0,q5fiey,1633896020,Went on a second date need advice,So I went on a second date with the girl I met on hinge. It went well we went to a local bar. Conversation flowed but had a few choppy moments but we both picked it up immediately after. She was briefly checking her phone on a occasion. But she did give me her attention and eye contact. When I mentioned going to another bar she said yes. She would get close to me but then pull away however when I went in for a kiss she didn’t pull away. We kissed a few times but I made the moves. She texted me after saying to let her know when I got home. She also added back on snap immediately after I added her. However she texts like she isn’t interested but she shows signs that she is. My main question is how can I truly tell if a kiss went well and does text length and time mean anything really in my situation?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5fiey/went_on_a_second_date_need_advice/

2,q5fqdl,1633896709,I'm afraid not being ready for sex/not wanting hookups will be a deal breaker,"I know this is a dumb concern and any guy who won't respect my wishes on this isn't worth my time, but it's still giving me anxiety. 

Basically I've (27F) only ever had sex with one person who I was in a 9 year long relationship with. Needless to say, I am no longer in that relationship and trying my hand at dating. I've never dated as an adult, but all I ever hear about are hookups and sleeping on like the second date and shit. I don't want that. Sex is special to me, and while I don't take THAT long to ""warm up to the idea of it/get that special connection"" (was with my ex for about 1.5 months before I lost my virginity to him), I still don't want to rush into things/I want to take things at my pace. I also have anxiety about it because I'm afraid of having a ""wham bam thank you ma'am"" moment and getting ghosted as soon as it's done. Basically, I think I don't want to have sex with someone I'm not officially in a relationship with. 

How do I communicate this without scaring off potential partners? I also don't want to be ""tricked"" into thinking I'm in a relationship or something only for them to pump and dump. 

I get that I'm probably over thinking things, but I'm honestly really afraid of this and it's affecting me in a really negative way. I was in a position where I never thought it would be an issue and now suddenly I'm having to figure this all out waaayyy later than a lot of other people. I don't even know if this is a healthy attitude about sex or not or if I have some sort of weird hang up or what. Societal standards have me feeling ill. 

Just for a little extra information, I'm about to go on my third date with a guy and things are going really well, but he's also been a little extra flirty lately. I do love the attention and his flirting gives me butterflies, but we haven't even kissed yet and the thought of rushing into sex when we haven't even kissed/made anything official makes me uncomfortable. I've told him I don't know what pace I want to move at and he seems to be respectful of that, especially since he even asked before giving me a hug (also said something about how he's fine with just going with whatever happens, happens), but I'm still afraid he will lose interest.

3,q5fupc,1633897094,Where do I go wrong?,"Bit of a nagging titel, but it's not meant that way. Also sort of a longish rant/post.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've noticed I have no clue how to make my intentions clear to girls I talk to. I either come off too strong or hide my intentions and they get scooped up by someone else. It might be good to know that I have asperger and aren't the best at reading people. I've never had a problem making friends. I have several friends, including girls, but as soon as I want to pursue a romantic relationship with someone they either reject me (usually with a ""let's be friends"") or I'm too vague and they meet someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of lost at the moment as someone I was talking to for a bit just told me she went on a date. I exercise twice a week, I'm pretty tall (2m or 6,5 feet) and not that bad looking I feel. I know girls aren't quick to ask you out, and no one owes me anything, but I haven't really been on an actual date and I do feel a bit frustrated. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to improve myself in this aspect? I'm kind of at a loss and  can't see the forest for the trees.

4,q5fx3i,1633897313,Women are rude as hell to me about genetics,"One of the reasons a lot of women don't like short guys is because they think that having short kids, I gues even especially a short son, is some kind of disease. I don't really understand how you can magically predict the height of a child's life before them even being born. I usually hear this way more from short and average women.  Tall women aren't as bad in this case cause they know their genes are good enough to have a chance at taller kids. 

As far as I'm concerned I don't care about the height of my future children and don't care if I have a son or sons shorter than me. A lot of women seem to care more about breeding with a short man. If you are one of these women then probably abort your son if you have one or don't be surprised if he ends up shutting you out of his life for POS mother that you will be or are.


 There was a case in which I saw on reddit in which a kid committed suicide cause his assholeish mother that was like 5'0 pretty much made fun of him for being short and made him feel like shit. She married a 6'6 man who she thought would magically pop a tall kid out of her vagina.

Its countless amounts of getting the balls to make the approach and try with women even countless rejection after rejection. 

I have to lead the conversations, plan the dates, put all that effort in even after getting lead on 100000x.

I have to play guessing games all day whether this girl is shy, uninterested, does she need more comfort so I should talk to her more or more space so leave her alone. I have to somehow read between the lines and observe tiny ass hints which may or may not even be hints. 

This shit is giving me so much stress and anxiety. I’m literally here thinking all day whether I should just fuck off and not text her anymore at all and let her come to me. Whether I should continue doing what I’m doing because she is interested just doesn’t want to show it too much. Is she playing hard to get. Is she just truly not interested. Etc etc.

I don’t know how common it is for people to do a background check on someone before a date, but I know nothing about these guys and am meeting them from online dating so I think it’s smart. Do you think most people are okay with this or at least should be ok? I basically just want to ask the guy for his first and last name, preferably him just sending a copy of his id with address blocked out that way he can’t lie about his name , and do a google search of his name. 

I have gotten some resistance when asking for this, and I don’t know if it’s because guys think it’s weird or abnormal, they don’t know what it’s like to date as a woman, or if they had something to hide. One guy I went on a date with I asked for his full name after our first date, and he said ok then I found out he had a criminal record of breaking and entering and assault and battery. It was pretty recent. Then another guy I asked for his full name before our date and he just ignored the question, then said I will tell you more about me on our first date, and said it was weird to ask for his full name or a copy of his id before we met. I told him to please send me a copy of the id via text, and that it was fine to block out any info about his address. When he refused I thought it was strange so I googled his first name and the town he lived in and a recent criminal record came up where he was involved in a drug bust upon which some pretty heavy duty semi automatic weapons were seized, pounds of marijuana, and heroin was seized. One guy I asked for a copy of his id before we went out and he sent it but then sent me a text saying “I’m sorry I can’t do this”. I’m not sure if he had anxiety about the date or if he thought it was too much for me to ask him for his Id. I can see how some guys think that it seems like their on a job interview for that part, but I would think that any guy with a brain would understand the need for it ? I am experiencing some resistance but it seems like it we because they had something to hide, not because they thought  it was too much for me to ask before a first date .

10,q5g6x8,1633898165,I asked a guy out and he agreed…Then ran away from me!?,"Guys I’m so confused!

I really like a guy that lives a couple of doors down, I first met him around 7 months ago and first noticed his dog, I was an overweight drunken mess at the time and just come out of a 10 year toxic relationship.

I moved into a new place and was sitting on the front step and out of nowhere this stunning dog came over to me and I started stroking him, then his owner came up and I told him that I wanted to keep his dog, I think he got freaked out and got funny then walked off.

I kept seeing this dog and didn’t even notice his owner.
One day after a week long bender on drink and drugs I made the decision to stop drinking and in my mind created a dream in my head that one day I was going to get my own place and adopt a dog, an old dog like him and I would spoil him rotten in his last years..

I promise I’m not crazy or obsessed but that boy touched my heart and stayed in my mind.
Over the months I got better and better and ended up dropping from a size 18 to a size 14 and got my looks back, I found my style and discovered my Art.
I am now a different person.
I love myself for the first time in my 39 years of life.

My ex came back and I ended up dumping him after a traumatic event, I got a court order and made sure he will never come back to me again..
Unless he wants to serve some time. 
I grieved and wrote and wrote and wrote..
I kept thinking about my dog and the thought kept me strong and sober.
I didn’t go out for weeks and weeks until court was finished and I had the order..
When I was granted the order and felt safer, I started sitting out on the front step again..
That’s when I noticed him, he was tall dark and had the most Seraphic eyes, he was gorgeous!
I’d never noticed him before and I got crazy butterflies, he was very shy but we got to a stage where he would greet me and then hurry off with his boy.

The other day his dog came straight up to me and I stroked him, the guy looked touched and said aaaah.. Then he rushed off, I decided that I had to ask him out.

Yesterday I was sitting on my front step again after an afternoon nap and he walked by and this time I said “excuse me but would you like to go for a drink one day(non Alcoholic for me though, I hate Alcohol now), he looked stunned and said yes he would but that he had to go as he was late to meet his Brother..
Then ran away!?

I’ve been outside today but he must be still running because I’ve not seen him.
I feel like such an idiot and must have looked so desperate!

I think I might move because I don’t feel like I can face him again.
I used all the courage I could find to ask him and he ran away! 
Wtf is wrong with me?!

What do I do please because I don’t want my heart broken again and this has knocked me for six.

Should I just get 100 cats and become a hermit?

12,q5gcnl,1633898665,Am I toxic to my ex,"I made a post before this but wanted to add more so I deleted the last post. 

This will be a longer post but I need advice 

Basically my ex and I were together for 7 months and she was my first love so that might be important idk but I really thought I was gonna marry this girl which might sound crazy cause we were only together for 7 months but I was absolutely head over heels for this girl.

So my ex and I had a decent relationship for the most part but constant arguments about small little things were such a problem. Before I say the rest tho I should say by no means was I perfect, I did mess up and I did try my hardest to fix my mess ups.

Some of the situations were like I told her I wouldn't be happy if she posted a bikini pic on Instagram just because my moral beliefs just don't agree with them and she thought it was controlling and toxic to not be happy if she posted one. She would also say stuff about being sad because she sees other dudes post pics of there girlfriend in a bikini and let me know she's sad cause she knows id never do that, I always felt so bad but looking back it seems kinda wrong she compared me to other boyfriends she would see on TikTok and stuff. I feel like if we could've just talked it out and been mature we couldve respected each other's opinions and continued on instead of her just calling me toxic which shut down conversations about it.

We also had broken up one time and 3 days later she was considering getting back together with me. I told her who I was with the day before which was 2 of my guy friends and one of there girlfriends and the others friend that's a girl, I'm in no way freinds with either of them and my ex knew that. She was so secretive about not telling me who she was with because ""it seems to normal and things aren't back to normal"" so I told her if we were getting back together id need to know who she was with cause if she was inviting dudes out 2 days after breaking up then the next day tried to get back with me then I wouldn't be cool with that cause I wouldn't want to get played. She then said it was the most toxic thing I ever said and we were never getting back together. I asked why it was toxic and she said ""you should know"" and then she blocked me. Fast-forward a couple days and we talked about it and she said it was toxic of me cause I was hanging out with 2 girls the day before but I told her context was important on who the girls were cause she knows I wasn't friends with them at all and they were there because of my dude friends. If she would've mentioned this concern instead of calling me toxic and shutting down a conversation I feel like we could've figured it out pretty easily. 

One time I saw her Snapchatting this one dude she hadn't talked to before and wasn't freinds with. I knew he wasn't a great person and has done bad stuff so I said ""I wouldn't snap him"" and said I didn't really like her snapping him, she then said ""good thing it's my snap and not yours"", I wouldn't have told her not to if they were friends or anything but I knew they weren't which is why I said it. I feel like this was an unnecessary situation cause my friend who has a good healthy nice relationship once said this to his girlfriend and she said ""sure babe, I won't snap him anymore"". 

After breaking up I asked Tons of people if I was toxic and they all said no. I then talking to my ex about it and found out one of the stories I told about her was a miscommunication, I remember her saying it's not wrong for her to snap dudes selfies where her top is out in a bikini, she remembered her saying it's not wrong if she shows her straps of her top. She said obviously it's wrong if she sent dudes snaps with her top all on the picture, and I agree with her that it's not wrong at all of her to send dudes snaps with her straps of her top in it, it was pure miscommunication. We then stopped talking again and today we started talking and I wanted to talk to her about our relationship and all the things she called toxic, alot of people thought weren't toxic and she would just say ""obviously people don't think you are, you lied in your story"". Obviously I remembered a situation wrong and I told everyone I remembered it wrong and apologized but she just kept saying I lied in my stories, and wouldn't talk to me again.

I just need opinions on this; am I toxic? Was the communication in our relationship poor? We're we just not meant to be and just had different opinions on relationships?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5gcnl/am_i_toxic_to_my_ex/
13,q5gcpf,1633898670,I’m continually dating women who say they’re ready for relationships but aren’t.,"Firstly, I’m a 36M, divorced, no kids, good job, have my own house, I live in a very populated area with a diverse dating pool. I try and date well educated or successful and attractive women that are in their 30’s. I’m picky but I’m not unrealistic, I do well with dating apps and I’m not negative or dissatisfied with online dating in general(OLD).

Over the past 6 months I’ve been on several dates and started exclusively dating 3 women, obviously not at the same time. I’ve always been clear and concise that I’m looking for a serious relationship and that I’m interested in marriage and a family but not to rush into it. My approach has always been to vibe with people and make it feel natural but still be a gentleman and romantic.

3 times now, I’ve met incredible women, attractive, successful, great communication, we’ve seemed to hit it off, multiple dates, good sex etc… but, all of these women have ended it. One said, she needed to focus on herself, another said: she wasn’t ready. The last said, she was too busy with her career and asked if I wanted to be FWB. She was shocked when I told her I wasn’t interested.

My theory is that people always think they’re ready for relationships until it’s there in front of them. When it’s time to commit to something real, people back out, be it because of fear, convince or just disinterest. I don’t know that there’s a way to filter people because I genuinely think that, they think they want a serious relationship, they just don’t know what it takes?

These experiences have made me second guess myself, makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me or my approach, it’s made me more reserved and made me less interested in committing.

I am still out there dating, swiping and trying, I chuckle a little when I see posts from women saying “all guys want is sex” because I wonder if when a relationship is open to them if they’d take it or if they’d back out at the moment of truth like the 3 previous women I’ve dated.

Has anyone else men or women had this experience? I’m curious what your thoughts are? How could I change my approach?

14,q5gdrg,1633898762,Girl asked for money after second date. The fuck?,"So, I met this girl alone a few weeks back. We went on a date last week, and it was fantastic. Immediately hit it off. It was great. Went on a second date yesterday. 

Started off at a craft beer place, then moved on to a jazz bar. Typical millennial bullshit. The jazz bar was super expensive, at about 220 USD. I was intending to pay for it all, but only had 150 on me, so I asked her to put in a bit. She put in 100, me 120, and I gave her my remaining 30. 

I get home to a missed call and messages asking for her 100 back. I'm honestly gobsmacked. I've never experienced this before. Just, the audacity. Am I the asshole, or am I right to feel this way?

I footed the entire first date, the craft beer place yesterday, and the bulk of the jazz bar yesterday. All in all I've spent over 300 on her, which I was happy to do as I enjoyed her company. 

Just, what do I even do in this situation? If she'd have prefaced it by saying I wasn't expecting to spend so much last night and it's going to be rough for me to get to the end of the month, it wouldn't be so bad. Also wouldn't be so bad if she'd taken the 30 I gave back to her into account, and maybe put in a little herself and called it 50. I'm just completely flabbergasted by this.

I don't even know where to begin to explain how or why this is the case or what I am doing necessarily wrong.

(Sorry ahead of time if it seems like I'm flexing but its to better explain my confusion with my failure)

When I was roughly 19 years old I took my lack of a love life as a big wake up call to improve myself. The first thing I focused on was making something out of myself. The idea is that if girls are not noticing/interested in me, then I have to become worthy of their attention, so I started studying to become and currently am a Medical/Laboratory Engineer. During these 5 years I worked on different things such as my hygiene, my wardrobe, fitness etc.. Things I had been greatly lacking during my teenage years. Hardest part was learning to socialize properly with people, even with strangers on the go. I am good friends with people from all walks off life and even some YouTube ""celebrities"" keep me in high regard as a valued friend. My dog was also a big help socializing with girls, and he helped me land the second date of my life (Mans best friend indeed).

Pics and gif of me, 1 pic of doge [https://imgur.com/a/PfOGRZf](https://imgur.com/a/PfOGRZf)

This summer, I was hoping that I would finally be good enough to peak the interest of girls. I asked girls for their numbers, snapchats or just if they want to meet up sometime and nothing ever led to a date. I don't think I have high standards either, the only physical standard I have is chubby girls (more than 30-35% fat ratio. Even with a gun to my head I wouldn't be able to be attracted) Other than that, I dont care about physical appearance.

I'm out of ideas now on how I can improve on myself or what I am doing wrong. I'm hoping any feedback here can give me new ideas or things on what more I can do. Harsh criticism/truth is very much welcome of what I may be doing wrong. Though I like to mention that dating apps are not an option. I've let both my male and female friends change it to their liking multiple times and nothing other than pictures of abs ever gave any results in terms of more matches on my profile.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5ghy2/hot_successful_social_and_never_been_on_more_than/

I recently figured I’d try my hand at dating again and downloaded one of the dating apps. It’s been over a year since I’ve been out with someone due to COVID, school, and recently moving.

After a few weeks with zero luck, someone messages me wanting to grab a drink. Fast forward to the “date” and all I can think about is how frazzled I am from studying all week, feeling guilty for not studying for an upcoming quiz, and volunteering the next morning. The other person was super nice and tried to make conversation, but for some reason I was too out of it to match the energy (I usually consider myself to be pretty personable). I’m also realizing how much school has become part of my identity and how boring that must be to someone who is not in the program/process.

After a while I could tell they were disinterested when they kept looking at their phone, took a phone call, and making faces at people they knew sitting across the bar. I ended up giving up saying that I wouldn’t be offended if they sat with their friends or wanted to head out. By the end I was exhausted and needed time to myself to recharge. I also realized I want to go on a date for at least another year.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5gwdq/first_date_in_over_a_year_not_so_great/

Now he forgave me for saying no, about 23-27 minutes after he ate dinner he wanted me to have sex I agreed to a blow job but then he wanted more, I disagree because I was tired after having a long day but then he forced himself on to me and choked me until I passed out. He is now trying to say we had some casual sex and I passed out for no reason, there are bruises and marks on my neck. 

I don't think what he did was rape, he just wanted sex and I am his girlfriend so he did what he wanted. So I don't think he raped me.

There is this girl in one of my friend group that I'm kind of interested in. Our friend group was hanging out today, and she chose to ride with me, I didn't ask her to. She said it is because I'm single and she didn't want to ride with dudes who already has girlfriend because she didn't want any misunderstanding (the girlfriends are jelly types)…even though her sister was also driving with her boyfriend so I don't know why she didn't  ride with them.

During the car ride with me she asked me if it's true I only ask girl out if I know for sure the girl is into me. I said yes to which she replied girls/herself want the guy to make the move first. She then pushed me to try asking girls out first and take the risk. I half jokingly said ""ok if you want me to make a move, can I ask you then?"" She paused for a minute and said ""...I mean trying on other girls lol"". This killed my mood but whelp whatever she is not interested. 

Throughout the day she hangs close to me, but maybe because everyone else are already in couple. I try to convince my group to spend the night at my house to watch football game and drink, she was also into it while everyone doesn't because they live far away (including her)...but she doesn't like football.

I don't know if I should try asking her out seriously again. She is quite chatty and we also have a lot of mutual friends so it'd embarrassing if she turned me down. Also she supposedly broke up with her long distance boyfriend very recently but I don't know how serious it actually is. We are hangout in the same group of friends but we're not close at all, we don't text or anything.

Even if it was an unusual relationship and in the eyes of some not a real relationship, it was my first one, i'm 21.

In 21 years only 1 girl asked me out (I said no cause she was extremely annoying) and with my ex we kinda confessed our feelings at the same time.
I've asked a few girls out, got rejected ofc but didn't really know what I was doing.
My social life isn't the best at the moment I have to be honest, but even when I try to really socialize it seems like no one is interested.
I've received a wide variety of compliment from many people, men and women.
I above average looking, I know how to dress, I have a nice voice, know how to hold a conversation with anyone, I have many interests, been told I was charming, i'm fit (I workout 5 to 6 times a week), I have nice hands...
The only things that can be a bit of a turnoff with me are my height (5'7/170cm) and I kinda have a babyface (I'd say I look more 18 than 21).

I also should add that i'm not looking for hookups or anything, only a commited relationship, hookups/one night stands and such things make me feel really numb. I tried some dating apps but that's really not my thing, i'm also probably shadowbanned on Tinder or something because I deactivated my account too many times.
I don't know what I can do honestly, I know I'm still young and some people might have it 10 times worse than me but so many of my friends are in relationships and I just feel like there's something wrong with me at this point.

I DONT KNOW HOW TO CALL IT. We go on dates, eat meals together, go on bike rides, watch movies/tv shows, and make out a lot lol. TMI: He gave oral a few times, but he's never wanted it back, in fact he kept his pants on every time we were in his bed after I mentioned I had a few bad experiences, and that I don't sleep with people unless I really trust them. So he really just focuses on me everytime.

A few days ago, for the first time he held my hand when we were walking on the streets, put his arm around my shoulder and held me close when we were standing outside. We text everyday, sending memes and both of us don't care about sending a lot of texts. 

We meet at least twice a week, sometimes 3-- depending on our schedule. I would like to see him more, but he doesn't try to ask to see me more, so I haven't told him that yet. 

I don't know where to go from here. I just don't want to get hurt. I have the onset of catching feels, and on one hand, I feel like maybe I should just tell him I've started to like him, and if he rejects me, to just stop the feelings when it's still very early and move on. Or to just ""go with the flow"" since a lot of people date casually for a few months before making it exclusive. I'm sure a lot of you have been in similar spots before.

44,q5iqw7,1633906452,i’m seriously about to give up on trying with relationships,"
i 18F have had SUCH a hard time finding a relationship. i know what your probably thinking, “you’re only 18, there are plenty of fish in the sea.” but i’m just getting so tired of it.

i’ve never been in a relationship, or even had anyone actually like me. no one has ever said it or even mentioned a date unless it was for sex. it’s really starting to break my heart. i’m getting tired of building myself up again and again.

i’m not sure where the deep rooted insecurities come from. i definitely don’t have the best relationship with my parents but that should pose a problem in romantic relationships right? after so many years of doubting myself, i can proudly say that i love me. i hype myself up every day in the mirror and actually believe it now. i think i’m pretty. i’m also very charismatic. i can make anyone laugh. i’m in college now and plan to be a veterinarian. so far, i’ve been incredibly successful in my school and previous jobs. now i help doctors at a nearby animal hospital and i’m learning so much. every time i get ghosted or what not, i pick up another shift and focus on helping the animals. i also found my passion at a very young age. lots of my 18 year old friends have no idea what they want to do meanwhile i have a long resume of animal care. im extremely great full  to have already found my passion- and i’m very serious about it. do y’all think that scares people away? 

i’m afraid one thing that has constantly posed a problem is that no one looks further past my body. i’m lucky enough to fit the basic Pac-Sun beauty standard and have a little more booty than most. that’s all anyone sees. i’ve talked to guys from the club, tinder, high school, in my regular college classes, and from my vet classes and it’s all the same thing. they get to know me for a little, then ghosted again. it’s really starting to get to me. 

what hurts the most is no one views me as a number 1. every single time there was someone better. i don’t like sneaky links. i just don’t want to have sex with someone who doesn’t care ab me. it’s not my thing. however these same guys don’t have the decency to snap me before 10pm but they bend over backwards for other girls. i’m honestly very jealous of those girls. 

i’ve wondered if there something incredibly wrong with me. like statistically shouldn’t someone like me? i feel like i’ve looked everywhere. i keep getting ghosted. it’s been about a year since i even tried to put myself out there. since i’ve changed a little i thought i’d give it a shot. however it’s the exact same thing. getting ghosted. honestly i’ve probably tried with 10 different guys this year and not one has been actually interested in me. i respond in a pretty timely manner, i stick to plans, i engage in conversation and i send full face snaps. i don’t know how to keep anyone interested in me. i’m talkative, the convos are never boring. i’m just seriously at my wits end here. 

this time of year gets me especially sad. halloween is my favorite holiday and all i’ve ever wanted was to enjoy it with someone.

Not that I have any issue with sexual questions, but I find that if you go into the game with these in mind you’ll come off super creepy.

I think the best games are a mix of serious thought-provoking questions and silly dumb questions. You want the game to be a fun time and an opportunity to really reveal yourself to the other person, but you don’t want it to be like 10 straight questions along the lines of “what is the worst day of your life?”, “what’s your biggest accomplishment?” or “who is your role model?”. It’s a game not a job interview.

I find the hardest part is coming up with the questions. A lot of people will end up resorting to corny questions that always get asked like “If you could have dinner with anyone, who would you pick?”

I forgot about dating or trying to have sex because I had to assume the roll of adult bc sister and dad were always drunk, combat my grief and my preixisting mental health issues, planning the whole funeral myself, people kissing my ass that I don't know, managing finances, signing papers until my hand was sore, suing the hospital for wrongful death, getting sued by estranged family for my moms portion of her inheritance, being paranoid that I would get arrested for the time I paid a stripper to bang me while high on some drug, and sleepwalking, so finding love was not my concern. 

I really want someone to love, but the issue is that too cynical since I can retire today and have enough money to live until I'm 300.

\-At your darkest rockbottom day where suicide isn't a bad idea, DON'T DO IT. YOU WILL GET BETTER. 

\-Buy a casket on Amazon, its multiple times cheaper for literally the same exact casket. 

\-Don't let other people disrupt your inner peace

\-Your parents will never be angry for what you did when you were at war with yourself

\-Don't drink alcohol, do drugs, or have sex with strippers to numb pain.

I met 1 through a dating app and just assumed it was my bad for not reading him properly. I was upset for a while but got back out there. The other 3 were actually through friends or work. I assumed because we had mutual friends, they were ""safe"" to a certain extent. I was wrong. All 4 experiences were traumatic. We meet up, we speak for a while and share a few laughs. Normal date stuff. Then things escalate super quickly and I'm not feeling it. I say I'm not comfortable with what theyre doing and they keep trying throughout the date until i ultimately decide to leave.

 Thing is, im not a flirty person really unless i am comfortable with someone. Theres no way im giving them any kind of signal to pull this shit as i am often nervous as fuck going to the date at all.

The one that was the most upsetting was a guy that i actually set boundaries with before meeting up with. I explained to him that i am celibate now and looking for something long term. He agreed and said he respected that. Then that date went the worst out of them all. Tried to force himself on me and grab me mid conversation. It ended with me yelling at him and leaving. Weird thing is he texts me later that night and asked for a second date. I feel like Im fucking losing my mind, lol.

I feel heartbroken honestly. I get really excited that we're hitting it off and love the energy. I want things to work out, i want to love these men. Then its spoiled and it hurts. I feel unsafe.  I have so much love to give and i want to share my life with someone. 

Is there some kind of vibe I'm giving off now that attracts  these types of men? Is it something I'm doing? Not saying anybody deserves this btw. Im just noticing a bit of a pattern and I'm genuinely curious. I even texted one of the guys and asked what the fuck was going through his mind to think that what he did was okay and he told me it was because I'm sO bEaUtiFul...are you fucking kidding me? 

Nobody here knows me, i am just an anonymous gal on reddit and i understand that you guys cant even really answer this fully.

58,q5jie0,1633909149,Am I overreacting?,"This might be long. Sorry. 
Background: My Fiancé (M) and I (F) have been in an LDR for over 3 years now &amp; got engaged last year. We plan for me to move halfway across the world to his country next May/June (2022) ish to get married, if everything goes according to plan. 

Recently we got into a major argument because I found out he was planning to go on a trip to an amusement park around the same time I would be moving there, AND he decided to exclude me from it. His reasoning being that I don’t really like the crazy/dangerous looking rides (especially rollercoasters or anything else that goes upside down etc) and that I wouldn’t enjoy it, and I would also ruin the experience for him since I would be screaming the entire ride etc.. 

I love amusement parks, like Disney or universal studios, I just am not a fan of the big crazy rides. I have however gone on them before just because my family or friends wanted to. So it’s not like I completely hate amusement parks or would avoid them. I love the regular rides and the rest of the amusement park experience. Plus, for me the most important thing would have been to enjoy spending time with him regardless of where we were or what we were doing. 

While this might seem trivial, I’m very upset because of the following reasons 
- he excluded me from the entire decision making process as a whole and decided to exclude me and made a choice for me. 
- I’m moving halfway across the world to be with him while he wants to go on an amusement park trip and leave me behind around that same time. I thought we’d be doing things together to make up for all the lost time in a LDR
- he barely gets actively involved in any of the planning, like the move/the wedding/our future plans etc.. but he’s making the effort to plan some random trip to an amusement park. I feel like he doesn’t have his priorities straight as he should be helping me plan our future, and the amusement park plans can wait. 
- moving to another country plus the visa fees, flight tickets etc are going to be very expensive and I have been doing my best to save up for these. He has been claiming to be broke as he met with some unexpected financial trouble recently so I think a trip to an amusement park is the last thing he should be planning right now. 

He says im overreacting and that I should grow up, that it’s a trivial issue and he’s been wanting to go there for a while. And he says he doesn’t want to take me. So now I’m wondering if I should even give up my job and life here just to move to be with him when he won’t even make the effort to include me in things he plans to do when I’m there.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5jie0/am_i_overreacting/

    *Preface* So I’ve been working at a store and I would usually stop by a sandwich shop for my lunch. I met a girl there who I thought was pretty and my type so I did some flirting but I didn’t feel like things hit off. I decided to just have fun and talk with her regardless. I always make her laugh really hard and she acts more of her “true” self around me ( she doesn’t use the fake customer service attitude etc.) and often doesn’t charge me for anything/everything I buy. I would probably consider her my friend, We have each others number but We don’t text just talk/ flirt in person about once or twice a week. I never really thought she would or did like me.

Her: Ditzy, pretty, very kind, intelligent( compared to me.) probably a objective 7-8/10. She gets ALOT of male attention, many guys hitting on her complimenting her etc. 

Reasons why I could see she likes me:

She has brought her mom to my work (Deli)
she was doing some shopping with her and she was all dolled up and kept asking how she looked. I did the usual class clown and made them both laugh and entertained. Her mom and her left and I heard her mother say faintly “I like him” 

Constantly gives me free stuff and tells me to come visit her at work. 

Her boss ( I’m chummy with him also, older gent real nice guy) always gives me her days on and tells me to visit her. (Weird but dunno)

Three months into our work friendship and we are talking about her upcoming outfit for her dance ( no outsiders allowed to it) . She claims its “super hot” and she is excited she gets to dress up. Usually when I meet her she is in her work outfit. She says I  should come see it, ( we have never met outside of work) but I had work so she said “I’ll come to you then you work sat?” 

*The event* I was just cleaning the deli with my boss and then I see out of my eye her and two friends, all three dressed very pretty. Her friends were prob “prettier” but her dress was the best. They come up to me and we all chat for a bit ( I was kinda breathless so I probably seemed like a idiot to them, I regret acting so bashful) but regardless, my boss comes over and she says “ are you sure she doesn’t have a crush on you? Who the hell drives out of their way to show some guy she knows her fancy dress.” I said “I don’t know” and then my boss calls me clueless. Took a poll with my friends and they all said she does also

Sorry for bad formatting and long winded my first reddit post tbh. I just want a outsiders POV feel free to ask any questions if you need more info.

TLDR: talk to girl for three month, super friendly with her, she gives me free crap and wants me to visit her, she came to my work out of her way to show me her outfit for a dance.

68,q5k3v4,1633911331,How can I make myself stand out?,"I'm a 19 year old bi woman and I often struggle to make genuine connections with people around me. I'm pretty average looking and super shy, and in group conversations I don't usually contribute much, and rather listen to what's being said. I often fade into the background and go unnoticed, which in the past was preferable due to having loads of social anxiety. Now that I'm older, I'm having a really hard time with dating and relationships. 

In the past, I've been in two relationships. Both were online and pretty toxic in their own ways. I've had my fair share of short flings, but once again everything has happened online. My online persona is much more confident and charming in comparison to how I act in person. I don't have the same nervousness that I do when interacting with people in real life.

I'm seeking advice because I want to know how I can make myself stand out more. I haven't had my first kiss yet, and I feel left out because many of my friends are in super happy and loving relationships. I'm fine with online/long distance relationships, but the most important thing is finding someone who can appreciate me for who I am. I'm a nerd who likes to watch anime and geek out over music and writing stories. I don't want to change myself and yet I want to increase my confidence despite this. 

I've never used a dating app and I'm not sure I feel comfortable with doing that. I wish there was an easier way to meet people without the fear of it all going wrong. What do you think I should do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5k3v4/how_can_i_make_myself_stand_out/

74,q5kfpi,1633912555,Is this what dating is like now? No loyalty? Smash and Dash? No respect for the other person? Did i just happen to walk into a bad situation since the other person is divorced?!,"So my friend introduced me to a recently divorced mom three months ago. The first month, the mom and I started exchanging texts, starting to exchange personal things with each other, eventually borderline sexting, seeing each other every now and then. She was so adamant about seeing me some days, showing care for me and such. We finally went on a date and when we got back to her place, we hooked up. A few days after I noticed she was slowly starting drift away. She would occasionally like my posts on FB and make a comment every now and then. When I would text her the next two months, i was most initiating things, she would keep it small talk and occasionally flirt with me, but when I tried to see her again, there was a reason. 

Finally I had a talk with her. I asked her why she had been so distant. She said that with her divorce and work, she wanted to focus on herself, not looking to get into dating or relationship, just want to have fun. So i just backed off a bit, I told her how I felt about her and we could just go slow and play things out, she didn't turn down the idea. So for the last several weeks, I gave her some space. 

Yesterday, at my friends get together, she shows up with a dude driving her and she gives him a couple kisses before she walked in. I caught it all and not going to lie, I was hurt/salty about it because IMO what I saw kind of felt like she just did me wrong because I didn't feel like she gave a indication that it was a one and done type of thing. So I just couldn't help but ignore her while she was around, we said a few words to each other and i just couldn't make eye contact with her. I know I probably could have handled the situation a little better, but I'm not of the smash and dash mindset, and she feels the same way in a sense. She had told me in the past that sex is more than just a fun act and we move on, like she wants to have that connection with someone before she does it. So shes leaving, she says to me ""do i get a hug?"" I said ""yea sure"", but I couldn't put much into it, and she was on her way. 

I told her today that after what happened yesterday and just seeing what's been happening of late, she just doesn't have those feelings for me clearly, and I even mentioned as a friend, I said I hope we can talk but honestly I don't expect that we will now and wish her best of luck. She never respond.

I am the loyal type, not a smash and dash. I feel used. Is this how dating is now? Like a Black Widow, ""have sex with your partner and basically cut their head off after your done?"" Did I just run into a situation where I was just the rebound guy and that she just needed me to get some until the next guy? I literally couldn't sleep last night thinking that I never changed being the person from one day to the next with her and she had a change of heart. I personally feel like damaged goods now, my one friend says don't take his personal, we weren't dating....and I get it, but if this how dating is, putting time and effort into it, getting personal, and then once the sex is done, your just another notch on the belt?

75,q5kgz9,1633912675,should I consider this a red flag?,"Good evening everyone. I (30F)  have met this guy (25M) around 4 months ago and we are getting to know each other. 
We live in the same city but he is originally from a city that's 3 hours away by driving.
He told me he was transfered here because of work and almost one year ago he broke up with his ex and she came back to the city they are from because there is where her parents are.
The thing is they have a 3 years old daughter, and the girls lives with her mother.
So this guy drives every weekend to this city and stays there for a day and a half with his daughter.
He's always talking about his daughter and he shows how much he loves her. He videochats with her every night and seems like a present father. He shows himself very sad about being away from his daughter and tells me the girl gets very sad when he leaves too. 
The thing is... His boss told him he gonna be transfered back to the city where his daughter lives. They didn't give him a choice, it was an order and he's currently there. But he is fighting back legally because he says he doesn't wants to live there, that they can't make him and that he wants to live in my city because he likes it better than his city.
My problem with this is I'm wondering if he really wants to be a present father like he says, because he is always telling me how much he misses his daughter and how much she wants to be with him, but when he gets the chance to come back to his city he doesn't wants to, and not for a legit reason.
I know you still have the right to do what you wanna do when you become a parent, but I'm starting to think his daughter is not his priority and this is making me respect him less.
Because now he is all the time with his daughter, but he is deciding to come back here and only see her for one day and a half every weekend. Also, he told me he is waiting to his daughter to turn 6 years old and decide to live with him. I also think this is so selfish, to make a little girl decide between her mother and father just because he have decided to live in a different city.

My last relationship didn't end well, and I've missed a lot of opportunities, but I still want to feel that way about someone again. Maybe this time it'll end well, maybe they won't hurt me, or maybe it won't be too late.

Still, I don't know how to find that ""someone"". Dating apps are out of the question for me, and I live in a very homophobic country so my dating pool irl is already so small (I am part of the LGBTQ community). Plus, my ex was my classmate, and we only dated because we were together almost everyday, so I doubt we would have been a thing if we didn't or we were in a long distance relationship.

And speaking of, I've had crushes on people who lived on different continents, but that didn't end well either. There is someone I had a mini-crush on as well, but they just told me today that they planned confessing to their irl crush. I didn't really care, to be honest, I'm actually glad there's someone close to them who can make them happy.

Sometimes, when I look back on all my negative experiences with dating and attempts-at-dating, I start thinking that maybe I am the problem. I'm simply not likeable enough, or I don't do enough for my person of interest to like me back. This thought is also part of what's keeping me find that ""someone"".

I somehow get really bad vibes from women that are conventionally attractive and go by what society deems is the most ""ideal"" type of women by society. Shorter, thin, and overall dainty. I feel as though chubbier and women that are bigger in size are just somehow sweeter. As a short guy myself I can relate both to fat women and tall women as we are all somehow less than ideal in this society and usually have people wanting others that are the opposite of us at times. I get bad vibes from other women and its like they don't really know what its like to not be the ""ideal"" or of the norm in this crap society. I would honestly be more interested in a bigger women (fat, tall or both) because somehow I just feel like theres a connection that we have in which we can appreciate each other more since others might not.

i do have to admit im a pretty boring person. but again thats why im on a dating app rather then looking in person !!! i have a little farm in my back yard so i dont leave the house much other then go to work. trying to find someone who is wanting to settle down and raise some animals both for milk , meat and egg production.  and growing a garden. im doing it all by myself right now , and im fine doing it myself, but wouldnt be horrible if i found someone interested in the same thing...   but all i seem to find online are people who want to party , or travel ... and i dont like any of that, because i have anxiety when it comes to crowds .... or people in general ...

&amp;#x200B;

when i do find someone interesting that might just work out, im the carrier of the conversation and then it dies off....

1. I was teaching English abroad and he almost trapped me in a country and job that I hated.

2. Cheated and left after a year. No explanation given. Took and never gave.

3. Cheated and dumped me on Valentine's Day. We worked at the same place and ignored me when I even said hello. Waste of time.

4. Cheated on me in a beach house with his friends Memorial Day weekend (I was there). Waste of time.

5. Was with for three years. Implied when we met he was looking for marriage. Somewhere along the line decided he liked what we had and never wanted marriage, just a committed serious relationship. Three years down the drain.

6. Used me and took advantage of my kindness. Took me out on my birthday and dumped me by lying about not wanting to come out because his parents would disown him. Was actually seeing someone else for two months before he dumped me. Waste of time.

I view failed relationships as a waste of time, because I don't think I actually learned anything from these folks. What I did learn is that I hate dating and think most people try to use relationships to fix their own messed up personal lifes. I don't think I actually learned anything from any of these though.

91,q5lmx9,1633917058,Remembering and addressing someone by their name goes a long way,"Online dating-  I received much more conversation engagement when I would add the person's name to my opening message. 

My theory is-

1. Makes the person feel like it's not a copy+paste message
2. There's some instinctual reaction to someone who says your name

In-person- Definitely made a date feel more comfortable on both sides, obviously don't keep saying their name like a weirdo, but saying it once or twice during the date after initial meet-up is good practice and etiquette.

Ex. ""So tell me X, how would friends describe you?""

1. It makes the date event more personable
2. Something about people acting nicer once they know you'll recognize them by name (even more if they forgot yours)

The little things help, you can imagine the opposite reaction someone would give if they realized you don't remember their name.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5lmx9/remembering_and_addressing_someone_by_their_name/
92,q5ln8s,1633917093,Having doubts dating as a women of color...,"I know, I hate to bring race into things but I’m unsure where else to post this that may actually help me? 

Now that I’m getting older (23F), dating is harder. My ex and I decided to officially separate and even though I’m still young, I’m finding it hard not to be insecure. Things were so much easier in high school which is the last time I had an open dating pool... I never thought of the things I do now. 

I am in college but my classes usually consist of white and Asian males (engineering major)... I think I’m overthinking because of the last Asian male I dated telling me that he was worried about bringing me to meet his parents as since I am mixed (black and white) female, he’ll probably get disowned. This has happened to me a few times before during my high school/early adult age. 

I want to start dating again but I can’t seem to shake this feeling of just being undesirable due to my race. I know part of this obsession is due to trauma from my childhood from being a darker mixed race female but I was never *nervous* about it with dating. I embraced the diversity but now that people are dating to marry and settle down to have children... I’m scared. And I don’t want children either. 

I guess I just want to be desirable? I’m really unsure. Any thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5ln8s/having_doubts_dating_as_a_women_of_color/
93,q5lqc2,1633917420,when will it be my turn," posting on a throwaway account.

I'm a 22M and I'm honestly frustrated with finding a partner. I've never had anyone interested in me enough to seriously pursue ANYTHING with.

It's not even that I haven't tried. I've shot my shot at girls that I was really interested in getting to know, and they've all never liked me back (which is not a problem, I just moved on. no hostility). And don't get me wrong, I've always been polite and respectful in ""shooting my shot"" too. I've tried instagram and in real life. All I say is ""hey I think you're cool, I'd love to get to know you more"". It never works out. I by no means feel entitled to any girl saying yes, but getting just one time to work out would be nice.

I just started a PhD program, I go to the gym, I play sports, I'm close w family. I even get told that I am good looking... by girls. I don't understand why things have never worked out. I just shot my shot again at a girl I actually really like and really wanted to get to know, and I got left on seen.

Does it ever just work out for people the first time they shoot their shot, or has anyone gone through this constant rejection?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5lqc2/when_will_it_be_my_turn/

Been dating a girl for 3 months. Basically BF/GF. Slept with each other multiple times. See each other twice a week basically. Met friends. Do something new everytime we see each other almost. 

I thought it was a lock for when I asked her to be my GF. I really didn’t want to as I thought a label might ruin things. I didn’t want to drag my feet any longer though so I asked. She said she wasn’t sure and needed time to think, but said she wanted to see me next week.

We never really texted before as we don’t like being on our phones and conversing all day. We prefer face to face time over texts. We only really text when we need something. We do Snapchat though but we have been sending basically 1 or 2 a day. Lost the best friends for 2 months logo thingy. 

So basically what I am asking is do I just keep this no contact going until she initiates something? Or do I ask to see her? I don’t want to be needy but also don’t want her to feel I’m

96,q5m08a,1633918413,Should I go for it or nah,"

So I'll start off by saying I'm not the best with women. I'm 21 and haven't been in a relationship since I was 19. I've changed a lot since then mainly my appearance (went from fat to pretty lean and muscular). I've noticed since then that I've attracted a lot more girls who are out of my league, but I never go for it. I once even had a really cute girl who I was eyeing approach me to say hi, but, like a dumbass, I walked away. I'm not the worst at social situations, I can usually hold a conversation and things like that, but I can struggle starting them. Mainly with girls I find attractive. I've always been pretty shy, but I'm constantly improving with small talk to the point where I'm pretty comfortable even when it's awkward. However, approaching a cute girl is still difficult for me because I overthink the hell out of it.

Anyway enough rambling I have a question and forgive me for this being super long I really want to detail this situation:

So there's this girl at my work who I think is really attractive and is definitely into me. I know this because she works with my mom and she tells my mom she thinks I'm cute (odd but whatever). I usually only see her at work maybe a handful of times because we're in different departments, but sometimes our paths cross. Once we said hi to each other but both got shy and walked away. Bunch of times we saw each other but just looked away.

I've been telling myself for awhile that I should just man up and talk to her, but then I think about things I've heard about her. 

One thing is she somewhat recently totalled her car because of drunk driving though I think she stopped drinking after that. Another is that she's friends with this one dude who works at the same place as us who's her sister's ex, and they've had sex. Not sure if it was like a one night stand kinda thing (I really don't care if a girl I'm into has had sex before or anything as long as it's nothing crazy). They're still close, but I know they'll never date.

I constantly think about that stuff whenever I think about going after her and don't know if it's because of low self esteem or that it's something that means I should just not even try.

So yeah my question is should I go for it or should I just wait for another girl? Also I would like some tips on how to approach either her or anyone else because I suck at these kinds of things.

This is something that's been really on my mind as of late and just wanted some advice. Also thanks to everyone who took the time to read all this I know it was a lot!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5m08a/should_i_go_for_it_or_nah/
