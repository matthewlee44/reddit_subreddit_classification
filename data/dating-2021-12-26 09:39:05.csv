0,roz9sj,1640533225,Is it wrongful to prefer dating a woman taller than me?,"I'm 5'10 male (more specifically CIS straight male) and I've always loved tall girls. Even when I was a kid where I was among the smallest in the class, I would pick the top few tallest girls as partners for school activities. I've definitely dated girls that were around 6 feet tall. When it comes to dating apps, I tend to swipe right on most girls 5'9 and up (of course I can tell if height is troll or not). I remembered pre-Covid I would jump into bars and whenever I'd see a tall girl, I'd almost hit her up instantly.

However, I do understand that I am limiting myself severely but at least I know what to pick. According to percentile calculator, only a measly 1.3% of women are 5'10 or above. Not to mention that I see half the profiles list them preferring a guy taller. It also doesn't help that some of them are really athletic or look like models which makes it feel like they're out of my league. But despite this ""uphill battle"" I enjoy the challenge and I've had a fair share of dates.

Now you might think I'm into this who fendom, snu-snu, giantess, amazon, role reversal, etc fetish sorta stuff but it's not the reason I like tall girls. Also, no I don't make tall jokes/phrases like basketball, volleyball, asking about height, etc. Isn't there a difference between a ""preference vs fetish""?

I never openly admitted I was into tall girls to ANYONE or profile not even to my best friends or family because then I'd get judged. I mean is it really wrong for men to have a height preference? Girls do it all the time. We sometimes see racial preferences too or body preferences.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roz9sj/is_it_wrongful_to_prefer_dating_a_woman_taller/

It was great at the start, she was really pro active in getting to know me, even asked me for my number and wanted to call me a lot.

We've been on only 2 dates due to work, she said I make her feel like herself when I'm with her.

At the start she was talking to 2 other dudes but after a month she's only talking to me. 

On the second date I asked if we should be exclusive (now I realise how soon that is) and she respectfully declined.

This is my first talking stage that I'm scared and serious with. So I don't know what to do? Sometimes I feel like I'm chasing too much and she's not giving me the vibe she likes me. :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rozctj/been_talking_with_a_girl_for_2_months_and_it/

3,rozf8m,1640533705,Have I been single too long?,"I’m a 35 yo guy and have basically never had a serious relationship. I’ve had plenty of FWB situations, plenty of hookups and a couple of times dating for a few months that then fizzled out.

It’s basically because I’ve been too focused on career, travelling with friends and a few family things. I’ve just never prioritised dating.

Most people I meet around my age have had previous relationships. It’s a question that comes up pretty early on first/second dates. And the guys I’ve met seem to find it a bit worrying that I don’t have that experience.

Most people have learnt lessons from their previous relationships…how to live together, how to integrate their lives, how to be selfless. I’m worried that at my age, most guys are looking to get serious and not have to cope with someone learning all that for the first time.

And I desperately want to settle down to something serious too. But I’m aware that it will be a steep learning curve for me. Will that put people off?

Guys, stop complaining that we have to do all the work in dating/initiating/etc.

It’s our job.

sorry if Becky from the club or Megan from hinge doesn’t immediately give you all the love in the world and makes you work.

You are the pursuer.

Now yes is it nice when a girl suggests the date first. Of course.

But most women are passive, so it’s up to you to put in more effort objectively 

Of course this shouldn’t be like pulling teeth. When a girl likes you she’ll do anything for you, beyond even what you’re homies will do for you. So it really boils down to compliance.

If she complies with what you ask she’s interested. If not, move on.
Sure maybe she’s shy, but most often she’s not.
This is why it’s important to date girls who really like you. There’s no negotiation. no convincing. She’l want to hang out and she’l put lots of effort in.
If she’s not efforting= she ain’t like you. Because women move mountains for men they have chosen as sexy and funny and want to know

He takes the phone and answered it… dick still in me! He works in IT and she had network issues. Get this- he tell her to turn it off and on… dick still in me. She already had, etc etc,  so he tells her to try something else and that he’ll be over shortly… dick still in me.

I tried, really did, initiated a few different positions to see if I could get it back but nope. Finally had to tell him the call made me lose my lady boner. He explained that she would have kept calling then come over (she lives nearby) and proceeded to tell me a story about when she had come into his apartment while he was having sex with someone in order to drop off LAUNDRY AND GROCERIES.

23,rp19nu,1640539178,I PLAYED WITH HER FEELINGS,"I'm 24 Male, I'm a personality development trainer.
4 weeks ago I started a community for college students who wanted to learn about personality development.
The first person to enroll was a 19 year old college girl, let's call her Sasha. And we had this crazy spark, but I was in a relationship so I never explored it. 
1 week after that, my gf of 10 months broke up with me because long distance didn't work for us.
Few days later Sasha drops a text asking me some question, which turned into a full blown conversation and we ended up flirting with each other. 
We decided to go out on a date, where I mentioned I was looking for just a casual relationship. She said she's fine with that. 
In the first date she told me how badly she has been treated by all her exes and dates. She felt used and unloved. And she mentioned how everything I do makes her feel special. Even though I was doing what every man would do, (like opening the door for her etc) she felt happy even when It's the most common thing. 
Later that night, we texted for hours at night. She told me she's falling for me, getting obsessed with me. I could have stopped it right there, but I loved the attention so I said I felt the same even when I didn't. But I also mentioned I can't commit to a relationship, it's fun as long as it is not serious. 
Well, obviously she agreed but I knew how she felt. I could have called it of right there and then. 
Next day she wanted to go get a regular check up, I was teaching nearby so I joined after my session. I took her to the hospital,spoke to her doctor about her health. She felt sooo damn special. I knew I shouldn't have done that, but I did because I missed doing it for me ex.
She kept falling and falling and I kept telling her it's casual but also fed her subtle hopes with it. 
Today after the community session we went for a walk in the park. She held my hands and I could feel her heart beat rising, she getting overwhelmed and constantly smiling. We almost kissed but that turned into an awkward hug. We decided to walk back home and she kept telling me how grateful she is and how much loved she felt. I knew that she's falling hard for me.
I just wanted some rebound sex man, I knew I fucked up.
After we came back home, I told her that I have no intention of dating her (because I'm still hung up on my ex) and that we should call it off because she's definitely falling for me. She broke down. She asked me to meet her tomorrow so that we can come to a decision.
I'm gonna meet her tomorrow and tell her what's it about.

24,rp19w9,1640539198,"5th date cancelled as she tested positive for covid, having flashbacks of last girl who rejected me with this","Hey, probably overthinking this and based off our dates/interactions I do believe she’s still interested, but I do have worries of “what if” after the last girl I dated cancelled due to covid and never saw her again

Some context:

- We’ve had four dates
- Each date she’s always asking when I’m next free
- She holds my hand, randomly kisses me, touches me, shows me all the signs, etc
- She’s been suggesting we spend the weekend at hers
- She messages me first every day without fail (unless I beat her to it) but she’s not much of a texter so we set up a call
- We talk a lot on phone and facetime too
- Although in the last half hour of our dates she is constantly checking the time so she doesn’t miss the train
- She was ill for 3rd date but still saw me despite myself suggesting to re-arrange (she was negative for covid).
- During the 4th date she added me on facebook and allowed me to tag her at the location we were at (I asked if this was okay first, she agreed and joked that her family will all ask about me)
- She also mentioned how much fun she’s had and loves how much effort I put into our dates. After leaving the location she pulled me to her and kissed me
- We facetimed on christmas eve and she seemed positive, every time the call disconnected she immediately called back
- When I messaged her merry christmas she replied “merry christmas 😘”

So yeah from the month I’ve been seeing her, I’ve been getting positive signs to suggest she does like me. When we facetimed on Christmas eve she did say she felt she was coming down with something, then today on boxing day she sent this:

Her (9:30am) - “Hey I've done a lateral flow and I have covid. So I'm not going to be able to come out for several days. I'm just awaiting on my pcr results. But I think I deffo have covid, as I have all the symptoms and feel unwell. It might be worth you doing a lateral flow, as I was around you on Wednesday xx”

Her (12pm) - PCRs positive as well xx

Me - Hey that's a shame but can't be helped, hope you feel better soon. I'll have to get a test done too. Obviously you've got to isolate for 10 days etc so let me know when you're free at that point. Can do facetime tomorrow if you're feeling up for it xx”

Her - “Awh thanks 😊. I'll let you know if I'm up for it tomorrow xx”

I believe her but I also like to overthink. The last girl I was dating cut things off with covid and I never saw her again, so I’m getting flashbacks this might happen again. Only difference is this girls explanation is very detailed compared to the last one, but she doesn’t offer an alternative date.

Anyway, plan is to see if facetime goes ahead tomorrow but if she’s not feeling well that’s fine. Seeing as she texts me first nearly every day, if she keeps that up this week then I’ll not worry

35,rp25nh,1640541690,How do I [18M] approach my friend's classmate [18F],"Hi there,

I am an 18 year old guy, who has found himself attracted to a friend's classmate (an 18 year old girl) that goes to a different (catholic) high school. He does not talk to her very often (infact not at all) and doesn't know her that well. I saw her on his class' picture and I haven't been able to stop thinking about her ever since. 

My game plan right now is to approach her in real life before hitting her up on Instagram, so as not to seem like a total creep. How do I accomplish that without infringing on her privacy too much or should I just text her directly, however I have bad past experience doing that since she has never heard of me at all. 

I asked my friend and he's told me that she does in fact use Snap Map, which does show her location somewhat accurately at all times. This could be a way of tracing in her in public and making a street pickup but as of right now I'm not really inclined to doing this as it does seem rather creepy and stalker-like. 

My friend doesn't really know where she usually hangs out or anything all we know is that she does live in the school dorm during the week. He doesn't feel comfortable setting me up though as he hardly knows her and talks to her only a few times per year.

The girl is not really shy but is more on the quiet side she looks alright but isn't very popular and is quite desperate which is in truth exactly what I'm looking for. 

How do I approach her with my friend only providing intel and not being able to help me otherwise. 

Thank you very much for taking the time assisting my desperate soul.

TLDR;  I want to get to know a girl in real life but don't know how, also my friend is useless as he doesn't know her and therefore doesn't want to help me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rp25nh/how_do_i_18m_approach_my_friends_classmate_18f/

39,rp2dbj,1640542287,"My friends tell me I'm ""on the hook"". When I put myself out there I get rejected. Then when I try to break contact I get pulled back in. How to move forward?","A couple of weeks ago I felt really rejected and confused about my situation to mixed advice. The one I followed was to start journaling to really piece together what was going on and how I felt. I'll also add that I just started dating again this year after a 15 year relationship, so I don't have much dating experience, and that I am in therapy and working on my issues. Next appointment is in a couple of days and I want to talk about this situation. Here are the bullet points I came up with for the last 6 months with her

In June I (36m) met a woman (32f) on OLD. We aren't diving across the table to make out, but it's a rare first date where I immediately feel comfortable and connected to someone. We talk that night and she invites me to stay the night at her place next week.

The day before our second date she backs out. Says she is recently out of a relationship and shouldn't have been on OLD. That she likes me a lot but isn't ready to date again yet.

A few weeks later she reaches out again. Says she's still isn't ready to date but wants to hang out and take things slow and see what happens. In this break I had started casually dating someone else, and decide I'm ok with us just talking and seeing if something happens.

We start texting, talking, and flirting a lot. She is sending me cute selfies and we're having deep intimate conversations. She has not given me any indication that she wants to date. I feel like the selfies are for attention/ego boost as I keep calling her hot/interesting/creative.

​​* I had been dating the other woman for about a month and get rejected. I hadn't told this woman about it at all, but then share the whole story with her. She says she wants me to take her out to dinner somewhere nice that weekend. She backs out an hour before saying she got really anxious. She says it wasn't going to be a date. I say I wish it was. She says she really likes me but her head is a mess right now and isn't ready to date someone like me until she gets better. She wants to still be friends. I say I need time to think about it.

*​ She reaches out a week later to check in. I tell her I'll be in town in a couple of days to see a friend and invite her to go to a bar after. She obviously put a lot of effort into dressing cute for it. We're both pretty tired and it's kind of a melancholy night, but I enjoyed it.

​​I start to invite her out more over the next couple of months. She's always up for it. She frequently takes pictures of us hanging out and posts them to social media with cute stories about our day. Her social media is usually just her posting selfies, family, art, memes. Everything I'm inviting her to do is stuff I would do with a gf, but this is all platonic as far as I can tell.

I'm about to go out of town for Thanksgiving and ask to drop off something I had borrowed from her. She invites me to hang out at her place for the first time. While we're there I tell her about my back hurting from work and she comes over and gives me a back rub. Then her hands move to my shoulders, my sides, arms, hands, way more than I expected. I think something is going on here. I turn around to face her and she gets flustered and jumps off the couch and tells me thanks for coming over and rushes me out.

Communication drops significantly over Thanksgiving. That's understandable. When we do talk the energy is different though. We went from texting almost daily to maybe once or twice a week for the next few weeks.

Jump to a couple of weeks ago. We had planned on driving out to a concert together. The day before she tells me she has been making friends in online groups and this one guy since around Thanksgiving has been DMing her every day calling her beautiful and talking to her and she wants to give him a shot. That she's thinking about flying to see him in a few months (he's a few states over, not a day trip). I'm floored. She had said she wasn't ready to date anyone. I had thought we were growing close. I had even ordered her a small but thoughtful Christmas present that I was going to give her when I picked her up. I tell her that he's just stating the obvious by calling her beautiful but that it's cute to see her excited about someone and he'd be an idiot not to like her. This was on the way to the concert. Between driving, the concert, and dinner after we spent 6 hours together that day. It was fun overall but also kind of stressful and uncomfortable.

I'm sad for days. To top things off this is the time of year my ex walked out on me 2 years ago. Stressed, depressed, anxious, I reach out to this woman and tell her I'm in a bad place (I blame the stress of the holidays surrounding my divorce). That I think we're starting to grow in different directions and should stop hanging out. She tells me that's not true (growing apart) but I can take all the time I need to get better and that she'll be there waiting for me whenever I'm ready. I thank her and we haven't talked since, outside of us sending Merry Christmas texts.

So here I am. Feeling rejected and that any romantic feelings this woman had for me were all due to chasing/infatuation. I'm not sure she ever actually was interested in me as more than a friend. The couple of times I've told her I'm interested she's not, and when I date other women or move on, she pulls me back in. I have not made any huge efforts to show that I'm interested in about 3 months. What's going on here? Was she interested and I should have been trying harder, is she legitimately a mess and just doesn't know what she wants, is she not interested in being more than friends at all and I'm just reading too much into things? I really want to figure out how I feel and what to do about this, because it's causing me a lot of stress. I'm trying to talk to other women and find myself hung up on her. I've received advice ranging from ghosting, to putting everything out there, to just keeping her around and focusing on other things. As much as I enjoy talking and hanging out, if I'm being honest with myself I'm more interested in seeing if we could grow romantically than continuing to grow platonically. It feels like at first we communicated very openly about things but the past few months have been muddled.

TLDR

Receiving mixed hot and cold signals for 6 months from a woman saying she really likes me but isn't ready to date anyone at all. She tells me she wants to start as friends and take things slow to see what happens. We start growing closer and spending more time together. My feelings for her start to grow. Then she says some guy online has been making moves on her and she thinks she's into him. I'm also currently dealing with stress and anxiety around the holidays from my divorce and am going to go to therapy and figure things out before taking any action.

This is so different from how I've felt about dating for like, my whole life. I've always been looking for ""the one."" Even back when I was hooking up with a lot of people, or fresh out of other breakups, I was eager to get back on the horse and open to love.

gonna try to make this as short as possible. 

So ive been seeing this girl..

she admitted her feelings for me first along with hitting me up.  
fast forward one night we got in a fight and the next day we talked and she said she wants to take things slower and start off as friends.  

we had been sexting etc which she always initiated but would say it would give her cold feet but shes so attracted to me. 
when we first met she said i dont speak much and when i do everyone listens with such intent and that im funny etc

im also used to always making the first moves and decisions so with her this is different. shes very outspoken about men, consent etc and different so i wouldnt dare making a move without asking. 

anyways so she says about starting as friends but is still attracted to me and i respect it. so i start treating her as a friend and immediately she was flirting and texting me the same night. 

i was completely confused and didnt really play into it. 
we went on our first “date” and had SO much fun.  
i didnt initiate any physical contact nor flirt though as i want to respect her wishes. 

she professed her interest in me and asked if i had the same in which i do after. 

but still i am afraid of flirting and overstepping boundaries/not rush anything. 

the way she is i also feel like im walking on eggshells sometimes which from what i see if partially my fault in thinking so. 

lately ive been in a lull and losing interest in her simply just by the confusion and suppressing my emotions so i dont get attached and hurt. 

she will flirt with me here and there too. which gets me confused. 

the other day she started flirting kinda with me and asked me to go to stores with her so we did for like 2 hours, we went and had a fun time. but again no physical contact. 

last night she flirted hard so today i said fck it and sent a flirty text. things were getting intense. she even was “begging” for my attention.  she then asked if i was intimidated by her. and doesnt want me to feel uncomfortable. 

it took me 2 times asking her and giving examples to why she felt i was. 

she proceeded to tell me that she has been making all the moves. 
as well as the way i respond to her 
the way i conduct myself
 “you dont seem dominant” 

i told her i have been respecting her wishes and trying not to put her in any uncomfortable situations. as well as taking things slow. 
im afraid of flirting and holding back because of that. 

that im used to making all the moves and decisions and if i have permission i will then. 
she then told me how much she wants me and that we agree on telling each other what we are comfortable with and would rather press the gas pedal and reestablish boundaries than nothing at all. 

we started flirting and role playing hard. 

we are seeing each other monday as of right now and im going to kiss her and maybe even a little more. just this all has me kind of confused and the way she said that im not dominant along with it seeming like im weak when in the end im just trying to respect her wishes felt very disrespectful to me. 

i did thank her for telling me though and that im so happy she did. 

what can i do to go back to being myself and not seeming so submissive? and what was i doing wrong?

So I was thinking either a Thai place for dinner since I know Thai food is one of if not her favorite foods, or a movie (probably spider man but we have both seen it and really liked it so idk), or I was thinking an animal shelter or sanctuary (I’m not totally sure the difference), I had mentioned that I wanted to get a dog in a couple months and I currently have 2 at my parents house, and she has a dog as well. I had mentioned that me and my family have always adopted a dog from shelters and she talked about how husky’s can be given away so I feel like there is mutual interest but idk if this is a good first date especially if you have never met the person.

62,rp4eak,1640548281,Would you date someone with herpes?,"Hi, I'm using a throwaway account to remain anonymous. 

Not that I should need to provide context, but the virus has such negative stigma I always feel like I have to. My (24F) ex (25M) did not disclose to me that he had herpes until a month or so after I moved in with him. It was at a point in my life where I felt I didn't have a lot of options, I was also so in love with him I had my rose-coloured glasses on. So, I stupidly decided to stay, despite him keeping the truth from me for over a year of dating. I was promised marriage if I stayed, amongst other bs. Long story short, he was reckless and irresponsible and guess what - now I have it too. 

I chose to provide context not to deny my own promiscuity but more to show  that you can be in a relationship, take precautions and still catch it. So please, don't judge anyone because you see the word 'herpes'. 

Simply put, I trusted someone I shouldn't have and now I have to live with that poor decision for the rest of my life. 

Since being ready to date again, I have promised myself that I won't make the same mistakes he did, and if there is the potential things may become physical with someone, I always disclose. I try to give as much information as possible without overwhelming the person. For example, I take suppressant medication which in theory halves the risk of passing it on and I am open to pursuing any other method that lowers the risk to my partner, however the risk, although very small, will always be there. 

At the end of the day, it is a coldsore in an unfortunate place. 

Typically, the people worst affected have a weak immune system, however as one of those people, I rarely get outbreaks, in fact I haven't had one since Jan 2021 and I was diagnosed Sep 2020. In fact, I've been told most people don't realise they have it because they do not show symptoms and it is not screened for during standard sexual health checks. My local GUM clinic actually advised me against taking suppressant medication due to the small number of outbreaks I've had since being diagnosed, and generally not to worry as supposedly 1 in 4 have a type of herpes. They stated I am much more prepared to be dating (in that I'm informed of how it can be spread) than those who do not realise they have it.

The sad thing is, the worst part about the virus is the stigma, in terms of my general health, it really doesn't affect me.  

So far the responses have been mixed, some people have politely turned me down but appreciate that I was honest and responsible. Others have said, and I quote, 'I'm worth the risk', and are willing to pursue a relationship with me.

To conclude, if someone you wanted to date/have sex with revealed all the information I have here, would you still be interested in pursuing things with them?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rp4eak/would_you_date_someone_with_herpes/

He was always a bit distant, I was mostly the one reaching out and making plans. But he was worth it, I thought. Because every time we meet, things are amazing. When I asked for exclusivity, he wanted that. When I asked for a relationship, he wanted that. I thought that with time, he would naturally reach out to me more. But no, it's constantly just waves of hot and cold. 

I have spoken to him many times about him being so distant when we are apart. Sometimes it has been better for a while. Then he is distant again. Lately he has been depressed and has started drinking a lot. He also did cocaine. He spends every weekend getting blackout drunk and staying out till 3 in the morning without me. 

We exchanged gifts this Tuesday and watched the new Spider-Man movie. Things felt great. We loved the gifts we got from each other. Then he went back to being distant. I sent him a sweet text on Christmas Eve, telling him how much I like him and that I'm happy it's the two of us. He left me on read. He doesn't reach out. He's been drunk for days. 

I just... I can't fucking do it. I have all this love and warmth I want to give him but it's too one-sided. I've thought about breaking up several times but today it just... became real. I can't do this anymore. I don't want this anymore. I want to feel loved and cherished. I try so fucking hard to make things work, but it always fails. I really want someone to share my life with.

But are there people out there who don’t let the experience completely break them? 

All I ever see is people who get so worked up and stress over the rules, methods, anxieties and strategies about dating. Post from how there’s no hope for average men to “does my body count matter?” 

It’s like a never-ending blanket of fear that if you don’t live a certain way, follow specific rules or posses particular qualities then your dating life is forever doomed and you’ll never live happily ever after. I understand that outcome isn’t ideal, but is there really a point in stressing so much over it? Or letting it turn you into a pessimist? 

I can’t help but think the people that don’t center their identity and individuality around dating have the best approach. They just seem so rare. But if you are one of those people that’s chill about dating, what’s your dating life like?

I (27M) wouldn’t trade mine for the world.

I video chatted with this guy on bumble and everything was fine. We planned to have a one night stand so he drove about 30 minutes to my apartment. He seemed nervous so I asked him if he was okay and he said he was fine.

We went up the stairs to my apartment. Once we were inside, he frantically checked his pockets and said that he forgot something. Then he went out the door. I actually believed him at first. Then a thought popped into my head like “what if he just drove off and left?”

I checked the bumble app and saw that he blocked me. Then I texted him and it wasn’t delivering. I called him and it went straight to voicemail. What the fuck? I don’t understand what even happened.

I was wearing the same outfit in the pictures, and we video chatted. I don’t know why he would waste gas and 30 mins of his time just to leave as soon as he got here. He was going to get some sexual action so I’m like what the fuck.

If anything, he was a major catfish. His pictures weren’t clear on his profile. His face was always covered up or it had a stupid Snapchat filter on it. I kept asking him for pictures of his face and it clearly showed that he was lying about his weight. But he was still cute. Even when we video chatted I thought he was still handsome.

Was the relationship in reality wasn't that serious in the first place (such that the relocation wasn't that emotionally expensive to warrant the breakup)? Or is it usually the assessment that finding a replacement beau in the new location is relatively easy?

89,rp7gee,1640557631,"Women, do you know the exact reason of why you're not feeling a guy?","I'm a guy, and when I go on a date with a girl... I can pinpoint the reasons why I don't want to go on another date.  There almost always ""brutal reasons""

1) I'm physically not attracted to her

2) Our personalities don't click.  She's rather obnoxious, or has conflicting views that I have.  (She thinks all poor people are just lazy)

It's almost always a lack of physical attraction.  Of course I can't tell them that when rejecting.  I just resort to the no spark bs.

But the women I've talked to, often times they don't seem to be consciously aware of why they don't like a guy.  

So women on here, do you usually know the exact reason to why you're rejecting someone?

Or is the whole ""no spark, no romantic connection, no chemistry, blah"" really the real reason?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rp7gee/women_do_you_know_the_exact_reason_of_why_youre/

91,rp7mev,1640558093,"We had sex on the first date, and I thank you","The title says the whole story for conclusion, details are down

&amp;#x200B;

We matched on a dating app, after two weeks of trying to get a good match, we didn't really speak that much before I (26 M) invited her (27 F) for dinner, and she accepted

I was loosing confidence because of getting older problems, like receding hairline and the skin flaws, but what's more than a rejection could happen? 

So we went to the restaurant, we had a good conversation with some laughter, then we went out and it was so cold, so the date was coming to an end until I remembered an advice a guy have written here which says ""take actions in a date, don't just wait for things to happen""

and I did, having the cold as an excuse to hold her hand, we hold hands for a while before I invited her to my place, she preferred her place because it was closer to spend time in

Before we went there I had to make sure that this was going somewhere, so I made up another excuse to hug here - I remember she was a little bit shaking from cold - then we kissed 

We went there, and I slept over at hers. It was a very good Christmas for both of us.

For that guy who wrote those advices, Thank you!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rp7mev/we_had_sex_on_the_first_date_and_i_thank_you/
92,rp7nmg,1640558203,I (26 F) suspect that guy (29 M) I’m dating has a girlfriend at home,"I’ve been dating this guy that I met from an app for 4.5 months. Over 2 months ago we have established that we are dating each other exclusively and that we have both deleted our dating profiles. We get along great and we have both talked about the potential for a serious long-term relationship. We normally text everyday. Sometimes he responds to my texts right away, sometimes when he’s busy he would reply after a few hours which is fine with me. On a few occasions he would call me, but that’s not often.

This guy is only here for school. He flies back to his state to visit his family quite often (every break such as Thanksgiving and Christmas). I have been noticing that whenever he’s back home to visit his family, he barely texts me and would take much longer to reply to my texts. When he’s home he would never call me even though he is supposed to have more free time when he’s home. This has made me suspect that he has a girlfriend back home. This guy does not use social media, or at least he told me so and I have tried but can’t find anything about him online. One time I even jokingly asked if he has a girlfriend back home, of course he said no. We haven’t met each other family.

Yesterday morning I texted him “Merry Christmas,” and he replied to my text right away. I then asked him if I can call him. No reply from him for the rest of the day. Today, over 24 hours after my last text yesterday, he texted me back saying “Sorry so busy with family. How are you?” Should I call him out to let him know that I’m not happy that it takes him over 24 hours to reply to my text? If so how should I do it? I like him and I think our relationship is going well so I don’t want to make myself look clingy and mess this up. At the same time I can’t really tell if he’s hiding something from me, and the suspicion is growing in me.

93,rp7pa4,1640558343,"You know in romcoms, when the woman is dating two men, and has to decide between them? And you think ""That would be an amazing situation to be in; but it's obvious which one she should pick."" It's NOT!! It's horrible and difficult, and I can't believe this is happening to me.","I've been dating A1 for four and a half months, but things have been rocky on and off since the beginning of October, including a break up. In all this time, due to traveling and busy schedules, we've only been together in person a total of six times, the longest period lasting approximately twelve hours. Our communication consists mostly of texting, with the rare video chat. He's also in the process of looking for a place to live in another state, so if we continue our relationship it would have to be long distance, and I don't think he'll be willing to travel one weekend a month to be with me.

Then, two weeks ago I met A2, my knight in shining armor. Rescued me when my car broke down. Calls me at least once a day. He wants to spend time with me, and even made a joke today about future plans. I can see myself being happy with A2.

But, I'm in love with A1, and he indicated a couple of times this weekend he thinks of me as part of his future. If he would just commit to spending time with me on a regular basis, now and after he moves, everything would be great. He just has a problem with committing unless he knows his plans will work out.

If my life was a romcom, everyone would say (and in real life everyone does say) A2 is the obvious choice. Dump A1 and live happily ever after. But, A1 has my heart, and I don't want to settle.

He said that he thought the same thing about previous partners too, so maybe it's just a him thing and I don't need to be worried about it, but it's created an insecurity in me that i can't shake.

96,rp8ah2,1640559991,Just want to move on and stop thinking about him,"I (25 F) was seeing this guy (24 M) for a few months who told me from the jump that he wanted a relationship with me. I wasn’t ready for a relationship (at first) but made myself ready because I really liked him. He was basically everything I wanted in a man. Good looking, goal oriented, amazing in bed, and I could listen to him talk about his passions forever. So, when he’d tell me all these romantic things about how much he wanted to be with me, I felt so happy but almost like it was too good to be true.
Sometimes, his actions wouldn’t match his words. He’d brush me off sometimes and say he was “too busy” to talk to me even though I’d really only want to talk to him like once a day. So we stopped talking for this reason. After confronting him for ignoring me for 12+ hours, he said we “think too different” and it won’t work.
He blocked me because I blew up on him. He told me all these things I wanted to hear and then pushed me away like it meant nothing. I was hurt. It’s been 2 weeks since we’ve talked. I keep expecting him to reach out but he hasn’t, and I’m still blocked.

I've never dated anyone before or at least didn't was in a nontoxic relationship where things went well so I really don't know what to do on this situation

Also since the day we declared our intentions with eachother we've been talking all the days at least one time for at least 2 hours (chat)
She added me for the best friends thing on instagram and replies to my histories making a way to talk with me
It's like I think I'm in love with her but don't know what to talk about, I only want her to come here and stay time together doing things like going to places and couple stuff
And if we talk all the days I think like she is going to get bored about me
