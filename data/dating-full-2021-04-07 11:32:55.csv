So here I get a bit uncomfortable. Is it really normal? Like, if I meet someone couple of times, we become serious, and it turns out they slept with someone else, literally a few days ago. I would feel really uncomfortable with that.

Complete silence. He still hasn’t even opened my last messages on fb which were replies to his questions. He still views my gram stories all the time which is super weird too.

And I think it'll help some people in the dating scene, guys and girls. and everything in between.

Have a hobby.  Seriously, this is a big thing that I look out for when I first start talking to someone, what they do in their spare time.  Because if someone asks you this, and the answer is ""nothing"" BIG RED FLAG! ABORT ABORT! haha. Maybe not that dramatic but...

In my opinion Healthy relationships consist of two independent people, that enjoy each others company, when they aren't doing their own thing.  They support each other and help each other be the best individuals they can be.

But for some people, who don't stay busy... the relationship or the other person **becomes their hobby**.  I am very guilty of this myself, for basically my entire life until recently.  And it will 100% drive people away, and you wont even realize you're doing it.  

Don't text them all the time, let the times you do interact have more meaning. Texting all the time has burnt out so many dates/potential dates for me. I know this is super hard to do, especially when you're really into someone/excited about them. But you have to discipline yourself and do this.  Or you're gonna lose 'em.  The best way to do this you ask? Stay busy! Work on yourself and your stuff! Make them wonder if you're gonna text them back a little... Make them excited to see your name pop up on your phone, cause it's a rare treat, make them wonder what you're doing...   


If you are constantly texting your prospective relationship, especially if they stay busy.  And every time they reply, BOOM you reply instantly... that's gonna be a turn off, because it'll show you're not busy, and that you're not doing anything even if it's a subconscious realization.    


Think about dating before cell phones, and how that worked. Really think that through, and kinda try and emulate that.  **Cause we weren't meant to be in constant contact with each other** like we are... So it's better if we keep it that way!

I’ve (f18) been talking to someone I met on Tinder (m21) for a week and some change now. At first, he seemed way different from every other guy I’ve talked to on that app. I’m used to shallow, gross guys who just want to use me for sex and don’t really care about me as a person. We were able to hold a conversation, joke around, he called me my favorite petnames and expressed to me how interested he was. I was smitten and eager to keep talking to me and he offered me his snap, which we primarily used for a while to communicate with each other. 

We talked back and forth for a couple of days. As time went on though, the worse he got at texting. I didn’t really think to much of it as I knew he had a job, a life, and you cant really expect someone to be in contact with you all the time. However, he used to AT LEAST always text me in the morning, and then at least once at night when it was pretty late. He always seemed pretty remorseful for being gone for so long and made it known how much he missed me and how much he had been wanting to talk to me all day. There was a specific instance early on when we were talking where he was gone for a couple of hours, I wasn’t responding so he started spamming me until my bitmoji popped up on his screen. He expressed that sometimes he could get clingy when he really likes someone and also REALLY likes when his partner is clingy back. So, I figured it would be alright to do a similar thing to him sometimes. When he would be gone for a while I would double, triple, even quadruple text to just let him know I miss him and can’t wait to talk to him later.

Eventually we planned to meet up. He lives 2 hours away from me but he said he was used to driving a lot and really wanted to see me so it didn’t matter. We decided to meet up this past Friday in my town to have dinner and then to play frisbee on campus (I live in a college town.) We had expressed sexual interest in each other before so I was sure to prepare for something like that happening but I also knew he wanted it to be a real date and not just a hookup or anything. That day was pretty stressful because he got off work later than he planned and took a while getting ready, so I was very worried he might not be coming at all as it had gotten pretty late. But, he called me once he was in his car (which was the first phone conversation we had) and we clicked instantly. It made me even more excited to see him and get to know him better when he arrived. 

When he got here it was pretty dark and I remember being pretty paranoid that he was some sort or kidnapper or something. He obviously wasn’t and when we stepped out of cars we immediately met up with each other in the middle and exchanged a couple of words before there was a pause and we kissed each other. I had never experienced anything like that before, but the moment felt so right and perfect and we both just couldn’t help but express how much we liked each other. The rest of the date was great, he paid for my food and we talked up a storm. We dived into each others struggles and personal lives and comforted each other when talking about a heavy topic. We eventually went to a garden and sat on a bench, taking turns making out and continuing to talk to each other. He expressed how much he really liked me and how happy he was. I was over the moon! We went back to his truck and had sex and then cuddled until he had to go home since he had work in the morning, which he didn’t even leave until about 2 am and he was supposed to go in at 9. 

The next day he told me how sick he was feeling, that his boss told him to go home and see a doctor and so he spent the rest of the day in bed with a horrible migraine and stomach problems. He texted me a good amount for being sick that day, so I was worried about him but I was happy. The next day though is where things start to get weird. He didn’t text me that morning, he only texted me once in the evening and it was just one exchange of words. He didn’t text me that night, and I remember being so scared and paranoid he was ghosting me that I called him a bunch and left him dozens of texts. Of course I tried to rationalize that he was sick and was probably asleep or didn’t feel like being on his phone. He finally texted me the following morning and he apologized to me and I was easy to forgive him. We hadn’t exchanged numbers at this point so I asked him if he wanted mine and he agreed. Text became the primary communication we used as he hasn’t texted me on snap since Monday (the day he texted me back after having disappeared the day before) and we exchanged words for a while that day. He was describing to me how sick he felt and that he had to take 4 antibiotics and that tomorrow he was gunna have to go to the doctors to get an IV. I became really worried about him and when he disappeared made it known that I was worried and hoped he was okay. However, he again didn’t text me until the next day pretty late into the evening and told me he was in the emergency room because he couldn’t drive himself to the doctors. They asked him to stay overnight since they were worried about how weak he was. That day for some reason I had this terrible gut feeling that something was up though. 

A few things I should mention before I continue:

1. He asked to be exclusive pretty much immediately. I brought up to conversation with him about our 2nd day of talking to each other and he expressed how he didn’t like dating multiple people as he really was interested in me and wanted to focus on and pursue me. I agreed since I also really liked him a lot, but I had this anxious feeling that I would get attached easily to fast because of it. I ignored it as I trusted him and wanted to believe he really did like me. We even had a follow up conversation about it when he came to see me. He insisted he really liked me and would be happiest this way, but also made it known that if I wanted to see other people he didn’t want to prevent me from doing so. I encouraged him that I really didn’t want to and preferred it this way. (Which is the truth, I just thought maybe starting out exclusive so early might be detrimental if something were to happen. But I decided to trust him regardless.)

2. He has so far only been in bad relationships. His most recent ex he was on and off with for about two years, and she was constantly lying to him about her feelings and she used him for money. He quit his old job that was making him a lot and so she broke up with him. He said it’s been difficult but he was ready to try and be with someone else. I am also in a similar situation, I recently broke up with my most recent ex in February and one of the worst things for me about it was that he told me he loved me ridiculously soon. I sort of gave into pressure and told him I loved him back, but the more we said it the more I started to believe it. I told tinder guy about this and he seemed really sympathetic. He also has ex’s who have cheated on him. Overall, I don’t think he really knows what a good relationship looks like. 

3. Remember when I said my ex said he loved me too fast? Well, tinder guy said it at the end of our date. I freaked out in my head but I ended up saying it back because I trusted him and only saw our relationship going up from there. But I don’t understand how he didn’t absorb what I said about my ex and assume that if he did the same it would be inappropriate. Ive since brushed it off but it is something that bothers me. 

Now that you have that knowledge, you can imagine how upset/confused that I’d be when I saw that he had updated his tinder profile last night. I know it seems hypocritical, what was I doing with the app if we were supposed to be exclusive? Well I really liked going back and looking at our conversations sometimes when we first met because they were cute and made me smile. But I remember my heart rate going up and my stomach churning when I saw he had added an extra photo to his profile. He hadn’t answered me in a while and the last I heard from him he told me he was in the hospital. I was really, REALLY suspicious something was up though. I remember getting home and checking how many miles away he was and it had changed by 20 miles. It was 2 in the morning, if he was in the hospital how could he have moved 20 miles? His snap score had gone up and he hadn’t answered me on snap or on text message. 

Then, the worst thing happened. He had a tumblr which I had taken the liberty of following when we matched. My name or face is not anywhere on it but he followed me back. I had messaged him a few days ago, planning on telling him it was me if he messaged back. Well, he had gotten back to me. That same night. At 2 in the morning. When I hadn’t heard from him in several hours and had assumed he was in the hospital. I had a full blown panic attack last night, I stayed up until 4 am trying to rationalize what was going on with my friend. We couldn’t rationalize it at all because his actions and words were so confusing and inconsistent. I spammed him with a bunch of texts, expressing I was worried something was going on and he was lying to me about something and all I wanted was the truth. I tried calling him (I knew he was on his phone because of tumblr) but it rang all the way through and he didn’t answer. I told him to call me in the morning. I don’t think I’m blocked, he hasn’t unadded me on snap and every time I try to call him the ringer doesn’t go straight to voicemail. I have been loosing sleep over this. I really don’t want to be with someone who lies to me this way, but I don’t even know if he is lying and if I’m missing something. I really like him and hate how attached I am to him over such a short period of time. I just really want him to either block me or call me back so I can either move on or get an explanation. Am I overreacting? Should I just block him and never look back? I’ve never felt this way about anyone before and I really need advice.

We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and that was 3 weeks ago now. For my birthday, I never received a text from him and I didn’t receive anything over easter either.

I have an idea to hold social events that where men and women could meet and get to know each other. The goal is that everyone can find someone who they can at least get along with. Maybe some individuals can take thing further. 

The issue is that there needs to be enough individuals that would get along well in a room together. Also these events would have some kind of financial cost. 

Costs may go towards  food, and recreational activities as well as the cost I would have to take on to use an area. Rent can be costly even just for a few hours. 

A fee is required.   If you are interested in attending message me, so I can see if you would be a good fit.

Zoom Sessions: 

The goal of these sessions is for women to be able to have somewhere where they can talk about what it is like to be a female these day. Subjects can include but may not be limited to motherhood, family conflict in family of origin, conflicts with friends, health issues, menstruation etc, cultural norms. 

5-10 individuals each session to start with.

The chemistry with this girl is unlike anything I've experienced, even better than my past relationships. It feels so natural in every way and we've both expressed that we **really** like each other. We seem to connect on every level: serious dates, casual hangouts, gotten intimate with each other, deep conversations, playful banter, etc.. I'm usually a pretty level-headed person who likes to take things slow, so I'm a little surprised that this girl could take me by storm.

Here's the kicker – she is only up in my area for another 2 weeks before she heads back home. She is from Los Angeles and I live in San Francisco, which is just far enough to make things difficult. It's like an elephant in the room every time we hang out, but we both have agreed to just enjoy the moment for now (good old procrastination). Pragmatically, I can't see myself doing a long distance relationship after only knowing someone for a few weeks and not being able to see them often in the early phases; but emotionally, I don't think it's very easy to find a connection like this and it would be a huge shame to lose out on her. We both agreed that we would probably date each other if not for the distance issue. I can also tell that it's weighing heavy on her mind, since she seems to act in ways and say things that are extremely intimate, but is uncertain about the future and reels it back in. 

Dating her made me realize that if we do call it quits, I'll probably want to take a break from dating again because I'll end up comparing every other girl to her and it won't match up. I'm also in no rush to be in a relationship – I actually enjoy being single and all the things that come with it. She was the first person I connected with in over a year since my last relationship ended about a year ago (had been on many dates with many girls that led to nowhere). 

r/dating – please help me organize my thoughts: Should I try to pursue this even if it's long distance so early on? Should we call it quits but leave the door open for a relationship should the circumstances ever work out? Should we stay in touch? Do we do a casual long distance thing where we don't call it a relationship, but we visit every so often (is this a road to nowhere)?

TLDR – met a girl on a dating app that blew me away. She is only in my area to visit for a few weeks before she leaves back for home.

I'm trying to stay optimistic but it's pretty hard right now.  The dating world has just been cruel no matter what I try lately. Last time I wasn't feeling it with someone I politely let them know only to be ridiculed for being an asshole. Hopefully this is just been a string of immature people.

I've tried different pics, bios, apps but I seemingly only match with really immature people-with what I'd consider to be decent profiles. I've taken time off to work on myself and have gotten some support from friends but there's been zero dating opportunity for months now and it's crushing my soul a bit.

 I'm not sure how else to put myself out there with the pandemic being what it is. I work from home so I'm only out of the house to see friends occasionally, hike, run, and golf. There haven't been any women to pursue in any of these avenues so OLD seems like the only way.

 It's starting to feel like the truman show lol.  I'll have great conversation then people just disappear. There's SO many lonely, single people and I'm out there as much as a I can be, but I can't get a date. I'm fit, tall, financially independent, with no kids. No clue what Im doing wrong.

Got her instagram and a few days later I was drinking at night and decided to call her (bad idea I know). Anyway when I called her her friend answered but I could hear whispering in the back. I was a bit confused by why she even bothered answering to be honest.

Then a few days later I sent her a text and a few hours later she put up a story and didn't even open my message so I unsent the message not waiting for a reply and just took it that she wasn't interested.

I haven't initiated contact in like 4 months but I feel like she could've been testing my clinginess and that she might be trying to bait me by putting up stories of the place where I met her first quite often and (maybe its in my head).

I'm going through a pretty heavy drought at the moment as our country is in a strict lockdown and haven't bothered with other women since as pubs and clubs are closed with no sign of opening.

Should I try one more time to be sure by calling her or replying to her story or should I just call it quits?

Like, they get very upset over a stray sock on the floor, a cabinet ajar, the toilet paper being on the front/back, stuff like this.

I literally don't care about any of this kind of stuff. A dish in the sink is a dish in the sink, not the end of civilization. It's also the fact I make typos in my texts, or don't make my bed the second I get out of it. I guess it's about control?

I find it ironic because I'm a pretty accomplished person. I have multple degrees, work at a great job with people I like in a company that is helping people, and I also run a small volunteer business part time. I'm organized as hell, but becuase I don' thave OCD about all these tiny things, the people I date get pissed off and often start insulting me. 

Lazy, stupid, sloppying, pathetic, etc. I'm so used to it at this point I kind of expect it. I just don't understand why people get so angry about stuff that has zero real world consequence. It's not like I'm going into work submitting grant applications riddled with typos, but that's work. Apparently if I text 'hey what do you wnt to do tonight?' And they will be like 'I can't understand you when you text, wtf is wrong with you why can't you just text correctly'.. ummm OK? seems like a ridiculous over reaction to missing an a? 

I a few of these people I kinda figured out it's projection. Like, they were paranoid about tiny stuff because the big stuff in their life was a total mess. Hated their job, debt, had no real friends, had addictions to bad food and alchol, stuff like that. 

I have to say though it's pretty depressing. like, apparently I'm the only person that thinks it's more important to show up to work on time than to have my bed made in apartment that nobody will ever see? What? I can't wrap my head around this crap, and yet it becomes this dramatic issue with most everyone I date.

I'm not a slob, I'm just not chasing perfection in my private life. I also don't have crippling anxiety about stuff like a smudge on my shoe or a stain on my shirt either. Shit happens.

1. Is it too soon to give the heads up? We made plans yesterday (Tues). Got my period today (Weds). The date isn't until Sat. Honestly, if it was with someone more local, I'd probably try to be more casual and wait until Friday to give the heads up.

I know I deserve someone who would treat me like a human at least, and my expectations is apparently too high despite it being the fucking minimum in the world's eyes. Everyone is too fucking dangerous and crazy. 

I guess I just wanted someone to help me on my ultimate goal, but, maybe I should do it alone so no one gets hurt by whatever crazy partner I could trap myself into.

A lot of people on all dating/relationship subs post every single day, that “omg i’m never gonna have a GF/BF. I’ve never had one, never will. Life is so depressing. What to do?”

Ok let me stop you there. You’re not ready for a relationship, if it’s to fill a void, so you don’t feel depressed... whatever the cause is. Depressed because you’re lonely, poor, bad looking, whatever. 

You feel depressed because there’s something very specific, that’s bothering you. You’re insecure about something, and have low self esteem because of it.

You’ve probably heard about people on different subs saying “you need to work on yourself” when given advice. That’s absolutely correct!

I personally had a porn addiction i got rid of a year ago (shoutout to r/NoFap). That made me a whole new person. I was good at dating before, but it’s a whole new World now. I’m not scared if i get rejected, idk if i didn’t get to 2nd date with the cute girl, because i’m good without it.

I’m good without a GF, because i’m happy with who i am and proud to be me. Every single day.

Whatever it is that’s bothering you, you gotta find the core of the problem, the main reason you *don’t* have a self esteem, that’s on top of its game.

Why? How you may ask.

Most of this is in relation to attracting someone, ANYONE to date, as the dating pool may be dry for you with failed apps, failed day game, failed everything. Naturally looking at yourself and who you are may come into question. I was in this boat not too long ago, no matches on apps, no day game, single for 6+ years with seemingly no hope.  


For reference I'm a 27 year old, average looking man. In 2020 I went on 5-10 dates, it took immense effort, unimaginable amounts of tinder resets, tinder gold, cold approaches, you name it I did it. Finally I had the options, finally I just had the dates, the foot in the door, the bare minimum I see men begging for on here. It was terrible. I didn't enjoy any of the dates, because I didn't connect with any of these women on any sort of level. Why? Because I attracted them artificially. Sometimes I would be the one not to progress to date 2 or 3, often the other way around. Simply put even the women could tell I put on a show to get them to the table and what they got was not what they were hoping for. This made me feel WORSE about the situation. Zero dates for years into multiple bombings and failed dates. I gave up for a few months.  


Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. I reinstalled tinder with fresh pictures. I'm a huge nerd,and always thought a nerdy bio would be a turn off, and for the most part it seems to be true, so instead I let nerdy pictures convey that side of me and my bio conveyed two short facts about me and what i wanted. Within 48 hours I matched with my soon to be girlfriend. She is everything I could want, and we connect on every level. Why? I said fuck it, and did nothing other than speak and act, exactly however I would to anybody else, or to my friends. My time wasn't wasted, her time wasn't wasted, and we click together with no friction. If you do not 100% commit to being yourself, no matter how drastic, uncanny, horrible, you think you are will attract people you will never jive with, who can smell your act a mile away, and the following failure will only feed your current insecurity.

I started liking him pretty quickly in the beginning and he always said he liked me but didn't do relationships (and then he got into a relationship for a little while about a year later). We grew apart and didn't see each other much until last May and eventually started things up again over the summer, and then faded out again for a while.

A few weeks ago I saw him for the first time in a few months and was expecting to just have a beer with him and catch up for like an hour, but that time kept going until we found ourselves on my couch cuddling and eventually having sex. We hung out again a few days later (2 weeks ago tomorrow) but haven't planned anything since - I asked about a week ago if he wanted to go to the dog park over the weekend and he said he'd let me know but would probably be busy with school, and that this month would be a lot for him. I'm all caught up in my feelings again and haven't actually brought it up to him at all in at least 3 years because I'm assuming it would it would go the same way as it always has. 

So I've been keeping my therapist up to date on all this and she's kind of insisting that I have *that conversation* with him to see if there's any chance of it ever going anywhere so I can have an answer and stop guessing and overthinking. Based on our history and him saying he's too busy to hang out for the time being, I feel like I already know the answer and should just try to move on, but she keeps saying I can't assume things or read his mind, and that some people are actually busy when they say they are and it doesn't mean they're not interested (I'm totally guilty of this). And even though getting that answer will hurt, it's probably what I need for closure so I can stop going through this on and off cycle.

Since I have no idea when I'll see him next, I know I'll have to bring it up over text so I don't have to wait and sit on this in my head for weeks, even though I'd rather do it in person (but that's scarier and easier to avoid too). I'm just not sure how to bring it up or frame the question. Every time I think about asking him, I try to manage my expectations and be realistic and prepare myself, but a part of my mind still runs wild and gets my hopes up. So I know I need to just get this out of the way and have my answer soon so I can stop trying to guess at it in my head.

TLDR how do I bring this up and frame/word the question? How do I manage my expectations and stop getting my hopes up?

We’ve gone out on two dates so far, and we have a great connection in person. After our first date, texting turned into a 1-2 text convo a day, and after our 2nd date texting has pretty much ceased altogether. 

He mentioned to me that he has been struggling to balance his work &amp; personal life alongside trying to raise a puppy. He’s also in 3 bands, and mentions how much time it takes to practice and write music, etc. He’s been working on average 10-12 hour days and then I don’t really know what else. Bottom line here is that I don’t ever hear from him. 

I feel like this has become extremely unfair because since the beginning he has been the one to initiate the original convo, asked me to go on the dates, etc, but now I can’t hear or see from him because of everything going on. He was going through all of this even prior to meeting me as well, so it isn’t anything new at this point for him— but he didn’t mention any of this until I brought up how I was feeling a disconnection because of the lack of conversation. 

I brought this up to him again this week, expressing how I’m not sure how we are going to go about this if I can’t speak to him throughout the week, and that I was going to start seeing other people if building a relationship is something that isn’t a priority to him right now. He admitted to the lack of communication, etc, and said that he would do his best to work with me. He offered to hang out Friday or Sunday of this week, and upon me trying to ask him for his preference I still have yet to hear back, and it’s been almost 2 days since I asked him that. 

I am trying so hard to be patient and understanding, but we haven’t even had a 3rd date yet, and I can’t get to know him because I can’t communicate with him. I understand if this is something that isn’t top priority right now but I have put things on hold for him because I truly and genuinely would like this to fruition into something more. I just feel like it’s one sided right now and I know it’s unfair of me to say that.

I have brought up several times I'm looking for someone that doesn't mind taking the lead in decisions and conversation. He responds with things like ""yeah"", ""Sounds good"".

With talking online he tells me how much he's crushing on me and into me, and says things like ""hope you have a good day, how are you, enjoy the nice weather!"" These are nice things to hear, but so ungodly dry af and boring. 

I try to give answers that have some context to reply to, but I feel like I could be taking to my dad or brother. 😅 There are so many things a potential date could be asking. 

I can have great/deep/fun/random/insightful conversations all day if I'm initiating the conversation with guys. I can be charming, funny, intriguing, and generally interested in the person I'm talking to. I don't want to do this long term and I don't think I'm interested unless a guy can do the same when I don't lead.

She seems very busy so I get it, but she would usually always say sorry or why if she wouldnt reply for like a day
But this past week or so she's been taking days to get back to me
It's not anything that important, but it just gets me to thinking why the change all of a sudden
I just think I maybe get too invested in online dating early on and I know it's just a fantasy version but still. I know its pathetic but it really does make my life better , I feel better during those times of texting someone interesting, which isn't that often really, maybe like a third or half of the time. but anyways, back on track, i just dont know why she seems to have lost interest, everything seemed to be going ok. i don't know, from the very beginning she seemed to be a little too good for me, but it seemed like she liked me, so i don't know. she has been saying she's busy, but that still doesn't really explain to me how she doesn't have time for at least 1 or 2 messages a day. it just seems a bit rude. also, i don't expect to have messages waiting all the time, but since there always seems to be something to say, thats how it ended up. maybe i would rather prefer to hear from each other in a call once in a while, than this. i don't need or want to be touch 24/7 either nor do i think thats healthy. but anyways, another one of my concerns was that she maybe realized she doesnt like me once i sent her a video of myself, because it seems like the messages became rarer a few days after that.but it could just be my insecurity. i don't know, the thing is she lives like 15 miles away, which is a villiage next to my city. its maybe like a 20 minute drive, which isnt even that much honestly. but i think she works like 10 hours a day and really rarely gets a day off. i dont have a problem going to her villiage but id feel stupid inviting myself over there. especially if shes working every day, theres no point really for me to come at night and then have to sit outside because all the cafes are closed indoors. i mean, all of that could be arranagble, but she doesnt really seem to be that initiative about it, and I don't want to be anybodys lapdog anymore.i already told her theres a ping pong table here in my city and spent a lot of time trying to find it, and i told her we should play sometime. so we did say some ideas what we should do some time but never an arrangement. and i don't know, i think she doesnt take anything of this that seriously, it was just like an option  in her head. and im not sure if she wants to come to my city just for me, maybe she's waiting for errands here to come up as well. i just dont want to come off like im persuading her to come if she doesnt want to. I mean, I could give her a nice and formal invitation, if she ever ends up responding to my recent texts. But when we first started talking she said that she was there to distract herself from a girl she stopped dating i guess. and that i was her first match on a dating app and 1st time there. and that she wasnt really there with a certain intention, just to see whats so interesting about dating apps. so i guess she followed through on her goal there. i distracted her a bit from that girl and showed her whats interesting about dating apps. her mission is done from what she said at first. i dont know if she wants anything else from me. she seems like a pretty busy person in comparison to me who is practically unemployed and never has been employed for long term. i just don't feel like asking her any of this because i think actions speak louder than words. im done chasing girls but i did just want to rant a little and get this off my chest. it sucks that i spent so much time thinking about it  when i know i barely crossed her mind lately. maybe she really just is busy i hope so and its not something bad i said. i just dont understand how someone can have me as a priority yet not reply for days. i cant really imagine myseld actinf like that towards someone unless i was trying to gradually ghost her, which seems cruel. i dont really know what to believe anymore, but whatever it is im not satisfied. i know she doesnt owe me amythimg because we havent met yet but i just dont like the way shes going about it. theres nothing wrong with ending a conversation because ur busy, but why  does she keep livint unfinjshed business in the air. at least write ok or something and be done with it. whatever the reason is its simply driving me crazy and honestly if this doesnt stop soon id rather never text her unless she wants to meet up then this racking my brains. i just hope to forget about it already and move on with my life. and i hope i didnt come across as a coward. it would suck to have wasted potential just because of miscommunication or her lack of it, for which im not guilty of. anyways, thats ir i guess.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,702566,public,self,"A girl I was texting with every day is now taking days to reply, what does this mean?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mmbqsp/a_girl_i_was_texting_with_every_day_is_now_taking/,all_ads,6,,,
