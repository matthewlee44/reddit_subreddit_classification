Well, turns out, it works perfectly though not exactly the way it was intended lol

Basically,  the magic phrase (asking them if they'd like to meet for coffee) separates men clearly and undoubtedly into different categories (time wasters, a-holes and f-boys, and the genuinely interested), and that's great, I don't have to scratch my head as to why the convo has fizzled out. No regrets and mysteries as to why he has faded away and other ways of wasting my time.

I have 3 exhibits so far:

Guy #1: small texts from time to time for a week, then I sent him the magic phrase with a polite add-on ""if you are available"". He immediately jumped at the opportunity to have more time-wasting fun, ""Ohhh, I can make myself available"", ""why can't I make myself available, I don't know"" etc. And the next day as if nothing happened, he resumed texting me once a day, in the evening, from his couch. ""Where did the day go?"" and other BS. It was a weekend btw.

&amp;#x200B;

Guy #2: nice texting and connection, it was slightly weird that he invited me to the hotel for a first date but it was in a joking way and we continued texting, and it was still fun and interesting. Then he started slow fading, and I shot my magic phrase. His reaction was, ""ohhh but I don't drink coffee, I want to meet for laughs and kisses"" as if he was the princess and I was courting him, not saying about the fact that he showed his true colors as a f-boy who needs to be reassured that the intimacy would be from the get-go, otherwise he is not interested. 

Anyway, the magic phrase worked again, highlighting his intentions.

&amp;#x200B;

Guy #3: I had a good feeling about our connection, and when I used the magic phrase, he said, ""Definitely!""

My (38f) bf (42m) of 2 years kicked me out 4 weeks ago. I had been depressed due to extreme job stress and we were fighting too much, but I realized it and started getting help (antidepressants, therapy, time off, etc.). I was starting to get better from my lowest point ever, and days later he kicked me out because he hadn’t been happy for the last few weeks or months. 

He then left for a trip to Asia to potentially work there. He’s not sure but he’s there for 2 weeks to test it out. He had always said this was a decision we would make together. 

Now, he says we are not broken up and he can’t believe my words that I’m doing all I can to not be depressed and make sure we have a happy relationship - he needs to see it. But he’s also barely talking to me and doesn’t want to hang out because he’s feeling “too introverted”. 

On the one hand I do agree that actions speak louder than words, but on the other I can’t believe he left me at my lowest moment despite me taking full responsibility and making a change. And also making me feel so unstable (getting kicked out, asap leaving for Asia, being cold, etc.). He’s also not once in the past month asked how I’m doing, despite me being consistently caring and affectionate. 

Honestly I’m at a loss- what do I even do next?

I’m 40F and set my age range as 35-47. This is what I want to date at the moment. I used to date men 50-61 but right now I want to date men 35-47.
Yesterday I went on a great date with a guy that put down he was 39. He was really really into me and wanted to see me again; he kept complimenting my appearance and I could tell he was into me. I found out on the date he was actually 42; he said he lied about his age because his “finger swiped on the wrong year by accident.” Sure.
The only thing I can think of is these men want to date women younger than what’s considered “appropriate” (nevermind the fact I’ve willingly dated men as old as 60).
If I put my age range as 40-50 then I never would have met yesterday’s date.
Lying about the age just puts a disgusting taste in my mouth.
A few years ago I went on a date with a guy that wrote he was 42…but then I found out on the internet he was 52. This was after I’d already slept with him.

The break occurred due to difficulty maintaining consistent meaningful contact.  We were still very new (still kind of are actually) and he pretty much faded after multiple attempts to connect while I was caring for my mom for a couple of weeks after surgery. Apparently my quick texts between work and caregiving/ hosting made him think I wasn’t really interested. He reached out again and we’ve since had a good chat about how to stay connected through schedule challenges and obligations. He’s more laid back now about always trying to make plans and I feel a lot less pressure around that whole aspect. Last time we saw each other, just last Thursday, he was asking about the weekend and I excitedly reminded him that my kid is visiting for spring break. I don’t know about others’ experience their first year as an empty nester, but these visits are everything to me now that we’re on different time zones. He was like, ah yes, well enjoy! Seemingly positive and understanding. 

A few days into my kid’s visit he’s started to be kind of distant again. I’m communicating more/ better as per our chat, but over the past few days he’s become much less communicative — still responsive but…different. I can’t tell if he is trying to be considerate— I.e. giving me time and space during the visit — or if he really has an issue. I did ask if “we’re good” and he said, yea, enjoy your time with your kid. I didn’t want to make a thing about it so just said thank you looking forward to catching up later. He concurred, everything was friendly, but something is off. And I think it’s the lack of attention.

Is my prioritizing precious time with my kid out of the norm? It’s waaaay to early to introduce them and I can’t be in two places at once. The thing is I have to work as well, so I’m trying to squeeze as much time as possible in this 1 week visit. I like this guy more than I have anyone I’ve met since leaving my marriage but I’m also a mom and the reality is that opportunities to spend this time and get to know the adult version of my child is dwindling as life progresses!

Do I sacrifice time with my child /carve out time to see this man?

Almost instantly I had women who seemed interested. Holy shit that was an ego boost. Even if nothing else I felt like my working on myself and getting myself together was worth it.

I was chatting with a few women. I asked 1 out for coffee. We met and talked for 2 1/2 hours. It was refreshing and enjoyable and just felt good. We would've talked longer but I needed to collect my son. That evening we arranged another date.

We were going to go for a walk but then she suggested dinner. Aces!

She turned up at the wrong restaurant hahaha. But that was all good it gave me a chance to walk out and meet her and walk her to the right restaurant. She put her arm through mine and the goosebumps hit me.

We sat and had dinner and a wine. The conversation only stopping while we ate. It was relaxed, comfortable and most of all natural. Dinner lasted until the staff were closing up and practically pushing us out the door.

I walked her to her car. She kissed me. Then she kissed me again. Then we made out (feel like a teenager saying that) for a good 10 minutes. It was amazing. She drove me back to my car. We kissed goodnight.

When I got home, as I was texting her to say thank you, she text me to say she had a lovely night, good food and great kissing!

She was a well-dressed 36 year old with a noticeably athletic body (she played a lot of tennis), and she turned out to be quite nice and flirtatious. Nothing happened that night (I'm not really a casual sex person, not then, not now, since an emotional connection is important to me), but she came back to the club a few more times over the next month or two and we talked, then cornered me late one Saturday night and gave me a very wonderful and veeerrryyy sensual kiss. After we pulled apart from each other, she said, ""I have a confession to make. I'm married. But I saw you and couldn't take my eyes off you and have such a crush on you..."" Whatever she said next was irrelevant, because I was not about to get involved with a married woman and politely told her as much. She never came into the club again, of course.

I was not in the habit of kissing and telling, but I did share the story with my college roommate a few nights later, who after a few beers shared the story with our basketball buddies, who all teased me. ""Dude, she's like my mother's age?"" one of them snorted. ""What were you thinking?"" But I didn't care. (My friends' opinions were irrelevant to me when it came to matters of the heart, plus it was. pretty wonderful kiss up until I learned that she was married). 

Anyway, based on continued posts here, and feedback from women friends, the MILF thing is very real. There are no shortage of younger men seeking middle aged women. And I myself have been approached by 20 and 30 something women (not a lot, but here and there). 

What I'd like to say is this: I think it's a tribute to a generation of moms and dads who raised 20 somethings. For my friends and I in 1990, when we were 20-somethings, we were mostly latchkey kids. We'd been turned loose to fend for ourselves days and sometimes weeks at a time, and I can't say that we were ever positively encouraged by the adults in our lives (teachers, etc.). So when we were 21 and a 36 year old approached me, I think it summoned some hard repressed feelings that we had about the way we were raised. 

I feel like parents are much better in recent decades. We're better educated about parenting, are more involved, try to overcompensate for the negligence that some of us felt (two of my best friends growing up, I was at their house all the time but only ever saw their parents once or twice). But today's 20 somethings I think for the most part (with exceptions of course) felt loved and encouraged, and thus do feel some attraction and affinity for older people. Thus the whole MILF/DILF thing in recent times. This may all sound creepy, but in a weird wAy it's sweet, too. 

Here's to raising generations of fulfilled kids. Even if it means we occassionally have to fend off younger suitors :) (I learned when I was dating at 51 that 40 to 60 was my cut off and 45 to 55 my preferred ages).

1. Not ready to date. But they think they are...at first...and then realize they are not. 
2. Ready to date, but seeking perfection. Anyone who falls short of perfection, will not work for them because they feel like they are ""settling"".

I think the most hilarious was 2 different men who I actually went on a first date with and didn't really have a connection with (mutual fade on those). And this occurred within the past 6 months. Like - how do you not remember that you actually went on a date with this person you're reaching out to within the past 6 months? 

But, the lesson I've learned here is that this is a great way to weed out those people who just like every profile and then weed through the responses they get back - so you don't waste your energy bothering with them. 

Some OLD apps don't like when you delete and eventually sign back up for a profile, as they consider it gaming the system. So if you have this as a pattern that you do often, it may result in a ban.

Of course, it also can be a hack to show people that most people on OLD apps are validation seekers only and have no business on the dating apps to begin with. So, do what you will with the info.

It’s been awesome actually -lots of fun, shared adventures, mutual love of music and dancing, lots of shared intimacies and secrets, discussed details of past relationships, tentative sharing of plans for the future (more him then me, he’s in a crappy situation living with his mother after his divorce and really wants out). I’m quite established and financially secure, he is not. I get the sense (if it wasn’t so early), he would be making moves to at least move to the city I live in. 

Also for context, our relationship is LDR, I swiped on him on a road trip near his home, we’re about 8 hours away from each other by car. But we do. Find lots of opportunities to spend time together (mostly I pay for these trips, or he comes to stay with me).  We say ‘I love you’ to each other, starting about month 3. 

I’ve said I’m ‘established and financially secure’: I have a pretty high powered professional occupation. I’m also confident and somewhat assertive, and quite tall and athletic (I was a college athlete). Despite these, I’m pretty typically feminine and in my past  relationships was generally kind of “the princess”. I’m used to being submissive in bed (I don’t mean “submissive” in the kink way, I’m just used to the man being in charge! I want to be ravaged, you know?). Since I’ve been single and on the apps (2 yrs) I’ve run across several sexually submissive men, also a close male friend of mine is a “sub” so I’m familiar with the dynamic and I don’t like it, I can’t get into it. But I think these  guys in particular tend to be attracted to me. 

Because of this, Within the first few weeks of dating I asked him”do you want me to dominate you?” (I can’t remember specifically how it came up, something must’ve happened or was said that gave me a hint ). His response was emphatic “no, I don’t like that, I’m  not into it”. 

Turns out that’s not true though…it started with small things (“experimenting” with some anal play for him) which I went along with because I was becoming increasingly invested in him! Then it was watching some pegging videos, playing around with me mounting him from the top, with his legs up (like reverse missionary I guess?). 

The last time he was here (for a two week visit), he went out and bought a strap on for me to f**k him with. These things don’t just feel like fun experimentation between two people… They have a clear dominant/submissive dynamic. I’m pretty put off by it actually. 

On our last night together before he left, I thought we might have some romantic goodbye sex, instead he wanted me to sit on his face and then f**k him missionary. 

I will say that he is very attentive to making sure I have an orgasm, he’s sexy and fun! But I just  don’t like the vibe. And I’m pretty dismayed that he misrepresented himself to me in the beginning, before I got really invested in him. I’m super sad actually. ☹️
