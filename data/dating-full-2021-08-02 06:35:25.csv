After first week or so of this relationship she received notification from Tinder which bothered me a little that she is still using it, but I thougt that maybe she just got matched with someone. Few weeks later we were cuddling on the couch and another notification came. She said „oh, someone replied to me” and seemed happy about it. I asked and she consfessed that she is still talking to other people. Soo my question is - I am wrong to not feel comfortable with this? We are not couple yet but in my opinion it looks like she is looking further to find some better match than me. She claims that those are just conversations and she is not willing to date anyone beside me.

This will be a long post so bare with me !!!

Just to get straight to the point - it has been almost two years since me and my boyfriend began dating the first time, and while we did break things off for about three months, we rekindled our relationship about two weeks ago. I am 18 years old and he is 17, and while age usually doesn't matter in this context - I just want to express that emotionally I feel I have went through so much more than him in many ways since the breakup. Not to discredit him AT ALL. Because pain shaming here is everything wrong. (But you know just things like handling a miscarriage alone and finding out you're really from another birth father than you believed for 18 years of your life 😭 oh and finding out you have a half sister and a billion cousins ! The usual sighs)

To be frank his reason for breaking up with me is because ""I wasn't confident enough"" and he felt the only way to fix that was to break up with me because his parents also had such an opinion about me (don't even get me started) - let's say after three months of refinding myself...I truly feel like a different woman through my experiences. 

During our stage of talking things over he was very evident of his regrets. He missed me and expressed how there truly wasn't anyone like me, and I agreed to giving this another go and I knew there would be spots that need serious mending, spots that we both were very excited to revisit and spots we could create. This is our second shot and I told him from the get-go that handling everything maturely is the ONLY way to go. No bottling things up anymore. No caring of parents' opinions. It was time to finally enact on what we want while being on board of each other's thoughts and affections.

Fast forward to a few hours ago. We were on FaceTime and had our first teeny tiny qualm I got just a little stuck on. I expressed how ""I don't expect much"" now, but would still be absolutely ecstatic at the thought of him doing the entire ""if he wanted to, he would"" kick. Maybe I was a bit upset seeing my other friends' SO's so proud of them all the time and constantly posting about the small things. Maybe I did expect too much as a little recognition for pulling through and meeting my shitbag birth father's family this weekend and being strong. Which is where the question comes in.

I don't want him to be detached, but I know I need to give him time yet at once it was kind of painful to hear ""you should be realistic""...because maybe I just have so much faith in him. Not that I give up on the vision, I know he can do it, he's just so alienated from expressing with his emotions. 

I know it's only been two weeks but...is it bad to say that in a relationship? That you don't expect much from your partner no matter the context and no matter the length of time?

I'll put a bullet point on where the ""question"" of this post starts. 

Last night I (23M) went out to a bar with my friends for one of their birthdays just looking to hang and chill out and drink. After that, we moved to another bar where it was a bit crowded so I had to walk past a few people to get to the bartender. On they way there, this girl (22F) pokes me and asks if I had a lighter. She was with her friend who I assumed was her bf. I say no and just say good luck in a playful way and went about my business. She was cute but I didn't think much about it. Later on, she walks by me again and grabs me away from my friends to talk to me. 
She told me ""hey I asked you for a light honestly because I just wanted to talk to you. I think you're really cute."" So obviously, I'm not stupid so I bite. I asked if she was single because I saw her with someone. She said that's the other guy was just a childhood friend. Great. Greenlight. I told her I thought she was cute too and we talked about stuff like what we were doing that night and where we work. 
The entire time, the music is absolutely blaring. So if we wanted to talk to each other, we had to get real close and almost yell in each others ears. She was real close and kept open posture, asked me questions, grazed her self on my arm deliberately. Obviously it's going great. Unfortunately, before I could really use to change venues to somewhere quieter my friends decided to move to the next bar. So I told her I had to go so I followed her on IG and got her phone number. She told me ""text me"" and left that bar. 

- Later on that night, about 3 hours later she texts me back. Here is the convo. I wake up next morning and text her to make plans. I've made the mistake in the past of spending too much time texting so I decided to go with the direct approach. I let her know I was interested and wanted to meet up later this week. Here's the problem though. https://imgur.com/a/WBDif0v
- I have also been rejected a few times with the classic ""maybe / I gotta check my schedule / I have see / I'll let you know"". So I'm weary about any real potential this might lead to. But at the same time, she seemed receptive and she originally approached me at the bar. 
- So I guess I wanted to know if I did all that I could last night and via text. Is there anything else I should do? The way I see it, the ball is in her court. She'll get back to me if she wants to.

And 23M

Basically I’ve been dating my bf 8 months (most LDR until I officially moved near him) he and I have gotten to know one another well enough considering most has been long distance but I’ve been having issues lately. See I know relatively he hasn’t dated too much and all I know is that one or maybe the only girl he dated cheated on him. The other day I wanted to play a questions game and get to know more but as soon as I asked “when was your first kiss?” He shut down completely and then said “I don’t want to talk about Jenna*** fake name*** 

See now I’m more curious because I want to know what happened that may have made him more hesitant with being open about his feelings. I already see the signs in our relationship where I’m more open and he isn’t. Main reason I wanted to know more was because I wanted to see if he’d trust me enough to tell me about it. I have been wanting to tell him about my abusive ex and some stuff that occurred relating to sexual assault in the past because I don’t want to hide it from him because I want him to know my boundaries. But I felt as if he couldn’t open up to me I didn’t feel I could open up to him . 
I typically stay away from the exes conversation but I. Wanted to ask him because my last relation I found out my ex was still in contact with his ex and her family and it crushed me . I’d rather know ahead of time his own boundaries and who he still keeps in contact with so I know also for myself if I can handle that too . I see he still has her on his Facebook but doesn’t seem to like anything of hers but still it hurts that he can get so closed off about a personal stuff.  
I know I shouldn’t pry but after all I’ve gone through I’m scared to end up in another situation of dating someone who isn’t able to be open with me or isn’t honest with me .",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,932802,public,self,Bf doesn’t open up much about his past dating experiences… am I being unfair for wanting to know a bit about it?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow9p06/bf_doesnt_open_up_much_about_his_past_dating/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

There's this girl that I follow on IG, and holy shit man. Not only is she hot, has a very similar style to mine, we share the same hobbies, interests and appear to have very similar personalities. The thing is, I've never talked to her before in my life, and we don't know each other

I keep thinking about DMing her but I'm so afraid of saying the wrong thing or coming across as creepy or weird. I do think she's attractive but that is not why I'm interested, and I can't figure out a way to properly convey that, which leads to me over thinking about what I should say to her

It's just so weird because this never happens to me. I usually manage to keep my cool and stay grounded when I don't know a girl, because, well, I don't know her, but I really really want this one to go well. Which, of course, makes it harder to go well because it's going to come across as desperate

I don't know what to do, here. I think I should shoot my shot but I can already tell I'll be extremely disappointed if it doesn't work out. I'm not the most attractive guy, I know that, so that doesn't help. She doesn't have a lot of IG followers (like 700) and her profile is private, so I'm hoping she doesn't get constant DMs from thirsty guys

So, I guess my questions here are: how should I approach this? What are some ways for me to take this one easier and not be so anxious? If you're a girl, what would be the best case scenario here?

The hobbies and interests we share have mostly to do with movies and music. We have incredibly similar tastes and philosophies.

One of the most romantic things a guy did for me (on our first date no less) - I couldn't go to dinner as my dog was sick so he said he'd come to me, 45min drive, showed up with an ice cream and popcorn because I'd told him that I loved dipping my ice cream cone in popcorn at the movies.

Then when I said ""oh I didn't know they sold these ice creams at supermarkets, good to know!!"" he said ""they don't, I might have stopped by a cinema on my way over""... I was so touched. It didn't work out in the end, but this memory stayed with me.☺

There was also more than one situation where an ex gf would go back to her ex, or would soon hook up with the guy “she told me not to worry about”, after our breakup. Which also looks shady, so I don’t rule those out (even though they seemed very trustworthy people).

I have also witnessed a lot of cheating stories in my multiple friends’ circles, heck, even in my family.

I am currently happy being single, but not sure what I will do in the future or how will I ever overpass this. And tbh not sure if I want to get past this. My spidey senses and trust issues always saved me from wasting time with cheaters.

Venting time....

This girl i'd known for a year; we got on really well super similar tastes in pretty much everything and we could talk for literally hours about anything and everything; we'd been good friends until about 3 months ago when I decided to ask her out on a date.

Anywho, we dated for 2 months - she wasn't sure at the first date about labels and didn't want to label it and wanted to take things super slow; fast forward a fortnight and we're ""Exclusively seeing each other"", I probably should have red-flagged this there and then. idk. I ended up meeting her parents about 4 weeks into us dating, I asked her if she thought that was a little quick but she said it felt right and didnt feel strange; we met my parents about 2 weeks later as well. I've met a lot of her friends and she's met mine too; we were even talking about holidays in a few months time; each time i've checked in with her that things weren't moving too quick for her.

Fast foward to 8 weeks in and she's taken a week off to travel across the country to see friends and family; it seemed like something was up within the second day of us messaging that week because her replies were short and closed-ended. I figured it might be because she's super busy with stuff and maybe that was why; this was like this for the whole week until she came over to see me that weekend and things are great; she apologised for being terrible at texting and stuff it was just because she was busy. The following Monday we talk a little most of the day and then she says ""can we call?"" she tells me that i'm a really great guy but she isn't ready to DATE or a relationship right now and she doesnt want to let this go on any longer because it'd be more difficult to break it off.

Reddit, pls - how does someone date for 2 months, meet each others parents, plan holidays later on in the year and then suddenly decide they dont want to DATE? like I know the whole ""im not ready for a relationship"" but surely not the dating side of things?

I dont know, i'm confused. There isn't anyone else, apparently, and I dont think there would be. I dont feel like i've had closure but I also don't know if there is anything else to add to it. I'm coming to terms with it weeks later but part of me is asking myself if I should wait and see if she is going to be ready to date; but I know thats a really stupid idea.

We'd message every day and talk everyday and like, none of that is really the same anymore; we talk a little bit but she doesnt really message to check in or anything like that or just to tell me how her day has gone, I miss that.

We met when I wasn’t looking for love. He perused me fast, we were talking and hangout constantly. He spent thousands on me at nice restaurants, occasional gifts. He was helpful when I needed help with things big or small. We became exclusive pretty fast. He told me he loved me pretty fast and would usually tell me every day. 

Here’s the downside, he has baggage. Going through a divorce. Raised her kid and is a great stepdad which I found attractive that a man stepped up to that plate when he was only in his 20s. As the divorce isn’t finalised our relationship had to be kept somewhat a secret. It would hurt his daughter and his wife could get nasty in the divorce. His close friends knew about me but not his family. It wasn’t ideal, hurt a lot sometimes and I wondered when I’ll finally get to be fully apart of his life. 

The second red flag is he often goes through depressive episodes. There’s a lot of drama with his baby mama and a kid going through difficulties. When he gets depressed he shuts off from the entire world. It has happened a couple times but only lasted around 3 days and he came clean later on and explained why. I forgave him and asked for better communication. 

The next time it happened was worse. I noticed I was the only one initiating contact. He went 3 days without even a “how are you”. He knows I don’t have many friends in this new city I’m in and we were in lockdown. Another 3 days went by where no messages. He would still reply or pick up the phone. But I was left constantly questioning. Feeling needy and unsure if I’d done something wrong. 

Finally I called him and we talked it out. He said I’d done nothing wrong. He loves me and doesn’t want to keep hurting me. He knows these periods will happen again and it’s unfair to me. He knows I’ve been loving and supporting and deserve someone who can give me more. I was devastated. He said he wants to still be in my life. And he will always be there when I need help and would like to be “friends”. We’ve never been friends. I was ready to give him my whole heart and was patient and understanding he had these baggage from the start. He raised the bar for relationships. Giving me all I wanted just not quite the full deal. it’s just these episodes have been a pattern in his life. His ex wife went through it and tried to get back with him numerous times but he was with me now and didn’t want that life again. 

I’ve gone no contact for the past 5 days. He was texting every day. Not apologies, just chit chat or trying to get attention. Asking if I want my toothbrush and some other shit I don’t care about. Another saying he at least deserves an explanation (as I said I don’t know if I could ever be friends). The last text was obviously trying to bait me to get a reaction but I stayed strong and didn’t reply. He’s stopped with the messages but honestly I want him back still. We saw eachother as we live in the same building today. I avoided contact and left. 


I’m figuring out a message to send. I’m not going to send a lengthy paragraph even though I have a lot to say. I’ve been out living my life and staying active. I don’t want him to think I’m desperate and miserable. Should I keep ghosting ? Let him chase? Keep in rare contact to keep the peace as we will bump into eachother inevitably. I’m tired of thinking about this man. It’s been not even a week and he thinks he can just still be in my life or deserves an answer now. I can’t be expected to know what I want just yet.

The situation gets more complicated when we talk about actually going on dates. As a guy especially, but of course even others, there’s a pressure to setup an actual date relatively early in talking. First off to show confidence, but also because there is a risk of being ghosted if a move isn’t made. 

So my discussion topic is: is it ok to setup multiple meetings with different people around the same time? If so, is there an etiquette to disclosing that information? 

I throw this question out here not to look for an answer, because there is no right answer, but to see what people think. My natural inclination is to not do that, and if I did to disclose the situation. My issues with that are any other possible people I was talking to are likely missed opportunities and what if the one date goes bad? And if I disclose that I’m seeing others until when/if I commit to someone the date will be against that and back out themselves.

Dating has been taking a real negative toll on my mental health. I’ve been dating for a number of years and something always happens for it to end. Either we go on one date and there’s no connection or go on 3 and then suddenly stop. Either they ghost me or tell me they don’t want to see me anymore. when this happens I always internalize it to try and understand why. Is it because of how I kissed her, is it because of something I said, is it because she doesn’t like my body? 

I can’t take this rejection anymore. I feel like I can’t make any sort of mistake. I can’t be nervous, I have to kiss perfectly, I can’t fumble on my words, we have to have great sex the first time we get together. If I don’t do any of these well then I don’t get another chance, even if we have a lot in common and could potentially be great together. This is not fair, I am not so unforgiving to people, I give them a chance, I understand someone might be nervous on a date, it doesn’t mean they are going to be nervous every time we meet. I just want someone to give me a chance.

I understand that this internalization isn’t healthy, but I can’t help but do it. I mean why would someone stop dating me if it’s not something to do with me.

As you can see I’m really upset, I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m 36, and I just want to meet someone and settle down, why is this so hard?

As for the third date, it went  ok. Again we had a great time, but after it was over her communication has become scarce (we had 2 brief exchanges in the last 6 days). I don't want to overthink it (maybe she is busy) but could it also be a sign of her loosing interest ? Maybe she was expecting things to progress more on a third date ? I dont know

Turned out we live in the same general area and have some common interests! We soon started talking and had plans to hang out in person, but covid ruined those for a few months with the fall/winter case surge and we kind of fell out of talking one on one (though we have been communicating in group chats nearly daily since meeting).

A little over a month ago he reached out noting that we never got to hang out, so we finally did and it was so fun and felt so natural! We hung out a 2nd time a few weeks later and a 3rd time at a concert we both attended, and we seem to get flirtier each time we hang out (saying I look really nice, teasing the heck out of me, saying he can’t wait til next time, etc.) We also have several future plans already set for the next 2 months. Overall things seem to be progressing naturally and I’ve definitely started crushing on him. 

However I have 2 little concerns: 

1. We don’t text often like we used to. I know texting isn’t the end all be all, and I myself am a terrible texter, but it’s odd to me that we texted daily initially when we weren’t hanging out, but now that we are it’s actually kind of rare (not including group chats). 

2. He has cancelled plans on me the day off twice. They have seemed like legit reasons and he always works hard to reschedule, but I got a bit aggravated this 2nd time as we both have very busy schedules so this meant postponing for 2 weeks. Giving him the benefit of the doubt I have witnessed him cancel other plans not including me spur of the moment as well, but my idiot crush brain can’t help but overthink. 

It’s too early to have established if we are “seeing each other” vs just kind of growing our existing friendship, so I know he doesn’t owe me anything. But does this seem like behavior of someone who is interested, or does it seem like he sees this as more casual/platonic hence the casual cancelling etc. Nothing physical has happened so I don’t think I’m being used for that. I genuinely haven’t had a potential relationship with a natural progression like this in almost a decade so I apologize for my complete helplessness!

I'll also mention that I typically don't feel comfortable making first moves with women unless the women sends really obvious signals or just straight up tells me to make a move, and this stems from both a lack of experience and my confidence in expressing intimacy being shattered by my ex.

So this question stems from an experience I had at a club after finally feeling confident enough in my 
Appearance to go. Essentially two girls came up to my mate and I and started dancing near us, with one of them going on to quickly make out with my mate. The other girl was getting very close to me at this point and after putting her body on me I put a hand near her waist. We all stopped to go grab drinks and during this time she told my mate that she wanted to hook up with me, and obvs my mate went and told me this. So we went back to the dance floor and she started dancing on me again, however after 5-10 minutes she excused herself along with her friend and my mate told me that I completely blew it with her.

So my question to the guys would be that in this scenario, how would you go from dancing with her back to you, to spinning her around and kissing her? And a question for the girls, would you be comfortable with a guy spinning you around to kiss or just make eye contact with you even if you've expressed interest in them, or would you rather make the first move or have them ask first?

Note. Even though I blew it this experience really boosted my self confidence as sad as that may sound. I also don't go to clubs with the sole purpose of hooking up with people but rather to dance and vibe with other people, so this was a new experience to me.

Honestly it was one of the best encounters I have had with another human being in a very long time and it borderline scares me since I always have a lot of walls up and I feel that this is too good to be true. 

I was in a long term relationship (3 years) that fell apart really badly because I found out that the person whom I thought was going to spend the rest of my life at the time was cheating on me and it really broke me. I really thought he was my all, and we never really had any issues with our relationship so it was a huge shock when I found out how much things he hid away from me. Since then I’ve been healing and focusing on myself while doing things I’ve always enjoyed. 

As a person even in the past, I tried to stray away from being in relationships because I was always a very private and singular. I felt that it was easier to have NSA hookups and continue living life but lately I feel that it’s been too repetitive or just almost soulless. I always had the notion that it was better to be alone and just feel lonely, rather than open up and be hurt by someone you truly care about. I also have a lot of anxiety (I hate to admit this because I try to portray myself as a very care-free person) and this stems a lot due to the fact that I moved around a lot internationally as a kid and having been cheated on the only two serious relationships I have had.

Now I didn’t know what to expect when first talking to this guy, but it felt really natural especially considering that this was from a dating app. We kept talking and eventually moved to regular texts and next thing I know we were almost talking nonstop daily. Both him and I were traveling during the time, so when i finally came back, we met up almost instantly. 

I think this was one of the most nervous dates I ever had and unfortunately I sweat a LOT when I am nervous. We decided to meet up at a jazz bar, and I was a complete mess. Just disheveled and lost in what to do, I’m not even sure how I spoke especially because English is my second language. When I also saw him, I really felt that he was super cute and super out of my league. I gained almost 20 kg during the pandemic and although I try not to let it get to me, it has been difficult trying to maintain my self esteem. But despite all this mess, we had a really good time. Of course to try to calm my nerves, I drank a bit and so did he but the conversations really flowed and we ended up hanging out not just that entire night, but all of the next day too. We slept and woke up together and just had a lot of fun having a very spontaneous day while walking together for hours, talking, as he held my hand. 

I’m also just super flabbergasted because while talking he admitted to me how nervous HE was in meeting me. He also informed me how he told all his friends about me and honestly for someone who is almost dead on the inside on a day to day basis, I’m just feeling too many emotions of just joy and panic because this has been a lot of great things in a short span of time and I’m still taking the time to process through it all. I still got butterflies and have been trying to regain function as a human being. 

Despite all this, I’m also feeling super scared because I have a lot of trust issues but am willing to take my chances again and hope for the best.

He said that when I go back to college, the first day of class pick and seat next to any girl and just talk to her. Then at the end of class invite her to go to the dining facility with me.

This to me seems like a horrible idea. I know she’ll probably be creeped out by some random guy, she’ll be even more creeped out when I start trying to talk to her, and she’ll probably pepper spray me if I even think about asking her to go somewhere with me. I’ll be labeled as a creep and I’ll end up a social outcast.

Of course my brother told me I was overreacting. I’d like to be able to take what he’s saying seriously, but he’s just built different. He’s a good looking guy who’s 6’1 and is in great shape. I’m average to below, 5’9, and in okay shape. We just live in different worlds.

Last two months things have been very bad for me emotionally. I cry everyday thinking of all the good memories I had and I just want my best friend back. We were really good friends and the level of bonding I had with her, I don't have that with anyone else. We used to share best things with each other first and now I really don't have anyone to go to. In May I had received a job offer and I was fucking elated, she was the first person I told this to and that was the last time I was sky high happy. Next week I take up a new job and I have absolutely no excitement. It's a very lucrative offer and still I find no joy in it. I am empty inside and I just find myself missing her really badly. I tried to talk to her and really broke down while mentioning how badly I miss her. She told me I was behaving like a desperate and she needs time and space. It really kills me that I no longer have my best friend with me anymore and I feel like a fucking loser. I have no one to talk to. My family members are beginning to worry about me because my depression is visible on my face. I haven't told anyone about the situation i'm facing.

Even as a small child strangers would stop my parents to tell them how beautiful I was. My parents, both ex runway models, loved having a beautiful tall daughter. It was expected that I’d be a model from the moment my parents found out I was in 100% percentile for height when I was a baby. 
My appearance has always forced me to be social. On top of daily random complements from strangers. In school, often boys wanted to be boyfriend and girls wanted to be my best friend. Making friends was no problem, dating was easy and being lonely was something I didn’t even know existed. I played every girls varsity sport in high school, I competed in dance for my entire childhood, I was taught to love all the attention. 
Right after high school I started a full blown party girl phase. I went to over 100 music festivals from age 18-20. I slept with who I wanted, I partied as hard as I wanted, and I worked every bit of my genes by always looking my best. I had beautiful dyed blonde hair, perfect nails, perfect make up and I was a gym addict with a full 6 pack. I looked like a Barbie. 
But then when I was about 21, it finally hit me… I hated all this attention! I hated being treated like an object. I hated being a pretty girl so I stopped coloring my hair, threw away all my make up, moved to the mountains and now live a life of complete solitude. I live alone, 20 miles from the nearest small mountain town, 4 hour drive from the nearest actual city. I’m single and go weeks without talking to people. I haven’t touched another person in a long time. Honestly, I’m still naturally beautiful and still get stopped in my tracks anytime I go in public. I’m 6ft, 130lbs, tan, toned and healthy. I still constantly get compliments and asked if I’m a model. I spend all my free time hiking, running, skiing, yoga and strength training. Even though I don’t brush my hair, paint my nails or wear make up, I still get treated like a trophy when I go to town so I try to avoid having to run errands as much as possible. Literally being beautiful has ruined me socially. I spend all my time alone, I have no friends and chose not to date. 
When I try to date, I have so many options I don’t know who to chose to go on a date with and going on a ton of dates to try to find the right guy is too exhausting and anxiety producing. I have never been on a first date where the guy doesn’t ask for a 2nd date. Finding guys to date isn’t hard but I really want to find the right guy for me and finding the right guy out of all the guys is too hard.

I've been talking to a guy on tinder for about a week or so.

This guy is a former model, he sings and plays instruments, and is very attractive. He's told me that the reason the dates I went on in the past didn't work out is because they weren't as smart as me, and that he is and he might be my perfect match. He told me that I was very attractive and that he wanted to do a lot of dirty things to me. I told him that I don't have sex with people that I'm not in a relationship with, and he said that it sounded like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that he should, because he knows that he likes me, and was obsessed with me and falling for me, and that he could see himself spending his life with me. I said that I did want to have sex with him, but it was too soon for me to, not knowing him that well.

We went on a date and it went well. We had lunch and then we went for a walk on a nature trail. He sat me down on a log and we made out for a bit, and he put my hands down his pants on his ass. He asked if I wanted to go further and I said I didn't. He dropped me off at home and we kept texting each other afterwards.

He told me that he wanted to have sex with me and cum in me on the second date, and that if it was good that we'd be boyfriends. I told him that I didn't feel comfortable having sex with someone that I didn't know that well. He said it was fine and that we didn't have to have sex on the second date, but that it would delay us being in a relationship. I also didn't like the fact that we would have to have sex in his car because of neither of us have our own place. He told me before that we could have sex at his house because he's had his ex stay at his house with his family before and it was fine, but his family unexpectedly had to move while we were talking.

I am pretty much experiencing those same feelings that were expressed in the Paramore song, “Misery Business” or Taylor Swift’s “You Belong With Me” and “Better Than Revenge”. I know that might be ridiculous for a 25 year old woman to feel but I guess it comes from deep rooted insecurities from childhood abuse (which I am getting therapy for) and just having overall shitty luck in the dating department. I mean, let’s face it…..90% of the time, people reject people because they believe that they can do better than the person who asked them out (there are exceptions like differing sexual orientations or if you already liked the person but know the timing isn’t right for whatever reason but you get the point). And knowing that…..it only adds to the already established insecurities….especially when the other person thinks they did find better. So, i guess it kind of helps me to imagine that his partner is the worst person imaginable in order to feel better about myself and I guess build up false hope that he’ll eventually leave them and then come running to me. After all, why shouldn’t we be together? I have known him longer, which means that have we shared more secrets, created more memories, and we even share similar traumas.

I just wanted a place to vent about something that happened to me recently. Figured it might help to just let it all out haha.

I'll try to provide some context first.  There was this girl that was a friend of a friend who I met through playing games with.  We got to talking randomly one time and ended up messaging back and forth pretty much every day for around 4 months.  It's important to note that we live in different parts of the country.  She had mentioned to me that she was going to be in town pretty close to where I lived and that she would like to meet up if I was comfortable with it.  I said of course!  We planned to hang out for one of the days she was here and grab dinner at the end.  Unfortunately, as the day got closer, I actually was offered a new job offer that I couldn't pass up which required me to move a couple hours away, so I told her I wouldn't be living in the area anymore.  This girl is super nice and we have a lot in common, and I was super bummed so I decided to just shoot my shot and see how things work out.  I asked if she would be interested in a remote/virtual dinner date where we make dinner together and just hang out via video call.  She said she would like to do that, and I was super happy!  As the day got closer I wanted to just verify everything and told her I was super excited for our date coming up and she replied back that she was super excited as well with heart emojis and everything.

When the date actually happened, it went really well! We had a good time talking back and forth while making dinner and everything, and the date lasted around 4 hours.  I was actually the one to end it as I had to get ready to pack up all my stuff and move the following day so I took it as a good sign that things went well. I asked for her number for setting up something for another day and she gave it to me. I thought wow things are actually looking like they'll work out!

The next day I texted her saying I had a great time and that we should setup another date once I'm moved in to my new location and everything.  She said she had a great time too but then asked if I had intended these as romantic dates or platonic dates. I was stunned and crushed at the same time... It basically died out from there with her saying she wouldn't be interested in a long distance type thing, but that she would still like to go on virtual platonic dates (???).

So to end this I wanted to say I totally understand not wanting to do long distance.  The part that really crushed me was that everything seemed so clear to me that this was looked upon as a romantic-type date and I guess she didn't see it that way (really unsure how still).  

But yeah I just needed to vent. I don't have too much experience dating (had a girlfriend for a couple years in high school but that's it), but it seemed like I did everything I could to make it clear that it wasn't just a platonic-friend type thing.

He was my schoolmate from high school (middle school). He was a freshman and I was a junior when he first saw me. He is a cousin of my classmate. I didn't know that he likes me from the very beginning, he said that he was stalking me every after class.

Fast forward. I entered college. My major is teacher for high school. I went back in my alma matter to have my practice teaching. He became part of the class I was observing. I only stayed in their class for weeks. After my observation in their class I received a message from him. We exchanged messages for years but I'm just being nice to him because he was my student. Although he have confessed his feelings for me, I acknowledged his feelings for me but I told him to finish his schooling first before pursuing me.

Fast forward. I graduated from college and went to other city to pursue my career and became a teacher. It's been 4 years since I last saw him. He still keeps on messaging me and he's now a college student, everytime he message me he ask my help with his academic stuffs and ofcourse acting as my lover. Sometimes I don't entertain his messages due to being busy at work.

I deleted lots of my social medias and created a new one. I added him just to have social media friends. He's now a grown guy and I'm now adult working woman. Again, he confessed his long time feelings for me and I know to myself that I like him too however I always consider our age gap and disposition in life wherein he's still a student and I'm now working. I tried to open myself to him but I realized that it's not a good idea. He's far from me and there are things that he can't understand about my life because we are not having same problems facing in life.

So I decided again to turn him down. I felt bad but he said that he understands me and he will try to pursue me again once he graduated and already working and if i'm still single. I told him that he should just pursue other girls same as his age and also a student like him. When I told that, I felt bad but I think that would be the best for him.

We've been asking alot of questions about each other and learning alot when we see each other and he has excitedly wanted to tell me all about his current career goals. Our second date lead to sex that night which was so good and he stayed over afterwards. 

I'm also still not 100% sure where his head is at in terms of if he wants just sex or seeing where this is going. He has been very interested in getting to know me more by asking questions about my life, family, past experiences with school and growing up.

On our second date he mentioned people he knows that are in open relationships and told me that he doesn't think that's for him and he only really wants monogomy.

Last night we had our third date and went for a few drinks. I thought it went really well, he was giving prolonged eye contact quite a bit when I talked, as well as him staring at me when he thought I wasn't looking, convo was great and we laughed a lot, he also paid for my drinks when we were leaving but he didn't kiss me at the end of the date. He said he will text me in the next day or two when we said goodbye.

 I'm having a hard time understanding if we are casually dating and seeing where this goes or if we are FWB?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,933527,public,self,Casual Dating or FWB?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owjoye/casual_dating_or_fwb/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

i should be happy now right? because he used to make me miserable. but ALL I CAN THINK OF IS THE GOOD PARTS. every single day i remember the beginning of our relationship and i literally have to force myself to remember the bad parts. how do i fix this",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,933531,public,self,good memories vs bad,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owjptv/good_memories_vs_bad/,all_ads,6,,,,,,
