Potential to meet great girls but a lot of flakiness and it makes the process exhausting. I’m 28, been in one short relationship since high school, and I’ll admit, I feel almost officially miserable.

2,r65oma,1638330746,Should I text him again or just let him reach out/let it die?,"I went on a really good date on Saturday night, it ended with kissing and I didn't let it escalate. He was extremely turned on but still ultimately respectful despite pushing for more physical closeness at the end. I knew this guy was worried about relocating (as he has plans to move early next year) and was convinced he couldn't do anything serious, but then would flip flop in conversation and say he might end up staying longer or would date someone he really likes. Point is, I'm not delusional - I know he's not in a phase of being totally open and I'm not deluding myself into thinking this would be something serious.

That said, I really enjoyed the date. He mentioned being open to doing stuff together with sex off the table if I preferred that. I decided sure, why not. I'm attracted to him and we're actually really compatible, but if he's in a different life stage, I can't change that. Might as well hang out with someone who makes me laugh and is fun to be around. We might kiss a bit, we might not, who knows. I normally don't open myself to these types of situations but was open to it this time.

So he said himself, that night, that he'd want to see me more. He even asks me to text him when I get home, which I do. He paid for the entire (very expensive) date despite me insisting/trying to insist I pay my share (I insisted 3x and he wouldn't take me up on it). He even paid for my uber home. I think about it and text him the next night and say I'm interested in seeing him again but obviously I'm looking for something more serious, so I'm implying this means we can do stuff just not date with sex on the table. I gave him my number. It's now Tuesday evening and he hasn't reached out. I'm pretty surprised... he asked me for my number before the date and I wanted to wait until after we met, and from all objective accounts, it was a fun night (he said so himself) and he seemed interested in hanging out.

So this isn't a conventional dating thing, but... what gives? I'm slowly letting it go but wondering if it makes sense to text him once tomorrow, or to just let him reach out (if he ever does) or if I should just unmatch him.

8,r6671b,1638332429,Do I Swipe Left on a Co-Worker?,"Need advice here.

The context is: Hinge (so pls be familiar). 
It’s a complex scenario that I feel I need to play correctly, since the stakes aren’t exactly super low.

I freelance, so this person isn’t someone I *need* to see on a regular basis. She hires me to work, and we work together when I do. Usually once a year/every two years, for a few months at a time.

I’m fairly new to Hinge. She keeps popping up in my feed, and every time I close my app. Why? Because if I swipe her right, it’s showing my hand. It *will* be awkward if I show interest and she doesn’t reciprocate. It’s happened to me in the other direction. Not like I judge the person, it just makes direct interaction a bit awkward and strange. In the reverse context, I’m also aware of the way women are sexualized in the workplace. I’d hate to contribute to that feeling on her part. 

And yes- she is the type of person who might be weirded out by a co-worker showing romantic interest. I’m confident it could hurt my ability to be hired at her company again, anytime soon that is.

The question is this: does it mean that she is also avoiding a swipe/decision, if she keeps popping up for me? As in- is that a sign that she’s waiting for my move? Or could she have 1) not seen me yet or 2) said ‘no’ and she is still appearing in my rotation. 

For the record, we get along really well and there is def attraction on my end (though I’m not sure how much I’m her ‘type’). We connect on a few levels and I get a faint feeling that she is interest but perhaps unsure.

Any thoughtful responses would be greatly appreciated. This has been weighing on me.

20,r66xrz,1638334970,24M Went on my first date ever!,"I’ve tried online dating since I was 18 and never landed a date, I usually got about one or two likes from a bot or so and after a week called it quits. That and I’ve always been rejected in person. My last OLD attempt was in 2019. 

However, my friend’s success with hinge convinced me to give it a try again. Despite putting tons of time and effort every time I make a profile, this time it actually worked. I match with three girls my first week, one ghosted me, and I set up a date with two of them (both 21). One of them canceled on me twice because she was sick, she apologized and said she wasn’t trying to ghost me. She was the one I really wanted to meet too because we had a great conversation. I asked her again after a couple days but radio silence. The other one I think was really excited to meet me, but I was iffy because her profile wasn’t very good, and I was just so much interested in the other girl.

I’ve never been on a date so I have no idea what I’m doing, that means I’ve never planned dates before and I’m finding it difficult, especially with winter because I’m only limited to indoors. I ended up going with the third girl who I was iffy on, she didn’t have a car so I couldn’t meet her far from campus and had to plan everything within walking distance. I was also really stupid and got a haircut three days after my profile went live so I warned her that I might be a catfish. 

We went to an indie coffee shop last night near her university. I was really nervous. I didn’t even know how to dress (and she realized because I didn’t bring a coat), this is my second winter (from Florida). I called my friend 15 minutes before the date, he told me to take a shot lol (I should have).

I got there ahead of time and scoped the place out. There were two rooms, a bar/lounge which was a little crowded but quite enough to where you could hold a conversation, and a study room which was at about half capacity and silent. 

I waited outside for her and expected her to look okay-ish like her photos (I was on the fence about her looks) but no… She looked way better in person! She was tall, petite, and beautiful, she could have been a model! But I never complimented her!!! First mistake. We walked in together and I realized she was taller than me, which I knew ahead of time, but it hit different in person (I never brought it up be she did later). Just meeting a stranger online was nerve racking, but she was taller, gorgeous, and I have no experience with girls or dating. Plus, I’m not familiar with bars or the environment I was in since I hardly drink. Overall, it was an intimidating situation for me.

I froze when the barista asked who was paying and then I didn’t tip him as I was telling myself “tip him, why aren’t you tipping him.” I should have tipped him, I would have tipped him, but I didn’t. Also, aside from our initial meeting, the whole time we were standing she didn’t make eye contact with me. I was looking at her, I think she was nervous or I was a catfish.

Once we got our drinks, I was eyeing two barstools in the corner of the lounge room but she went ahead and sat down in the study room since it was more vacant. We were the only ones talking in there, knowing there were half a dozen other people in there didn’t help my anxiety. When we sat down she finally made eye contact again. She first off said she really liked the place and she would come back there and study which was good on me, but can I use this place for other dates now? What if I see her on another date?

She had her hands on the table and I put mine below. Once I realized this, I brought them up again, but they just kept drifting back down. She also had a lot of question’s and I was drawing blanks as what to ask her. I told her this, but still couldn’t think of much. She had some cute mannerisms and aside from asking about work, school, where she’s from, I asked her a couple generic questions like music, hobbies, and movies (her profile was all selfies and one body photo). Meanwhile she was asking me about stuff I had on mine and I felt self-centered mostly only talking about myself, because I didn’t know what to ask her or how to express interest! This whole time we were the only ones talking in the room. We spoke for about an hour and a half because she had somewhere to be. 

Fortunately, she lived a block away from where I parked. We walked to the parking garage where we said goodbye (I wanted to walk her home, but not to her house on a first date so this was good except that I never touched her), I mentioned dancing later that week, but nothing was actually set up. 

I also never complimented her! When I got home, I texted and thanked her for the evening. I told her that I was really nervous and that I forgot to mention how pretty she was, and that she looked way better than her photos.

Overall, I think it went pretty bad on my part. I’m just not comfortable being around women like this, but I want to be. I have no experience. I didn’t know what to say, what to do. I’m just completely platonic. How is a first date from online supposed to go?

I have a second date with her later this week. Since she’s expressed interest in my dancing, I offered to take her to a dance class I’m a regular at (so I’ll be in a more comfortable environment, but around people I know and it’s a small class) and to get some food after. She said yes to the dancing but couldn’t do the food because she has somewhere to be at 8:30 P.M. again. I’m going to ask if she’d like to go to another coffee shop before then dance class. Am I doing this right? How do I not fuck this up?

Tldr; Have no experience with girls or dating and went on my first date ever thanks to OLD. Was really nervous. Didn’t tip, didn’t compliment her, didn’t ask many questions, had my hands under the table, never touched her. Yes, I did hold the door. I know better than this! I’m full of regret and embarrassment.

So far we’ve been on two dates; the first was just meeting for drinks and then bar hopping and the second we went to a popular lounge in the area and then we went out with his friends. We’d spent a few weeks apart because our schedules were busy with the holidays but he said we’d do something fun this weekend and kepttt asking what my plans were for the weekend. Well as we’re planning out the weekend, he basically admits to having plans with his friends Friday night (a birthday dinner), and then Saturday night he has dinner with his roommate who’s “going through something,” even though he also mentioned he’s spending the day with that roommate doing a cool activity in our city (that same roommate is also invited to the Friday dinner). He suggested that we hangout afterwards unless his roommate was cool with him cancelling dinner. I kind of butted against the idea only because I didn’t want it to be a “Netflix and chill” thing for date #3 or going out to drink again. So he said we could “get dinner/drinks and then stay in.” To me this feels like a red flag because I feel like he only sees “going out” and “staying in” as dates, and “going out” has almost always lead to him trying to stay over/get me to stay over. I have no problem doing that when I feel the time is right but it just doesn’t feel right for me yet. 

We’ve yet to do a daytime activity or any activity like the one he mentioned doing with his roommate (note that we live in the most populated city in the US so there’s a lot to do…especially around the holidays) but somehow it seems that he’s able to do these things with his friends. He goes out most weekends because his job is intense during the week, and I like a good time out as well, but not for three dates in a row. I can tell that his life heavily revolves around his friends and he’s mentioned having troubles with relationships in the past because he always prioritizes friendships. For me the bigger issue is that I like more activity oriented dates, a dinner date (which could be this weekend so I won’t put it past him), daytime dates, etc. Just a little more variety. We always mention “adding things to the bucketlist” on dates but it would be nice to start checking them off LOL

What is it that makes you hopeful? What about alternatives for sex and love? Your genuine friends and family provide you with warmth, support and companion.

29,r67hsb,1638336990,Am i being selfish by asking for space?,"So a couple of months ago, I met this girl at a party and we really hit it off. We talked almost the whole night, and I definitely didn't imagine the situation. I felt like she was leading me on (maybe she was just being friendly)

After that night, I got her number somehow and managed to text her. We'd text quite a lot, and since we lived nearby we'd meet every now and then as well. I started to develop feelings for her, it felt easy and right. 

Although, a few weeks into texting, I asked her if she was seeing someone and she said yes. And that broke me. It was hard for me cause I loved talking to her and I still want to, but it's hard for me to do so without my feelings for her get stronger. 

A week-ish ago, I met her and told her that I really like her, but I know she's dating, so nothing can happen. But, I would need some space to myself so that I can gather my thoughts and work on moving on. I don't know how long it'd take, but I just need a bit of time, after which I would LOVE to continue being friends cause I really love talking to her. 

Am I being selfish here? I feel like I'm just putting myself ahead in this situation and giving myself time and space to move on so that my feelings don't get stronger. She feels otherwise, and it's not right for me to do so, and says that I've become integral part of her life and she needs me. I've got no idea what to do!

36,r67pyt,1638337827,I like my neighbor’s ex,"Okay so this is very chaotic and all the names are made up for privacy reasons btw.

I’m dating in college, and one girl (Lucy) in my friend group has a really cool boyfriend (Ian) who thought his close friend (Mark) would be perfect for me. I went on two dates with Mark— both nights were really great. I rarely date, and usually I don’t feel this good after my dates either. We have so much in common. After our last date though, a girl (Anna) in my hall (someone who is technically an acquaintance but has shown me a lot of kindness over the past few months) approached me and claimed that Mark had manipulated her into having sex with him before breaking up with her. Ian disagreed and said the relationship just went too fast and he advised Mark to end it. One of my other friends in my friend group had met her on tinder and told me he went out with her and thought she was a little crazy. People in my hall said she screamed and was really angry when she found out he was dating me. The problem is that everyone in my hall likes her and I still like Mark. At first, I really believed her and told him I wouldn’t see him again. After a week though, he was still on my mind so I went to Lucy, and she showed me some messages from Ian that showed that Mark feels similarly about me too. So I decided since we’re on the same page, we should maybe give this thing a chance, but now I’m concerned for me, Anna, and my hall’s dynamic. What the hell did I do, and what should I be doing honestly? I’ve just been going at this really immaturely and with little thought.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r67pyt/i_like_my_neighbors_ex/
37,r67xz9,1638338637,A story from high school:,"Hello all. I’ve been pretty down as of late, and I’m not sure if this post is really related to the premise of the subreddit, but I want to post it here even if it gets removed later. I’ve been hurt a lot, probably not as some people here, but still hurt. The worst emotional pain I’ve ever felt was at homecoming on my freshman year of high school. We’re all immature then sure but I felt used and dejected and it fucked me up for a long time. I asked a girl, let’s say her name is “H” to hoco, my mother always tried to teach me to be a gentleman and so I paid for the tickets with money from mowing my neighbors lawns. We go inside after I give her a ride and since my HS was small and not very well funded, our homecoming was in the tiny ass cafeteria as the back of the buildings bottom floor. We sit down and things get moving, music starts playing and she asks me if we could have some punch, so I go over and pour some and come back to the table and she’s gone, vanished. I searched for her for what felt like ages. Eventually I considered that maybe her parents called her and picked her up for some reason even though I was supposed to give her a ride home. I went to the bathroom to wash my face off because I live in arizona and that cafeteria is hot as hell with over 100 people in it and an out of date, probably half broken AC system. I go back into where everyone and a I don’t see it immediately but it’s H and another guy slowdancing with everyone else. I just stood there for a few small eternities and had a blank mind. I never confronted her, never said anything, never asked why she ditched me when I went to get us punch. I just walked outside and decided to walk shine since my mother wasn’t off of work to come pick me up yet. I walked home on a cold night in early October alone. I never said a world, but I never sobbed, I just never tried to stop letting tears go down my face. It bothers me still, even today, four years later. I’m not sure if him and her are still a thing, or if that fizzled out too, but it hurt me so deep, being stood up is a whole other ordeal, but being abandoned by someone who seemed to actually show interest in me, a girl who laughed at my dumb jokes and shitty puns, it broke me for years. My father left me and my mother for the wolves, if my grandmother hadn’t taken us in we probably would be in a homeless shelter. I wasn’t expecting to find true love that night. I still don’t expect to find either even though I want too. I always thought I’d meet someone like my grandmother, gramps always told me stories about how they fell in love when they were young and he came home from the Vietnam war. Maybe I went in with the wrong idea, I made sure she knew I wanted it to be a date but then she left and danced with another guy. If she wanted to go with him, he could’ve paid for her ticket and she could’ve asked him instead of doing what she did with me. We sat on the bus decently close to each other for about two years after that, I was always at the back and chose to avoid girls after that, I developed a toxic view of how girls are and what they want. It took a while to grow out of that stupid world view. I fucked up a really good thing with another girl in my senior year because of that world view. I didn’t treat her right even though she did right by me every time. Now she’s in a committed relationship with a good guy, and I regret my decisions every single time I think about her. It also goes back to that cold night in October, when I saw the first girl I fell for with another guy on our date. If you actually read this, thank you for listening to my story, my confession, and listening to me. I don’t feel owed anything by anyone I just wanted to speak about what hurts me. I suppose if you wanted to derive a meaning or lesson from this story it should be to not let people walk all over you, but also don’t blame the whole world and everyone in it for what happens to you, because that can lead down a much darker and much sadder path that no one should go down and follow to its end.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r67xz9/a_story_from_high_school/
38,r67y7h,1638338664,I overthink a lot and it's always my undoing.,"I can never seem to take things one step at a time.

I imagine where we'd go, what we'd do, the places we'd explore and the activities we'd enjoy together. It's so damn exhausting, and it only triggers when I sense that she might reciprocate my feelings. I could have a crush on a girl for years without ever thinking 2 steps ahead, but the moment I suspect that she might have feelings for me, the thoughts begin pouring in and she occupies my mind 24/7.

52,r68uru,1638342218,Attracted to bad girls only (25 Male),"Hey guys first reddit post, going to use 3 examples but you really don't have to read all 3, so here goes.

I'm quite an honest person with myself, I can look in the mirror and see my own flaws and I'm able to grow and improve. So recently I think I've come to the conclusion that I'm attracted to really BAD girls. Not promiscuous girls, but bad attitude, girls that have been fired, girls with a reputation or just generally have that aura about them, think Bonnie and Clyde.

Example #1
I work with a guy whom I don't really know but as soon as you see his name on the schedule you think ""oh no.. its him"". You quite literally hear his last name and it's like ""oh yeahhh we all know what he's like"". A few months back his sister got a job at our store. I began speaking to her not knowing her last name. There was some talk before hand that this guy's sister got a job at our store and it was like ""oh nooo..."".

She was honestly really sweet and lovely, however you could feel an edgy vibe coming off her. Then as soon as she said ""my brother works at this store and everyone hates him"", that's when it hit me.. that this girl is his sister. Just hearing her last name (which is also quite unique) was like ""oooooooh you're the one.."". And it was really strange. It made me attracted to her. It was the first day we'd met but later that day came up to me crying her eyes out alone that her boyfriend had just broke up with her, her doing that broke something in me. Ihad a bit of a fondness for her. She was later fired about a week later for not turning up to work. She is a chav girl who sometimes goes out in pyjamas which I was never attracted to and smokes a lot of weed (if you're from USA then think a girl from the hood). I did see her again as she came back into the store at night in her pyjamas to tell me she got sacked, but I've always wanted to see her again and speak to her.

_______________________________________________________

Example #2
I trained a new girl at my job. She was from Liverpool as was I, and both of our families had moved away for a better life elsewhere. We had common ground, I don't actually know what's happened to her, wether she still works here or not. But I know what girls are like from around Liverpool, very loud and mouthy, sometimes aggressive and defiant, but usually not horrible people they're just from Liverpool. On my dad's side of the family the girls literally sound more masculine and aggressive than the men. My sister doesnt sound masculine but is quite defiant and aggressive. I am used to these types of girls, this girl I trained was very sweet but very defiant, however it didn't anger me because I know that's what they're like. The managers think she has a horrible attitude, but I actually think she is quite sweet, she's just scouse.

I suffered the same fate when joining the store. ""He's really nasty, horrible taste in humour"" and so on. The same type of situation. She's one of those girls with a bad reputation or comes off as aggressive but that doesn't push me away and it infact makes me more attracted.

_______________________________________________________

Example 3
A girl from a different store, same type of arrangement as number 2 except I don't work with her. She has a very strong scouse accent and is a bad girl. She used a managers card to make my whole order free which will literally get her sacked on the spot. This was about a month ago and I found myself attracted. My friend who works with her recently walked off shift because she refused to help him and got a really bad attitude towards him. His girlfriend also doesn't like her but for some reason I'm not even angry on behalf of my friend. Of course she's nasty for doing that but there's still that strange attraction in the air I have towards her.

_______________________________________________________

Why do I think I'm attracted to these girls?

I feel like it is a reflection of self. I myself had a terrible up bringing in a rough area, think poor town with lots of gangs and crime, no job opportunities. And I managed to do an absolute 180 and I now do really well. But I was the skinny kid, which despite the fact I am now quite muscular and live in a nice area, and no longer need, is wired into me. I'm better now but I used to be quite defensive around new people, sometimes very very cold for a long time until I warmed up to you. I'm still a little bit like that, but the only people who don't need to break that barrier are other rough people like these girls. Guys are the same, lads from Poland or other parts of Eastern Europe break through easily. The only alternative are extremely submissive girls or men. 

I myself had that reputation of ""its him"" at one stage, simply just saying I'm from ""such a part of Liverpool"" can trigger it and I don't blame people, because some parts are rough and the gangs are bad. But I honestly want to do good. That poverty I was raised in has given me such strength to stand on my own two feet and face up to hard times to become wealthy and strong. Recently had a girlfriend who was a career girl but felt like she was quite narcissistic as she was studying ""such a such"". She was popular and had a good reputation but I feel like it was more a good face she put on for others and she doesn't actually know poverty and crime areas.

I don't look like a bad lad. I'm not a chav. I infact look quite young for my age and described as well presented, Imagine Graham Stephan (financial youtuber). Most of my young life I thought I didn't like girls who smoked and sometimes looked at them negatively because it was raised into me by my father who is Catholic. My dad loved the girl who was studying and asked where she went, but my last girlfriend I was with for 3 years and loved deeply he never complimented or wanted to see her. 


I often times feel I need to run away and do a Romeo and Juliet with these girls. Not literally, but in the sense of being very cold with people and my family, as everyone has an opinion. But that's life, we all judge others relationships based off our own standards. But what are your thoughts?

69,r6aqkt,1638350108,Guy 27M complitely vanished after the most amazing 24 hours we had!,"  

One of the most hurtful things in my life just happened to me. It is still hard for me to grasp the reality of this. 

I met this guy, Paul from a dating app. He was 27 and we first video called cause we lived a bit far and I didn’t want to meet him right away. He had written to me first: Looking for a friendship first. 

After we talked, I found him interesting. He was an investor, came from a very rich family but as I noticed with time, he was also extremely smart and sharp. After the talk, we met, I went to his town cause its bigger and more interesting than mine. He seemed impressed that I would do that, cause as he said later on girls don’t usually do that, but I am so sick of my small town that I just want to get away from it. 

We met and I was very nervous but he seemed very nice. Very courteous as well, but probably that’s expected since he was well educated. He kept looking me in the eye, was very attentive, we went to a park and he showed me around. I am a doctor myself, but I should say I was intimidated by him, he just sounded so smart. He was very passionate about finances, investing, which I found cool cause it seemed he enjoyed that at max. 

We get in his car, the weather was so bad, and he starts driving. I ask him to where, he says his house. He asked are you ok with that, I though because of the weather. I said half ok, was not really sure, but he seemed kinda safe. 

We go there, long story short, after a long day (we met on 9am) we had sex (that happened at around 23:00). It was very slow, he never pushed, was very attentive any moment that I stopped him. So it was all consensual. He was so so sweet, we talked about many things, he got overly excited and I did tell him multiple times we would rather know each other than speak too much. He fully agreed. He was actually the one who asked me first: Do you do this often? You are into this for something serious right? 

He then proceeded to tell me how important it is for us communicate, to be open with each other. He asked me of my weak point, I told him I close off, am cold and distant. He said don’t do that with me. He just seemed to say all the right things and more. Told me we should both delete the app and so on. 

When we finally did have sex, he was really trying to get me off. I told him that was never possible for me during sex. He said: well, I only have a toothbrush, could that help? He genuinely seemed to want that for me. Then he made me to eat, was always so so careful. I hadn’t eaten all day so I had stomachache after dinner. He offered to make me tea, to bring me a hot bottle or something to relieve the pain. 

We slept in his bed and he hugged me all night. Woke up and we did it again. He started without a condom and then said to me: We are in this for a long time right? Are you going to think of a contraceptive way, cause I hate condoms. I said I didn’t want to take hormones. He said: What about the spiral? I said yeah, that could work. We then used a condom. It was all so amazing, it was the first time I actually felt so close to someone. I haven’t felt that for my ex boyfriend with whom I stayed for 2 years. He insisted that I take his shirt with me and offered me his underwear as well since I didn’t have with me. He gave me some food that Id have with me for the way. He was so careful all the time. 

Then I left, came back to my apartment. He was so loving all the time. 

Its now been 24 hours and he pretty much vanished. I uninstalled the app but installed now again and wrote to him (his profile came up again). I messaged him, wrote him on whatsapp, called him. Yesterday my calls reached him, today its off. Messaged on whatsapp were delivered yesterday, today not anymore. He blocked me apparently. I didn’t sleep all night because of anxiety. I woke up with heart palpitations. It is terrible. How can someone do this? How could he behave like that and then vanish. I feel so terrible, I am never using these apps again. What is wrong with you men? How can one be such a psychopath as to be overly loving and then vanish. I feel so unworthy.

At first over FaceTime she said that she wanted something physical only, she didn’t want me to catch feelings and I was like cool ok, and then I see her in person and she says she didn’t really mean that and kind of wants to see where things go, but take things slow I guess. She told me she’s scared of committing bc she doesn’t want to feel trapped or something and like she has to devote herself to me, which I guess she’s done in past relationships. 

Anyways, we basically like were sitting on a park bench and we made out for awhile and usually this has only happened when I’m drunk(we were sober), but we kissed and then just hugged each other and it was intimate and cute. She told me I checked all her boxes physically which was nice to hear, but idk it seems like she’s just unsure about things. She also told me she’s not seeing other people and probably won’t, but that she doesn’t expect me to be exclusive. 

We’re going to watch a movie in the park and I’m already thinking about how we’re going to cuddle and shit, and idk I just don’t want to be invested in something that’s not their but I can’t help it.

But recently, I’ve been so into the idea of having sex with fat, old guys. Literally, fat grandpas. I think it’s some sort of degradation thing. 

My point is just that, if you’re struggling with sex, there is ALWAYS someone out there willing to fuck you because that’s what they’re into in that moment of time. This obviously doesn’t apply if you’re looking for a relationship or a partner etc.

76,r6bcwm,1638352744,"As an introvert who doesn't OLD, how screwed really am I?","Well, title says it all I guess.

I don't date online. have never had any real success with any dating app. They've only been any use to me either for wasting my time or finding people to buy weed off of. Most of my friends also say that unless you're exceptionally hot (I'm pretty much average) as a guy you will end up wasting a lot of your time on them and even then success isn't guaranteed. I haven't touched any of them years and I don't regret my decision not to, though I do wonder from time to time if the general scene there has changed at all (I deleted them all in Jan 2019)

For pretty much my whole life I've had a very introverted personality. I do not usually go to social events or bars or anything and when I do I usually end up leaving after not very long or just sticking with my friends that I go with. I never went to prom in high school and even on my 21st birthday I didn't go out, I just had a chill night in with a couple homies smoking and playing TF2 and had a great time. It's always how I've preferred it. I have never felt like I fit in well in super social environments with lots of new people and me being on the autism spectrum probably has something to do with it. I also don't drink alcohol, so going to bars at all just feels weird for that reason (I've been made fun of for ordering water on several occasions). Smaller parties with a few new faces I can sometimes enjoy but I very rarely get invites to them, and usually those parties just end up being my friends and their SO's so they aren't helpful in that regard.

I have not worked since August because of school and probably won't work for at least a few years because of school, so meeting anyone in the near future from that is probably out.

I have an extremely expensive and time consuming hobby, but I don't see it being helpful as 99% of the people that participate are around retirement age, and of that remaining 1% basically none are women. I am 21 and straight. In fact I have never met a woman who participates in it of any age in almost 10 years in the hobby. I have tried other hobbies in the past that have user bases that align better, but i eventually concluded that wasting time on a hobby I was only interested in to meet girls wasn't worth it and every time I have reverted back to my main hobby.

I don't see my career path being helpful either as it's very heavily male dominated but not as badly as my hobby.

I had one pretty awful relationship in high school which honestly put me off the whole idea of dating after that for a while. Since then the number of women I've even advanced past the acquaintance stage with I can count on one hand, though a couple of them I ended up becoming close friends with so it's not all bad. I had one which seemed really promising but we hung out once and she tried getting a little physical and I wasn't having it (physical contact often makes me uncomfortable even with someone I'm interested in) and it fell apart pretty fast after that.

I live in a fairly populous college town so it's not like I have a shortage of people in my age range and preferred gender but the problem is I never end up meeting any of them without going to places that I feel like a complete alien in, because then I get nervous and don't feel like socializing and usually just leave. It honestly kinda sucks because I feel like I've matured a lot as a person in general in the past few years and would like to try some sort of relationship again now that I'm a little less of a complete chucklefuck like I was in high school. I just don't ever meet new faces in any of the places that I usually hang out in.

86,r6bvwi,1638354876,Curious what message I sent here.,"Curious if people think I might’ve sent the wrong message here!

Long story short, I (21M) had been seeing this guy (20M) for around a month. When we were together, we seemed to have a genuine connection, opening up about a lot of things and being generally vulnerable with one another. But because of other signs, including a general lack of communication over text, some hesitancy on his part about a relationship, I sent him a text a day before we were supposed to hang out explaining that I don’t think we should continue to see each other in a romantic context because we seemed to be at different points in our college experiences and may have been looking for different things; I didn’t say it, but he just didn’t seem as into it as I did. I said I’d be happy to hang out as friends and because we were so open with each other I hoped we could continue as friends. 

He expressed he was open to being friends but he wasn’t ready to hang out yet. I just responded saying if he ever needed or wanted to talk to someone to feel free to reach out. 

Thanksgiving break for us came and went—about two weeks—and my friends asked if we had talked since. I said no, and they said that since I ultimately rejected him, I should probably be the one to reach out and show him I’m genuine about wanting a friendship. I thought sure, and sent him a text today around 4PM that was simply “How was your break?”

No response as of 7 hours; I figure that’s that. I know he does not at all have to respond or want to be friends, but I’m a little worried I sent the wrong message here: I did not mean for that text to convey that I wanted to re-establish a dating or talking scenario, just to show him I’m genuine about wanting to be friends because I hate to become vulnerable with someone then never speak to someone again. 

I don’t know, what does Reddit think? In that situation, would you assume someone that someone was simply being friendly and trying to make it clear they were serious about the friend thing, or was regretting ending things and trying to make a move?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6bvwi/curious_what_message_i_sent_here/
87,r6bwfu,1638354930,I had my first date! :),"I got out of a toxic 4-year relationship a few months ago. I honestly should’ve gone out of it sooner, but I was 18 and thought my high school boyfriend was it for me. I’m 21 now and downloaded Hinge and ended up matching with a guy on there after I sent him a like. He sent me a message a few days later and he asked me for my number and we started talking that same day. He asked me when he could take me out and I told him I’m more free at the end of the week but we ended up spontaneously going out on Monday evening.

He was really sweet and took me places and at the end of the date he kissed me. I was a nervous wreck the whole time and admitted it was my first time on a date like this ever and he was okay with it and asked a few questions about it, but he treated me better than my ex ever did, which was really sad. We’ve been texting since and he’s been saying I should join him in some of his hobbies and we’re planning to meet up again when we’re both free. 

I feel like this is too good to be true and that the first date I go on ever is with someone who is interested in talking to me still after, considering I was laughing nervously and openly admitted to being shy and in my head. I feel like I might have messed up by doing that and maybe he’s just playing with my feelings, but I’m not sure because I’ve never dated like this and don’t really know.

I really want this to work but I don’t want to get my hopes up too. I hope I get better at not being flustered and shy and I just hope he’s interested in me :’) any advice or support for picking up these things?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6bwfu/i_had_my_first_date/

89,r6c0ie,1638355416,Am I overreacting?,"Hi all, so basically I, 23f, met 22m on Bumble around a month ago. We chatted a lot online and we met once and plan to meet again next week, and honestly it all seemed to go well. He seemed to be interested in me and I to him as well. We've exchanged plenty of flirty texts and sexual ones too daily, and we have similar opinions on how we want to develop a relationship (slowly, and with more time together irl). 

It all seemed to go well until today I went out with my friends and I decided to take a photo of what I see, which was my friends, and send it to him (just to send pics of what im doing throughout the day) and he also does the same. I got a reply after sending a pic of my friends saying ""Any of your friends single lol jk"" and that really hurt me for some reason. It could be because I'm insecure in general but hearing him say that really took a blow on me. I know he said jk at the end but was I supposed to laugh, is this supposed to be a funny joke? Idk I just felt like if he was interested in me he wouldn't say something like that even as a joke. 

I also understand we are not dating yet. Purely just interested in each other and in the end we are both single, lonely people who want to find our significant other, but did he have to say that when we potentially had something and it was an innocent pic of my friends? I don't know if I'm overreacting that's why I'm here but also if I'm not, I dont really know what to do. I can tell him honestly how I felt but do I just forgive him and tell him to not say it again? Is this something that should make me rethink this relationship?

Any advice or thoughts would be great, I often find myself overthinking things so a second POV would be nice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6c0ie/am_i_overreacting/

91,r6c42a,1638355862,Girl i date wants to buy me everything,"“English is not my main language, sorry when it isn’t typed correctly”

I’m a (29M), my origin is spanish (Europe) and i’m dating this lovely girl (26F). In the words of all the girls i met is that i’m good looking and attractive, and over the years i noticed that it’s quite easy for me to get girls. Now because it’s so easy i met also a lot of toxic girls who are very jealous or when i don’t give them much attention they get pissed of because i’m busy or when i text late they get mad, so that is the reason that i became quite picky and choose more wisely. I met this girl on Facebook and we texted for around 1 month before meeting her. Before we met we talked about our boundaries and what we both are looking for in someone and we quite matched, our conversations felt very good, she’s the first girl in years with this damn good vibe. I told her that i’m not the person who rush things into a relationship fast, just knowing eachother first and with time we see what happens and she felt the same way. I had a role ina movie and the shooting was 15 minutes from her city so after the shooting we met after 1 month of talking and FaceTiming eachother, it felt really good and we had sex on the firt meeting, i know it’s crazy but the vibe was so good, it’s hard to explain. Now fast forward 3 months later we still meet and she give here and there hints that she wants to be my girlfriend and i also met her mother and her friends, but i still don’t made the move for a relationship, i just see how it goes. Now what i’ve noticed the recently is that she wants to buy me everything, winter jacket, she wants to pay restaurant bills, movie bills, when we order food she wants to pay, she wants to buy new shoes, she wants to give me money when i’m riding with my car to her city (almost 2 hours driving). But i never accepted any of this! It doesn’t feels good because i don’t like it, i feel bad when i accept this, and i can pay for this for myself, i don’t need it. She just wants to buy me everything, it’s crazy. It feels for me that she likes me tooo much and that she doesn’t want to loose me and by buying stuff she thinks she has me or has more chance for a relationship? Or mayby it’s a redflag? Mayby there is something wrong about her that i don’t know about and she tries her best to hide it by buying me stuff? I already told her that i don’t like it!

92,r6c63r,1638356116,"He won't say sorry for past hurts, so I cannot move on.","A former friend - who was partnered when we were friends, but who is now pursuing me pretty aggressively now we're both single - has reconnected with me. We're both in our thirties and have both been single for long enough for this to not be a rebound. 

Under normal circumstances, I would be happy to date him and see how things went. Only, in the past he really hurt me and refuses to talk about it. He just wants to move on and 'see how things go' now. 

I don't like that he won't be held accountable, and I recently told him that if he won't at least acknowledge past wrongs, this cannot work. He is stonewalling me. 

Should I just move on from this situation and find someone else? Or, maybe suggest he speaks to a professional, as stonewalling isn't a healthy coping strategy? 

I do care about him and want what's best for him, I have to look after myself too though. Or, as Samantha Jones once said, ""I love you, but I love me more!""",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6c63r/he_wont_say_sorry_for_past_hurts_so_i_cannot_move/

95,r6d90v,1638360235,Nameday Fiasco,"Disclaimer: this might take a while. 

I’m currently on semester abroad in an Eastern European country. While on semester abroad, I met the bartender of a local bar. There was obviously connection there and we’ve talked every day since then. We are now dating and I’m very very fond of her.

Awhile into talking into seeing eachother and blah blah blah, she tells me that we need to have a serious convo. She meets me in person and says she wants to tell me that during the time we’ve been talking, I’ve also been talking to a guy from England coming upon 9 months. But, since we’ve been getting more serious, she wants to tell me that she and him are now largely friends. I say okay cool thank you for telling me. That’s normal, I was also talking to some other people but it wasn’t important. I didnt think anything of it. 

Flash forward a month into dating and it’s thanksgiving day. I look over at her phone on WhatsApp and see there is a notification in her archived messages. I say, “oh who is that,” and she says, “it’s boys that I don’t want to talk to.” I saw what, can I see? She looks at me like a hurt puppy and says “it’s the boy from England.” I then ask again if I can see and she says no. I leave the celebration to call someone and clear my head. (This is also her nameday btw and I gave her gifts)

I return after a bunch of calls of texts from her. We sit down in a room and she shows me the conversations. I come to find that while the conversations between them have been plutonic and friendly, she seems enthusiastic to talk to him even during the month we’ve been dating. I’m obviously pretty hurt because it seems like too-close-to-home/ very borderline emotional cheating. At the very least, she was dishonest about her feelings and didn’t disclose the full truth about things. I say borderline because the conversations were not flirty. Plus, there were two instances where he asked to her hang and she denied him twice. 

The things that bothered me was that she hid the convo from me, and, while she did tell him that me and her were seeing eachother, she didn’t explicitly tell him that we’d been dating for a month. She could’ve just shown the convo and explained it, but she hid it and that only means she knew it was not right. 

After talkings things through, she automatically said she didn’t have feelings for him (because that convo came up) and she’ll stop talking to him more. She realized it was wrong and that she was going to tell me eventually, but she didn’t know how. She said she talked to him as friends solely. She values our relationship so much and wants to do whatever it takes to build my trust back up in that fact.

I think this girl is being genuine, but I don’t want to make a mistake. We’re already trying to move on, but these things are still on my mind. There are some details which I didn’t include but this is already long af. 

Just wanted to get your guys opinion on what you would’ve done.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6d90v/nameday_fiasco/

I agreed and we discussed that it’s just to watch the movie not sex or anything. I’m not naive I know he’s going to be thinking about sex etc but it’s not happening from my end. 

But is it ok to arrive to his home empty handed in this case? I don’t want to come with something and in my mind reward him being lazy and not really planning an actual date.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6dbub/he_invited_me_to_his_place_being_something_to/
