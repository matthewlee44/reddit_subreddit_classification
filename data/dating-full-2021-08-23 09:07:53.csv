Unfortunately I’m someone who scars easily and those acne didn’t heal nicely which led to atrophic and hypertrophic scars on my butt with some dark spots. So if u see my butt, there are quite a few (around 6-8 on each cheek) bumps. To make things worse, I’m mixed Asian with darker skin tone so I do get dark friction patches on my waist and lower butt.

I’ll say I’m quite hygienic and bathe twice a day, have a whole skincare routine for my face. I also use a cleanser and moisturize my body and butt but it doesn’t seem to help (for my butt)

I’ve consulted a few dermatologists and all of them said that it can’t really be cured. My only option is to let time TRY to “heal” those stuff.

A ""red flag"" is something I thought to mean a character trait of a person that doesn't align with your values or doesn't attract you personally. Or someone who has deep issues with something - narcissistic personality disorder, alcohol, drug abuse, racist/sexist, being verbally and/or physically abusive, etc. Things like that. But people tend to use the term very loosely too - like say you get hurt or emotionally affected by something and want to talk about it and then that's suddenly a ""red flag"". Or maybe you have a bad day where your confidence is less than usual, and then that's a ""red flag""? Or maybe you handled something badly in the past, learned from your mistakes, changed completely and improved your ways, but then because of that one moment in time you have ""red flags"" in you, like you're just a bad person for life? I've seen people use this term so loosely like as if someone is unable to change or improve or become better. We're all works in progress. No one is perfect. By that logic we all have red flags all the time, but I think that's a belittling, disdainful and highly negative way to perceive human beings.

""A condition many people experience after dating an individual for a short amount of time. The individual is probably polite, nice, and generally pleasant to be around, **but one day, you suddenly find yourself disgusted by his or her appearance or actions""**

This seems to become a frequent thing with me. I meet someone, I get excited and then on our second or third date there is something insignificant about the persons mannerisms that changes my view of them completely. I've never come back from this, I havent found a way to reverse it so when it happens I've just come to accept that I cant really do much about it. 

I wonder if anyone else has this issue? I guess its worth to mention that I struggle with anxiety, depression and I was a polysubstance abuser (clean 9 months). My therapist thinks it may be some sort of self-sabotage mechanism that happens unwillingly, but we havent been able to reverse it and its very disheartening.

She was super touchy and flirty, asking me lots of questions, getting close etc. etc. I asked her for her number at the end of the night, and texted her the next day, asking her out for a drink. She agreed and asked me when I was free. I said Tuesday night. She waited 36 hours til 1130 on monday night to get back to me, apologizing for being 'disorganized'. I said no problem, and we met up the next night.

She asked me lots of questions about my dating history, what I look for in a woman. She refused to call it a 'date' in spite of all that, but i was adamant that it was of course a date. Two people getting together and seeing if they have a romantic connection. I told her I wasn't interested in just being friends. She commented several times that I was 'bold' and 'smooth'. As we left the restaurant we held hands and I gave her a soft kiss as we walked. We went to another bar and had another couple of drinks. She was very touchy and affectionate throughout. We kissed again a few times, and walked back to the subway, which was now closed. We walked round the corner to get cabs, sat on a bench and got pretty physical, kissing, touching, close contact etc. I ordered my cab and told her she could come back to mine if she wanted. She agreed with very little hesitation, although she said ""i know what type of guy you are...you're a scorpio, sex is your love language...I've been fucked over by guys like you in the past'. I said she had no idea what kinda guy I was and she'd have to take a risk.

We got the cab home and we got in to bed. We lay there for a while and kissed a little, although she batted me away when I tried to get more physical - repeating the same thing - 'I know what you're like' etc. I rolled over and we went to sleep. Next morning we woke up and we carried on cuddling, I rubbed her back and we chatted, she lay next to me hugging me etc etc., but no sex. I flirted a little with the boundary but I kept it kosher. Anyway, time to get up. We get dressed and go downstairs, drink a coffee and chat some more. She gets her stuff together and leaves, and gives me a tender kiss goodbye on the doorstep.

That evening I texted her 'I had a great time, would love to see you again soon'. and I got nothing back. I sent no follow up text, and just let it lie. TEN DAYS later, she texts me this:

Hey, I hope all is well with you. You're an awesome person but I want to keep things platonic between us. I want to be transparent as I feel you deserve that'. I replied 'that's a sweet message, so thanks, although I'm not impressed at all with how long it took you to send it. I'd love to get to know you better but I'd be lying if I claimed platonic intentions. Get in touch if you change your mind but bye for now xx

So weird. She seemed heavily in to me throughout the night, it just seems like a total flip around. People change their minds with the benefit of hindsight but I can't shake the feeling that she was up for the chase. Maybe gave herself away too much in the beginning, and had to pump the brakes.

3. If your husband decided to move out of the state or the country, would you go with him?

5. Would you be a stay home mom? 

We went to the beach to watch sunset. He almost couldn’t wait to ask me these questions after we found our seat. Apparently watching sunset wasn’t of his interest at all. I didn’t get a chance appreciating nature either because he kept asking these questions. 

On our way to the beach, he complained about his ex girlfriend not contributing financially and dependent on him. She was a struggling actress. He also complained that she liked to dine out all the time (again it’s about money).

On our way back home, he asked me whether I’d sign a prenup if the guy asked to do so. He’s not a billionaire but an average person who holds a job, like me. 

Other than that, he was very generous with giving compliments on how I looked. It was very generic, not so genuine compliment though. So I got bored of his compliments soon but still tried to show appreciation.

I had been talking to a girl for about 4 months online before meeting her physically. This was because she was out of state and moving to the state I live in. (She wasn't moving for me - it was part of her plan)

When she was moving, I helped her out and let her stay at my place for a while. However she was moving with her single mom as well - so they needed a seperate place of their own since my place.

&amp;#x200B;

In the midst of all of this, getting a place to rent was hard because she didn't have a job. I didn't offer to become a guarantor. Anyways - after being at my place for a few days since moving in, her friend (who is some other guy mind you) - offered to be her guarantor.

I’m sitting here thinking 

The societal expectation is “stay within your lane”, don’t feel entitled to a supermodel, because supermodels mostly date other supermodels

“Get realistic expectations of a partner, and you’ll be happier” 

Etc etc. 


Just get someone less attractive but with a great personality, and learn to love them for who they are, as we would hope they love us for who we are 


Now, I don’t feel entitled by any means to a supermodel nor do I particularly want one right now. 

But I wanna play devils advocate and say, don’t you think there is something deeply disconcerting and despairing about this sense of absolute finality in sex and relationships? 

At least for me, it’s like a caste system we all just unconsciously accept. Models are the upper cast, then there’s average, below average castes, etc. We know it’s probably a good idea to “date in your league” to avoid disappointment 

I think we all know that the higher the “caste” of attractiveness you are, the more life opportunities and pleasures present themselves to you. Some superficial, others quite deeply enriching. And as a supermodel “caste”, it’s just accepted, and perfectly natural, that sex, dating and relationships with other beautiful people *just happen* organically 




I guess what I’m trying to say here is that, this unofficial, universally accepted heirarchy of looks we disappoints me, and only because I’m a loser in the heirarchy. Should I ever dream of dating a higher caste, I’ll be screamed down as a pig or all manner of belligerent insult

I have tried dating apps on and off a few years (I am a straight female). I typically use bumble and hinge. I want a relationship, but it has seemed impossible to find someone who I feel attracted to, can have good conversation with, and is interested in me and willing to be in a relationship.

Here's a recent example. I matched with a guy on bumble, we texted for about two weeks. We had pretty good text conversations and then met up for drinks and ended up spending about 3 hours. The conversation was very easy, we had a decent amount of stuff in common. I could tell he wasn't someone just seeking a hook-up. When we parted he told me to text him to let him know that I got home okay. I text him later to let him know and he tells me he had a good time. I say me too and ask do you want to meet up again sometime. He messages me the following afternoon saying nice things about my looks and my intelligence, that the conversation was good, but that he feels no spark. It's not me it's him, apologizing etc. I then notice that he deleted his bumble account too.

Living up to someones expectation that you should have a spark after meeting off an app for the first time is a really high bar to meet and somewhat unrealistic IMO, but I don't want to focus on that too much as that is one person. I don't want to seem like I am letting one experience affect how I feel. For me it is a combination of poor experiences. I've used these apps for a while now off and on and it rarely leads to anything positive. I always seem to encounter two common situations: guys looking for a hookup/very casual situation (I often don't meet up in person with these matches, as I can more easily discern that it is not a good fit) or guys who seem normal, nice, select that they would be open to a relationship on an app and act interested but then kind of flip on you later. Basically, even the guys on the apps who indicate they would be open to a relationship often don't seem to be in the end.

I know people say to not take any of this app dating too seriously or be too hard on yourself but as a human it takes a toll sometimes and things can bother you whether you want them to or not. However, meeting someone naturally in real life is really unlikely in my current situation, so the apps seem to be the tool I have to keep using. The problem is that I increasingly get the feeling that maybe the people out there for me, if they exist, are not on the apps and I'll just never meet them.

We went on 3 dates in total (he went on vacation for a while after our second date).

Even though he is pretty talkative with me and seems to trust me with telling me certain things I think he’s pretty shy and I don’t know what to do. I enjoy his company a lot (and I told him that) and he enjoys mine.

We haven‘t even really talked about what the other was looking for but I’m planning on doing that the next time we see each other. Normally I try to just go for the things that I want but I don’t wanna mess things up with this guy.

For the first date we had ice cream at a park and talked for a couple hours, the second date he asked me out for dinner and last night on our third date I went over to his place to watch a movie. And that was all we did. We watched a movie. I wasn’t expecting to hook up since I wanna take things slowly but we didn’t even cuddle or anything. Of course I also don’t wanna make him uncomfortable but how do I get him to loosen up with me? Not for hooking up but I want him to be more comfortable in general. What do I need to do? I tried putting my head and arms close to him without being too aggressive. I initially wanted to put my head on his shoulder but though that might be too much for him.

He mentioned that he‘s a very awkward person (and I can see that) so I’m assuming it‘s hard for him to be more assertive. Do I need to take on that part for him? Can a shy person try and tell me what to do? I‘m not the most outgoing person myself. Or does anyone have experience with a shy partner?

Earlier this year, I(25M) moved across the country for a new job. This was a complete new area to me that I barely knew. My job is mostly working alone so I don't get too much social interaction on a day to day basis aside from small talk. About 3 weeks after moving here I meet K(22F) through a dating app. She lives about an hour away from me, we FaceTime several times and instantly hit it off very well. Go on a few dates, and seem to be developing quite nicely. Before I know it essentially 2-3 months later we are dating pretty fully, sleeping at each others houses multiple times per week, and I even met her family once although it was by accident.

From the beginning we agreed to take things very slowly and let the relationship develop naturally. About three months in, I am on my way to visit K and spend the night there when she tells me she bought a bottle of liquor and is insistent on us drinking for some reason. I am not a huge drinker, but agreed nonetheless (I Know my limits pretty well.) We end up having about 4-5 shots. I know this is enough that will give me a good buzz but she got way more drunk than me. She starts telling me she loves me and wants to fully date me for real and stupid me believes it all and thinks Im really falling for this girl. The next few weeks or so go very well as our attachment seems to be growing.

Then due to our busy schedules, we aren't able to see each other for about a week. We had plans to hang out on a Monday night. I text her but she never answers me until later the next day.(pretty uncommon, we would always answer rather quickly) Meanwhile she posted on her snapchat story at 4-5AM several snaps of her out partying all night with 2 new guys she had met. She knows I am not the party type like that and that could be why she didnt ask me but I still feel like I deserved an explanation or something. She texted me back the next afternoon just saying hey and how her night was wild. I tell her (without trying to play the blame game) that I was really looking forward to hanging out and that I was somewhat uncomfortable with her behavior the previous night. We were pretty open and honest about everything and I had always been respectful towards any feelings and boundaries she had. 

This was the first scenario where something like this happened in our relationship and she immediately got defensive. We end up getting into a long argument through text and agree to FaceTime later that night because nothing was getting accomplished. We talk on FaceTime and things seem somewhat patched up (I never felt crazy hostility at any point) We never fully had a full resolution to everything yet when her phone dies mid FaceTime (this happened quite often when we would FaceTime, I could tell because it cut out mid sentence.) She never calls me back, so I decide to go to sleep and well talk the next day. I send her a good morning text and she answers in the afternoon how ""she isn't ghosting me but just wants some time to process everything."" I simply say ok well talk when you're ready. She then proceeded to not reach out at all for several weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I only sent 1 short follow up text a little over a week later saying I would really like to talk but other than that nothing. It has now been over a month and she still never hit me up. I pretty much accepted its over at this point but it all feels so fucked up like how can you do that after everything that we had been through. If you would have told me the last time I saw her would be it I would never believe it. It wasn't even like a breakup it was just nothing. 

I ended up just blocking her on social media recently and deleting her number in my phone and trying really hard to forget about everything but like I really dont see where I went wrong with anything. Maybe I am just older and more mature and she wasn't ready for the relationship and changed her mind?Is there something here I am missing???

 But to never talk about any of it or resolve anything or get any closure was really getting to me so I just had to shut her out and now am trying to completely move on which I am having a very hard time doing. I never made too many friends in this new area since I pretty much met her right after moving here and now several months later, it has been very difficult dealing with this whole situation. This has definitely taught me to make sure I really get to know who someone is first in any future relationship and definitely not get emotionally attached too quick because this was fucking horrible.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,969631,public,self,“Girlfriend” essentially ghosted me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa3vdd/girlfriend_essentially_ghosted_me/,all_ads,6,,,

TLDR: Girlfriend emotionally cheated with friend and now having I’m having problems trusting future friendships 

My Girlfriend (F22) and I (F20) have been dating for almost a year. We went long distance for about 3 months during the summer due to school break and I’ve just recently (about a week ago) returned. During the summer my girlfriend admitted to having a crush on one of her coworkers who was her friend. She didn’t outright physically cheat but it still hurt nonetheless as she had denied liking her for months and would lie about communicating/ hanging out with her. She’s since cut off all contact with her coworker and changed jobs. While I’m grateful for the steps she’s taken to help rebuild our relationship..I’m still a bit hurt and weary of future friends. Every time she’s met someone new recently and have showed interest in becoming friends, I get this gut wrenching feeling that this can happen all over again. I know trust is absolutely needed in a relationship and I really love her and can’t imagine breaking up but it’s really hard. 

She’s complained that I’ve been smothering her lately and has suggested spending less time together to do different clubs. I know that is a absolute reasonable request and would have no issue with this in the past but now just the thought gives me terrible anxiety.

I’ll add that I don’t get these feelings when she hangs out with the friends she had before knowing me…just new people.

I just don't know how to deal with this in the future because I inevitable have to be around this person.

Both times we hung out were really amazing, in my eyes at least. For context, I recently got out of an on/off serious relationship probably around the beginning of July. It had been a long time coming and I honestly was already over him. So the couple of dates I went on w this new guy were really refreshing and honestly, I don't mind if its not a full blown relationship or if it stays a FWB kinda thing. 

So onto why I think I'm being ghosted. Last time we hung out, beginning of Aug., was really nice and ended on pleasant terms. We watched movies, we did some other.. stuff.. and overall I really got over my initial nerves and felt comfortable around him. I tried keeping convos going with him after that day, and it was limited response from him. I point blank asked him if I came on too strong and he said yes, and stated he was dealing with stuff. Last message I sent, I left the door open and said I'd give him space and if he needed anyone to talk to, Im there for him. It's been a lil over two weeks now since we last talked and he read the message but never replied and hasnt talked to me since. and I hate to say it but I'm hung up on him. 

I feel like I messed it all up big time and I hate it cause I'd like to even just be friends cause hes a nice guy. Plus, I can see when he's active (we message on Insta) and that kills me even more to know he's just choosing to not talk to me.

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

As time progressed we remained friends, still talking on the phone everyday, telling eachother everything going on in our lives and she frequently said things like she is really happy that she has me in her life and that she needs me. But as time progressed it also was harder for me at times. Especially if she was hanging out alone with her guy "" friends"".

I was feeling jealous and really questioning my own self worth/ respect at times. I know i just should have go NC the moment she friendzoned me, but yeah stupid me.

But i was becoming more distant from her to just protect myself and 3 weeks ago she send me a messages that she really misses me and did not thought our bond would ""break"" this quickly. I told her i miss her aswell but from the moment she told me she just wants to be friends a lot had changed because i really thought we were building something more then just friends. she did not respons on my reaction.

For the last 3 weeks our conversations are really dry and it feels forced. I got a snapchat from her last week from her that she was taking a drive with her ex, which she always complained about to me and talked alot about when we were ""dating"" in hindsight it maybe meant she was not over him still. But since she send that snap i did not contacted her and it has been 3 days now.

I need some advice on what to do next, should i stay no contact or should i contact her? i have to be honest and tell you all i am having a hard time, also because she is undergoing surgery coming thursday and i want to be for her, but on the other hand it is hard to be in her life as just a friend.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,969767,public,self,I (M24) need advice on situation with a women (F21),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa65eo/i_m24_need_advice_on_situation_with_a_women_f21/,all_ads,6,,,

He left town for a week. He said he wants to hang out the night before he left. Both of us were working until 10pm. I told him I had to work early the next morning so I only had a couple of hours and couldn't sleep over (we usually sleep over unless one of us has to be up early \[usually me\]) but that I'd still like to see him before he leaves.

 I'm off work at 10pm, I ask if he wants to come over, he says he's wrapping up but it might be a little late. I don't hear from him until 12:30am saying he just got home. I was falling asleep at this point, and just told him goodnight. He said he wants to plan for this weekend when he gets back but truthfully I'm hurt/disappointed at basically being blown off so I didn't respond.

IMO, we've been seeing each other long enough to where he knows I'm not going to drive 15 minutes to his house in the middle of the night when I have to be up at 8am.

However, immediately after the incident I asked him about STIs and he said that the results would be in the next day, but on that day, he told me that he simply didn't take that test and that there is a misunderstanding. I was super confused amd frustrated about it and he told me that he would take the STI test to calm me, so it got better. But I did tell him that I needed time to deal with the anger, which he totally understood and I sent him a friendly text when I was over it and that's when I sensed that he started pulling away.

Im out of college. If I dont get out I dont meet people. If I dont ask people out everyone thinks im their friend. If I dont work on myself and try to be better at talking with people I probably should throw in the towel.   


Right now I'm trying to find people through my social circle. Im kind of striking out and may need to broaden my circle. I got this one girls number, but it's someone I have been talking to at social event and it was because she was interested in checking out my climbing gym sometime. So I felt there might be something there, but will need to explore it more the next time I see her.   


And I just got rejected from someone else in my social circle last week. So I dont want to come accross to people that Im jumping from one person to the next, but if I think I might be interested then who can blame me?? I just dont want to be that dude that gets known with asking everyone out.   


Side tracking a little. My point is that I really want to be looking for dates, but I think there is a balance that I need to find. For instance I'm not going out tonight and I kind of wish I was because of fomo. When I know I'll probably be out several times this week.

I understand after he came from vacation he was swamp with work. I saw him on the fort’s page with some activities he was involved with.  Yet, ever since I added him he has been less proactive in texting me. I had been the one initiating conversation and leading to the point that just recently I ask him hey let’s do a phone call if five minutes.

He is not been active online but I noticed when he is online and sees my stories. What would you make up this? 


Another observation, I recall seeing all of his albums pics were easily for me to view but as of last week I can only dee the pics that he is tagged in, public post and his private post posted in the past. What would you make up this? Is he setting up to ghost me or just leaving me hanging? I want to give him the chance to know each other but sometimes I feel like I getting mixed signals. Thought of sending him a message at the end of weeks sling him how can we improve our communication and where does he sees things going forward with our interaction (so I can adjust expectations accordingly). Will this be too much on my end?


It does not help that I also suffered from anxiety.

I know I posted several things about relationships and anxiety on my stories and wonder if that could have scared him away?

2. met a girl who was really into me
3. developing already feelings, but I want to enjoy being free.

Hey guys, Im 27m. I divorced with my wife few days ago. It was a long process over few months, so we are doing better than before.

I began to meet new people and I wrote to a girl I met recently on work-related place without any intention.

She was really interested in me, chatted with me the whole time and she made so many compliments and didnt even try to hide her feelings towards to me. 

We discovered some mutual hobbies, interests, sexual preferences and planned a date next week.

She knows about my situation and understands I dont want to be in a relationship. She said, she is in a similar situation.

All of sudden she is writing only few times a day. In comparison to whole day texting with so much interest and affection, its like nothing.

Maybe its a strategy, but Im worrying to „lose“ her. Because she is the only person Im chatting with now and I really like her. 

I discovered myself want to be in a relationship mode again, but since I never had a time to be a free single, I wanted to use this time to meet seceral people. But I can‘t get this new girl off my mind.

I am so unexperienced in flirting and being single. I dont want to rush in a new relationship, but I want her so badly.

We already have 1 child together and got engaged earlier this year after almost 5 years. 

Recently my intuition was telling me something is off about my fiancé. He doesn’t usually spend much time on his phone. However, I caught him smiling at his phone, differently than he would have been over any post or guy chat messages. The next morning I woke up for work and decided why not just take a peak (even though I trust him and rarely ever do this.) Well the last person he texted happened to be his new coworker (who he has to have communication with at and outside of work due to type of job.) Initially I thought “nahhh it’s too soon” then again you never know. Well turns out they were talking pretty inappropriately about “tips and tricks” for certain areas of the body. They didn’t get into details, but still why is this going on for messages throughout the last conversation?  

I spoke to him that night and his “reason” for this was because he is lacking attention at home. Because I wasn’t giving him the affection and physical attention he needed. My point to him was why didn’t he communicate these before he got to this point and he said I should have known after the way he was acting. Also why would he allow himself to get to that point if he could just speak to me about his concerns? 

Days after we spoke still feel like crap about him talking to her and now any time i see her name pop up on his phone I’m a bit bothered and deep down want to see what they’re talking about. He brought up therapy and I’m up for it, but really don’t think we need it if after all these years we’ve dealt with a lot already on our own and have no problem with communication til now.
