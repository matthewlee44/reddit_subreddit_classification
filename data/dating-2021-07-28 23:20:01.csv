I had fun, and I thought she had fun but she ghosted me and was with another guy shortly after. I was extremely upset over it. After so many years of trying and failing, finally getting that was supposed to be my big win. I took some time off dating after that, it was covid anyway so it’s not like people were going out. I used that time to work on myself and get some things I’ve always wanted to do crossed off the bucket list.

I dipped my toe back in the water this week, and it’s not going good. I downloaded Hinge, matched with literally one girl, messaged for a bit, got the cold shoulder when I tried to move the conversation off Hinge. I know it’s stupid to let this one thing get to me. I know she doesn’t matter. I know that I’m going to be fine. But I don’t *feel* like that. I feel really hurt.

I made it a point this time around to stop caring about the outcomes and just letting things be what they may. Like an hour after I was shot down, I was doing just fine.

I try to be nonjudgemental about the personal lives of consenting adults, but most people, including me, would say Leo is a bit of a creeper for only dating young women. 

What I don't seem to ever see is similar commentary about the other party. In other words, criticism of these young women who choose to date someone twice their age. 

'Gold digger' is a generic term that is of course used, but it doesn't seem to attach to any individuals (Anna Nicole Smith is an obvious example, but he was 90 something). 

Or are they criticised and I just don't consume the media that discusses it? Or are they not a valid target of criticism because of something else I'm not considering?

 I'm a Man and I tried Hooking Up two times, both times it was incredibly bad and I simply did not like it. But it helped me finding out what I want in life and what my Values regarding Sex is. Because I like Sex allot, but only if it's with someone who I have a lot of intimacy with.  That's the first thing, I get judged when I decline to hook up with them and get told to ""grow up and become a man"". Like what? Just because I'm a Man, I can't decline Sex with a Hot Woman? That's stupid. 

In general, when I'm dating I'm looking for Partner with the same Values like I have, I always did and this ended in great Relationships. And for me seeing Sex as something special between two People is a kind of Value. I always was respectful to the Woman I would stop dating because of to many Sex Partner.  You can do whatever you want and I'm not judging you, I would even be friends with you. But I don't want a Partner who just sees it as a fun Activity you can do with Strangers. This Woman are getting mostly extremely defensive and telling me I'm a Sexist when im dumping them. Which is weird, because I think it's a reasonable decision for a Woman to not date any Fuck Boy or a Guy who sleeps around a lot. I don't make a difference here between Men and Woman.

12,otsbgw,1627541530,How to not set up any expectations?,"So, I'm 21, been on the dating scene for couple of years already but have had no luck by now. I've tried various different approaches, always adhering to the social norms and not behaving out of place, yet, to no success whatsoever.

However, today I have a different kind of question, as it seems there is no general advice on the above part. What I would like to ask you all, is how do you manage, when beginning to communicate with someone you have romantic interest in, to not create any expectations, so that in the end, when things don't work out, you don't get sad/depressed and let it affect you.

It's simply not inherent for me to put effort into something (be it a project, hobby, or in this case dating) and not expect results. This last girl I was talking to seemed really nice at first glance, however, it turned out she's still a bit confused with life and I didn't fit her perfect friend/partner model.

Don't get me wrong, I'm completely fine with this, everyone is entitled to a choice and preference. The problem is that I had convinced myself that, after so many failed attempts, even if things don't work out, it's simply how it was meant to be and I shouldn't stress over it. 

I was sure I wouldn't let it get to me (this time) and I will just carry on with my job, hobbies and daily life. Well, this didn't really happen and when the picture became clear to me (that things aren't going to work out) I could almost feel my heart become heavier and my mood, from rather cheerful or at least definitely above neutral, definitely plummeted and I couldn't bring myself to do anything I found enjoyable for the rest of the day.

It's just that each and every fail is taking toll on me and I'm not sure how long I can keep this up. I'm a man so society has some expectations already set for me, I have a really disfunctional family, can't communicate with my friends of recently and I don't see anybody to turn to for help.

Therfore, I ask you, kind strangers on the Internet, to share a piece of mind with someone that has yet a lot more to learn about life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otsbgw/how_to_not_set_up_any_expectations/

There's this guy at work who came up with a theory. But before I introduce the theory, I want to give you a bit of a background on him. He's in his early 30s, married, has a seven-year-old daughter. He constantly makes jokes about cheating on his wife with younger coworkers and seems dissatisfied with the marriage, when confronted about it, says he's staying with his wife for the sake of their daughter. Yet he always does whatever the wife tells him to - she wanted a car, he bought her one even though he was very opposed to doing so, she asked him to leave a work picnic on the lake, he did so immediately, etc. 

Now onto the theory itself. According to him there are 5 kinds of women in this world. 

1 - the unattainable ones (virtually perfect, too good to be true, but you can only dream about them);
2 - the marriage material (not as great as the previous kind, but good enough to the point where you want to settle down and spend the rest of your life with them);
3 - the ones you would only hang out/mess around with (you wouldn't consider seriously dating them, they are only good for a fling);
4 - the one-night-stand ones (only good for a few commitment-free nights, wouldn't even waste your time on getting to know them);
5 - the ones that you wouldn't even have sex with, unless you were drunk or they paid you (pretty self-explanatory).

34,otugd3,1627552550,Frustrated by my ex and even more frustrated by my own response to him,"We've been broken up for 6(ish) months now, and he reached out to me today - out of the blue, we've only had contact about practical things like mail and dividing up goods (together for 6 years and lived together for most of that). He told me he got a job, starting therapy etc, and it felt to me like he was just wanting for me to be happy for him and to tell him he's doing well. 

Long story short, these were all things I wanted him to do when we were still together and they played a big role in us breaking up. So I got very frustrated by this message, because I can't help but wonder how things would have been different if he'd made those changes to his life when we were still together. And I told him as much.   


Is it impossible for me to expect myself to separate my own emotions from his message and be genuinely happy for him? I'm quite frustrated that I let my own emotions dominate the interaction, but part of me also wonders why did he feel the need to reach out to me?

I have a real problem with talking to girls that I find attractive. So like the thing is almost never try to initiate conversations with girls because i always under the assumption they don't like me automatically/ i get too scared that ill end up embarrassing myself so i never try initiating conversation (im kinda big boy, 190cm, 123kg). I get scared of what ill say and i get too scared, ive probably never talked to a girl one-on-one before.

We went to school together for 9 years. After we graduated, we still went out with our group (2girls, 6 boys) for like a year or so. After falling and breaking my leg, i decided not to go out with them until my leg had healed completely. I had cast on leg for month and couldnt walk without crutch for another month.

One boy kicked me and another guy from the groupchat we were in. After that i havent talked with that girl and and another 3 boys since 2017 july. Recently i started seeing that girl in large store working as cashier and i just cannot get her out of my head. I keep thinking about her, but im afraid to do anything

What should i do to get her out of my head? I mean she obiviously is cute, not gonna lie. But im sure a boy like me would have no chance with her.

She shouldnt have a boyfriend either, because the one she had, is now dating her best friend.

37,otulos,1627553257,He’s perfect for me but there’s no connection,"So I (27F) have been talking to this guy (33M). We’ve been texting everyday since we matched and we went on our first date last week.

I like him. He’s attractive, responsible, hard-working, respectful of my boundaries to take things slow, and we share a lot of the same values. We both are looking for long term too. (He’s also a REALLY good kisser. Our first kiss was electric.) The first date went well despite me being extremely nervous. We ended up talking for several hours before going our separate ways. I know he’s into me too because he initiated setting up the second date. 

And yet, I have doubts of it being long term. Even though we both keep the convo going throughout the day with texting and talking on the phone, it feels kinda stale. I honestly feel like I’m giving a daily report of my activities than actually connecting with the guy. It feels forced at least on my end. But I don’t know if it’s just because we don’t know each other really well yet or if this is a sign that we don’t have a connection at all. I don’t want to rush to the conclusion we aren’t compatible but if it’s not there, I’m not going to try to force it. I’ve made that same mistake in the past and rather not do it again.

42,otv46x,1627555719,Nervous before a first date,"Hi all,  


Never posted in this subreddit before so please bear with me! I recently moved to a new country / city and have been in a hotel quarantine for nearly two weeks. I've \[M27\] been single for a few months and been involved in a fair few casual relationships, ONS etc. I was kinda expecting this to be the case when I came here, so whilst I was bored I went on all the usual apps and had a few convos with a few girls.  


Anyway something fairly crazy happened in that I actually started speaking to someone \[f27\] where almost immediately there was this crazy chemistry. We have been speaking for just over a week now and it's almost constant messaging, calling etc, and it all just feels so awesome and natural. Being someone who has done this dance before, I don't think I can recall a moment in my life when I've connected to someone this much online, or indeed maybe at all, and from what I can tell the feeling seems reciprocated. Anyways, we are due to have our first date on Sunday when I get out of the hotel, and as it gets nearer I'm starting to get more anxious about it.  


I've been reading a lot about how online / video calls never quite equate to physical chemistry. I was wondering what people's personal experience of this was, and if they had any tips? As a disclaimer we have both been very emotionally raw and honest with each other text / call, and are clearly physically interested in each other (ahem) and I was wondering how best to utilise that energy?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otv46x/nervous_before_a_first_date/
43,otv6tf,1627556056,I'll be turning 26 soon and I've never been in a relationship,"So, that's the problem and I don't know what to do. I feel like it's too late, I've already missed the fun 10 years from 16 to 26. People want to get married now and I didn't even have my first kiss. 

I was deeply hurt by the fact that I couldn't have someone I wanted when I was younger (HS). It wasn't even so much about having that someone, but more that I just wasn't good enough, or thats at least how I felt about it. 

When I started going to a STEM university (I'm from Europe), I basically had a talk with myself.  
If I can't have the women I want, I'll focus on myself and achieve other things and won't settle until I do. I started working out in HS, and seeing a visible change on my body, I for the first time felt like I was in control of something. I could change something, and that's what I did. I kept on working on myself thru out the university, mentally and physically, and I'm happy I did that.

A few girls, over the 10 year period, have shown interest in me, but I wasn't interested in them, I was focused on myself and on the women I wanted, but that didn't want me.

Now, at 26, I'm a very fit, tall guy. I'm 188cm tall (6'2), athletic, take care of my looks/clothes, I have a STEM degree and work as an IT engineer for a few years, have my place, drive a nice car, but I'm still alone.

I know those ""achievements"" won't get me the women I want, but I'm not getting looked at anywhere I go, and the more time passes, the less I feel like something is going to happen. I still feel like that 16 year old kid at times. 

I'm not motivated to chase women. I'd rather work on my career and stay single, rather than chase someone average that I don't really want. People ask me why won't I give someone a chance, but why am I not given a chance when I want one? The more time passes, the more bitter about relationships I'm becoming. I can remember all the women I've found appealing over the years, since there are just a few. And nothing happened with any of them.

I can't narrow the gap between the women I want and the women that want me. Or at least I don't know how. Fu\*k I'm going to die alone.

I personally get really turned off, because it makes me think the person is using me. Just a personal example: when I was young and dumb, a girl I had a crush on said we could go on a date if I bought her a video game. I did, then she said she *wasn't ready to date anyone,* never paid me back, and never spoke to me again.


I especially feel this way if we haven't even met in person yet. If she asks we have our first meeting at an expensive restaurant, I think she's only looking to get a fancy meal for free, and even if that's not the case, I'm not interested in spending $80 on dinner just to find out we have no chemistry.


I was talking with friends about dating and brought this up. For the most part they understood but a point they brought up is that we, as men, are in constant competition with other men during the dating phase, and someone who *does* follow through with buying gifts is going to have the advantage.

I am a 25M who has not dated in 10 years, and got out of a long relationship/marriage last year. I spent months working on myself, rediscovering hobbies, working out and getting fit, and focusing on myself and having fun. But I was close to starting a family before my divorce, and that is a huge want for me, so I want to get back out there.

I decided to try online dating out, got an account for tinder/bumble/hinge. At first I had a couple matches, nothing great but a start. Then nothing. Finding it weird, I asked my girl best friend to look over my profile and give me tips. She said that everything looked great, my personality showed well, and my pictures were giving me a good look, and she'd of swiped on me had we not known each other. Yet still, after several months, I have only been on one date and that girl only wanted attention. 

Being someone who works all the time, it is hard to find people that I don't work with (and the options are scarce at my workplace). I don't really go out, nor have the desire to look for a meaningful relationship at bars. I work so much I do not have time to attend my church much, so that's off the table. I want to meet someone naturally, so online dating really doesn't seem to be my thing, but having not dated in 10 years, I feel like my way of doing things is old school and doesn't work these days.

66,otyr47,1627569555,"I'm ""breaking up""","I (24) have been talking to a guy (34) for about a year, long distance, and we've seen each other twice : once in September and once in May, hooked up both times. This relationship is a mess. I love him from the bottom of my heart, but he doesn't reciprocate and I tried to discuss about it with him, to know if I should move on or if I can hope because I know I'm no catch and those things can take a while, but each time he couldn't give me a straight answer. So in February I misunderstood and thought I had a good chance: I let myself fall really in love. Then, in April, he was a bit drunk and he told me about the girl before me (A), two years ago, whom he loved and had a fling with but she found someone else and kindly told him they could still be friends. So they're still very much friends and he is still very much in love with her but doesn't want to acknowledge it. He couldn't tell me he and I were just a casual sex item, but I could hear it.

Now, in April, it shattered my heart. I took it pretty well on the phone and told him I was happy to spend some time with him anyway, but after that I stopped texting and proposing online dates, in an attempt to heal and move on. He didn't stop talking to me though, talked to me more than ever actually, and I responded politely until he asked if we could hang out again. Stupid me decided it wasn't so bad of an idea, I was feeling better already and we were still friends, and let's be honest, I kinda wanted to have sex with him because we are undoubtedly compatible. I was wrong, obviously, nothing was over for me, again: stupid. We spent the weekend together, like a cute couple, going out and cuddling and all, so when he left, hope came back. He then proceeded to crush it little by little, never reciprocating anything remotely affectionate I sent him. And then, this happens:
I had the occasion to plan a trip to go to him, and also I wasn't sure if or how I wanted to end our relation, I knew for sure I wanted to see him one last time. I decided we would talk about it face to face, better for everyone. Last week though, A called him to plan her birthday, saying she wanted him there, probably on the day I was coming mind you, so he asked if it was possible for her to do it next weekend but she seemed less happy about that. So he asked me, if I could come on another weekend. I was visibly unhappy about it but said yes, thinking I wouldn't go at all if it happened and I'd end everything on the phone. It hurt me so much to actually understand how little importance I had in his life. Turns out she has too much work, she can't party. So I'm still going. And I'm ""breaking up"" with him on our last day together, this weekend. I'm selfish, I want to be with him one last time. I can't take it anymore, I'm mentally in a much better place than a year ago and I can't let this relationship that doesn't even exist mess with my head. And my already broken heart.

I guess I'm just venting, I'm so sad. I feel like if we could've dated in person it would've been different. He is such a sweet man, so considerate and so passionate. At first, I thought he showed his affection in his actions, asking me how I am feeling, saying I can always talk to him, answering my texts and my calls, actually trying to be present when I need it. I was wrong. I feel bad that I saw something that wasn't there. I feel so stupid and embarrassed. I feel like the pain is never gonna really go away.

It's not about relationships. This is about dating after a relationship ends.

Basically, this is usually a period where people consider it disrespectful to date (at least publicly) after a long-term relationship ends.

Some feel there's a certain amount of time you have to wait. Some feel only the person who did the dumping has to wait. Some feel it doesn't matter (the second a relationship ends, anything is fair game).

I've seen a lot posts like ""I can't believe (s)he moved on so quickly,"" etc.

68,otz220,1627570541,Need help with planned date tonight!!!!,"So I have been talking to this girl (A) who I was been semi interested in that I planned a date with tonight. However the last 2 nights I went on 1 date with another  girl (B) where we hit it off so well and it was my best first date ever, we have so much in common share similar interests and passions. Everything felt right. Last night girl (B) asked me to see her again for a casual walk together and she ended up staying the night. No sex, just tons of making out deep conversation, everything seems to be going in the right direction and I think this could lead to something definitely more. We are not exclusive yet but we are going out again this weekend and depending on how that goes I may pose that question. 

Problem is I still have date planned with girl (A)  today who I am not even remotely interested at this point. I don’t want to lie to girl (B) and ruin anything that could happen because I really believe this could go somewhere. 

Yes I know we aren’t exclusive and I can date freely but I also don’t want to get caught up in an uncomfortable situation.

70,otznqv,1627572423,How to get into the dating scene (F23),"I'm 23 years old and I've never been in a relationship, had a fwb or even a proper date. 

I had my first kiss when I was 19 with a 21 y/o while I was working abroad in Spain during the summer - we were celebrating one of my coworkers' birthday at his place and he was one of his friends.
He asked me to hang out alone a couple of times after that, but we didn't click at all and run out of things to say pretty quickly so we ended up ghosting each other.
I haven't kissed a anyone ever since.

When I got back to university I decided I was gonna start dating around, but then Covid happened and I took all of my classes online until graduation, so I didn't really get the chance to meet anyone. 

I would ask my friends to introduce me to someone, but they basically only hang out with me and they're not big into dating either - one of them just found her first boyfriend at age 21, while the other one is 23 and hasn't dated since high school. They also don't like clubbing or drinking, so that's not an option either (I tried to go alone to a pub once and I felt so uncomfortable). Then again, it's not very safe to hang out in crowded places at the moment.

I moving out of town soon tho to start my master's degree and since I'm gonna have classes on campus I really wanna do better and meet new people and maybe go on some dates... I just don't know how. I really struggle to socialise, but I wanna do my best.

So, any tips on how to go about this? What should I do? How do I meet guys and eventually ask them out/get them to ask me out? What's the etiquette for dating? Anything I should be aware of?

ps: I'm not against casual relationships, but I need to feel comfortable with someone first since I've never done anything like this, therefore I would like tips on how to meet people in real life and not through dating apps since they are mostly used for one night stands here and you don't really get to know the other person much beforehand.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otznqv/how_to_get_into_the_dating_scene_f23/
71,otzu7s,1627572978,"My boyfriend has started liking other girls selfies more frequently, and it's bothering me. Do i have any right to feel this way?","Me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 months. In the beginning, here and there i'd notice he'd like some photo of a girl he knows and not think twice about it. This stuff popped up periodically on my discovery feed, and I never went looking for it... it was just something I noticed a couple of times as i scrolled through it. The photos were usually of their cool travel experiences or something that was genuinely interesting... but his engagement on social media is pretty minimal. 

Lately however, I was triggered a bit when a picture popped up in my feed of a very pretty woman that I believe he met when he was at an F1 race. I saw that he had left a comment on this girls bikini photo, referencing some inside joke from when he was out there a couple years ago. She didn't reply to it, but it was a bit startling for me just because he goes on about how much of a waste of time social media is, and he rarely posts let alone comments on anything. When I looked back at her feed, he had suddenly started liking all her selfies. 

He hasn't posted any pics of me and him together and at this point he hasn't told me that he loves me but he does treat me exceptionally well. For instance, he bought me some brand new camping gear last week as an early birthday gift and we are headed off for a backcountry trip this week. He spends money and his time on me, and has introduced me to friends and family. Unfortunately because it is out of character for him to comment on peoples pictures, let alone other women... the sting it caused made me do a deep dive into his friends list and noticed that specifically within the last month or two, the only photos he's ever liked are of other women, usually very pretty women that he knows, and only their selfies. His friends photos? Meh. Very few interactions. One girl in particular had about 6 selfies in a row and then a photo of her and her boyfrined. He liked all the photos of her except the one with her boyfriend. 

While I don't compare myself to these woman, it made me feel like maybe he was keeping his options open by offering up validation to these other girls. He told me early on in the relationship that he has never had much luck with women, which I found confusing as my view of him is that he is a great catch. Super kind and hardworking. Another reason it makes me fearful is that I come from a highly religious family and have a sour relationship with my parents as they rejected my decision to not attend church anymore when i was in my early 20's. Sometimes I worry this makes him second guess whether we are right for each other as he has a loving family who were happy to meet me, and my parents will likely never accept him... or would at least try to sabotage the relationship if they could. I have made it clear to him that they don't play a part in influencing my relationship choices, and that I will not put my partner in a position to be hurt by people who are behaving intolerant and irrational. It truly sucks because if i could change the situation... I would. But there are definitely women out there with better families that he could be a part of, and that reality really hurts me. 

 It made me wonder if he'd leave me if any of these women reached out to him (or he reached out to them and they reciprocated) and expressed interest. This likely shows that I think very little of myself, but I felt really sad mostly because I am extremely conscious about all my interactions with men, whether strangers or friends... just in case the wrong impression is given. I've been cheated on before, twice actually, and I know how confusing and devastating it can be when someone has no interest in respecting you or telling you the truth. I never want to give anyone any reason to think I don't have their best interests at heart, and I feel I am falling for my boyfriend pretty hard at this point.. 

 I want to stress I have no bitterness towards any of these beautiful women.  As it stands, there is nothing on his account to signify he has a girlfriend, and I think this fact makes me anxious that he is leaving himself open to better options by presenting as single. All i know is that any time a dude who has a girlfriend likes my selfies, or comments under them, i lose respect for him and feel bad for his girlfriend. Perhaps I am overthinking it, but I'd just appreciate some insight.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otzu7s/my_boyfriend_has_started_liking_other_girls/

I went on a first date yesterday with a hinge guy and I felt like we had a similar enough sense of humor so I was just trying to be myself. I was probably a bit cold since I was nervous and I noticed he rolled his eyes at a couple things I said but I wasn’t really sure why. I don’t feel like anything I said was horribly mean or anything.

After the date I texted him since I forgot to thank him for dinner in person and he told me I act different in person and am “a bit rude”. I apologized and told him it wasn’t my intention and asked him how I was rude because I didn’t feel like I was but want to know so I can change that if I genuinely was a bad date lol! That was last night and he still hasn’t responded today. 

I honestly feel bad because usually I offer to pay for myself on dates but I figured I’d go out with him again and could pay for us that time since that’s usually what I do with guys I go on multiple dates with.

77,ou0hzd,1627575020,Didn't communicate clearly that I liked her now shes not interested?,"Met this girl online a month ago and after 2 weeks of talking she invites me to come visit her (she lives a few states away). Ended up seeing her 1.5 weeks ago and we spent the whole weekend together. Felt very natural with her and we were practically acting like a couple that whole weekend--hand holding, kissing, etc (all of which she initiated first btw). We both said we had a lot of fun and enjoyed the weekend and before I left she said she was so glad I came to see her and to keep in touch. However, earlier that day I asked if she wanted to come visit me next and she didn't really say/was hesitant so I assumed that I was maybe moving too fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next 7 days after that we just texted back and forth about small stuff--I didn't really mention the weekend with her and neither did she, but I did make some jokes about some stuff we learned about each other when hanging out. I wasn't sure what the next move was after having visited her because I didn't want to say something and have it backfire from me appearing to be moving too fast, so I played it a bit slow. 

&amp;#x200B;

But this monday I asked to come visit her again because I wanted to clarify where we stood and of course to spend time with her. And then she hit me with a curveball saying she really had a great time with me but wished I had expressed in more detail how I felt about her and hanging out with her. I realized shes right and that I shouldve made it more clear, so I told her how I actually felt and that I wanted to spend more time with her. But I think shes convinced that Im not interested or something because now shes leaning towards not wanting anything romantic (but has not said this definitively). The thing is I really do like her and its clear she felt the same way... But we had just met 4 weeks ago so I didnt want to make the wrong move too fast. I figured my way of escalating things was asking to see her again a week after we had hung out. Im not really sure what to do now. I told her Ill give her space to think about it but it makes no sense to me as we both like each other and this seems like something that can be easily fixed? Its not that I was talking to other girls last week or something, its just that I wasnt 100% sure how she felt so I decided to play it safe and take things a bit slow.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou0hzd/didnt_communicate_clearly_that_i_liked_her_now/

For the first part of me knowing her she already had a BF but would never mention him. Got a little weird when she would tell me shes going on vacation with friends when actually she went with him and so on. Then I finally found out from her and met him at an event. In the past 5 months or so things kind of changed a little. She suddenly added me all over social media and we started texting a lot more often and messaging more often (usually banter or light flirting) (went from 0 interaction outside of work to every week).

At work it's usually very fun. We flirt with her. A lot of these interactions are started by her. She playfully calls me names or teases me. Sometimes she gets pretty touchy where she holds my hand or grabs my arm.

One thing I noticed is that she gets pretty territorial or jealous when I interact with other girls who are single. For example, if i start talking with one of them she will swoop in and interrupt or stand super close to us and listen. Once i was chatting and flirting with another girl and she sat beside us and was staring at a blank computer screen (lol). Another time I was hanging out with another girl coworker outiside of work and posted her on my snap story and she kept asking me where we met and what we did and so on.

83,ou12t2,1627576808,I am depressed,"Hallo internet. I am married with kids. My wife cheated me 2 years ago, she was cheating for almost a year. I was a good husband, earning tons of money, driving amazing cars, giving her lots of attention (I am a romantic and emotional guy, giving her lots of gifts and money). She was with me when we did not have anything, when we were poor. She cheated with my friend. I was a really good looking muscular, tall guy, who graduated and post-graduted with honors. She told me that she made a mistake and I forgave her because I am crazy in love with her (highschool sweethearts). Unfortunatelly, after I forgave her she remained the same: cold, almodt never interested in me. She is sometimes happy with me, but in most cases she is just yelling on me, nervous etc. In most cases she says that she loves me and rarely she gives me attention.

Now, because of all of this I am depressed for two years, and I think that now I am in a big deppression for several months. I have suicidal toughts, I gained weight and I ma crying all the time.

My whole world crashed that day and I never recovered. She was not there to support me by being gentle, nice to me and by showing affection. I do not feel loved nor appreciated, and we only have sex like 2-3 times a month. I am in my late twenties, we married young.

I tried talking with her but she gets nervous, start yelling and saying really bad words which hurt me. I was a sportsman, black belt, so I do not fail in that part. I tried ti be perfect but now I am in a big deppression. Every day I think of killing myself, but I cant do that to my kids.

I was also very religious, not strict in any way, but I loved  the calm heart when praying. I left religion after all of this.

My deppression is so hard that sometimes I just stare at wall being lonely and sad. I tried talking with specialized people for many months, but nothing saved me. I started smoking  alot and I am thinking of starting drinking, eventhough I am afraid that if I do that that will end me forever and I want to be saved from this state.

I cant say that she does not love me, because I think that she does but she almost never shows it. I am crying my soul out while writing this. I know I need help, but I do not know how to help myself, I just want to be loved, appreciated and happy. I can't sleep in most nights because I am so sad.

We are in our early 20s and it was my 3rd first date ever. I was nervous since I had such little experience. I made her laugh in the car ride there but conversation was still awkward and clunky and there were silences. We had bought lunch beforehand so we had lunch in beach and built sandcastles. Then we took a hike and explored a bit and then we drove to a cute waterfront town where we explored and got sweets at a shop.

The conversation was still awkward with pauses but we decided to go another beach an hour away. When we got there I asked her to make a sand heart and she did and then we did some dancing on the shore. When we sat back down it was cold and I put my arm around her and i managed to kiss her on the cheek and then the lips, then a few times. We got into a makeout session on the sand and French kissed and then laid down next to each other on the sand holding hands but it was cold and the sunset I came to watch with her wasn’t for another hour or more so I decided to go back to the car with her.

In my car we went at it made out my head in her lap but we decided to drive back and she kept kissing my hand while I was driving. In the freeway she gave me hickeys and had her arm around me. Then when we got back to where she had her car she made out more with me but nothing really sexual then we kissed more walking to her car and that was it. She said we could see each other again and that she had a great time.  I am just a 5’6 guy without a muscular build who is shy

Now he's calling me every night he works since he went back to third shift and we talk for hours about everything. We've both opened up to each other a lot. We've seen each other a few times since and it's always me going to his house to play a game and then we make out. Any other time I see him is him stopping by my house while he's on shift to say hi. A mutual friend of ours brought my name up to him when they were hanging out and he said that he cheesed really hard at the mention of me and then immediately went back into bro mode, like, ""Yeah man, anyway....""

I kind of thought we were getting somewhere finally. He was never this open with me before, but now he's got a date on Friday and it really bothers me.

Younger girl I've been crushing on for nearly a year found out a lot of embarrassing stuff about my childhood, what I did, how I behaved etc. I was also an ADHD fat kid with frequent rage outbursts bullying other kids, throwing chairs out the window. I was stupid and vulnerable and didn't watch my tongue in front of her best friend (we were hanging outside with our mutual friend; my crush wasn't there). I managed to slip somehow. Of course she told her. As far as I know, her best friend also told my friend I'd be a cool fit for her. I managed to overshare shit about me and actually open up emotionally. It wasn't no gay vent to a girl, I just spoke too much about myself, I was laughing about it anyway and we had a good time. But it was very cringey in my eyes, especially me being a man and usually keeping stuff like this to myself. The less they know, the better the chance.

To make things even worse her brother was my classmate in elementary. We are in good relations and almost neighbours. He probably confirmed a lot of the stories if she ever asked him. I feel like she sees through me now, maybe that's an insecurity? I want to ask her out but I was never in a situtation where the girl I'm infatuated by knows a lot of my cringey past. She's very beautiful, one of the best looking girls her age. But she's shy, introverted, works out at the gym hard and doesn't seem to trust a lot of people. Maybe because she has 3 or 4 brothers. I felt like she was avoiding me like the plague at first, but all of a sudden I realized we pass by each other a lot in the neighbourhood, at the gym she's smiling always when she sees me etc. She didn't behave like this before. She was very cold before so this is weird.

Keep in mind, I've met with her friend a couple of times later after that cringey night and we had a blast each time. Maybe I unintentionally fixed what I fucked up and now she sees me as a fun guy now. This COULD BE! But she could also easily see me as a weirdo. Easily. I can't lie, I've had my awkward moment. She was also the 'weird silent kid' once and wasn't really pretty. She always seemed to stick to the corners and walls and she was scared of anyone.

Again, not insecure, but I have to admit that reality is sometimes not advantageous to your situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou1lbt/dating_as_a_short_dude/
90,ou1pzb,1627578780,Anyone else notice this?,"I’m a 29M Asian American and my entire adult life I’ve noticed that dating has been extraordinarily hard for me.

There is a lot of systematic racism in place that suggests that people like me aren’t desirable in the bedroom or otherwise, and it shows in mainstream media and so on.

I’ve been on dating apps for seven years, with very little results. I’ve tried every permutation of profile there is, many different kinds of pictures, but to no avail. If I change it to one of my white friends, immediately the matches start to happen.

Recently, I tried to date this this one (white) woman (28F). I was completely enamored with her, and she liked me some but didn’t want to commit. She freely continued a preexisting sugar daddy relationship and went on multiple dates with other and even went to poly meetups while we were talking. Which is all fine and good, but it just continues to show me how out of the dating world I really am. I don’t have the opportunities that are afforded to others.

Anyone else noticed this? What can I do to change this? I know that confidence is huge in dating but these sort of events really damage how I feel. And also, confidence doesn’t really play a role in dating apps, it just is how it is. Very frustrating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou1pzb/anyone_else_notice_this/

I (31M) have been seeing this girl (26F) for 8 months now - and we have been officially dating for 3 months. Her birthday is in a few weeks. She loves the outdoors and loves a good thrill. I would like to give her an 'experience' for her birthday. I was wondering - would it be too much to do a helicopter ride? I just don't want to do too much too fast, if that makes sense.

92,ou1uag,1627579132,Defining the r after a Holiday,"So I’ve been going out with this guy for approximately 2 months. For context, we know each other pretty well as we’ve been friends for over 2 years but I was previously in a relationship and never had much interest even after I broke up with my ex. He always showed some interest and so after he broke up he started asking me out etc. We finally decided to start properly dating and it’s been going really well. Last month we decided to go exclusive and now I think it’s gotten to the point where we should define the r or just end it (what’s the point of being in this intermediate phase longer??). 

We spoke about this and decided we would make a decision after the trip we had booked (next week). However, I am now having massive second thoughts about this and dreading this trip more than anything. What should I do?

For context, I personally don’t think that labelling something is a massive but I feel that he thinks it’s a huge commitment (ie needs to be the person I want to marry etc) which is why I’m more relaxed about taking the next step. He has also shared that he is really attracted to me and interest but he doesn’t feel it’s a whirlwind romance kind of feelings (to which I say, this ain’t Hollywood but fair enough) which perhaps explains his hesitation. If he doesn’t like me enough that he’s willing to rubber stamp the commitment should I not just end it before this trip or at least say we need to discuss and define beforehand?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou1uag/defining_the_r_after_a_holiday/
93,ou1wtb,1627579332,Does anyone get jealous of people who can date without dating apps?,"Hi everyone! 

I’m a 20 year old female and I have been using dating apps for years. But I have never found a serious relationship from them. I’ve met a lot of people I’ve had many first dates and some flings. But never what I want which is a relationship. I get jealous of my friends who find their partners so easily like at school, work or a party. But I have never had that kind of luck. I’ve been hit on in public but it’s never by people I find attractive. My own twin sister found her current boyfriend of 2 years in her first year of collage and they went to high school together. She never had to go through the trail and tribulations of dating and dating apps. And I’m jealous I talk to her about my dating life all the time and she doesn’t see how hard it is for me. A lot of people I’ve met never exactly want a relationship it’s always something casual or nothing serious right now. I would still go on dates with those people in hopes they would change there mind once they met me. But they never do. I’m tired on going on so many first dates. Im tired on being on the apps. I just get jealous when I hear of people who met there partners in there real life. I just never had that luck. Some of these people will even judge me for trying to find a partner on a dating app. I just never had luck meeting someone in my everyday life. I really think it comes down to luck. Or being at the right place at the right time. I don’t know I crave a long term relationship so badly. Im afraid I’m just going to be in a endless loop of going on first dates or dating people who will never commit to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou1wtb/does_anyone_get_jealous_of_people_who_can_date/

And you really, really feel like texting your ex asking for clarity, but EVERYONE on the dating subs says don't do that.

What's the big deal if you do?  Sure they may not owe me an explanation, but in a way I sometimes feel like I'm owed at least something out of decency other than a cliche ""wasn't feeling a connection.""

95,ou1zhn,1627579555,Crush that rejected me because of neediness is strangely kind to me again. What to do?,"22M. Got infatuated by a younger girl I haven't seen since elementary. She was a shy, awkward and introverted kid that didn't trust a lot of people and I saw her at the gym after 8 years. I was instantly amazed at what I saw. First chick to infatuate me. And so fast! She became a real woman. And a fucking hot one too. Asked her out via IG, she initially showed interested and told me I seem kind. Of course I was melted by the compliment and started to show neediness through a very cringey double text. I was blinded by emotion. I thought it couldn't happen to me and she was my first crush. I got rejected by many girls because of embarrassment but I never cared about it, so I thought it wouldn't affect me.

I was wrong. She left me on seen and was avoiding me for a couple of months. I've met her best friend a few months after she rejected me and we hanged out a couple of times. We had a nice time each time, but once some private information about my cringey childhood slipped out of my mouth. Real embarrassing shit. Shit I need therapy for, especially as a man. On top of that, her brother was my classmate in elementary and he also knows embarrassing shit about me. Like being a bully with ADHD, constantly misbehaving, arguing with teachers, having rage outbursts, etc...

Of course I thought my world came to an end and ended up depressed and also started to avoid her because I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable. We ended up passing by each other a couple of times and she showed me an unusual smile, she's saying hi all the time. She always used to pull that cold look and went by me as if I didn't exist. After she rejected me, I didn't really try texting her again and wasn't giving her any attention. After her best friend told her about me, it seems like she has a different vibe on herself, but I don't want to count on anything. Also there is not so much awkward tension between us even if we meet each other at the gym. I even caught her looking at me once or twice. But it can't be I'm only imagining right? One of my friends has told me she approached him and asked him how he's doing etc. Keep in mind, this chick NEVER does that. He suspects it could have something to do with me. The situation is very, very weird and I don't know what to do about it. Her behavior has sure changed, but I don't know if it's to make a clown out of me or maybe something sparked her interest.

What to do, how to approach this as carefully as possible? We haven't spoken a word in person yet and she is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. It's been a year. And yes, I realize I can get rejected.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou1zhn/crush_that_rejected_me_because_of_neediness_is/
96,ou20un,1627579670,Orbiting,"For anyone unfamiliar with the term in the dating world, orbiting is when an individual (an ex, a fling, a flame) ceases direct contact yet interacts with the person's social media through likes/views/comments.  It sounds simple but it can cause a lot of confusion and heartache for the person on the receiving end.

My question is - do you have experience with this?  Have you ever left someone on read yet interacted with their social media?  How come? 

No hard feels about it; I truly want to better understand this. I might be getting old or something.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou20un/orbiting/

I think I’m falling down that rabbit hole.,"I’m 22 and turning 23 in a few months and I’ve had no luck with girls. I feel so hopeless. I’ve been trying to date and hookup since I was 16 and now I’m about to be 23 without even having my first kiss. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I feel so miserable because of this. I’m a good guy, I’m in decent shape, I don’t think I’m too ugly looking, I just can’t figure out where I’m going wrong.

I don’t want to die a virgin, I don’t want to die never knowing love, I just don’t know where to find a girl that likes me. I don’t go for girls out of my league, I go after the plainish looking girls that seem nice and I can’t even get a girls number let alone a date. I feel like such a loser. All of my friends are getting laid, dating around or with partners and I’m the one freak that can’t even get a text back.

In trying to find some guys that are in similar situations I found incells and I kinda got sucked in. I think part of me is starting to believe some of what they say. I don’t hate women or anything but it’s frightening how much I feel like what I say applies to me and some of my friends both male and female.

I feel like if this keeps going on I’ll end up fully one of them. I don’t see any girl giving me a chance to prove I’d be a good partner or a girl being attracted enough to me for a fling.

I don’t know how to get those thoughts out of my head.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou24iv/the_more_i_try_and_fail_the_more_i_think_im/

My birthday is next Thursday but he's camping with his family that weekend. I was supposed to come down to stay with him from tonight through Monday or Tuesday considering that (we had this planned all month) but he told me earlier this week he was trying to see if he could get out of working this Saturday to go to a family reunion, and then said yesterday he might just end up wanting to be alone all weekend instead.

I was still planning on driving down to his town this weekend anyway even if things got canceled, as most of my relatives also live there and I was going to pick up my birthday gift from my Grandpa.

I didn't want to immediately drive back home afterward considering the distance, so I was trying to figure out if and how I should bring up asking to stay with him for at least one night without potentially making things uncomfortable. He did already say though that we could hang out if I do still end up driving there since he's had my birthday gift ready for 2-3 months.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ou28b0/wondering_about_a_safe_way_i_can_ask_my_long/
