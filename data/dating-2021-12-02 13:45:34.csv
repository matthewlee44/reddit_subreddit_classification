0,r7fkbk,1638474372,"Men, how did you fall for other women if your ex surprisingly checked every box you could have ever wanted?","It’s been over a year, and I have found myself going on a lot of dates. 

The issue is, a lot of these women are decent, as in they’re the kind of women I could have seen myself be interested in a few years ago. The issue is, I have a hard time dealing with the feeling of “downgrading” as crass as it might sound.

My ex checked boxes that are very hard to check, and I honestly didn’t know I’d ever meet someone who checked all these boxes, because of how statistically hard it is to find someone who:
- same age, tall
- Is your exact type physically
- Has a similar sex interest (weirder stuff)
- as social and as emotional as you are
- Confident and dominant (very rare)
- Has the same intellectual interests (that’s hard)
- You both love/play the same sport, which you could share for the rest of your lives together (this is huge for me)
- Has a similar career, so same finances and flexibility, and we can relate/understand each other’s work
- Both have the same love languages, same wants out of life, same philosophy

Before meeting her my standards were lower because I just didn’t think it was realistic to wait for someone that had all these things. Now that I did get someone like this, it’s messing with my head.

To top it all off, she’s easily the most attractive women I’ve ever dated. Most of the other women I dated, it took me a while to warm up to them, so after a few months post breakup, the love wore off and I could see they weren’t that attractive. I thought my ex was a 10/10 the second I saw her.
The breakup was mostly my fault, so the whole “you’ll eventually realize she wasn’t good for you” won’t work. I got into a personal slump and put in no effort.


I feel like I now have such a high standard, because I tell myself if I already was with someone who checked all those boxes why would I settle for someone who doesn’t.

They might check maybe three of those boxes at best, and statistically it will be almost impossible to find someone who checks all of those ever again. 

I’m worried about becoming the kind of person who will go on to marry and have kids with someone who is definitely very decent but I will deep down always kick myself, knowing I could’ve had someone who would have done XYZ with me out of her own want, while I have to drag my wife to do it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7fkbk/men_how_did_you_fall_for_other_women_if_your_ex/

I offered to pick her up around 8:15 for an 8:30 reservation downtown (where I live). She said something like “that would work but I live in *suburb*, should I meet you there?” I replied that works for me if it does for you. Then no reply for 20 minutes or so, and then she said “ok I’ll meet you there then”. Should I have offered to still pick her up? Didn’t want to be weird and press it but wondering if that is making things inconvenient for her. She lives about 30 min from downtown. Also didn’t know she lived there when I picked the spot/offered to pick her up.

&amp;#x200B;

6,r7gabf,1638476318,Am I being ghosted? What do I do?,"So I met this girl in one of my university classes few months back. We only talked once back then but the conversation was great and we had few common interests. So she just got stuck in my mind and I decided to reconnect with her about 3 weeks ago.
We hit it off immediately.
We had our first date later in the same week and it went absolutely faantaastiic. She even kissed me at the end of it and we couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Again, everything was going great.
Few days later she asked me to meet her again, because she really wanted me to meet her friends. I was working that day and was super exhausted and just didn't look my best, so I told her no. She kept telling me that she really wanted me to meet them and how important it was for her. So I met them and things went great. There was not one moment of awkwardness or anything, we just hit it off. She seemed really happy and told me that her friends like me alot the next day.
Few days goes by, we continue our normal everyday conversations and then we go on a second date. Now the day before this date, we had a little argument/miscommunication, whatever you wanna call it. So we clear that confusion up on that day and she tells me that she likes me alot and that she wants me to know it. She also brings me a poster of a musician I really like, because I had mentioned that I liked that musician the day before. It was a suupeer sweet thing to do and I just melted right then and there.
So, I tell her that I like her too and that date went great.
In a few days she invites me over to one of her friends house, because all of her friends got together and she wanted me there. Also asked me to bring my friend if I wanted to.
So I bring my friend and we go about an hour later. We go inside the house and it's a complete disaster. Two of her friends are already drunk. We also drank a few glasses of wine but nothing serious. We hang out for a little while and it gets kinda late and one of her friends has to go home. So we all go outside and since this friend lives close by, we decide to walk her to her house. And we do.
This whole time she's being distant. She doesn't talk much, make eye contact or anything. Once we go outside she comes over to me to hold hands a few times, but I can tell she doesn't really want to, so I don't make any moves and keep at distance.
We walk this girl home, and then we decide it's getting late and me and my friend should also head home. So we get to walking and this whoolee time her and her friends just don't stop talking. They're not even trying to include me and my friend and it's just all getting chaotic. I'm uncomfortable and I know my friend is too. 
So we walk to my friends house bc she lives nearby and we invite the girls in. We make some tea and just sit to talk. Again, we aren't talking, but they are. And it's getting super uncomfortable because her friend keeps telling some verryy personal stories and me and my friend just don't know how to react. About two hours pass like this and then they go home.
She didn't kiss me this time which I found super weird because she always does. No goodnight text that night, no nothing.
The next day I wait for her to text me in the morning - nothing. So I figure she must be busy or something and only text her at night. I asked her if everything was alright and she tells me that everything's fine and she was just really busy that day. Her texts seem very dry and different from how she usually is. So I leave it at that.
The next day - still nothing. So in the evening I text her and tell her something's really bothering me and I wanna talk about it. She texts back immediately and she's a little bit panicked. So we talk about it and get into a little argument. The next day I text her to apologize and she says that everything's fine. The convo stops there.
I admit our last meeting did not go so well but apart from that everything's been going really great.
It's been two days now since then and she hasn't contacted me.
We used to talk everyday, meet up. She was always so caring and sweet. Goodmorning/goodnight texts, flirting, texting non-stop all day about everything and anything and so on.
I really miss her already.
How can someone go from all of that to this? If you really liked a person you wouldn't do this, right? 
She made it very clear that she was really into me and now everything turned into this?
I don't know if I did something wrong and I don't know if I should text her. I don't want to seem desperate but I also really need the closure because I keep thinking about her and I'm really anxious as to why it's happening.
What do I do guys, any advice will be appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7gabf/am_i_being_ghosted_what_do_i_do/
7,r7gee6,1638476619,Advice wanted,"Alright apologies in advance for any seemingly dumb questions or things that are common sense. Any advice is appreciated!   
So to start, I turn 18 in about 2 days. I moved to a new state at the start of the pandemic and haven’t been able to meet, well, anyone. Covid + doing entirely online school does not give you many chances at meeting &amp; making friends.  
I’ve never exactly had a girlfriend or even been on a date. Haven’t had my firsts, either (no shame, I’d rather not rush). I’ve been asked out by a fair share of guys but never taken anyone up on the offer since I’m very much a lesbian.  

How should I get started? I do have a couple social events coming up with others my age so maybe there? Or would an app be a good way to meet others, whether to date or just be friends.  
I also don’t exactly have many nice clothes - I still haven’t fully unpacked since moving and mostly just have graphic tees, skinny jeans, and leggings. I do have a nice pair of boots at least. Should I try to dig out some plaid shirts I have ? They’re a button up &amp; do looks nicer than my usual tee. Or is it a better idea to just find a few nice shirts at Walmart or target or something?   

Would it be inappropriate/weird to bring a small gift? I do a lot of crafts and tend to show my love &amp; appreciation through giving small handmade gifts. For people I don’t know too well it’s usually something simple like a small figurine of their favorite animal. Is this weird? I mean if I’m meeting up with them then I’ve probably spent a good few days/weeks chatting and like them as a person so far.  

And lastly, where are some good places for a first date? If I’m meeting someone off the internet then I’d definitely want somewhere public. Starbucks is pretty typical so I’d assume that’s fine. Would a small little Italian ice place be good? Or going to the zoo? I don’t know a lot of places here - would it be better to let them choose?

8,r7gf51,1638476678,34 (f) with older kids dating 26 (m) no kids,"6 months out of a 2 year relationship (38 m). The relationship fell apart due to me not wanting more kids. Been very clear that I do not want more. My kids are 14 and 12. Everyone my age is getting married and having kids now. My life is headed into a new chapter. I can have kids, I don’t want more. 

Essentially my heart was broken in this last relationship as he ended things abruptly, stating above differences. I’m not really on the prowl or doing anything to find someone. 

Fast forward to present day .. 6 months later. Organically meet a financial advisor that works at my bank (met over a year ago while in past relationship. Clear chemistry. Even switch advisors), he gets a new position so he’s not my advisor any longer or at my bank. Sends multiple DMs via social media. Begs for a date. I eventually say sure why not. We kind of know one another, movie date. I’m bored anyways. 

How and why the sparks fly out of control is beyond me. I’ve never dated a younger man nor been attracted to one. Ever. So I’m trying my best to keep calm. But what the heck do I do? He’s likely gonna want kids one day. He says he doesn’t know. Well in 5 years when he’s 31 that could easily be an option for him to leave. Find what he’s looking for as he matured. He’s says he’s smitten and doesn’t want anyone else. Haven’t crossed the lines. It’s been 3 weeks. The chemistry is UNREAL. 

Take it day by day? Cut my losses early and assume we aren’t aligned? Waste another 2 years of my life? 

I have a great job, financially independent, homeowner, mentally stable, attractive. What’s wrong with me?! Just looking for perspective. Let me know any info you might need to weigh in!

9,r7ggsr,1638476800,"He ghosted me, now what do I do?","TLDR; this guy that I was actually really into ghosted me, and I don't know if I should reach back out to tell him I'm not interested, or forget about it. 

I (24 F) was set up with this guy (35 M) by a mutual friend. We both work in healthcare, into fitness, and love animals, so we had some things in common. We met up for coffee, and I honestly really liked him, but I got mixed/weird vibes from him. It was hard to tell if he was looking for a serious relationship (I was), or if he was just looking for companionship. I asked him what he was looking for and he told me that he was ""okay if he never ended up finding someone"", and I told him that I too, didn't have expectations. I was fully expecting to never hear from him again after this coffee date, and when we left, we didn't make plans for a second date. 

The next day, he didn't text me for the entire day so I knew it was likely game over. But then, miraculously out of the blue he reached out 2 days after the coffee date (one day of 0 conversation), and asked to go out again on Friday. We went out, things were much better than date one. Lots to talk about and I genuinely felt a good connection. Two nights later, he asked to hang out again. Weather was terrible so we ordered Skip and watched a movie. You know what comes next. We ended up having sex which also was amazing, and I even joked, ""we probably shouldn't have done this a week after coffee because you'll probably never talk to me again"".

He texted me the next day, and subsequently we did text basically every day that week intermittently. We went on another date the Friday night, didn't have sex, and all felt okay. After this Friday date though, he totally went awol and hasn't talked to me since. It has now been 4 days without a text from him, and I did notice that since the beginning of this week, if I didn't send the message first, he didn't initiate the conversation. Obviously, there's someone else, or he just isn't into it. And I'm not gonna chase anyone. 

Where I struggle is, given that we went on 4 dates, and had sex. Do I say something? Or do I just let it go? I'm NOT desperate, but I am disappointed. I genuinely liked him and I felt like he obviously didn't want anything right now, got what he wanted and now he's dipping.

21,r7hhpu,1638479637,she's being incredibly confusing,"Sorry this is long, I wanted to provide details as the situation is weird, tldr at bottom tho

We're both 16, and I have two classes with her. I realize I have bit of a crush on her, so I start to pay a bit of attention to her. I seem to notice her glancing my direction a few times too, and I realized it seems she's looking at me when one time I was working in the hall alone and she looked over her shoulder. We would occasionally make eye contact, but I tried to never look directly at her cause that gets weird and creepy.

So, I go sit at her table in the other class as she sits with my friends, and its not weird to do so in that class. The first day, I ask the group if I should stay there or go back to my other seat, and she's the first one to tell me to stay. Normally she's kinda shy and talks quietly, so this kinda surprised me.

We have a good bit in common, we both play soccer, similar classes, that sort of thing. I could get her to laugh, but that was when everybody else did too. She would pay attention to me when I was over there though, she'd lean over the table to see if I was coming over, she'd pay attention to me whenever the other girl at the table was talking to see if I was listening to her, and she would bring up stuff like when a sub said my name wrong, even when I wasn't her table when the sub did so.

So, I figure it's time to ask for her number. I do so after class one day, and I text her then so she has my number too. I text her that weekend a couple days after, and no response. I then figure oh well, she's not really that interested.

But then she's staring even more. There was a time when we were out in the hall in groups, and she kept looking over her shoulder, and when I moved behind her other shoulder she repeatedly was looking over that shoulder. In the first class, whenever she gave thoughts about a poem or something she was looking at me out the corner of her eye, and not the teacher who is on the complete other side of the classroom.On top of that, she was glancing more and sometimes touching her hair when doing so, which I didn't previously notice. Again, I tried to not make eye contact and be creepy.

We moved tables in the second class, so I no longer had an excuse to go talk to her. I did manage to catch her before lunch one day, and I asked her why she didn't respond. She apologized and said she was at a soccer game and so she couldn't respond, but that doesn't make a lot of sense as she was staring since then and could've texted back later. A little while goes by, and she's still staring. I don't know a good time to talk to her, so I decide to text her again, I ask if she didn't respond because she didn't want me to text her, again no response.

But ever since then, she's been staring excessively, a lot more than previously. With the new seats in the second class, she looks past me before the whiteboard, and the day after I texted her I could see her pause for a moment when she had an angle to look at me any time she look from her paper to the board, and back. I'm not exaggerating here, she must've looked at the board 20 times that day and every time she paused for a moment.

She was messing with her hair repeatedly in each class, glancing repeatedly, angling herself towards me, and sometimes staring for a few seconds. Yesterday we got moved around for discussion, and I ended up directly across from her if she turned her head to the right, and she was glancing that way a couple times when she was supposed to be talking with her group. The teacher was behind her, so she just turned to the right in her seat when the teacher was talking so she could look, but instead was looking straight at me most of the time. I know she was looking at me, I looked at her 3 times and each time we made eye contact, she would then look away after a moment, and shortly after she'd be staring again.

The day before thanksgiving, I figure I should maybe try to talk to her before we have a few days off, and so I stare back a bit too. I think she noticed, as that day she was walking really slow in front of me after class, idiotically i didn't want to approach her from behind so I just slowed down too. In the second class I ended up with a group of people who wanted to talk about a test, and she could've passed us and left, but instead stopped to look at her phone and left with our group. I was going to talk to her when the group left, but she went home early so again I feel like an idiot. Walking back after the fire drill the other day she ended up next to me, i'm not sure if that was on purpose, but she was talking to someone and went back into the door first so I didn't get to talk to her.

tldr girl was staring at me a little bit, I go talk to her during class. It goes well, I can get her to laugh, she seeming pays a bit extra attention, and told me to stay at her table. I ask for her number, text her, no response. Talk to her about it, she says sorry, text again no response. After second text she's staring excessively, and I haven't talked to her as tables have moved.

I know what I need to do, I'm really just asking if someone can explain what's going on. All I can do is find a time to talk to her. Problem is, I don't know when to do that.

22,r7horx,1638480184,Advice for entering LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP (LDR),"Hello everyone,

I'm sure there a million of these posts on this sub but here's another one for good measure! All advice and opinions will be 100% appreciated, thanks in advance.

For context, my SO and I have been in a relationship for four months and will be entering into a long distance relationship at the end of December at this point for a foreseeable period of a year - with maybe a few weeks of actually seeing each other throughout the year.

What advice, if any would you recommend we take? What aspects of the relationship should we question each other on? What tough topics should we discuss with one another prior to going long distance?

We'll soon have a serious sit down discussion about how to effectively manage the relationship at a distance and would love to see if there is something I'm missing and what tips we could utilize to strengthen the relationship to last throughout the possible year.

TLDR: Help us with by sharing some tips and advice on how to efficiently move into a dating/courtship at a distance.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7horx/advice_for_entering_long_distance_relationship_ldr/
23,r7hpab,1638480224,Blocked/ghosted after 2 weeks of good convo from Tinder,"23 M. We matched on tinder and he was really cool. We’re both bi and experimenting with this side of ourselves so it was nice to have someone to relate to. We kept texting nonstop for about two weeks. We were always FaceTiming at night and he expressed he really likes me. We were talking all through thanksgiving. When he got sick a couple days ago, I even offered to get him an Uber eats gift card cause I felt bad.

He hasn’t responded to me in two days, which I thought was okay because he was sick. I just wanted to check his tinder profile for Fun and I couldn’t find his profile. I suspected he might have ghosted. I check instagram and I’ve been blocked.

Pretty much sent him a good bye text and everything.

Why are guys like this? It always seems like when everything’s too good to be true, they most definitely are too good to be true.

25,r7hr69,1638480368,"Multiple options while dating ""stable"" date?","I've started to date this one girl back in September where we've been doing 1 date every week or every two weeks. Is it wrong to keep dating her while I go on first dates every so often?

I know I probably seem like a jackass but I have a fear of being rejected or ghosted so I like to have options. It's fucked up to see girls as options but is it wrong if I want to not be affected by rejection?

She found out that I'm going on new dates as I lied during pillow talk and it backfired on me. She understood that I lied and was very distraught. Even with a lengthy chat, she didn't seem to be convinced about dating me further going forward. 

I know everyone has options but do you all mainly keep the same options from the time you met all of your matches? Or do you go on new dates while having a ""stable"" weekly date?

I know I'm going to be asked if I'm happy with this girl or not. And the truth is I like her but she blows up about things if I'm making a joke that are little dark. The night would end on an awkward note but I'd convince her it's nothing to be worried about. But we would still get physical and have a good time. This is probably why I am a little iffy about her.

So, today I've been on a date with a girl that I'm seeing. Had some sushi, a walk, them we just relax on some sofas drinking a tea. We had a nice date, lot of kissing, cuddling, hugging, caressing etc. I tried to focus more on the moment, emotions,  gestures, being with her, feeling her nice smell, her person and character. Also talked about more deep things, about us, who we are, what we did in life...

And it felt great. It's like it helped me a lot, being liked by someone, spending time with her, just me and her in that moment. Off course I'm not 100% ""healed"" but changed a lot.

I really do like him)...he's involved in a complicated situation with someone. They aren't together but he's still comes around for her kids, even though they aren't his. I don't know how he feels about her, he told me he didn't want to be with her and that she only talks to him when she wants something. But they were together for 4 years, I'm just afraid he will go back to her... but only for the kids. I understand he wants to be a father figure and I admire him for that because my biological father didn't even want to be my own life. But he deserves his own kids and in the future, if he will be with me, I would love to give them to him. I feel like we would raise awesome fucking kids together. I know he was drunk, but one night he told me that him and I would have a cute kid together. I just wish it could come true. He told his brother that I was amazing to hang out with...

I got sick later that night but I didn't tell anybody) I apologized that night to him before bed and I told him that I didn't feel good. We talked and it seemed like he understood and the next morning it was completely okay. But I know how he feels about attitude, he's fucking hates them and I feel terrible for getting one. He even told his brother that.."" I'm not going to deal with that"" ( his brother told me ) The next day I apologize again over text, he told me that he was too old to drill with that...which I understand and I told him that it wouldn't happen again and I promised. He's been working a lot since then, so I would like to think that he's just busy working, but since then we haven't been talking a lot. Like we used to.

44,r7jzv8,1638486695,Could somehow this whole situation workout between me (m18) and her (f18)?,"So this is a long story to get the main situation..

It all started in sophomore year of high school, she was the new kid in school and barely knew anyone. We never talked to each other, but we did have a class together. The reason why we started talking is she became friends with another girl I was friends with. The three of us went out for a small birthday celebration, that’s when we started talking more. 

Nothing really changed between us until halfway through senior year of high school. 

I came back to my school after leaving for that semester to take college courses and online high school classes. She was excited I came back, including a lot of other her and my friends. I got back on the school tennis team and started practicing again with my old teammates that didn’t graduate last year. I jokingly asked her to join the team and she said she would join with me. At the time, nothing really seemed special between me and her so I never really thought of us being in a “relationship.” When she joined and we started hanging out more, I started to like her more. We would always practice tennis outside of school every week and just have fun. After awhile, we started going to activities together and going to restaurants. 

This is where the story takes a turn.

After graduation, we had a lot of free time. Every week I went to her house and watched her favorite movies and shows. The first couple weeks were just me and her sitting there watching the tv and us talking. After a while, she started laying on me and touching me; which caught me off guard. Probably a month in, she was literally on me and and rapping her arms around my body. At one point, she literally grabbed my hand and put it on her ass. That night of the ass touching, we both went outside so she could say bye to me when I was leaving, and we did a 30-60 second tight hug, which was kinda awkward since I’m quite a bit taller than her. She also brought me around her family and her mom and dad loved me. Her dog also LOVED me, it was hilarious. She’s also in pageants and won the city last year and she was competing for state queen. I promised that I would go but something came up and it made it where I couldn’t see her preform. So I got her a small gift for what she did, and it was a cameo of one of her favorite actress’s congratulating her on what she did. When she saw it, she almost cried. 

After the gift, was when I gained up the courage to tell her my feelings. She did say that she cared also but since we were going to colleges that are pretty far apart from each other. Which I understood, I was in a long distance relationship at one point and it fell apart. So do you guys think I still have a chance or was she playing me in some small way? The thing that stings about it if she was playing me is that she seemed like the one. Whenever I tried to talk to other girls after her, I would grow disinterested with any other girl because they weren’t her. She was the perfect girl I was looking for; funny, smart; likes to play video games, same religious standpoint, and same political views. I know this is surface level but she is beautiful and she would always complain about her “assets” but I thought her body was perfect the way it was. I’m not a fan of girls having big “assets.” 

Some other stuff that happened that I don’t want to somehow cram into the story

- when we were playing video games together, she started talking about baby names and which ones I liked. Then she followed up the names she liked with my last name. 
- after the whole situation, her mom followed me on Instagram. 
- she out of the blue started checking up on me when I went off to college",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7jzv8/could_somehow_this_whole_situation_workout/
45,r7kcb8,1638487707,Not sure if the girl would like to go on a second date,"So, I met someone online, and after talking a bit, she casually asked what's my preferred date spot, and we agreed on a place to meet up.

She rescheduled what we initially planned for, which I found reasonable, because things happen, plans change.

So we finally met at the day and time she suggested. Our conversation kinda went like a therapy session with probably a bit too much depth for a first date. She and I are in the same profession and have similar career goals, so the entire time kind of went by in that area only.

After parting our ways, I texted her this:

Me: Hope you got home safe. I had an awesome time with you, hopefully we can see each other again soon! (If you feel like it too, obviously :) )

Her: Yup! Got home safe! Thanks for checking up on me ☺️


Now, I think our date went relatively okay, but the fact that she stalled my proposal of going out again makes me think she isn't interested. However, the emoji is a bit confusing.

Should I have been more specific when asking about going out again? I don't know if she wants the conversation to keep going, and I don't wanna pester someone who isn't really interested.

50,r7klsj,1638488476,Terrible experiences so far (19M). Losing hope,"3 months ago, a girl friend showed interest in me. We slept together and eventually after starting to spend more time together I started to want something more. She didnt and we drifted apart. At the end I was feeling that she was using me for attention anyway so it seemed like a good thing. A month later her friend told me that apparently she never really liked me and only slept with me because I was a virgin and she wanted to be able to say that she took someones virginity... Good riddance. However I was still extremely disappointed and ashamed since this was my first experience.

A month later I met a girl through a friend that is roommates with her. We hit it off and I asked her out. We went out several times but nothing physical happened since she was very shy and introverted. After a month I started the ""what are we"" conversation and she told me that she sees us only as friends... Now forget all I said in this second story. This was my side of things.

The real situation? The girl was still hung up on a guy that doesnt want her and is kinda depressed from it. The roommate knows it and since they are friends she wants to help her forget him. Her plan? Get her to like another guy. So what she did is introduce us and then tell me things ""from behind the scenes"" that made it seem that she liked me. She didnt and kept insisting to her roommate that she only saw us as friends. But the roommate continued to feed me lines of bullshit about how she likes me but is very shy. No physical contact? She is shy. In reality she just didnt want any. However all that time I was under the impression that we were going on dates because I liked her and (at least I thought) she liked me back. After I wanted to know what was going on between us I learned the truth. The roommate just didnt want me to give up on her with the hopes that the girl would start to like me and forget the other guy.

We've talked online almost all day everyday and played some games for hours at a time a good 5 or 6 times before we went on our first in-person date. The date was a couple of days ago and I had an amazing time, afterwards I realised I really really like him and he's made it very clear that he is very into me. 

But this is the furthest into the world of dating/relationships I've ever been and quite frankly, I'm absolutely shitting myself. 

I've never had someone show so much interest in me before, he's almost too perfect in that he remembers even the smallest of details and is so interested in getting to know me for who I actually am and it's all just a very foreign feeling for me. 

We're trying to fit in a second date around our busy schedules at the moment and I feel like this next in person date is going to be the point of no return and that is also something that scares me. I value my independence and my ""me time"" so much so I'm worried about having to adjust to someone being a part of my everyday life. I'm also feeling anxious about physical intimacy, and generally just intimacy as a whole.

When I began coaching last spring, I can 100% say I was not expecting to meet anybody. 

I was fine, I was doing great on my own and
I had finally come to a much more solid place in my life. 

Then, I met a guy I coached with who was 6 years older than me, and I began to feel even more solid than I already was. He didn’t complete me, I just felt like I wanted to be a better person for myself because of him.

However in the back of my mind was always a dream to travel the world on my own, go off and do these great things, and never settle down. 

Then I met him, and everything changed. I now feel like the more solid options are with him. That the dreams I once had, even moving back home seem like an impossible stretch in my mind. 

I don’t get it. I’ve always been okay on my own. And I didn’t intentionally fall for him.

ok, so this is just going to be a rant, and I would really love some kind words/support, so if you have anything rude to say then please just don't say it. 

I've been dating someone for the past several months, and we explore different places together and overall it's great and we have fun together. but... I have a fear of intimacy and now that things are progressing, it's really scaring me. I sabotage relationships when things get too intimate. I try to find things I dislike about the person and latch onto them to try to make myself not like them anymore. it's all in an attempt to protect my heart because I'm a very sensitive person and love deeply, and hurt deeply too. 

I know I need therapy but part of me doubts how much it'd help and I don't really have the time for it... sometimes I consider it but never take the initiative to book an appointment. I know it's something to look into.

Last week, we were talking about our pasts a bit (sexual pasts happened to come up) and I felt sick to my stomach afterward. The next day I started wailing and even scared myself with the intensity of my cries and screams. because talking about our sexual pasts had reminded me of past trauma that I'd suppressed for years but still never dealt with fully. and it also makes me sick to think of him being intimate with someone else. it makes me want to never see him again. 

so yes, I have so many issues and probably am not ready to date but at the same time I'll probably never truly be ready, so I just have to work through this mental anguish I'm going though. my mind is trying to torture me pretty much the whole day. just a week ago I was feeling so happy and now I'm so messed up mentally. I really don't know what is going on with me. we also don't share the same values and it's an issue for me but not for him at all. he doesn't seem to think it matters and still thinks something long-term can work but I have doubts. like he seems to be ok with casual sex and that bothers me a lot. I know lots of people on reddit think that's no big deal, but to me sex is a big deal and can be indicative of other areas of personality/values. I just want someone who aligns on what's important to me and makes me feel safe but I also don't have the strength to break it off with this person who I do like. fuck me!!!!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7lz5m/dating_someone_who_is_ruining_my_mental_health/

Hoping for some advice,

I have tried online dating, been single from a long-term relationship for about 4 years.

Most of the apps that are popular seem to just be scams with how much they charge you.

The affordable ones I have found where you don't get charged for them.   


Literally, no one uses it in my city. And I live in one of the biggest cities in Canada.

Aside from that, the only people that do message are scammers or green carders, and I'm not down.  


I have found like 1 free app, but it's still awful.

I have tried: Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, EHarmony, PoF, CDFF, OkCupid, and Christian Mingle among others.  
All terrible, half of their algorithms don't work for custom searches, are just set up to make you dump your credit cards into their bank accounts, they charge enormous amounts of $$ and still have limitations.

I have stopped trying tinder, okcupid, because I was surprised at how little (almost none at all, after a lot of trying and hundreds if not wellll over a thousand likes/messages, so I have been trying Facebook dating, and I get the same thing! (maybe one match every few months, if that, but the match is always an odd encounter, such as a foreign person or a sex worker, and sometimes the match will not even message back.) I have had not had one single like! I have been trying this/out there/active for almost 2 years now. 

I have tried updating/reinstalling/new phone, but same. 

This makes no sense, because if anyone in the world is like me at all, ppl like to play with the app, chat, keep some matches, ect.., Not be regularly disappointed and feel like u r not worth it/not meant to be and confused over a long period why it always feels like I am targeted and selected as a loser, so that I will fold and purchase a draining dating app, but i hear those seem like a scam for many, while a few select are allowed to be happy with it, so it doesn't look so bad.

I have even put my name in my profile, and I have even tried tracking down ppl on Facebook and Instagram and sometimes to save myself wasting more time/alienation, I'll express that I don't want to be rude/bother but would be nice if could see if u got my like, and it's Always just as if I'm simply not there, like the message/friend request doesn't get through!


It also seems like I'm being controlled/hacked.  Or am i just unaware of how things work? i kno a lot of ppl that have 1000s of friends or likes every year and i cant get 5 over 5, im actually scared and confused, like im being attacked or controlled, since i had fb, i have tried sendibg out many hundres or thousands of likes and messages on dating, and also probly 1 to 200 freind requests of mutual friends but not all to be fair, (im just trying to meet ppl i have no friends and not superstitious about the internet and kno better than to meet ppl i cant trust) im genuinely a very affectionate person with good manners with a simple hello or something based on a post, but when i get a reply from maybe 10 of them, they start talking like they dnt care and are slightly off on grammar and articulation, and start teasing me and some, after we talk a few messages over a few days, can say like, can you help me?  with what? send some money so i can get my grocery fix, lol.. and then some teasing media shows up on fb and sometimes profile, and then an old FR from a year ago, responded right after one this time and its like just to show more confusion and ignoring, but.. all while their profiles are legit, with pictures and posts.
i know that many ppl have thousands of friends and likes every year, i cant get 5 over 5 years. is fb, ect.. a scam, am i selected/unlucky? 


.. is that normal? should it be that hard for someone like me? im actually not sure.


How many here have or do not have this kind of experience?


I am 33 Caucasian 5'9.5 M, New Jersey, I am nice/affectionate, I always treat women with respect and believe they should be treated like the queen, I can get a little excited, but otherwise im very mature, I am very active, i hiit run a lot, I'm very conscious about keeping well/healthy, so I am skinny because of this so I don't have much fat, but I am Def not the the scrawny type, I have normal pictures, and a couple of me smiling, a normal intro. 

It makes things worse cuz I never been on a date or had a gf, I moved some years back, so I don't have ANY friends or social life, work doesn't have ppl I can make friends with, family isn't as close/affectionate as me or would like to be and some are not right and very rude , so I get disconnected and lonely and feel in my head all the time.

77,r7n93v,1638496311,Boy who wants to reach out to his ex girlfriend,"Okay friends, prepare for this story. I(20) was with her(20) for like a 2.5months, broke up a month ago. We were seeing each other from 1 to 3 times a week. It was going great, (not long until she spent time at my place) and so on. We used to talk a lot everyday, chat all the time, send pictures of each other and so on. She even chilled with me and my friends (male and female),  and I met her friends. Sometimes, I was a bit jelaous when she was with her male friend (not because she was with him, but because she wasn't with me) (even though she was always telling me, even messaging me when she was chilling with him, or her best friends-girls). In the last 2-3weeks she didn't seem to have time to be with me (sometimes I was sure she was busy, sometimes meh). It was I who always had to call her for date or chill (which is okay if she agrees) But I noticed things were different in those last 2-3weeks. Told her I wasn't okay with us not having more time together (my scheldue was also sometimes busy but I was making time for her always)
10 days before breakup we went for a coffee (for the last time), we were talking but I was feeling not so happy, like something was off. We were talking about movies, she said she arranged a  movie with her male friend. I ignored that in the moment. Later, I could not stopping thinking about that. On the one side, if she wanted to cheat, she could do that without me ever knowing. (She didn't need cinema, and me to know to do that) 
On the other side, why wouldn't she call me. Maybe she even planned to, but I made one joke (where i told her im not okay with that). I could not tell her I don't want you to go.
2 days later I went to my hometown to see my family for few days, and before I went we went for short walk (like 15mins) just to say goodbye. She didn't message me in the meantime. I told her I didn't feel okay, and we need to talk when I comeback to our city. She said she wants to talk too.
When we met, we talked some light talk for a little, she returned me my hoodie(I left it on bench, I didn't want it) and started talking about all the things. She simply said she doesn't feel like she used, I said that's okay and we shortly after got separated. (We talked a bit more before that, but that's how it ended)
After that I started thinking about her, about our relationship, things where she got wrong, things I got wrong.
I wasn't acting like a male, like an alpha enough. It seemed like I was begging her to chill with me, like I don't have life without her (I have, I am very successful in all fields, really)
When we were together maybe I was too soft. I am sure that turned her away. She doesn't need man who acts like a lil girl. 
I wanted to reach out, but she didn't wish me a happy birthday (which was 9 days ago). She got a job in the meantime. She posts everyday on her social media, like she is showing she is doing okay, i feel like she tries too much. It seems she is looking for someone else (rebound or not, I'm not sure)
Anyway
I want to reach out to her, simply asking to go for a coffee, despite everything. I learned to respect myself and I will not feel awful if she says she doesn't want to go, met someone else, busy...
I don't feel like she has anything with that male friend (my instict tells me that, i'm almost sure)
I know where I went wrong in that relationship (I accepted it)

93,r7p1ln,1638501592,When taking a break feels like failure....,"I (33M) am recently coming off another round of using the apps again. I recently went on three dates with a lady that I thought was going awesome. She ultimately came to the conclusion that she wasn't ready to date and was still struggling with her past divorce. It was one of those classic ""it's not you it's me"" cases. Having been absolutely crushed by hearing this, my emotional tank and self esteem are on empty.

&amp;#x200B;

Well taking a break from these abs sounds like it might be some thing I should do, I can't help but think that doing so would be a failure on my end. I've been going on tons of dates on and off for years but I can't seem to get past two or three dates with anyone. No matter what I do, it always ends up the same way and I feel like taking a break is just admitting defeat that I will never find someone. Because if you aren't putting yourself out there and trying, you're never going to meet anyone. So it becomes this strange catch 22.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that I've grown rather desperate at my age as I have never had a serious relationship in my life. I have Asperger syndrome so the stuff is naturally a little more difficult for me. I also spent most of my 20s in a professional band that did a lot of travel while also working full-time in the tech industry. I was gone so much with that band that I actually was unable to maintain any friendships outside of the people I was playing with so truly dating would not have been some thing that I could've dedicated the time to. I also did a lot of mental health treatment at that same time as I needed to learn how to deal with my emotional regulation and just how to handle some of my autism. Reddit has assured me over and over again that having no significant relationship experience at this age is a red flag. And I don't know how to necessarily undo that other than explain my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Since all of the travel has stopped for that group, I have been hitting the apps as hard as I possibly can and going on as many days as I possibly can. I usually average about a date a week when I'm really trying and have no issue making conversation. Just for one reason or another, it's not a good fit or I get ghosted. Then I sit there and beat myself up as to what I did wrong for them to reject me this time. I will admit that my hair is starting to thin out and that I am 5' 5"" which I realize both of those will dock you some serious points. I'm also not super fit but I'm definitely not obese.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still able to get a fair amount of matches and start conversations, but I find myself literally just staring at my phone now waiting for matches to message me back and being terrified that they won't. I feel so pathetic that my life has gotten to this point. I work from home and my gigs have slowed way down so I have tons of downtime now to just sit at home and wait for something to happen. I sit and I wonder why people can't just get back to me in a timely fashion instead of sending a few messages every day. Maybe it's because I have so much free time it's no trouble to just message someone back. But I get caught in this weird mindset that everyone else should be able to just reply without delay as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The point of all of this is that I'm not sure what to do anymore. I probably need a break, but that's just kicking the can further down the road here. Hinge has started to recycle people that show up in my queue so clearly I'm starting to run out of people. And 33 and I feel like the best years of my life have vanished by without a partner and I have become just a left over in the dating pool that no one else has ever wanted and that will scare away everybody else. It's such a demoralizing and defeating reality that I have to accept I guess. I've watched my friends get married and have kids while I fret over if someone will even get back to me on a dating app let alone give me the opportunity to even ask them out. And then when I do go out, I can't even get them to see me a second time. I see a therapist weekly and am medicated and it does help. It helps me cope but it doesn't necessarily change my situation or fix the problem. I don't know what to do anymore, I feel so alone, I feel like a failure, I feel like this will never change, and I feel like I've run out of options and time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7p1ln/when_taking_a_break_feels_like_failure/

95,r7pmpe,1638503331,Is this guy leading me on?,"I (20F) have been dating this guy (20M) for ~2 months. Before dating this guy, I was in a long-term relationship (my only relationship) that moved very fast. This guy is very much the exact opposite from that &amp; I wanna know if I’m really getting mixed signals (red flag) or if this is normal. I’d really appreciate your opinion, I know people on the outside can have a clearer understanding of what’s happening than someone emotionally involved.

Here’s what our dating has been like:

We meet regularly (once a week) and usually set up a next date at the end of the night. He never texts / FaceTimes me in between. If I do text first, he usually responds right away but conversations don’t really start. So I end up not having any real contact with him other once a week.

When we’re on dates, we have fun but he almost never holds my hand and on some dates we don’t kiss. At the end of the night, he says he had fun and unless we already have something planned, he makes new plans. Even if his plans are his suggestion to begin with or if he agreed to plans I suggested, sometimes I get the feeling that he’s iffy about actually having the date. But when I meet him for the date, he’s fine and enthusiastic and everything so idk if I’m being paranoid. 

We’ve already had sex a few times but it never feels like I’m allowed to spend any time with him afterwards. So, no cuddling or anything, and definitely no spending the night. Our first time, I almost felt kicked out because it felt like he really wanted me to leave. 

When I recently asked him what we are because he himself said we’ve been dating for a while, he said we’re kind of in a relationship but not really. When I asked if can see it turn to a relationship, he looked flustered and said maybe. Despite that, he wants to meet my family soon, during Christmas (he moved to my area a few months ago and doesn’t have family here). He has a lot of friends here and I haven’t met them yet. 

Personally, I really like having labels on relationships. While I don’t mind a slower pace, I mind it if we’re not talking between dates and I feel like I’m getting mixed signals. I’ve been anxious that I’m being led on or that there’s something there I can’t see. That’s the feeling I hate most in the world, feeling like there’s something I’m not able to clearly see even though it’s right there. It’s also made talking with my friends awkward because they’ve been referring to him as my boyfriend and I always insist I wouldn’t go that far. While I’d like to use that label myself, I don’t feel like I’m actually allowed to and that it’s not accurate. But how do I explain that he’s gonna meet my family for Christmas but is not my boyfriend?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7pmpe/is_this_guy_leading_me_on/
96,r7pmxm,1638503348,Not seeing him during university exam period - should I be concerned things aren’t serious,"So I (22F) met this guy (21M) on bumble and we first met in midOctober. On our second date we went for drinks and then had sex. Since then, we’ve basically been hanging out once a week. We generally go out to eat or do some type of activity and then have sex after. I have been introduced to some of his friends - I did an outing with them and then he slept at my place after. We texted a little bit throughout the day. We discussed having not slept with other people since we got together but it was more in the context of STIs and it wasn’t as much of an exclusivity/relationship chat. 

Now that university exams are coming up, he’s expressed not wanting to hangout until exams are done (about 1 week from now for him and a week and a half from now for me). We will both be around for about a week after this time before leaving for a 3 week holiday break. I asked him to go to eat this weekend, and that when he said he wanted to wait a bit first. He seemed enthusiastic about wanting to do something after exams. I know that he is being reasonable/it makes sense, but I think I’m worried that this is a sign we are not heading towards a relationship
