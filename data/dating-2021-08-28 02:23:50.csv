0,pd5dxa,1630135473,Should I ask what happened or just stop talking to him?,"I (23f) recently downloaded tinder again and I thought I was having really good luck this time. I matched with a guy who I have a lot in common with, and he seemed genuinely excited to meet up with me. We talked a lot and it really looked like we would get along. The day of our date comes around and he didn't mention it at all. I was fine with waiting for another day. But ever since then he hasn't been talking to me anymore. His responses are low-effort, and when I asked him if he'd meet with me again he just never responded. 

I'm thinking of asking if I came on too strong, as I'd really like to know what happened. But it seems like he doesn't want to talk to me. He hasn't blocked me or unfriended me yet though, so maybe he wants me to ask? I really don't know.

It wasn't bad at first but I always eventually got ghosted, more than likely due too the many options that women have on the dating apps these days. Well I deleted the apps and focused on myself for months and months after and eventually started talking to a woman I met in person at her work. I casually flirted with her a few times and she reciprocated, so I eventually manned up and asked her out in person. She said yes and my heart fluttered. I felt immense joy all while reminding myself that it very well could be too good to be true, so don't allow myself to get hurt. Well I took her on a date and bought her dinner, we had a fairly good conversation and the food was decent. Afterwards I simply gave her a hug and said my goodbyes. She texted me shortly after and said that she had a good time and wondered what I thought of the date. I told her that I thought it was good and would like to take her out again if she's interested. She said that she would love to. Well to shorten a long story she started responding to text less and less, made excuses as to why she responded late, a definite cap. Now she has completely ghosted me, I know I need to let this go but I'm genuinely sick of being shit on in the dating game. I'm physically fit, I am a gentleman and I of course paid for the meal.

8,pd5zsz,1630138756,What is the impact on a girl when the father is not in her life and she has had guys in the past who led her on and then abandoned?," I'm a 39 year old guy and I was dating a mid 30s woman. We were talking on the phone for a few months and then we went on 4 dates. I made a good amount of mistakes with her (acting kind of clingy by texting too much, not going for a kiss and thus confusing it into friendship, etc.) but she also has a past that she said impacts her to the day. She decided to end things after date 4 saying she prefers friendship.

I want to understand how much of it was my mistakes and how much was it her past that contributed to this not working out? She did some odd things throughout. For example, we started talking on the phone every day immediately after we met (we met online dating and she was initially long distance but then moved very close to where I live). But, then for no reason, she just stopped talking for 2 weeks. At that point, we were still talking but at a much slower pace and I thought it might be over (she later explained that bc a guy led her on from long distance, she got scared with me). However she got back to the point of showing interest again and then we went on the 4 dates. But, in the dates, she was always very guarded and it was hard to even initiate touch or hold hands or put my arm around her. There would be zero response. And then she even invited me to her place for dinner and drinks (the 4th date) but again, she wouldn't really allow touch or physical intimacy. I ultimately asked to kiss her good night after this 4th date and she said yes. Regardless, she still ultimately said she wanted friendship. Additionally, she sometimes posts things on social media about how she doesn't need a guy as long as she has her girlfriends who matter most to her.

Is it more likely that this girl was driven to friendship by my mistakes or could she be kind of scarred from past bad experiences with guys which prevents her from crossing certain emotional levels of connection? Part of the reason it became friend-y was also because she didn't let it become anything more than friends by not responding well to the flirtation and touching escalation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pd5zsz/what_is_the_impact_on_a_girl_when_the_father_is/

13,pd6vl2,1630143650,Fwb problem. Need your help,"I (21f) had a fwb (23m) few years back. We used to solely meet for fooling around. Also, we used to talk about our personal life, friends and all of that. I started having feelings for him and I confessed the same. But he said he just got out of a breakup and its way too ealy to have something serious and it won't be good for both of us as we had religious differences. Since we have religious difference, it is impossible for us to have a future together, and that sucks. 


We both stay far from each other and were busy with our lives. So with time, the sex started becoming monotonous. But we still decided to keep on meeting since we were comfortable with each other and liked what we had. 


Later we stopped meeting because I felt that my needs weren't being met (and I still had feelings for him) and it's not okay for my mental health to continue all this. I used to give him emotional and financial support knowing that him and I could never be us.


I came to know from a friend that he started seeing someone from the same religious background. But he never said that. He still used to text me saying that he misses me and all of that. I never reciprocated with the same energy because I knew he's dating someone else and I thought it would be weird if i brought up this subject.


One day he texted me that he misses me alot and it wasn't for sex. He said that I think of him as someone who is 'cheapo and creepo' and as if he is some monster. He started saying sorry plenty of times and I had no clue why. He said that he really wants to see me somewhere away from the room and that he wants to be better with me and to give him another chance. I wasn't sure because I knew he was in a relationship and when I confronted him he said he was in a relationship but he broke up because there was no peace. 


When I replied him with ""im not sure"" he said ""Its okay. You dont have to. Im glad I got to talk to you and tell you how I feel""

Its like I ask ""how is it going"" and the response is emotionless. And I'll ask about them and never have anyone ask me about mine. And then head turns away. I get clear body signal that they are trying to be friendly, but are not interested.  


Im not trying to play victim. As frustrating as it is to get stone walled over and over again, I feel like Id be dumb not to see that I am doing something wrong.   


People talk about how confidence is attractive. I have confidence, but sometimes the rejections or cold responses sting and make me spiral about why this happens.   


I guess I just need to keep on working on myself and trying. The rejections kind of wear on me, but maybe I need to adjust my expectations? Maybe 1 out of every 50 women might show interest. IDK, made that number up.

Im 30(m) and I've been seeing this girl (27) for about 9 months now, and before I start I wanna add that I'm the only guy she has ever dated, kissed or done anything sexually with minus actual sex. So she really has no idea what she is doing dating wise or how to act around men in general.  

She originally told me she didn't want anything serious at first, and just wanted something casual. So me being the hopeful romantic just went along with it trying to be causal. Well that didn't last long, and I'm so in love with this girl I don't know what to do.

Now I've told her I like her, and she liked me too but wants to stay casual. Now she always makes sure to keep it as platonic as possible when messaging or talking with me, so as not to lead me on and be respectful to me. Which I appreciate, but she gives me so many mixed signals, and from how we fool around and the fact we do so many things as a couple that I'm just confused.   

I afraid to keep pushing and talk to her about this anymore, or even open up emotionally to her just because I never thought I could feel like this again.

That really messed me up for a while. However we had a talk the other day and she made it clear that she does like me, but I can't tell if I feel the same way anymore.

All summer we only went on 2 'dates' and we are both super busy until the end of October which is when we plan to get together again. We still talk over text nearly every day but I feel like the conversations are getting pretty bland and repetitive. We are both seniors in high school and we never seam to talk at school outside of a minute or two because we are both awkward when there are other people around.

There never really was chemistry between us but I liked her because she is truly something else. At this point I feel like I'm looking for more of an emotional connection not something that feels forced. I just really don't know what to do at this point..

last year we did not go to prom because she had work which was fine, but she has never really seemed to have time for 'us', I always thought that would change but so far it hasn't. We never really see each other much and when we do its weird.

I don't want to break things off because I know she is going through some mental things and also in the same friend group so that would mess things up too. Like I said, she is the perfect person in my eyes the only downside is she is very closed off and not very affectionate.

I really need advice, thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pd9jj1/i_am_so_lost/
32,pd9jxd,1630156460,Does This Girl Like me?,"I‚Äôve already posted this a few times but I want as many outside opinions I can get


So there‚Äôs a co worker I think likes me and I like her too. We‚Äôre both 17 and here‚Äôs the story so far. I originally didn‚Äôt like her because she trash talked me to another co worker about me taking all the customers at the registers (not on purpose but I just made eye contact first). Anyway a few weeks after that I had to help her at registers and she was super friendly, I remember thinking ‚Äúman she‚Äôs talking a lot for not knowing me‚Äù. But I was super dry and blunt because I was mad at her remark she made at the time. She did things like ask what time I got off and then acted disappointed when I got off before her. Before I left I had to buy something and I went to her register. When I did she said ‚Äúoh hey, it‚Äôs been awhile) and smiled and had a flirty look on her. She also was messing around with me and being mean in a playful way. Like messing with me when my card didn‚Äôt work and said ‚Äúwell we close in 30 minutes so if you don‚Äôt get it by then idk what to tell you‚Äù but it was flirty like I said


Fast forward a few weeks later and I see her one day and I decide to put what she said behind me and kinda have a ‚Äúfresh start‚Äù. I started taking to her and it went so well. I made her smile and laugh a lot and she was playing with her hair a lot. I was looking to see if she played with her hair when I wasn‚Äôt talking to her and she was but not as much. It went so well that day. The next day I worked tho she was busy and around other co workers so it was hard to talk with her. I finally wanted to at least say hi. When I did I went full blown stupid and froze and just wave. I said nothing but she did the same, waved and said nothing. For some reason I looked away and then looked back. I have no clue why. When she left I told her bye and she said it back but she didn‚Äôt seem flirty or interested at all. I thought I ruined it until today and yesterday


Yesterday she was there and I noticed she had her hair dyed. I wanted to compliment but decided not to because after last time I didn‚Äôt wanna make it worse. So I just told her good bye and she said ‚Äúbye, hey did you get your hair cut?‚Äù I did so I said yeah. She said ‚Äúit looks really nice‚Äù. I said ‚Äúthank you!‚Äù And went on. She asked ‚Äúdo you work tomorrow?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyeah wby?‚Äù She said ‚Äúnot until Thursday‚Äù. I said ‚ÄúI work tomorrow and Wednesday but not again until Sunday‚Äù she replied ‚ÄúI think I work Sunday!‚Äù I said ‚Äúok nice, see you!‚Äù And left. Today is when it gets amazing. Today she came in as a customer and checked out at my register. When she came up she was playfully being mean and stuff. I got to the screen where I couldn‚Äôt scan her discount and she said ‚Äúwow do I need to do your job? I think I do, cause I will if you can‚Äôt‚Äù we both made each other smile and laugh a lot and it didn‚Äôt feel like a normal conversation, but like she was flirting the whole time. I asked her ‚Äúdo you need a bag?‚Äù She said ‚Äúif it makes your life harder I totally need a bag‚Äù. When she went to leave she asked ‚Äúyou work Sunday right?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyeah, you do right?‚Äù She said ‚Äúyeah!‚Äù I said ‚Äúnice I‚Äôll see you then, btw I like your hair!‚Äù. So I finally complimented her new hair

So after my ted talk what do you guys think? Does she like me or not? No other girls at my work act like this. It‚Äôs never this playful with this much bantering. So do y‚Äôall think she likes me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pd9jxd/does_this_girl_like_me/

at First when we agreed on today he said that he‚Äôd pick me up not later than 2:15 pm. I was totally fine with it. Then a few days ago he asked if 2-3 pm was definitely fine for me. I said yeah. and today at 12 am I messaged him and didn‚Äôt get a reply. so I called him to make sure everything was fine and today was still going as planned. after picking up he said he was stressed and would leave his house at 2-2:30. that would be later than we planned but okay. he didn‚Äôt tell me why, nor did he even say sorry. and he has to drive for an hour to my town, so yeah. Then a few minutes ago (exactly 3 pm) I got a text that he is leaving home now. That means he‚Äôll be here almost 2 hours late and I‚Äôm kinda pissed. Like I started getting ready at 12 because I like to take my time and wanted to shower/ shave and whatever.

 I really don‚Äôt know what to do now. Like I‚Äôll go out with him today but I really hope he will have an explanation and will say sorry. I already dated a guy who was always late before and I hated it. If we are supposed to meet at 2:15 I expect you to be here at 2:15, not 4. Should I give him a second chance and see what he has to say later? Or should I just let it be after today? What pisses me about it is also the fact that I had to call and ask.

39,pdaftu,1630159793,"Almost 27[M], never had a girlfriend or been on a single date in my life and I'm losing hope can anyone offer me any advice?"," 

The title says most of it, but I'll elaborate a bit.

First off, I just want to clarify that I'm not desperate, but I am losing any hope of ever finding a woman in my life. This is in large part because my social life has been very vapid for as long as I can remember. It doesn't help with the fact that I am a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) with severe ADHD, Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, and Aspergers. All of which have made my life in general a living hell for over a decade.

That said, the last 10 years have been utterly brutal for me overall socially. Most of my experiences and overall interactions with most women I've come across have been for a lack of a better term, either utter shit or lackluster. Even with girls who have been friends of mine, they eventually ghost me in the end, regardless if I'm on good terms with them. The last one who decided to ghost me was a former college classmate and buddy of mine. In the dating world, most interactions I've had have been IRL and I've never had my feelings returned. I've gone for older women and younger women, fat and skinny, it doesn't matter. At bars, the women have been vicious and rude.. and I don't understand it at all.

This kind of behavior prompted me to look in other communities and I didn't meet any success there either. I've tried to go out with foreign women, but when that happened, I got either stood up or burned. Granted, these women were living in America and/or were Americanized, so maybe I'll still give the ones overseas the benefit of the doubt..

Keep in mind that nearly all of my dating experience has been IRL and not online. I don't even bother with dating apps because they go nowhere.

I have repeatedly taken breaks from the dating world every now and then. 2011-2014 were the years that I really tried. 2018-2019 and then early 2020 were when I tried again, but to no success.

At this point, I have no clue what to do. I'm slightly above average-looking I've always come across as kind, chill/relaxed and confident in myself. Yet, I can never get what I yearn for.. I want to be married and have a family of my own one day, but I honestly don't know if I will ever find it here in America..

51,pdc6vc,1630165632,"AITA for cancelling a date because he didn't check in beforehand, and tell me where precisely we are going","I matched with a man on a dating app. We were talking for a few days. We had one phone call on Wednesday night, where I felt like he was pretty tipsy. I knew he was coming home from a boy's night (on a weekday for some reason), and on the call there was something a bit off. He shouted at a passerby who allegedly said something racist to him, he kept talking over me and interrupting me. But still, I was like let me give him a chance. We agreed for a date on Saturday afternoon / today. 

Yesterday night I video called him on my way home from dinner, as I was a bit intimidated as men kept cat calling me or staring at me. We talk for a good few hours even once I get home. Here he's a bit more calm, he's indoors because the night before he said he had another huge night out and he was nursing a hangover. This time we talk properly about our spiritual journeys and professional goals, and we have things in common. On this call, he discusses a date again for the next day. He mentions he will pick a museum before we go out for a late lunch for our date. Nothing is confirmed but we hang up around midnight and I go about my day. 

So today comes around. And I hear nothing from him until half 2 ish when he asks if I'm bringing a handbag with me. At this point, for me the date isn't happening. I have a standard *when someone invites me on a date, they should be confirming a few hours ahead, the time, location and whether everything is still ok*. He didn't, so when he checked in, I said no. He called me, and he got angry, swore at me and then called me a flakey fucker. 

I know I could have confirmed with him, but he asked me out. The good manners I look for is the person who asked me out, for whom I cancelled other plans, should be checking in, confirming time and location a few hours before or I'm not going. This person didn't tell me where I'm going, which museum we were supposed to be going. It was a bit weird. 
For me, when it comes to online dating, I'm trying to be as cautious as possible and any thing that remotely wastes my time or fails to uphold the traditional standard i.e. you should check in ahead of the set time to let me know where I am going, isn't for me. This is both due to safety and because it's just respecting my time imo.

I would love to send her some flowers, and I'm sure she would enjoy the flowers and the gesture.  The only issue I have is she never gave me her address.  I found it quite easily online, but I think maybe that will feel creepy, but I do love the surprise nature of sending a gift.

A few other notes.  I know generally where she lives (she's from my hometown) and have seen her apartment on video chat, etc.  It's not as if she has been hesitant to share with me.   But as someone who is quite adept at using the internet I realize that often people don't understand how easy addresses can be found and it comes off as if I invested time &amp; energy to find out this seemingly private info.

Sometimes these girls are just not interested at all but this happens with Tinder matches and girls who start conversations with me

I mean I always make an effort to send longer messages and ask questions and all I get are short, dry answers and stuff like ""ahahahahah yeah"" which leaves me with nothing to say

And the other thing is, I don't feel like this happens to other friends of mine. They manage to have conversations with these women (honestly, from the little I've seen, these don't seem that interesting either, but at least they're answering properly)

anyways i am now 30, and i am thinking about joining some classes i am interested in. of course if i meet someone nice that'd be great but I am doing it mostly because i enjoy the class and i want to meet new people.

anyone who went this route and got success? activity groups could be anything like a running club, a sports league recreational, craft &amp; arts, movie night, whatever

were the people generally closed off to the idea? I generally find the people there to be much more on the older side (ironic, because i am old too!) but they likely married , either just moved to a new city and not out looking for dates/flings/relationship.

One thing I was just thinking about and noticing is that normally when I have been early in dating women and they leave town the ones who were really interested would message me not be in radio silence. So curious from a womans point of view is she interested or luke warm at best?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdg1bz/is_she_interested_or_does_this_sound_disinterested/

We talked, laughed, had a great time. In the end it even got pretty physical since i ended up resting my head on her thighs while she was stroking my hair (i gave her lots of kisses as well (which she really liked), but we didn't have a ""real"" kiss since she's very shy)... I couldn't be more happy with how it turned out, yet today she took more than seven hours to reply back to some messages i had sent (that's the longest she'd ever taken) and i'm scared that i screwed up somewhere...

90,pdgm4d,1630180287,"Not sharing my [M21] feelings, has led my girlfriend [F22] not wanting to confide in me about things","We [M21, F22] have been together for almost a year now and have always just clicked in a way where we almost know exactly when something might be wrong.

Whenever things are going smoothly and calmly in the relationship, we have these small petty arguments about things that's often caused by miscommunication. Despite having very open and honest communication, these things still happen sometimes. I've always been a very private guy when it comes to my emotions and feelings

When she goes through hardships and bad times, I am always there to show my support and cheer her up. This is anything from flowers, to supportive texts. She has always been open about her feelings, but this being my first relationship, I find it quite difficult to do. She feels that I am always there for her, but she is never there for me when I need it.

Recently, things in my personal life have taken a turn.  When I was grieving, I told her what would help me cope and she tried her best despite being busy herself. A part of me is always hesitant to come out or text her how I'm feeling during the week, because  she is usually very stressed with work and I don't want to be a burden to her with my issues.

She told me that she feels that I am not open enough with my feelings to her and this has led her to not wanting to share her own with me. She thinks that I do not want to confide in her during my time of need. When I told her that I find it hard to communicate about my feelings past the usual ""I'm good"" and ""I'm feeling meh"", and that I need help being more open about it, she told me that it's as if we are not serious and that she feels reluctant sharing her feelings with me because of it. Even when I really am feeling ""fine"" and I tell her, she suspects that there is more I'm feeling.

At times, I just don't really feel in touch with my feelings myself and despite loving her, it's hard for me to communicate it with her. This is ruining my relationship.

TL;DR: I find it difficult to express my feelings openly in my relationship. This has made my girlfriend think that I do not want to confide in her and has led her to feel reluctant about sharing her feelings with me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdgm4d/not_sharing_my_m21_feelings_has_led_my_girlfriend/

Is This Normal??,"I recently had a surgery (minor) and I'm recovering well at home and as part of the surgery ppl were checking up on me to make sure I'm doing ok. So through that he received my number and he would text me things like ""did you take your walk hun?"" And I'll be like ""yes"" and he will respond with ""good girl"" and that smirking emoji this one üòè.  He has now called me good girl three times over text and I don't know if this is how he talks?? But the only time I heard someone call me good girl over and over was my Ex during bedroom activities. He also asked for a selfie to see if I was getting better and I declined. This is weird. I obviously don't want to overreact but I would like to get ppls views. His gf is out of town for work and I don't want to disturb her rn. For what it's worth I love in the South USA and hun isn't a huge deal typically only women say it though so I'm confused and he isn't even from the south. I'm 23 my friend is 25 he is 33

95,pdhcju,1630182728,Going on a first date - outfit questions,"Hi all, 

I am going on a first date with someone i met on my friends‚Äô wedding.

My relationship before this (5years) was pretty abusive and my ex was always on the phone or texting me unless I was in the silent treatment periods. The guy I am texting now is not like that even a little bit. He is very busy due to work and social life (he told me, but my friend also told me), so he texts me or once a day or sometimes keeps a few days apart. He starts, because I am a bit shy and feel like maybe I would burden him. I am 29, but my ex was my first bf, so I am veeery nervous and excited. 

He lives in Germany and I live in the Netherlands. He asked me suddenly if I wanted to meet in the middle and go for dinner together. So I assume it is a date? 

Few questions on how to prepare and dress:

He is my height and I don‚Äôt mind, but would it be weird if I wear a bit heels? For me it is not a problem, but I don‚Äôt want to make him feel uncomfortable.

I was thinking of heeled boots, long skirt and a cardigan. What do you think?

Also I haven‚Äôt texted with him for 2 days now and should I text him whether he found a hotel already and that I am excited? 

So sorry for this. I am so nervous!!! ü§óü§ó",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdhcju/going_on_a_first_date_outfit_questions/
