Are there best practices for when and how to disclose this? If someone I'm chatting to asks, ""what did you do saturday?"" -- and I spent saturday on a first date with somebody, do I just say that? Or is that too blunt? Is there a better way or time to broach this? Is it contextual / based on how much I know the person?

6,q2mrdp,1633533965,Navigating Insecurities: Re: Boyfriends Friends,"I (32F) am in a relationship with a wonderful man. I really, really like him and we've been dating exclusively for almost 5 months now. 

I've introduced him to two of my friends, as well as my mom and my brother. I've yet to meet his best friend; and it's starting to make me feel really insecure. It's hitting one of my biggest trigger points; and even after talking it over with my boyfriend, I don't feel better. It's making me start to question the long term potential for this relationship. Also, boyfriend has mentioned to me that his best friend we'll know we're serious when he meets me in person, which hasn't happened yet. I also haven't met his friends who he plays cards with, but this makes a little more sense to me (I don't really want to be the girlfriend who sits around and watches her boyfriend play cards). I am also perfectly OK with waiting a bit longer to meet his mom. 

Additionally, boyfriend has made a few comments about his best friend stating that the best friend asked if boyfriend wanted an ""out"" for a trip that boyfriend and I have planned around Christmas time.

I should also mention that last week, one of boyfriends other acquaintances saw us walking on the street and texted boyfriend ""enjoy your booty call""; too which boyfriend replied ""lol"". 

I'm sort of rambling here, but I think what it really comes down to is that, I feel insecure about not meeting boyfriends friends and I'm also concerned that they already don't like and/or respect me for some reason. I also want to make sure that I'm being spoken of respectfully when I'm not in the room. I know it's normal for friends to vent and share things about their relationship, but I have an uneasy feeling about that teetering a very fine line between venting and being spoken poorly of. It's harping on my insecurities; and I don't know how to make myself feel better.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/q2mrdp/navigating_insecurities_re_boyfriends_friends/

11,q2o1m9,1633537847,Breaking Up Over Text,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately, input wanted.

I (32F) always felt like breaking up over text was rude once you had been seeing someone semi consistently. However, recently I dated I guy for about a month and although he never actually physically harmed me or threatened me, I just couldn't bring myself to end it in person. Something gave me an unsafe vibe. He wouldn't answer the phone either, so after a few failed attempts to call him, I did end things over text. He was someone who had presented quite a few red flags and I honestly felt that he could have a very unpredictable reaction in person. Anyway, I mentioned this to several female friends after I felt bad for doing things that way and each of them said that they typically do this over phone or text because it's safer.

12,q2o5az,1633538157,I love my boyfriend but is it enough?,"So I’ll try to keep this short and concise! 

I am a woman in early 30s and have been dating an amazing guy (4 years older) for the last 5 months. Honestly, I love him. We share the same sense of humour, love for food and have unbelievable sexual chemistry. Oh god, the sex! I can honestly say that I didn’t know what an amazing orgasm was before I met him. So, what’s the problem? 

Everything is perfect EXCEPT one thing -our intellectual interests. 

For the last 10 years, I have been a social activist fighting for anti-human trafficking, equal rights and anti-racism. It’s deeply a part of who I am and I am also a relatively spiritual (non-religious) person as well. I finished my bachelor’s degree in sociology so I have a deep passion for these types of conversations. 

My partner on the other hand, while incredibly smart, funny and even wise, is not overly excited or interested to talk about academic, political or sociological things. At times, I’ve found myself “in lack,” if you will, or “in want,” of some deeper conversation. At this point, I should also mention that previous to this relationship, I’ve always had a type that included this characteristic. 

Ok, so in conclusion, I love my boyfriend but is it enough to carry us through our differences? Thoughts?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/q2o5az/i_love_my_boyfriend_but_is_it_enough/
13,q2osb7,1633540043,Divorced dad I am newly dating does not communicate much when he’s with his kids.,"I’ve been dating a divorced dad the last 2-3 months, he’s in his mid 30’s and I’m an early 30’s woman. This is my first time dating a dad so this is all new to me. His divorce was just recently finalized (his ex had an affair) and he has 50/50 custody of his daughter and son, both under 10 yrs old. So every other week and weekend he is with his kids. 

Clearly he and I are way too early in the relationship for me to meet his kids, so I don’t see him when he’s got the kids. 

However he’ll also go a few days without texting me when he has his kids, or more recently when he was with colleagues on a business trip. 

I’m also recently out of a relationship and taking this all slow so this didn’t bother me at first, but now that he and I are getting closer and spending a lot more time together (we spent all of last weekend together), it’s starting to bother me that I feel “part time” in that he doesn’t check in much when he has his kids. It also feels wrong for me to “bother” him too much during those times. 

I will discuss this with him sooner or later, but before I do I’m hoping to get a reality check if needed. I don’t have kids/never been married and feel like maybe I just don’t understand his situation. 

Is this fairly normal? TBH it’s making me feel a bit needy, which I am not used to.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/q2osb7/divorced_dad_i_am_newly_dating_does_not/
14,q2pwjm,1633543392,Nearly 40% of adults from 25-54 are unpartnered,"Wow, my friend shared some new research from  [Pew on single adults](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2021/10/05/rising-share-of-u-s-adults-are-living-without-a-spouse-or-partner/)

There is a lot here, but the take away is that this has been increasing a lot over the last 30 years. Men are generally more like to be unpartnered than women. And there are significant ethnic differences. 

“While the unpartnered population includes some adults who were previously married (those who are separated, divorced or widowed), all of the growth in the unpartnered population since 1990 has come from a rise in the number who have never been married.

This trend has broad societal implications, as does the growing gap in well-being between partnered and unpartnered adults. Looking across a range of measures of economic and social status, unpartnered adults generally have different – often worse – outcomes than those who are married or cohabiting. This pattern is apparent among both men and women. 

Unpartnered adults have lower earnings, on average, than partnered adults and are less likely to be employed or economically independent. They also have lower educational attainment and are more likely to live with their parents. Other research suggests that married and cohabiting adults fare better than those who are unpartnered when it comes to some health outcomes.”

I don’t think our society is setup for singles, particularly singles as the majority. And we are getting pretty close.  These findings are really interesting.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/q2pwjm/nearly_40_of_adults_from_2554_are_unpartnered/

My S.O. and I are currently long distance. We were talking on the phone the other day when he got really quiet. Conversation up to that point was great! We were talking and laughing, having a good time. So much so that I thought maybe he was just falling asleep. So I asked him if he wanted to hang up. He didn't respond so I said ""hello"" just to be sure. He answered very clearly and said he was there. I asked him a couple questions ""Are you falling asleep?"". Nothing. ""Do you want to hang up?"". Nothing. ""Hello?"". Nothing. So then I said ""Ok, I'll talk to you later"". He then sounded agitated and said ""What?"". I got seriously confused and said I didn't understand what was going on. I asked him if something was wrong. He refused to answer. I said goodbye again. Then he asked why. ""Well, we're not really talking and you're not answering any of my questions so I'm not sure what else to do"". He then snipped at me and said ""You're not asking the right questions"". I admittedly got frustrated and asked him what he meant. What questions should I have been asking? He refused to answer and refused talking about it at all. Now here I am, three days later without hearing a word from him. Can anyone give me any insight into this? What could this possibly mean? I'm just feeling so hurt by his behavior and lack of communication.

I (34F) had a date last weekend. He (38M) was nice and we had a good time, but I found myself comparing him to the last guy that I dated and it just brought up some unresolved feelings. My friend told me “the reason it brought up feelings for guy #1 is because you didn’t feel a spark with guy #2. If you had, you wouldn’t be thinking about the first guy.” I think she’s right, but I also wonder if perhaps I judged him unfairly, given the fact that I’m still in my head about the first situation.

The second guy brought up going out again a few times (once as we were saying goodbye, and then the next day he said “that was fun, we should do it again sometime”), and directly asked me out again yesterday. Generally I think second dates are harmless, but I’ve also been on the side of being excited to go out again, only to realize the guy was apathetic and was maybe just being polite.

Met a cute guy at my gym. He caught my eye when I saw him checking me out in the mirror. Anyway a few months went by, and I finally got up enough courage. Anyway I needed help I asked him, he was super sweet. 30 mins later I finish my workout and leave, I’ve seen him workout for months. He wasn’t finished with his routine. We also go opposite ways home, he walked out looked at me walked towards me then quickly turned around. I just walked up asked his name he walked with me. Asked if he was single he said yes then asked for number. Did the thing where he called then, I teased about his phone he asked if it was dealer breaker. Seemed like he was interested.

So we didn’t text much that night. The next time.I saw him I just said hi, I’m on my way out just wanted to say hello. Asked if he was feee this weekend. He said he was doing some house hunting, and would text me to setup a time to get drinks. I never got another text from him. I did text him good luck and no response. I never sent another message

This is where it gets weird. I haven’t seen him again and it’s been weeks! It probably has nothing to do with me but I’m feeling low.. did I do something wrong?
