I'm good at giving advice to other people but it's hard for me to take any of my own advice bc I don't think I'm deserving of love. I see all my flaws and I know that no one would love me despite them. And I don't just mean character flaws although those exist. I mean literally down to my hygiene and personal space. On one hand my neglect of these things makes me feel unlovable but on the other I never want to bother because I don't feel worth it. I still try to stay on top of it when the thoughts aren't too loud but it's not easy bc I've got ADHD so I'm distractible. 

When the thoughts become screams in my head, these are some of the things I hear:

- I'm too emotional
- I'm worthless
- I never want to have feelings for someone again
- I'm not cut out to date
- Dating isn't worth it
- I deserve to be in pain
- I'll never find love
- I can never find someone who makes me happy

I realize that I self gaslight and invalidate my own emotional state (I actually find it hard to believe while typing this), and it's largely because of two relationships that were pretty bad, on the more emotionally abusive side. I even dated someone who told me that I didn't know what gaslighting was when I tried to explain to her what happened to me. She corrected herself but still it really hurt. But then I couldn't help but wonder if I'm just making it up, like I DIDN'T really know what gaslighting is or I'm just saying it to fish for pity or something subconsciously, and it didn't help that she was a pretty radical feminist type in retrospect. (Not that there's anything wrong with feminism per se, just that she made some comments once in a while that made me feel like she hated men if that makes sense)

I have a therapist and I'm working on this stuff with her but it's still really hard, especially when I try to change my negative thoughts because I don't believe them and I cringe at me saying it to myself. I feel pathetic for even trying to change it. If anything I use my positive reframing as ammo to tell myself that I AM in fact pathetic. All these things have resulted in me just becoming more jaded and unwilling to try. My friends try to help me since I've given them advice in the past that has helped them with their own problems but this is a tough nut to crack. I wanna shut my emotions off and not feel anything for anyone anymore but I also feel like something is wrong with me or I'm broken in some way for doing so.

Or are there other people in successful LDR out there that didn’t need to do this? 

Little background on my relationship:
We have been together for 7 months and we see each other very irregular. Sometimes we are together for one month and another time we only spend 3 weeks out of 3 months together. Because of this our relationship has been a bit rocky, sometimes I feel really disconnected from him when we are apart. When we are together though, I know that he’s worth sticking out this long distance thing. 
So back to the texting all the time and (video) calling every day; how do people have time for this? My boyfriend works an unpredictable job so sometimes he can be really busy and we can only text about 3 times during the day. Of course I wish there was more communication, but I also understand that if you’re really busy and stressed that you can’t always think about texting/calling. 

Any advice on how to make the communication better so we feel less disconnected, despite of a busy high stress job?

Long story short, I'm shit at choosing men.  Whether it be the manifestation of childhood trauma at work or just bad luck, I have never had a healthy relationship.  Worst cases were physical/mental/sexual abuse, best cases were that I was just someone to have around (til I went home or to work, and then the other someones filed in to take my seat).  My experiences, along with those of most of my friends and strangers on social media, have led me to be far more comfortable being single.

I appreciate getting to have things the way I see fit, and I accept myself as I am...something that seems to fly out the window once I begin to care about the opinions of those around me.  I feel at peace when I'm alone, and for me the good in relationships just doesn't outweigh the bad/potential for catastrophe.

HOWEVER.  I do miss the intimacy (not just sex) at times.  So I've tried out the friends with benefits thing...I just can't get into it if I'm not into them.  

The only happy medium I've found was when I had a fling with a man with kids.  I was hungry for him, and would've wanted to pursue something, except for the fact that I absolutely do not want be a mom.  It's the perfect deterrent for me..keeps me from getting too invested and putting myself in harm's way, but it's safe to feel good with him if that makes sense?  

So I'm thinking I may just pursue this as my ""type""...but I do not by any means want to use or mislead someone.  I want to be upfront about it, but I also don't want to invite any dangerous people/situations.  

I don't want to ""date"" folks that I work with, my friends are just my friends for a reason, and with Covid and whatnot I don't go out much.  So this leaves dating apps.  I need more than just a smash and dash, and I also don't want to end up tied up in someone's basement.

I've made some different accounts to analyse the response rate on that dating app and found out that showing of my materealistic bullcrap is making them woman go crazy over my profile. 

while my more underdog profile was hardly getting any matches.  


Also I noticed the girls with whom I'm having a conversation with on my ""populair"" account, It's really impossible to have a good conversation. There's really nothing valuable about our conversations, while my underdog profile I was able to get 1 decent conversation with some valuable content and very interesting topics (unfortunately without any reason she shadowed me).  
Honestly, I'm someone who's a little bit to shy to go directly to someone and start talking, but I think this is the only way to really get a girl who isn't full of materealistic bullcrap.

Hence my question to the guys and ladies out here.

If I go directly to a woman to talk to here because she looks nice I'm always afraid she will think I'm just one of those dudes trying to get in her pants. But I think it's the only way now instead of using online applications, because people using them applications are to far away from reality.

I'm a 5'8, Black, in fit shape with an average stomach. I can go from fit to tight easily by exercising at home or the gym. That all sounds good on paper but there a problem. I'm not the most charismatic. I have confidence in myself, but talking to new women is different and I've had herpies since I was a teen.

Sad thing is I was once married for years. I'm divorced 2 years now. So I'm forced to court women in this new environment. I'm shocked how different things are. The priorities of everyone is so backwards.

I can't seem to meet anyone decent. I'm only looking for five qualities in a woman that I don't think are unreasonable. 
She treats me with respect
She's cute to me
She can cook and likes to cook for me the home
Has no children and want to have a family 
In healthy shape

I recently tried dating apps again, it has not been a good experience. Locally, none of the women meet my standards. When I say cute, I don't mean beautiful. A nice smile goes a long way with me. A large number of them either have kids already or they are overweight. I was raised my a single mother so I have respect for them. I just want to have my own children and raise them in a two parent household. When it comes to weight, I live a relatively healthy lifestyle, so I would like to be with someone who does too.

I have met a few women that do meet what I'm looking for and are understanding of my baggage, but they are overseas. That's great and all, but we're in a pandemic and travel is horribly restricted. So going anywhere soon is not looking likely. I'm a patient man and honestly could do a long distance relationship until we could actually live together, but even they can be impatient.

I don't claim to be perfect. In fact, I'm far from it. However, I think I have a lot to offer to a woman even with my faults. I learn from mistakes, I strive to be better all the time and I have a vision I'm working towards. It just seems as though men are no longer allowed to have any preference. When did this become a thing?

Unlike media portrays, I don't want meaningless sex. It's nothing but a quick thrill that's gone soon as she leaves and you realize you're still alone. I want companionship with a woman. I want a family. What am I doing all this for if I don't have a family? Maybe I need to approach where to meet women, I don't know. Suggestions please.

I recently joined a couple dating apps, I didn’t have really high hopes being that the couple I chose were the more low key ones. But I prefer low key because it’s really hard for me to keep up with people. So far it’s been good and I’m excited about getting back in the world and meeting new people. 

I’ve been talking to two guys and I’ve had a couple dates with one of them. It was great, he’s a great guy. He older than me, established, has a good head on his shoulders. Very attractive, he has a kid. But I don’t mind that at all, normally I’d say it would be hard. I’ve been down that road before but he’s not one of those people who are timid when it come to his kid. He’s very involved in her life and talks about you to me. I admire it and find it attractive. 

I’m still trying to figure out how a man like him would I’m ever be interested in a girl like me. But anyway, he was very open and honest about what he wants. A relationship, he wants to settle down. Which is what I’m looking for as well. The only thing that I noticed that kind of scares me if that he is so intense, he’s got that mindset of grinding all the time, doing better with you life and succeeding in all things. He goes to the gym, he eats healthy. He doesn’t play around lol, which is very intimidating for me because I feel like I can’t keep up with that. 

I’m 21 years old and he’s 37. The one things I don’t like in a person is if they take things so serious all the time. Im afraid that if I fuck yo or make mistakes or we are not on the same wavelength he won’t be interested. That’s fine, we can’t win them all right. I can afford to make mistakes, I can afford to fuck up, I can fail and then try and again. I don’t have to have it all figured out and I don’t have to be perfect and that’s the pressure I feel sometimes. Especially being around older guys. They are already skeptical about girls my age. I just want to find someone who will accept me for me. 

Im a very shy, introverted person. Not very talkative, especially when im first meeting you.
If I feel comfortable, it’s a different story. But my walls are still up and I don’t let my guard down. Our first date I was a social butterfly, I was talking, keeping conversation. It was great, he was able to see a side of me that is there but just not all the time. We basically spent the weekend together and I kinda shut down a little, i do it. I get quite and he kept joking about how quiet i was. 

I hate that I can’t talk to people, it’s hard for me. I don’t want it to be the reason people stop talking to me. I’m misunderstood, but underneath it all is someone who likes to have fun, love and laugh. I have a goofy personality, I can be outgoing. When I’m around people I can be myself around there’s nothing stoping me, no holding back at all. I’m free, I just wish people could stick around long enough to see who I really am and what I have to offer. I can’t be that person to strangers, I don’t trust easily people sometimes have these ridiculous expectations. What do I do? How can I do better?

At first we said that we were gonna take it slow but we kept sleeping together.

About 2 weeks later she said to me that she doesn't want a relationship with me but she wants to keep sleeping with me and that she wouldn't sleep with other guys and that she's gonna be jealous if i sleep with other girls. So i continued sleeping with her, but lately I'm starting to feel very empty after we have sex. And every time after we have sex she jokingly says that it was the last time. We also had the crazy idea to have sex 12 times in one day, but after round 2 she said that sex shouldnt feel like work.

Im starting to think that maybe im being manipulated or something. Our whole friendship feels like a lie.

But then she also one time during sex she said that she was inlove with me. She also cooks a lot for me and pays for most of our adventures. On the night of my 21st i came home very drunk and threw up in the bathroom. My friends were all passed out in my bedroom. She then took care of me while i vomiting by holding my hair back (guy with long hair) and helped me get into bed. 

We are taking a break from sex because the last few weeks we've had a lot of it and i told her we should give it some time to reignite the spark

I am very confused as to what is going on

So we’ve been talking for about 3 months and we finally met up a couple of weeks ago.  He picked me up and we hooked up at his place. Having sex with him was fine, except when he smacked me straight in the face twice. At first I tried to play it off but after the second time I told him to stop and not do that, which he did. After sex I told him that he was slapped me really hard but he didn’t realize that he had a heavy hand. After that we went out tho eat, went back to his place and had sex (no he didn’t slap me in the face) and he dropped me off. Even though the slap was a little concerning, I didn’t really see anything wrong with him, we have a lot in common and I had a good time. 

Fast forward to yesterday I wanted to check in with him and see if he wanted to chill this weekend. We ended talking about sex and I referenced him slapping me and he said that it was weird for me to say that because he’s slapped other women in the face before during sex and they didn’t have any issue with it. It made me really think that he doesn’t really know consent, which kinda scared me tbh. 

He also calls women “females” which is so weird to me because he say something like “ a man and a female” in the same breath. So I just asked him how he feels about women and he kinda didn’t answer the question he just said that he believes in equal rights but that feminism is “r-word”. 

I’m just hesitant to see him because I don’t like his views on women. I’m not interested in a relationship with him but I do want and deserve respect.

Went home and we remain texting each other everyday. So this goes on, with him inviting me over and end up hooking up. 

I told him I wasn’t looking for a hookup buddy and wanted to actually go somewhere other than his place to hangout. He said because of his long work schedule, it’s hard to plan something like that. So I told him I wasn’t going to go over to his place until he asked me out on an actual date. 

He will text me all day, with good morning messages and share things throughout his day. But he doesn’t ask me any questions. I brought this up to him and he said he was sorry and will work on it. But nothing has changed. I told him if he was actually interested in me, then questions would just come naturally. He said he didn’t know what to ask me?? Then when I brought it up again, he said he’d rather do it in person than text. 

So I’m confused if he’s really into me or just sees me as something physical? When we do hangout, he’ll go into deep conversations about his life.

Reality is, most of what happened could've been avoided beforehand. So what I want to do is to make use of my repetitive mistakes and give it to you as an advice on what NOT to do. Some of this might sound like rookie mistakes, but that's the point. Even if it sounds obvious, give it a read and keep reminding you of it, because when we're under the influence of love we make things we wouldn't do in a normal situation. Here it goes:

1. Not planning your date to a reasonable extent: this sums up most of the mistakes first timers and losers do. If you value the person you're dating, then make plans, no matter how little time you have. Even if you have half a day or a couple hours to organise yourself, DO IT. You will feel in control and you won't depend on luck to get a good setting.
2. Choosing a bad place for the date: as we've already talked about good settings, take the time to choose the right venue based on his/her preferences and personality. Are you dating a party person? Then a bar or someplace loud might be a good choice. Are you dating a quiet person? Go for a restaurant or any place you know doesn't get too crazy. Also, if you are going there for the first time, make it known so your date doesn't put the blame on you if she/he doesn't like the place. If you realise the place is not good, suggest going somewhere else. Doing it early might just save your date.
3. Not being clean and perfumed: basic stuff, but there must be some people who think they can go from work to a date and still smell good. When you work 3, 4 or 8 hours a day, you sweat and you smell bad. Perfume might hide some of that, but not always. Take the time to get yourself as clean as possible, because there might be a moment during the date when you must be close together and it will make all the difference.
4. Not checking venue availability or closing time: the worst way to start a date is to see that your chosen place is booked out or just closed. You will be forced to improvise, but be sure that your initial impression is already taking a hit. Choose well and have a plan B.
5. Not checking the upcoming weather: this may sound unnecessary, but let's put it like this: your ideal date could be ruined by rain, wind or cold, when you could've easily stayed inside the place and have a wonderful time. Personally, I live in the coastal area, so I'd advise for anyone in that same situation to think twice before having your date outside.
6. Choosing a working day as date day: if you're dating a coworker or someone who you know works for many hours a day, this is something to remember: planning a date after work (specially at late night) is a bad idea. If you feel tired, you won't enjoy any event as much as you would've if you were well-rested. Your ability to improvise and be humorous will be dampen considerably, and both of you will be looking for an excuse to go home.
7. Drinking more -or less- than your date: don't feel the need to show off your alcohol intake capacity. Don't be a bummer either. If she/he is drinking, you're drinking. If she/he is not, try not to. If you feel your date is getting a bit too drunk, make it known. It's vital that you two stay on the same level, otherwise it will lead to confusion and frustration.
8. Going with enough money to pay for your part: there's a very big chance that she/he won't have enough money to pay for her half. In that case, the right think should be for you to pay. Don't take it personal, it happens. Dating is a financial nightmare, but that's the reason why it should turn out as good as possible.
9. Forgetting you're on a date and not a friendly chat: depending on whether you already have something going on, you may have to keep this as a mantra: this is a date. Why do I say this? Because we may get too carried away by the logistics or our feeling for your special person and forget you have to take some iniciative. Make your intentions clear but give your date room to respond. If he/she doesn't reciprocate at first, let the conversation breath and try again later when you're more comfortable. But never leave the date wondering if she/he got the message. Be respectful, but assertive in your intentions.

That's it. I hope you see some value in it. I'm still trying to remind myself of this when I go out with someone, but your memory may be better than mine.

Not only that, I’ve also noticed that men are usually much more open to working things out with an ex than women are.

Men seem to think much more fondly of their ex, assuming there was no cheating, I’ll usually see comments like “I still think about them fondly” “I think we could have worked out if I had been more emotionally ready” “she’s a wonderful person”

On the other end, I’ve noticed women tend to speak about their exes in a very… discarded way? Like a post I saw from a women talking about how an ex from 9 months ago, reached out asking how she was doing and if she wanted to catch up, and she said she just ignored him because “it’s weird”? Every ex of mine meant something to me, I could never rudely ignore them if we’ve both moved on.
Same with a lot of ask women threads, it’s mostly “I have not even thought about them once” or “I don’t care to see how they’re doing” or “I had an ex reach out and immediately blocked him.

It’s almost as if men see relationships as more significant than women do? Like as a man, why wouldn’t I try and work things out with someone I shared so much of my time with? Or why wouldn’t I think of them fondly forever?


Am I the only one who has noticed this? I can’t help but think that because online dating has given women incredible choice to pick from, they will almost always find someone better fairly easily (I’ve noticed men stay single for much longer)

I have a problem and maybe you have some advice for me...

Me, (M) mid twenties am fortunate enough to be self employed and own a nice house and 2 quote on quote ""supercars"".
No I am not a materialistic person I just wanted to treat myself... That however is not the point of my post.

My ""problem"" is it feels like every girl I meet is a golddigger. Once they see me with the cars, or they see my home I hear sentences like ""oh we should go shopping, or have a fancy dinner... blablabla""

As said, I dont give a shit about those things. I still love rocking my 30 € H&amp;M outfit or go to MC Donalds to have a bite, but it feels like those materialistic things I bought to treat myself, ruin the chance of getting to know a girl who is serious about getting to know me and not my money.

My friend jokingly said I should buy a cheap car and use that as my daily/when I am meeting up with girls but on the other hand this is me representing not my real self. So I dont know if thats a good idea...

Any advice? Also what do you think about my friends idea?

I have recently joined the dating app circuit and have been having a lot of fun going on different dates and things. Before I begin, of course I would prefer to meet somebody just out and about but with the pandemic, and my work hours, its  happened a few times but not as frequently/quickly as I would like. 

I've been on about several dates so far with a few different  guys, but they all have gone just about the same way. We go on a few dates, Get closer, and eventually I end  up sleeping with them when it feels  right, and at some point things completely change. I haven't been ghosted per say but the vibe is always so different.  I feel like guys who were once so attentive and fun just become boring, barely responsive, and at least to me seem like they are trying to ""play cool.""

I have slept(safely) with 3 guys in the past 3 months, and each one I have had an amazing time and what I thought was  smooth vibe and good times, and yet each one has ended up just kind of going dark as I said, way less flirtations, way less excitement, way less desire to do things. 

I guess I'm just confused. I guess I feel like confused if maybe having sex with them just is what they wanted and after that they don't feel the need to put in effort ? But I enjoy sex and I usually wait until I feel like we have  formed a  bond of some sort, I know that sex changes things but I thought guys would be more or  just as  into me after that. Maybe they just don't think I'm good in bed, but they have all seemed  into it at the time and have not given me any hint they aren't into it ( not to be graphic but sometimes they cum quick and are embarrassed or we have sex several times in a night) 

Maybe they just don't view me as girlfriend material after we have sex. But to me sex is an enjoyable and crucial part of a relationship. I also sometimes they guy is trying to ""play cool"" or like not get attached. I get this vibe a lot but then I remind myself that if they wanted to talk to me they probably would. I highly doubt it would all be a ""cool"" act

I feel like I am a kind, intelligent woman and I am always trying to better myself. I have a good job and my own place. I care about the people I date and do my best to be who they need. I am a little overweight but I work hard on my appearance and think I'm at least medium attractive. I guess I'm just feeling a lot lost and undervalued and confused and a lot of different feelings and thoughts are swirling.

 I'm tired of repeating this cycle. How long should I hold off from having sex when beginning dating and how do you do it when the attraction is there. I go through this honeymoon phase of thinking a guy is super awesome and having fun with him and then it  just slowly dying and its emotionally exhausting.

I'm totally open to all thoughts/advice, I'm not sensitive and I know this may sound terrible to people. I guess I'm just asking if this is normal or if there are ways to form healthy relationships that also fit my needs and desires. I know this is confusing and kind of all oover the place I guess I was just looking to vent and see if anyone had similar experiences.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125117,public,nsfw,Would love some brutal honesty,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqbbg8/would_love_some_brutal_honesty/,no_ads,0,,,

I used to think that it was just them being clingy, or me being very independent, but now I think it may be a low self steem issue reinforced by dating emotionally unavailable guys.

 I had a great first date with a guy a few days ago, and I came out of it thinking he was so perfect, and I was even nervous he wouldnt like me as much as I liked him. But since early morning next day after the date, he has been texting every day, many times a day. He even sent me a picture of his home office. I went from really liking him to thinking there is something wrong with him I didnt see in the date, or he is just generally desperate. 

On the one hand, I think he really is texting too much too early. On the other, I've been in love three times in my life, and all with emotionally unavailable people with commitment issues, so my idea of normal communication is fucked up. Myself I am a very guarded person (some of my best friends and family say I can be cold), possibly because I was bullied as a child.  I once kinda sabotaged a relationship because the guy sent me voice messages (lol, not my proudest moment).

Everything was great, awesome and fun. For once silence wasnt uncomfortable with someone, and he made me feel safe and it just felt healthy.

We were spending our weekends together, spending the night and either going on dates or just hanging out at his house. He would make me breakfast, be sweet with me, cuddle all the time, grab my hand while driving, etc. I genuinely thought we were dating as we would talk every day mostly all day, as much as our jobs allowed us to.

I spent all this weekend with him, I made a comment that I could tag him on my instagram story of the place we were, and he said no, it was okay. He wasnt really affectionate in public, mainly because his rank in the Army, and he said he wasnt really comfortable running into one of his soldiers.

On sunday we spent all morning doing outside stuff, farmers market + brunch, then we went back to his house, watched the football game and cuddle/take naps. Before leaving, I asked him ""What are we, what are we doing"" and he said we were friends seeing where this was going. I told him I really liked him and I wanted to date him. He said we could remain friends if I wanted, and that we didnt have to have sex anymore if I didnt want to. I was completely blindsided. I thought we were already dating.

He walked me to the truck, and I asked him if we were seeing other people, he said he couldnt tell me what to do. Then he asked me ""What do you want to do"" and I said again ""I really like you, and I want to date you"", he then said he NEEDED TO THINK ABOUT IT!!

He is set to leave to another country in the next 3 months. When I got home I sent him a text saying that I am sorry it that came out of nowhere, but I truly wanted to try with him, and that if three months was all we have, then I wanted them. He didnt reply.

Yesterday I met with him at a mid point of the city because I had forgotten my glasses at his place. Seeing him felt weird, he kept trying to kiss me and hug me, and I did. He say ""Have fun in your trip and be safe"" (Im leaving town this weekend) and I brought the subject again/ I told him I had missed talking to him all day, and that I did not wanted to stop seeing him, if 3 months was all I could have, then I wanted them. He only said ""We will talk tomorrow"". I havent spoken to him ever since, he hasnt messaged me, nothing.

I am torn with my desicion. Part of me thinks it was good that I voiced what I wanted and tried to get. it, and I am fully aware that he is leaving the country for 4 years, but I was having a really great time with him, and I really like him and his company. But on the other side I feel like I messed up things and that maybe I rushed into something? That maybe if I wouldve just stay quiet and ""go with the flow"" like he said we would still be together. Even though we were technically together, I was basically a friend with benefits, and I am not really into that.

I want to text him, but I am not about to beg him. I put my cards on the table and was open and honest with him, if he doesnt want it then he is probably never going to be interested in something. Should I text him or just let it take its curse, aka die.

I know I can get on a app and get dates but most of them haven’t worked out for me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125131,public,self,I feel I am in the prime in my 20s but with no one to spend it with.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqc64f/i_feel_i_am_in_the_prime_in_my_20s_but_with_no/,no_ads,0,,,

Just wanted to ask here how can I meet girls without with being creepy. I come from a very conservative background and have trouble meeting girls.

I have a few friends who I've asked to introduce me to their mutual friends. I have tried tinder and other such apps but no results.

I adore my boyfriend and he adores me but I always have this inherent feeling that I'm not good enough for him.

My boyfriend is quite intellectual, he's someone who's super smart and knows what he's doing. I on the other hand have done well for myself, but I wouldn't call myself an 'intelligent' person, I'd say I'm someone who just makes up for average brains with extra effort because that is what I have done all my life.

Idk how to explain this but I just always feel like he deserves better. He deserves someone as smart as him. He should be with someone who knows stuff and is going places. I do believe that I might end up someplace good, but I don't feel too sure of that.

I have no idea if there's any way I can feel better about this. I'm just looking for advice on how to deal with this or is there something I should do about it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125132,public,self,I(F21) don't think I'm good enough for my boyfriend(M23),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqc9ab/if21_dont_think_im_good_enough_for_my_boyfriendm23/,no_ads,0,,,
