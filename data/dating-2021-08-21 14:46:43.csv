I‚Äôm a guy who dates women. I‚Äôve read online that some women have said they don‚Äôt like to be asked out for a second date in person because of safety issues. I totally get and respect that.

It can make dating challenging because if I am interested in someone, there can be opportunities during the date to say ‚Äúwe should do that together‚Äù. If they aren‚Äôt feeling it, I‚Äôm not looking to put pressure on them or make them feel awkward. At the same time, if I don‚Äôt say anything, I feel like I‚Äôm not showing interest.

How should I handle this? Is it fine to not say anything during the date but follow up soon after to ask them out again? Or is it better to give hints that I want to do something with them again?

Thanks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p8yl52/dating_conundrum/

At times wed even spend the entire day together. Shes inexperienced so i didnt put pressure on her and weve made out maybe 3 times. I asked her to be more expressive with herself and show ke more affection, which i think is normal considering she agreed to be my gf. She didnt feel that way and said im way ahead of her on things emotionally. She said we really dont know each other and she needs more time to be able to open up. This topic came up twice and we broke up on the second time we talked about this. So id like any insight on this so i could possibly reflect and change my way of thinking? Am i in the wrong for expecting some emotional expressiveness from her? Or was i moving too fast? Any input is appreciated.

This strategy almost never works.

In these situations, the best way to handle things is to always be honest in an upfront, but respectful manner, never showing bitterness or resentment. A lot of times, the request to remain friends with be done in retaliation for the rejection, to harm emotionally instead of being honest with intent. It should always be the latter.

It seems harsh, but pretending to be someone‚Äôs friend when you have other intentions is ultimately deceitful, it doesn‚Äôt matter what your intent is. When this happens, the friendship often ends in a confrontational manner. The person who rejected waits in the wings, while their ‚Äòfriend‚Äô dates other people, and the resentment builds. The frustration comes out in passive aggressiveness, insults, more unhealthy attachment, etc.

It‚Äôs always best to show your intent from the beginning. If you have a friend and feelings develop, simply ask them out. Don‚Äôt make an over the top declaration of love and devotion. If they accept, have fun and see if they are a good fit for you as well. Only spend time pursuing those who value you, and be upfront as early as possible.

Edit: If you are rejected, always be cautious of someone‚Äôs intent if they want to remain friends.

27,p908vk,1629583306,Pressuring my girlfriend to get therapy??," I (22M) have been dating my girlfriend (22F) for four years now. Our relationship has been great, she's everything that I imagined my girlfriend to be and I can see myself marrying her. For the first year of our relationship, we were both satisfied with our sexual activity and everything was great. Going into the relationship, she told me about her abusive ex-boyfriend where she had some trauma built up. In about year 2 of our relationship, she says that her trauma has been coming back and that was the reason why she would almost never be in the mood, never initiate anything, and sex felt forced. Obviously, I respected that and tried to support her through this and would never force anything sexual upon her if she didn't want to. She said she needs time to unpack everything which is very fair.

It is now year 4 and it seems that nothing has really improved, we've had countless talks about her trauma and i've brought up getting therapy many times, which she agreed she needs but her commitment isn't quite there. I know that finding a therapist is a huge step for anybody with trauma, I've tried to help her find a few but she has never followed through with any. My girlfriend also feels terrible for me and constantly feels she can't satisfy me and that she is so ""problematic"". Currently, I am scared to initiate anything sexually nor even try to flirt with her sexually because I don't want to come off as anybody remotely similar to her ex or to re-aggravate her trauma. If we do have sex (around once a month), I found that my mental game is not there because I am just worried I will hurt her and I can sense that she's not really into it.

What I struggle with is finding the balance between treading carefully with my gf's trauma and keeping myself satisfied without pressuring her. For the first few years, I was patient and understanding that shit like this happens and I should be nothing but supportive of her. But now, I'm growing more impatient and worrying about the years ahead of us. I have never been abusive with her and would always think for her before thinking of myself, but I think it's gotten too far. I feel bad for repeatedly bringing up therapy every time we have one of those ""deep talks"" but we both know that it is the best solution for us.

Would appreciate what the reddit world has to say- I would prefer not to break up with her because sex-aside, she really is the one for me.

32,p90kdc,1629584467,Old female friend with a boyfriend I havent seen in 4 years hit on me pretty hard.,"So I'm 27 years old and she's 24. I've known this girl since I was like 15 years old practically, she was friends with my younger brothers group of friends while we were growing up. She was pretty close to him for a couple of years and knew our family really well, has been over out house a bunch. When I was younger I always had the feeling she had a crush on me but I spent my time with my friends so we didn't have the most time to talk and hangout.

I haven't seen this girl in 3 or 4 years. The other night she was at a bar with her boyfriend and a friend of hers. My uncle random happend to be there and knows the bartender. My female friend (let's call her Alissa) knows the bartender as well. The bartender introduced my uncle to Alissa and she heard his last name somehow and figured out he was my uncle. 

She was all excited and said I should come by the bar (for some reason me not my brother). She texts me out of the blue at 11:30 and says come by. I told her I'm already going to sleep maybe another time and she pushed me with a text or two and I came by. When I got there my uncle had left already and it was just me, her, her boyfriend and her other friend.

She was clearly happy to see me and spend almost all of the time talking to me. She would stare me in the eyes for so long while talking to me (like deep 15-20 second stares) and was practically 6 inches from my face, while talking I could smell her breath. The bar had maybe 15 people in our area with light music. For a couple of minutes she was saying how she felt lost and unhappy about something and it sounded kind of specific. I got the vibe she was going to say ""her boyfriend"" and voiala that was it. She said ""oh thank got he walked away"" and then she told me after. I asked if she was even attracted to him and she was like ""no."" And right after I was like holy crap same here, which happens to be the truth. She went on for another minute or two before he came back about how she wasn't happy with the relationship. She said her boyfriend was going to say something along the lines of ""why can't we get along as well as that guy you were vibing with at the bar"" after they leave. We stuck together and talked until them 3 had to leave. She even said, ""I'm so glad you came by tonight, it helped me with perspective and realize some things"" something like that.. The only thing she didn't really do was touch me and I'm guessing its probably because her bf was in the same room.

All in all I had a lot of energy from her, and I'm pretty sure this is a sign that she likes me..? I texted her the next day, she didn't sound as exuberant as she did the night before but said yeah for sure let's get together when I'm off middle of next week again. - I implied (with her boyfriend, kind of).

She‚Äôd make up excuses to get me to help her, we‚Äôd make excuses to go do the same tasks together, we‚Äôd constantly be laughing with each other, we added each other on like all social media which is weird for our workplace, she teases me all the time, she (not so subtly) tried to find out if I was single, etc. For a few reasons I don‚Äôt think it would have worked; there‚Äôs a bit of an age gap (I‚Äôm 23 and she‚Äôs 19) so we‚Äôre kind of at different stages of our lives, and she can be a little immature about certain things. But still, I would really look forward to a shift if I knew she was on and we could joke around with each other.

So today I handed in my resignation. I kind of wanted to just keep it to myself and not make a big deal about it to anyone, as I still have to work my notice, but I knew when I was handing it in that, with the way my remaining schedule for my notice period works out, I was never gonna have another shift with this girl. I knew it was our last shift together and kind of spent all day trying to think about how I should tell her, or whether I should at all. It didn‚Äôt help she was so normal with me; she was walking by me and playfully punching me on the arm and that kind of shit. Part of me wanted to just not tell her and leave it on that happy note, but at the same time I kind of felt like I owed it to her to let her know, because I know she‚Äôd have been a little sad if she showed up and I was just gone one day.

So I picked my moment and told her and she was like floored and completely shocked. She seemed genuinely a little stunned when she found out it would be our last shift. When I first told her the conversation was a little short but awkward, it was like we both had a lot to say but couldn‚Äôt really figure out what to say or how to say it. It felt kind of tense, I felt like she might have been a bit angry I didn‚Äôt let her know sooner, but probably thought she had no right to be angry or whatever. There was definitely a lot unsaid between us. We only really knew each other for a couple of months, but it really felt like we hit it off. That kind of short conversation ended on us joking with each other and it felt like we both walked away almost mid conversation because we both kind of just didn‚Äôt know what to say to each other, it wasn‚Äôt a proper goodbye at all.

About half an hour later I finished my shift and I bumped into her on my way out and it was really bittersweet. I just kind of awkwardly went ‚Äòwell....‚Äô and we both just kind of awkwardly laughed and properly said our goodbyes. It was still kind of lighthearted but it was obvious now we were both sad and we spent a bit more time talking as if we both didn‚Äôt want to let the conversation end this time round. She kind of had this sad smile the full time we talked that I can‚Äôt really describe, it was like she was trying to control her emotions kind of. The whole thing kind of reminded me of the end of Lost In Translation, where you have two people who kind of can‚Äôt admit at first when they leave each other how much it‚Äôs affecting them, because for all intents and purposes they haven‚Äôt known each other long, but they made such an impact in the short time that it‚Äôs still hard to say goodbye even if you can‚Äôt put it into words.

So that was that. The whole thing just struck me as really bittersweet and like a ‚Äòright person, wrong time‚Äô kind of moment. We were definitely attracted to each other, but we only had a couple of months together really and with the whole age gap and everything, it just wasn‚Äôt something that was gonna happen. Maybe if we were both a little older, if we had been in some position where we saw each other over a longer time, etc. I felt kind of stupid for feeling so sad when I was trying to build up to telling her I was leaving, but when I did and I realised she was acting awkward and trying to hide the fact she felt the same it made me feel less stupid, but probably made it more sad. It‚Äôs weird how you can be in and out of someone‚Äôs life like that so quick and still kind of make an impact on one another, I will genuinely miss her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p90p6n/had_a_bit_of_a_right_person_wrong_time_situation/

37,p90qyh,1629585118,Issue still bothering me,"Hello everyone. 

A few days ago, I posted a long story to several different subs about me and this guy that I thought liked me. 

Long story short: 

I felt like he lead me on, deceived me, and tricked me because he was dating another girl even though he had flirted with me. I confronted him about it. He denied leading me on and said that he never liked me and was only being nice. I called him an asshole for leading me on. He told me to leave him alone and I did. I then blocked him on Instagram. 

About 30 minutes after I blocked him on Instagram, he messaged me on Snapchat with a mean message. I told him to please stop contacting me. He said okay and took a screenshot of the chat. 

Yesterday, I screenshotted all our previous chats (including the ones where he is flirting with me) on Snapchat in case the issue comes up again. When Snapchat notified him that I took screenshots of the chat, he messaged me a question mark as if to ask why I was doing that but I ignored him. I then blocked him on Snapchat. 

I know I should move on since I blocked him, but the whole issue just keeps bugging me. Why?

He has a child under the age of two and recently started a new job. So I get that he‚Äôs busy.

I have very bad social anxiety, so hanging out with anyone new comes with a crazy amount of anxiety leading up. And it‚Äôs very frustrating to me that I‚Äôve spent two whole days so anxious I can‚Äôt stop shaking, just to not hear from him. 

Red flags, right? I‚Äôm not mad about it. I get stuff comes up. And even if he changed his mind that‚Äôs ok. I don‚Äôt care what he does in his free time, but I do care what he does with my free time, ya know? 

I just don‚Äôt know where to go from here. Last night was the second time and I haven‚Äôt heard from him. Maybe he has social anxiety too? I dunno.

48,p919rm,1629587083,I got into a fight with someone I've been seeing and he hasn't replied,"We've been speaking since late May and it was going well and saw each other multiple times a week until we got into a large argument on race, he had even said we should go our own ways but then I ended up convincing him to keep on seeing me. But he'd stop seeing me as often/texting back as much but still saw me a few times a month. in the meantime, we'd still argue small things but it would usually get resolved that moment.

We finally had a breakthrough moment last Friday, we were having a lot of fun until I caught him doing something really shady behind my back and I know he didn't mean to hurt me and I saw how remorseful he was so I forgave him and have never spoken about it since. That was the first argument where we didn't yell but we spoke it out and I even started tearing up bc the moment meant a lot. the weird thing is it might've been a more tame conversation and he actually fucked up big so he was the one begging for my forgiveness.

We've seen each other 2 more times since that Friday. I came over yesterday afternoon and it has been absolutely amazing and things seemed to be like how they were in the beginning again in terms of seeing him frequently and finally getting texts back and forth and daily, I've never felt so intimate with someone and had so much fun just staying in. This is the first relationship where I don't have anxious butterflies.

This is until we hit an argument at the end of the hangout and I was upset at him for leaving w/ his friends earlier for his plans that he had already scheduled thus cutting our time shorter. I was visibly upset but was quiet for the most part. he tells me I'm a drama queen and I need to chill (even tho he knows its bad to tell a woman to relax) then he starts yelling at me out of nowhere saying how we fight too much, how he's never been w/ a girl like me who keeps arguing with him, that I ruined his day and that he's too old for this (I'm 22, he's 29) meanwhile tears are streaming down my face with no words bc I'm in disbelief. I had to leave since his friends were expected to come and he says he'll talk to me later. I see his friends in the hall so they heard us arguing and so did his superintendent and doorman. He eventually texted me saying he's sorry for being so frustrated and how he was beyond embarrassed that everyone heard. I texted him back how sorry I felt that it got to this boiling point but shared my feelings of how hurt I was when he lashed out esp when he compared me to other girls and brought up our past when I've already moved past it. I've texted him a couple of times saying how sorry I am and how I hope we continue to see each other because there are truly good times we have in between everything. He hasn't texted back but I know he's been on his phone.

He's typically with his friends all day Saturday so I guess he's blowing off steam and needs a break which is understandable but I'm wondering if this is really the end for us since i'd expect him to reply faster seeing how much he cares about me. He does take a while to respond sometimes esp if it's a serious convo but always ends up replying. I'm hopeful in making it work out but we just need to sit down and talk about our communication styles when we get mad. He's a sweet guy and he knows I carry my own anxiety issues and seems to handle it better than any other guy meanwhile I know he has his own flaws and I accept that about him.

53,p91sbq,1629589081,Dating a Christian,"Hello,

I have come to this forum to ask for advice as I'm very confused about my faith.

I grew up from a mixed religious background. My father is Muslim and my mother Catholic.  Growing up I would attend church with my mother and as I grew older I would go to the mosque on Fridays with my father.

The past few years I've been reading the Quran and I've not given much thought to Jesus (pbuh). 

Now I'm 30 and looking for a serious relationship and started dating a Christian woman. She introduced me more to the Bible and Jesus, as before my religious foundation has not been strong at all. 

I like the Bible and it's teachings, but this woman and I broke up. She wants someone who believes in Jesus as God. She also says she doesn't want to force anything on me.  I've honestly been considering it and I think I'd be okay with it as long as we were together.

From what I understand in the Quran, God is indivisible. But sometimes when I read the Bible it can make sense in my head. Maybe I can believe both and be with her? Would this be committing a sin? 

I feel so in love and have prayed and asked God for help so many times and have read the Bible and Quran so much in a short amount of time that I physically can't focus on it anymore. 

I just want to be with her, but I feel so conflicted. 

If I were to be with her I'd be praying ""Jesus thank you for ..., ..., ..., In Jesus name, Amen"" and gong to church.

Is it possible to go along with get faith and believe Islam in my heart? Or just accept that I'm not perfect and just give her what she wants and be with her? I've never been the most devout Muslim as I don't pray 5 times daily and don't always go to Friday prayer (although I really enjoy it).

Anyway, I was afraid of what would happen if my family found out. I'm the only son and my father passed away and my mother and sisters still expect me to read Al fatiha when animals pass away and we bury them.


I am in love, but this woman won't accept me without giving my life to Jesus and accepting him as God. Please help",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p91sbq/dating_a_christian/

He was exactly everything I wanted and I couldn‚Äôt have been happier. We met through a dating app and last night we started talking about our experiences when we were using them before. He made a comment about how for him he didn‚Äôt think he was that good looking and so he would only swipe right on girls he considered ‚Äúin his league.‚Äù This really hurt my feelings because I took that as, if he doesn‚Äôt find himself good looking, his league would consist of girls he doesn‚Äôt find that attractive either (e.g. - me). When I said I was hurt and commented on it he said he didn‚Äôt mean it that way. He meant that half of the girls on the dating apps looked like super models and he knew he couldn‚Äôt be with someone like that. Now I‚Äôm hurt even more after this. He kept apologizing and saying he didn‚Äôt mean it how I was taking it but this is literally exactly how he said those things and whenever I asked what he ‚Äúactually‚Äù meant he would either say something even worse, or just stay quiet. I decided to ask him to rate me on a scale to see how attractive he actually finds me and he said I was a 7.

After all of this I called my sister and talked to her and her fianc√© about this. They thought it was disrespectful for someone that is supposed to love you to say those things to you. That the person you love should think you‚Äôre a 10 and thinking otherwise means they‚Äôre settling for you.

I tried to talk to him again after this phone call and once again it got worse. I asked what he actually meant by those comments again and then he says that half of the people on the apps are ‚Äúhot‚Äù‚Ä¶ so my immediate thought is, well then I guess I‚Äôm not hot? I didn‚Äôt say anything because at this point he looked like he was about to cry. He started crying and I felt bad so I held him and comforted him until he stopped crying. I feel frustrated because I was the one that got hurt and yet I had to comfort him. 

I just feel really hurt by all of this. I‚Äôm already really insecure and having to think my partner is settling for me is not okay. I really don‚Äôt know what to do.

60,p926w4,1629590606,Ex-FWB and her friend,"
Hi folks,

I‚Äôm a 21M currently going into senior year at university. In sophomore year, I met a girl through a friend who I clicked with almost instantly. The conversations seemed to flow seamlessly and for once, my romantic interest was the one initiating conversation and contact. Ofcourse, I was delighted. 

Later that week, she asked for some help with a few errands so I thought it would be a good way to spend some time with her. Things went well and that night we ended up making out. She had told me she was looking for something casual, which I was totally cool with. The physical stuff continued to escalate that month and she genuinely seemed excited to meet me.

My friend that introduced us didn‚Äôt know her that well either, and I would later find out that she was seeing other people at this time (which I expected since we were casual). We continued seeing each other for 2-3 months, and by this point she had drunk called me saying I didn‚Äôt love her, and when she brought up her ex and got emotional, she was upset when I said that maybe we should take some time off.

This was my very first romantic experience ever, so she was my first kiss. I was scared, nervous and excited, but I was careful to not commit to someone that didn‚Äôt see me as a dating option. 

However, I did end up letting my guard down and did get attached. She pushed me away and began to talk about the other guys she was seeing, which sparked major insecurities and comparison/anxiety for me.

At this point we started going our own ways, and eventually she fell for someone else and we ended it. I went radio silent, but she did try to reach out by replying to my stories on Instagram, but I was generally cold as I was getting over the attachment and feeling of being replaced. 

Months later, I matched with her best friend. We hit it off and started dating. She had okayed this initially, but now a few months into this relationship, she maligned me by saying that I was emotionally unavailable and that her friend could do better, even though I was the one attached.

I went no contact and removed her from social media, and since then she has spread rumours about her best friend cheating on me.

How do I proceed? My girlfriend(her best friend) has also gone non contact, but my ex fwb is now reaching my best friend to try to break us up.

During my fling, I often went out of my way for her, hosting her and her friends, checking up on her 24/7, and just generally giving boyfriend commitment when I wasn‚Äôt one. Is she just missing the safe/reliable guy, or is this a sign of something more?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p926w4/exfwb_and_her_friend/

We exchanged a few sentences, he tells me he is visiting, and said he wanted to meet me.  So, he then asks if he can come over so we can ""chat and see if there is chemistry"".  I didn't feel comfortable with that, so i suggested we go to a close by park and go for a walk.  So we met, and first thing i smelled was mouthwash.  He also didn't look that clean.  He tells me he is on a cross country road trip since the last ten weeks, and has been sleeping in his truck.  He is from the west coast, im in the east coast.  He also suggested we go on a secluded path where noone would see us and i declined since i wasnt feeling comfortable.  Last thing he tells me is he is a personal trainor but instead of working at a gym he goes to people's homes and works out in their back yard.  It was just all so sketchy.

63,p92ffj,1629591499,4 months in and all the effort seemed to fade at the drop of a hat.,"I'm 25 and he's 30. It started off unbelievably strong. I had really thought we connected, we shared so much in common (small stuff like shared hobbies/interests but also significant things like world views/political ideology/shared background experiences and from similar cultures) but we were different enough that everything seemed to flow. We were talking about getting serious, about our futures, about our dreams and hopes, making plans. The first three months it seemed to keep up that way; getting used to each other, seeing where things went, really enjoying each other and the process of getting to know one another more deeply, and then towards the end of the third month the effort on his end took a sharp decline until suddenly at almost exactly the four month mark he comes out telling me he doesn't want pressure on either of us and cut communication steeply. Cited work getting more intense and feeling like he had the weight of the world of other peoples' expectations on him.

He's no longer expressing interest, barely talking to me except when he's drunk (every weekend) he sends me a bunch of nonsense, and when he's sober if he bothers to say anything all he does is send me litany-style updates about how busy he is (unprompted - I stopped reaching out when I realized what was happening) or tells me random shit about looking to buy a house or a picture here or there of him with his friends. It was such a drastic tonal shift I initially thought he might just be overwhelmed so tried to offer support/give him some space but it's become clear that he hasn't got time or interest for me and I'm past chasing people. It's just annoying because I still get texts from him and we didn't end on a bad note - his ""no pressure"" proclamation + drunken babble ensured removal of any ability to have a serious conversation and at this point it's not worth the effort to me.

Now, at first I was relieved about this. He's not someone who I was planning to want to date seriously either, as his motivations don't really match mine. He is also aware that I've been dating other people (before this conversation), though I'm not sure if that factored into his 'decision' here. But, the more I've spent time with him, the more I like him. When we aren't together, we barely ever text, and we don't really set up next dates at the end of each hook up. So much so that I walk away each time thinking I'll never see him again (but this is also my slightly anxious attachment style speaking). When we discussed his feelings about our current situation, I told him that I was happy to continue spending time with him, but that I genuinely didn't know how I would feel to continue seeing someone casually, indefinitely. But, I did tell him that if he were to start hooking up with other people, we would need to use protection.

I‚Äôm getting pretty hopeless and feel like I‚Äôm reverting to a weird child version of myself. Just want to run to a mother‚Äôs arms and cry. I have matches. Over 200 guys (and some ones from irl not apps) but not one of them works out and I‚Äôm waking up to the idea that it‚Äôs maybe me. I‚Äôm literally this close to shaving my head and cutting off my vagina and living in a cabin in the woods. I think I‚Äôm funny? I can laugh at myself and I think I have things to say about the world, about science, music, art. I think I have hobbies, and I really like to listen to people and get to know them. I think I have boundaries, I think I‚Äôm older now and I know what I want and I‚Äôm TRYING to say it. I feel confident in my ability to hold a conversation. I always thought the issue is how I look. And it held me back for too many years, but intellectually there is evidence against that because people go out of their way to tell me they think I look nice on a daily basis now that I‚Äôve moved to this country. And when I post to Reddit, I get hundreds of upvotes and messages and awards and people telling me they register me as a good looking person. Typing this, and I think forever, I will always view myself as a fat raggedy potato. But I‚Äôm trying to act more confident and trying to accept compliments. Trying to do something different. I‚Äôm always ‚Äúdoing something different‚Äù hoping that one time, it may work out. They said stay away from the fuck boys, they said don‚Äôt be shallow! Don‚Äôt go for looks. Go for ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù. Guys who put pronouns in their bio, guys who are well educated and versed on women‚Äôs issues. Stop dating older guys. Stop dating cis guys!!! I think I have an excellent radar and can pick up very quickly on the most subtle signs of game playing, negging, ignorance, unkindness, etc. I‚Äôve literally tried with my heart, the poster child progressive guy that my friends would shed tears of joy seeing me with. That I myself was proud I could gain recognition and respect from. Not an older tattoooed douchey looking gymbro that makes my friends roll their eyes. Guys that are so sweet, who are so respectful, who on dates ask me if I‚Äôm okay and comfortable. But... at first. It‚Äôs always amazing at first, and then I lose them. So now I wonder, if something about me brings out the worst in men. If something about me turns these poster child ‚Äúgood‚Äù guys bad. These guys whose entire pics are with their moms and grandmas. Who like puppies and ask me how I am and about my day and never take it too far. Surely it‚Äôs me? 

I‚Äôm not an angel, I‚Äôm not great at responding to texts and despite everything I‚Äôm still easily overwhelmed and I guess can appear cold/closed off.

I have had sex, but it's been sparingly and not ideal so far. Just the thought of these guys getting to explore themselves sexually in deeply intimate situations with people they loved - it's enough to make me teary-eyed. NOT because I'm jealous, but because I wish I had that for myself.

92,p94obc,1629600635,Should I persuade a girl with mutual feelings for me to give it a try?,"First of all, thank you for taking the time to read this. If not, TL;DR at the bottom.

I've liked a girl ever since we met 8 years ago in college. She was an international Chinese student and I'd just gone through a bad long-distance breakup. It was hard for either of us to really start something, given our meticulous/analytical/logical personalities had already seen the end before we could start anything. Her with being able to stay in America for visa reasons; myself with starting a rigorous career &amp; possibly moving out to Korea in the future.

I always thought...2 more years, then I'll be in Korea. My plan delayed by like...basically 8 years now, each time thinking I'd go back in 2 years, only to find good opportunities if I stayed in America. So I did. But she went off to China for a few years. And then graduate school in New York (myself in LA). Then currently a job on the east coast (myself still in LA). I imagined one day getting married to her but I never knew how long I'd have to wait or how it'd pan out, if ever.

Everything changed in Nov 2020. During an annual health exam, my dad found out that something was growing inside of him. I questioned my very existence, having lived apart from him for 15+ years given his sacrifice to work alone in Korea to support us financially. Luckily they removed the tumor and he's healthy, but I know I definitely still want to spend more time with my parents in Korea while I can. So I want to move back and now it's probably a matter of when, not if. Today my decisions are based on whether I would regret something in the long-term or not. People often regret the things they don't do rather than the things they do.

So when she visited a friend in May, I finally told her how I felt. She mentioned she also liked me as she was crying happy tears. It was a beautiful moment and she told me she would cancel her plans to spend quality time with me during her week-long trip.

But we didn't spend that time together. Later that week, we met because she wanted to have a mature discussion about how she cancelled because she didn't want emotional attachment because she knew I would one day move. She'd been in long distance relationships before and hates them. I have no clue when I'll move, if ever, because my life is so up in the air right now.

She mentioned that if she found out how I felt earlier, she would've gone out with me because she was ""young and stupid"" (which I don't believe; we haven't changed much; she's smart as hell).

I have regrets that I didn't tell her my feelings earlier, so I finally told her how I felt this past May, and here we are again...seeing the end before anything starts. It's a desperate feeling I've felt so often. I told her I respect her thoughts &amp; feelings and that I support her. That I just wanted her to be happy, no matter where we ended up in life. And that I understood her completely. I meant all of that.

Fast forward and we're still great friends, catching up every now and then. I ask if she wants to travel somewhere together over Labor Day Weekend and she says yes. Then a few days later...again...she cancels on me. Same idea--emotional attachment. She's afraid of emotional attachment and afraid that she wouldn't be able to control her emotions when she's with me and that things might get complicated between us which we don't want because we both value the friendship so much. Same thing on my side...I told her what I'd told her before (totally understand; support her; etc). And I also mentioned that I'm not the type to persuade people, because I believe people should do what they want to do, rather than get persuaded, and that I'm not the type to want to impose. She also tends to be an emotional people-pleaser type so I especially want to empower her to make her own decisions to get what she wants for herself to make herself happy.

So here I am. I'm honestly heartbroken. And I don't know how to feel. I feel like our fear is driving us to make such rational, minimal-risk decisions. It seems so simple...we both like each other. And I can't get past the feeling that I might regret this in the future if we don't let things just play out naturally. But also that we might regret it if we do get emotional attachment and I do in fact leave. I so badly want to spend more time with her while I can but I don't want to persuade her. Or should I? I've no clue what's right.

It'd be great to get some feedback to see from y'all how absolutely batshit crazy / emotional / stupid I sound right now, and maybe put some perspective on all this? And whether I should actually say something to her, that I feel like maybe we should give it a try before we go off our separate ways? And what to say, if anything?

IDK. Very confused. Thank y'all so much for hearing me out. For real.

TL;DR Moving out of country possibly soon (months? years?). Liked a girl since 8 years ago. Finally told her 3 months ago and she told me she liked me back. She doesn't want to meet because she has a fear she can't control her emotions and she'll develop emotional attachment for me even though I'm likely leaving. I understand &amp; respect her &amp; her thoughts completely. Not sure how to feel. Not sure whether I should persuade her to take risks so we both don't regret like we both do about our relationship's past.

95,p94vts,1629601523,First time having sex with new guy and I was really dry. I am super attracted to him and I don‚Äôt want him to think I wasn‚Äôt,"OK question for the men mostly. I slept with this guy that I have a lot of chemistry with.  Throughout the night we probably did it twice. I did tell him that I haven‚Äôt slept with anyone in like a really long time. 

But without going into too much detail I was very dry down there. I don‚Äôt wanna go into too much detail but I recently had a bikini wax that irritated my skin so it was a little sore down there. I didn‚Äôt tell him that or anything but I‚Äôm pretty sure he could pick up on how I was dry. Like for example he couldn‚Äôt get it in most of the time. Like it kept slipping out. I told him that I‚Äôm super attracted to him so I think that I made that obvious? I‚Äôm thinking maybe he thinks I was nervous since I haven‚Äôt slept with anyone in a really long time.

TLDR; If you find yourself in a situation like this with a girl after sleeping with her what would your thoughts be? Would it encourage you to want to try again to ‚Äúwin‚Äù her over or would you think that she‚Äôs not good in bed?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p94vts/first_time_having_sex_with_new_guy_and_i_was/
96,p94w0v,1629601543,How do you know if your lack of dating success is due to you or due to where you're living?,"An atheist, left wing black male is probably not going to do as well in southern U.S. states. A poor or middle class person is probably going to struggle a bit more in a city with a culture that values higher class/income/status. A person with intellectual or highly niche interests is probably going to have a harder time in a country town.

So if you're not having success dating, how do you know if it's due to something you're doing or a disparity between your personality and that of the vibe/culture/demographics/social dynamics of where you're living?

I'm 24M and I live in a city (not U.S.) that while quite educated, has a very introverted and socially conservative (meaning reserved) culture. It's a small ish population (500k) where there's a culture that everyone knows everyone. I almost never see people my age talking to each other (meaning strangers) casually while out and about. I certainly never see (nor have experienced) any overt flirtatious behaviour of any kind. 

Whereas my personality is a bit more bubbly, openly friendly, and curious about new people. I can talk to anyone and hold a conversation no problem provided they engage back. I find it hard to meet women my age here that I click with because our vibes don't match and they don't really engage with me in conversation in the way that I would like. This is the case regardless of if they're actually interested in me or not.

I realised recently that all of the women who I've seriously dated as well as pretty much all my female friends have been women who didn't originally grow up here where I live. Every time I've met women in a different city/country or online from a different city/country, we've hit it off and we've become friends. I've asked some of these women if there's anything that I do that's off-putting and they honestly couldn't find anything.

&amp;#x200B;

So given that the general advice I see here seems to be either to ""work on yourself"" or ""you must be doing something wrong"", how do you know whether it's really a \*you\* issue, or a where you're living issue?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p94w0v/how_do_you_know_if_your_lack_of_dating_success_is/
97,p94wmn,1629601614,Just a quick question,"I‚Äôm dating someone and I am really wanting to progress further.

We‚Äôve known each-other for years and have been dating for around 2 months, I want to have a conversation with them to know what they want from our relationship if they want to progress any further etc.

But my problem is that I am extremely emotional, and no matter how they react I will cry and it won‚Äôt just be a couple of tears it will be full on ugly crying.

Is it acceptable to talk to them about this through text? 

I know it‚Äôs better to talk about this stuff in person but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd appreciate a 23 year old man crying on their shoulder because they said they love me (or because they said they don‚Äôt want to go any further)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p94wmn/just_a_quick_question/
