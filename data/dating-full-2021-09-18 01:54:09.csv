Not good on writing things, also not good at english.

So i've met the girl in the internet. You know we do things together, like gaming together, we talk about various topics also we write to each other quite often. The problem is that its happening for 2 months and we haven't met yet. I feel like i like her so much, i'm interested in her but i don't know what exactly she's feeling. Like she is spending half of a day for me, we can talk or write for hours. Then when im trying to say that i think we should meet, she starts saying that's pointless, she's gonna hurt me, i'd better stop typing to her. I really don't know what to think, like she's literally spending so much time with me and in the exact time she's saying that she will hurt me and eventually she'll get bored and will just vanish. Thinking of some mental problems, some confidence problems, self-defense. I'm also having some confidence problems, i think we can help each other. But what should i do? What is she thinking? Should i just quit or keep contacting her and eventually she'll change her mind?

The argument I always see being said around dating subs is that people ghost and people lie because they are scared of how the other person may react (tbh I feel like if your distrust is *that* huge you probably should be in therapy and not dating subs but my point is irrelevant in this post anyways). So why not just say something along the lines of ""Hey I am not feeling it. I would not like to continue this. Btw please don't take this as an invitation to ask me further. I will block your number because I am afraid of dealing with confrontation."" It is direct and goes straight to the point. At least the other person does not have to guess if they got ghosted or the person is being busy hence they don't get any messages. Whether the other person's gets way too upset or not is on them. And you won't have to deal with any of their outbursts in you blocked their number already.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1012890,public,self,"I know people ghost because they fear the other person might react violently, but why not just tell him/her honestly then just block their number/unmatch them?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqdz9i/i_know_people_ghost_because_they_fear_the_other/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I’m intelligent and relatively accomplished. 
Conventionally attractive (have previously been a high fashion model). 
Frankly, I’d be quite a catch. 

I’m not usually dating, but I’m open to meeting people that cross my path. E.g. at University, at bars and events. 

My dilemma is: For some reason, I always end up seeing / dating / meeting guys who have girlfriends (and hide them from me). And I’m always the sidechick. 

Some have even fallen in love with me, but I remain the sidechick as they reveal they are already in relationships that they “can’t leave”. Sometimes years go by in my relationship before I find out that I was nothing but a side-piece because the other woman has known him longer and met his parents and so on! Caught completely off guard. 

I’ve dated anybody from early 20s to mid 30s and it’s the same crap. Even with guys I’m only “talking to”, guys I’m fwb with etc. there just happens to always be another woman more important than me, and sometimes girlfriends or wives in the picture.

I don’t understand why I always get these guys and how can I avoid them?

Most times it’s with the guys that are naturally quite inactive on social media (as am I). And when I meet the friends they go along with him and don’t say anything. This makes it so hard to know the truth of these men.

I can never get a man just to myself.

Me: ""Hey, I'm thinking about going to Taco Bell tonight. Want to go?""  


Her: ""I hope you're joking.""

Her: ""You asked me out on a date to Taco Bell. We are ADULTS.""

Hope to get some advice and personal opinions. And rant too!

I'm a South Asian male in his mid-30s and I moved to Toronto from my home country in my late-20s. I had lived in other countries too. Before moving to Toronto I had never dated anyone. 

So.. I explored OLD and had a good-ish experience. I've been on over 100+ first dates. From those, I've been intimate with around 35-40 (including just kissing, just making out, or going all the way). I've had 4 short-term relationships. These relationships ended because either I or they didn't want to continue because the relationship ""seemed"" to have lost its spark.

I don't drink alcohol. I'm a Muslim. I don't have a North American accent. I don't party. My dancing skills are pathetic. However, I have several other interests and hobbies, and I like to believe I'm a very well-rounded and self-aware.

Despite all this, almost all people I meet through OLD fail to look past my accent, my religion, and the fact that I'm a teetotaler. Some people mention this and in the other cases I infer it. 

All these years I've been looking for a LTR, but for one reason or the other it never materialized. There were people who were interested in pursuing a LTR with me, but I wasn't keen on them. Mind you, I can be very picky. For people who I was interested in, they were not interested in me. I suppose that's modern dating for you.

I'm still using OLD, but I'm getting tired. So much effort, time, and energy goes into getting a match, texting them, keeping the conversation going, making plans, and then meeting up. And after all that, there's a good chance of getting ghosted. 

My first dates usually go very well. Lots of meaningful and philosophical conversations, jokes, etc. When I reach out to see if they're interested in a second date, l get the usual ""you're a great guy, but I didn't feel a connection"". Or I don't get any response. 

So my question is.. how does one make dating work again? Anyone with similar experiences? Any advice? I'm on the verge of giving up.

At least so I thought.

She's 19F. We share a love of the same TV shows, movies, and activities. We went on a couple of dates (one of which was her comingover to my place to watch Jaws because she had never seen it before), but because of my work schedule, we didn't have too many opportunities to meet up. We would still chat regularly, and she even told me she really liked me. We scheduled a third date, she asked me to pick her up the night before, then the next morning when I asked for her address I got no response and then 6 hours after our scheduled time she texted me to say that something came up.

After that I tried to make small talk over text and she hardly responded. I tried a few days later, same thing. She's never flaked before, and from early on she would usually take a few hours/a day to respond, but this time it feels like things have crashed down around me. I want to break things off because I feel like I'm wasting my time but OTOH if she really likes me like she says (it should be obvious at this point that I really like her too), I don't want a huge misunderstanding to destroy this.

It was definitely pretty tough to take but I respect the decision to at least let me know instead of ghosting. But I’m kinda at a loss of how to feel afterwards since I felt it as unexpected.

As humans, we are hardwired to desire things that we don't/can't have. I think a good example of this is how a lot of people are willing to make tremendous sacrifices just to get into Medicine and become a doctor, even though they really have no idea if the career is actually something they would enjoy.

This phenomena is the same in dating. That's why when dating, people would control their impulsive behaviours and match the other person's level of interest. They know that if they seem too keen, the other person would not feel attracted to them. For the pursuer, this then leads to feelings of inadequacy, resentment and emotional burnout, as you're putting up a fake persona of confidence. 

In the sphere of self-help and dating advice, the advice is to internalise ‘Not giving a fuck’ , so that you dont have to pretend to 'not to give a fuck' . This to me is abstract bullshit. 

Desire, feelings of inadequacy and an attachment to outcome come in a package; you cannot separate one from the other. Feelings of inadequacy come with desire because we only ever develop strong desire for the things that allude us. If you truly didn't give a fuck, then you dont actually have desire. Therefore, when going after someone that you actually desire, your only option is to pretend to 'not give a fuck'. If you ever reach a point of actually not giving a fuck, you would breakup, cheat etc.

I think in a way, this is the Pareto principle.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1013066,public,self,The fallacy of 'Not giving a f*ck',0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqg4zi/the_fallacy_of_not_giving_a_fck/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I said cool, then after like 5-10min I turn back because it was hot. And she was no where to be found, I was ditched at the park in 100 degree weather.

A bit of background. I’m a single; 30 year old male living in downtown Toronto. I live by myself in a 1 bedroom apt. And have a really successful full time job for the film industry. I’ve traveled all over the world to Japan, New Zealand, Mexico and more. I’m also very tall. I’m 6’8”. Basketball player size! 

But...

I can’t for the life of me make it past two dates with anyone. Just today I ended another relationship with a woman who we mutually agreed to be friends as their was no spark or chemistry. Now to be fair that part is true. I was no longer interested and my mind was elsewhere. But what I desire is someone who’s actually going to talk to me, and want to spend quality time with me. And this is still extremely difficult for me to date during Covid.

To points to note:

1): I’m extremely nervous around woman I am interested in. To the point where I have trouble talking. I haven’t had lots of experience when I grew up as society kind of frowned upon going straight up and asking people out. It’s even way worse for me nowadays as I don’t meet anyone through work and even then I don’t shit where I eat. Because I got bills to pay.

2): Kind of done with dating apps. Because I am usually ghosted or whoever I do go out with only goes out for two dates and calls it off.

Not really sure what I can do to improve myself or how I can find that right person. Part of me has a belief built in the back of my brain that I will meet that person in person. But I’ve been thinking about that for like 10 years now. Not really sure what to do at the moment...

Iv been with this guy for 3 years now .. we met on social media on a group about food and banter .. well everytime I would post he would comment and we got talking .. things was hot and heavy from the very first moment we started talking .. he would constantly want to talk to me , call, txt , hear my voice , completely obsessed and it made me feel amazing , he currently lives 300 miles away but that wasn’t a problem.. we would talk on the phone all night long , no sleep just talking all night . 
I fell extremely hard for this man .. now back then I was only 29 and came out of a 11 year relationship but I really felt like this man ( 17 ) years Older was the one! .. 
he would make all these plans , tell me he’s going to marry me one day, I’m his sole mate , the one for him! I’m his girl etc etc .. 
well fast forward a little and I had to move out the house I was staying at and move somewhere else and I managed to get a brand new house , freshly built , nice area and we decided for him to come move with me . 
He said he needed a job to come down to as he didn’t want to come down and not have any funds etc so I asked a friend of a mine to sort him out a job , gave him money for a car, let him move in etc , really sorted his life out , previously to that while he was living where he was he was getting into all sorts of trouble , drugs , crime , no stable job, no house of his own and I changed all that for him. 
Fast forward a little and he came down .. and that’s when things pretty much changed . 
He started to get controlling .. acting like my house was his , I don’t really have a say in the things I buy or do in the house or if I do it’s a bad idea. 
Trying to control the things I buy in general. 
Really aggressive and manipulative. 
Keeps telling me the things I do is rubbish or not good enough . 
Brings me down and constantly degrades me . 
Anything I cook I’m doing it wrong baring in mind I’m the only one who cooks and cleans , washing his stuff , while looking after my own 4 children to that previous relationship. 
Tells me how to parent my children even tho he has no children on if own and has admitted he doesn’t like children ( after he moved own with me ) but says he “ loves mine “. 
I have caught him on a few occasions taking drugs behind my back and then when I confront him he gaslights me , never apologises for hurting me , making me upset, says means things to me . 
Gives me the silent treatment if I don’t agree with him or tells me I’m wrong if I say no to anything . 
I have split up a few times with him and just worms his way back into my life with his words and then goes back to normal after a while . 
I’m currently sleeping on my own sofa while he’s upstairs in my room . 
He lost the job I got him from his own actions and now just sits on the couch all day on his phone while I’m cleaning and moans if things are not done . 
He will just sit there in mess while I’m busy doing something else and just wait till I do it . 
If I say anything he just puts it on me and says I’m the one always on my phone when it’s him , he says he tidies up all the time but that’s absurd it’s always me and then tells me I’m lying it’s unbelievable. 
He’s so negative it’s unreal. 
I’m supposed to be starting collage in 2 weeks and he’s not once asked questions or supporting me yet if he starts a new job or finds something interesting he’s talking about that non stop. 
It’s always about him.. 
so I have to cook, clean , laundry, care for my 4 children, pay bills ( he doesn’t pay anything ) and go to collage while he does nothing … I’m so done it’s unreal, I’m 33 years old and dealing with all this ! I want to end it but he just stays and tries to act nice / be nice until things go back to normal

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

As time progressed we remained friends, still talking on the phone everyday, telling eachother everything going on in our lives and she frequently said things like she is really happy that she has me in her life and that she needs me. But as time progressed it also was harder for me at times. Especially if she was hanging out alone with her guy "" friends"".

I was feeling jealous and really questioning my own self worth/ respect at times. I know i just should have go NC the moment she did not want to be more then friends me, but yeah stupid me.

Then i made a stupid mistake that broke her trust.. She works at a shop and i needed work and she set me up for a job at the same company ( but at another location) i really hated the job and decided to just leave. The big mistake that i made was that i did not tell her i left and she heart it from the manager of the store instead of me, resulting in her getting really angry. Saying she never should have trusted me and that she is sad she heart it from someone else. I made a proper apology saying i should have told her sooner and that i take full responsibilty for my mistake and it wont happen again. But after this incident the situation changed

She became more distant and i was really missing her, i told her that but she said she does not want to put the effort in anymore after what happened Anyway 3 weeks ago she send me a messages that she really misses me and did not thought our bond would ""break"" this quickly. I told her i miss her aswell but from the moment she told me she just wants to be friends a lot had changed because i really thought we were building something more then just friends. she did not respons on my reaction.

the last month we barely talk with eachother, this whole week we did noy have contact. I send her a letter last week that i was sorry for what happened a while back with work and that i broke her trust, she responded that she thinks about me alot and that it really is a shame what happened between us and that she wants to clear the air with me. After that letter we had a phone call and it was a good old conversation. I told her i barely sleep sometimes thinking about everything, she did not believe that because it that would be the case i would have put in some more effort, But i dont want to give all the effort for just friendship

But for the last two weeks we barely talk and the texts are dry.. What should i do? restore the friendship or stay no contact?

Last month i (m 24) forca brief period of time dated with 2 girls

Girl n.1 (f 20) : it felt almost disneylike to me and started to catch feelings after we kissed, but then after some weeks she told me that she didn’t want to commit because she had to move (she isn’t anymore and probably fell for another guy)

Girl n2 (f 19) she told me after I had seen her once to pick her up at 3 am from her house, I thought she wanted to hook up, she wasn’t at first but then changed her mind 6 times in an hour, I got frustrated and told her that there was another girl. I reached out later it seemed like it was going good but we’re not compatible so we stopped talking. 


Yesterday one of my friend’s girlfriend (f 20) who has common friends with girl 1 told me that she has been told that girl 2 (that she doesn’t know) has reached out to girl 1 to talk about what happened. If it’s true to it’s a low blow and feel pissed about it, and it feels like some form of manipulation. 

Some details don’t add up though. 
Girl 2 didn’t know who girl 1 was, and also she didn’t know the things that she told her ( for example that I thought she was into another guy). 

What I suspect is that girl 1 after being rejected from uni is realizing that the guy isn’t into her and she’s trying to gather information from our common friends about my current situation (we don’t follow each other anymore) and the friend who knows about girl 2 is making up fake scenarios to make me talk (she has told me that she feels like she might reach out in less than a month)

We started off texting A LOT, and we kept on doing this daily throughout that period. I initiated the first date, and she told me she would really like to see me again after the first date. After we kissed (and after she told me “You’re cute”), she even was the one who was asking when we would see each other again. We both knew (from texting and from the first date) that we were quite different, but I enjoyed spending time with her. Therefore, my intention was to keep on seeing her to figure out if something would work out, eventually.

The next dates all came from her initiative (""I really wanna see you""), and were also at her place (first date was outside). We ended up doing basically all physical forms of contact. The most recent date, she even cooked for me and I spent the night at her place. Then, the next morning, we had our typical goodbye (long hug and kiss), and we agreed upon meeting again in the weekend. Everything went smooth.

Then, 4 hours later (she met up with a friend in the meantime where she even sent me a pic of via text), out of a sudden, I receive a text from her that she ""is not feeling it"" and that she can't see me anymore. When I ask her for a more detailed explanation, she tells me that there is none and that she does not owe me anything more. She reacted SO cold, uses a lot of punctuation and short answers (as if she is a different person).

I am quite an experienced dater, but I haven't experienced anything like this ever before. Since I also did not know whether she would be the one for me, I thought I could not be bothered but I have been feeling shit ever since. Everything we did in that month, from texting to meeting up, is now gone and she is like a stranger. I also told her I obviously accept and respect her decision, but her actions were NOT AT ALL aligned with what she now suddenly decided...

Kinda clueless how to handle this or what the cause might have been. Maybe it was too much inside-dating and too few ""real"" dates where you do stuff together outside which threw her off. I just don’t think the whole “no feelings” argument holds, there must be something else that is holding her back out of a sudden. I also know there is no recent person in her life that she had a relationship with, she was basically single her whole life and she also told me she does not date very often.

There is a spark in me that says that there could still be potential, but I don't want to bother her anymore (rip pride). Is it reasonable to ask if she is willing to call/meet up to explain this f2f?

1st one was a girl I ran into really randomly somewhere while being out drinking. We’ve seen each other 2 times, after our second date I texted her asking when does she has time again. She didn’t respond, So I texted her after a week or something, we texted, whatever. One time I ran into her somewhere in our city, she looked really excited to see me, her eyes were telling me that she likes me. We agreed to text each other about going out. I texted her asking if she has time on that day, etc. She said she doesn’t, So I told her to let me know, didn’t text her after. Even after 2 weeks she didn’t text me, So I thought it is over. One time I ran into her somewhere again, she ran up on me on the street asking me ‘Why do I Ignore her?’ I was like wtf, I told you to text me.

2nd one was a girl texting that she always sees me somewhere around the city and that she thinks I’m stalking her (It’s a girl I know from elementary, she used to be into me). She told me we should go out sometimes. I texted her: Yeah, when do you have Time? She said: Idk. I tried to take it further, but she didn’t…
One day I couldnt sleep, So I texted her, she told me we should go out now, she texted me when and where. So I went there it was like 4 AM. I was there and I thought that she wouldn’t Show up. She then texted me ‘Where are you, I’m there’. That’s funny, because I was there the whole time and she wasn’t there. Texted her I was still at Home.

3rd one is a girl from my uni, we met there. I actually approached her, we were looking at eachother for some time. I was nervous while talking to her though, may not made a good first impression. At one point we Almost talked everyday for a week in the library (small talk). It seemed like she liked me. Then I texted her for a coffee, she never replied. Whenever she seen me there she looked So scared and sad like I did something to her, never understood that, So I stopped talking to her, only greeted her (you don’t want to be a creep). Whenever I see her, she either looks down sadly or looks at me with a really flirty look.

It makes me feel like shit how the messages I make, like that, can't even be responded to for no reason. I bet if it came from someone they thought attractive or liked a world would be made out of it, and things would likely happen.

The very least it'd get would be a response. A thank you, a fuck off, something. Something would be said if it came from a model or someone above average looking.

But from someone not so great looking? It doesn't even get a word or care or anything. (As would be my experience with the many variations I've sent)

I don't understand how people say they've had sex partners while in college or they've dated in college when I can't even get a girl to hang out with me. It's beyond pathetic, but I went as far as uploading my pictures to r/amIugly and people told me I was really good looking with nothing to worry about. Yet, if that were true I wouldn't have the issues I'm having. College is beyond depressing and being around this kind of environment with these circumstances is really hard to deal with mentally. It breaks you after a while and really makes you feel worthless. I can't believe that despite trying, I will graduate from a large four year party school knowing I never had one dating or hookup encounter. The absolute worst part? I actually tried. If I couldn't succeed in the most easiest environment when it comes to this, then I may have to accept the fact that I will never experience it in my life and may have to resort to paying for it to keep my sanity.

TLDR: I was a normal guy coming into school, I've had many opportunities to meet women. I took those opportunities and failed with every single one of them.

I’ve been exclusive with a guy for a year no and no longer think we are compatible together. 

  Based on my track record with guys in the past, I have been putting off breaking up with this guy. He treats me well, he cares for me, and I trust him 100%. 

  We met a little over a year ago online and I did my usual thing. I tried to connect with him and surprisingly enough, I didn’t have to do all the work for once. 

He initiated the first meet up. I usually am the one who has had to put in all the effort to not get any in return, but this was the first time I’ve experienced someone do that for me. 

I had been having no luck finding a guy deserving to be with me. I’ve always had the worst luck with guys before stringing me along. Like no one has ever put the work. No one. And I’ve dated before and done the whole hookup thing. 

Let me just say that it’s nearly impossible to find anyone real on the same level as you. I have always had the same result no matter what I did. I’m a sensitive, caring, low maintenance guy and that still wasn’t enough, but that’s another story for another time. 

I was getting used to the idea that I would never be good enough for anyone. I would settle for random sex because…shit. At least I got something out of it. You knew what to expect going into it. But I’m beyond ready to find my husband and get married. 

So I met this guy online and he wasn’t a piece of shit. He was very sweet. The conversation didn’t dry up after a few days. We connected deeply over a lot of things, so we decided to go on a date. 

We met up during hurricane Laura and I had the best date I’ve ever been on. We met up at my favorite steak house, went to an arcade and afterwards, played putt putt, raced go karts, and then played on the bumper cars. After that, we found a beautiful park with ducks and sat and talked for hours. We made out in his car. It was great. And then we agreed to see each other again. 

Overall, I was attracted to him, but I immediately noticed his voice. He talks slow and has a weird sound in his tone I’ve never really heard before in a guy. But I didn’t really think of it. I was buzzing off our first date. 

And then when we kissed in his car, I immediately noticed he was not the best kisser. Again, didn’t really think much of it. 

As time went on, we got very close and had several dates that just got better and better and we decided to be official. 

We eventually moved in together just because we spent so much time together. We had a trial run to make sure it’s what we wanted and then we would have a conversation about it after it was up. 

I didn’t have any complaints and neither did he. Maybe we were in the honeymoon phase and I was aware that feeling would wear off. 

Fast forward several months and I’m just not into it anymore. I think we are much better off friends and at this point we are better off as roommates than boyfriends. 

It started off gradually when I first noticed there’s things about him that I thought I could accept like the way he talks. Update: it absolutely cringes me on a daily basis now. 

I didn’t notice and it’s not really apparent unless you have a long conversation with him or spend a lot of time with him, but I really think he might be slow. It almost seems like he has some form of Down syndrome but he doesn’t have any of the physical characteristics. Or maybe he could have some sort of mental retardation (I’m sorry about the term. He has intellectual disability). 

The newest thing he does that makes me cringe is when he gets excited and talks, he smacks his lips at the end of every sentence. And then on top of that, he is a mouth breather. 

Like I don’t know if he really has trouble breathing out of his nose, but he breathes out of his mouth. 

It’s gotten so bad, I resent him for it. And I will never have sex with him. After loving with him for some time, I am no longer physically attracted to him. He has gained a lot of weight and it’s just over for me. 

I DO NOT want to break up with him. Or I’m waiting for the best time to do it. I do not want to have to deal with dating again.  There is seriously problems with every man I attract. 

I thought I could settle for someone who was not as tones as I wished. Like I genuinely gave him a chance despite my preferences. I thought I could live without sex because I am never going to feel satisfied having sex with him due to his size. And due to the other things I mentioned before. It’s a major turn off 

So I never talk about it and just shut my mouth cause I know I could either live with it, or deal with the reality and break up and be friends. That’s the choices. I know! 

But I feel like I would lose my best friend right now. I’ve never done so many fun things with someone. I love doing things with him because he is a curious type like me but that’s as far as my attraction to him goes. Nothing more. So friends? Right? 

I find that being single means two things: going back to settling for a man I’m attracted to who has the commitment of a one night stand and be satisfied sexually, or settle for a man I’m not attracted to but fulfills be emotionally because that’s where I am in my current state of conviction. Would anyone agree? 

I value more traditional roles and that’s just not what people are generally into in more recent days. I can’t figure out if maybe it’s because it’s difficult finding someone in the same area of life as you, or if it’s because no one values a fulfilling healthy relationships anymore. 

Ive always been the optimistic type and believed the first one because in the end, I know I deserve better than what I’ve experienced before. I had to get over some dark shit before and dealing with low self esteem because of the trash I’ve attracted. 

I still have to deal with the traumatic memories and expectations that someone actually had the nerve to waste my time and didn’t believe I deserved better. That’s the only way I can get through it is to not care about it anymore and give time to the things in my life that do deserve my attention. 

And you can take that life lesson to the bank. It’s about 5 years worth of overcoming that darkness it took to be able to put into such refined perspective. 

I also think if I’m holding off on breaking up because it’s not convenient, I’m no better than the guys that used me. It’s that kind of realizing that is mental torture. 

It’s just hard to deal with reality. There’s a good chance I won’t be able to find that kind of relationship I seek. I am realizing that is very important to be physically attracted to my significant other, it’s highly important to trust my significant other, and it’s important that we are sexually compatible. 

That’s all I’ve ever asked for. Of course, everyone always comes with their own set of baggage you have to help them carry. I’ve always been the only one carrying it when I’ve dealt with any kind of relationship with a man. 

I find that people in our culture are very selfish. I know I am selfish. It just really seem like there’s any real balance to things. And that’s something I have to accept. I may never find the husband Im emotionally and physically attracted to. 

But the thing is people have found that before. My best friend met her current husband. They were only supposed to be a one night stand but they are happily married now. Her husband is a good guy. She’s very lucky. 

I met my first love when I wanted a relationship he most. They always say someone will come when you least expect it. No, I met my first love in a laundry mat. The first man I ever experimented with introduced us and we had a two year relationship. 

We loved each other and the connection was very intense. But I couldn’t ever communicate with him. I felt like he invalidated my feelings, so I left him. 

Now, I have another chance with someone who really makes me feel valued. I just don’t know how I could ever risk losing him. 

I have a history of abandonment issues. I had dealt with that when every single friend I have had left me or stopped talking to me. It wasn’t until recently that I accepted the fact that friendship comes in seasons. 

Anyway, that’s all I wanted to say. If anyone has some perspective, it would be appreciated. I have thought this whole year about my values and it really helped get me out of the dark places I’ve been. I’m just realizing more values I will never be able to settle for, which is physical intimacy, physical attraction, and sexual compatibility.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1013593,public,nsfw,Settling in a Relationship with Past Trauma,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqmm1r/settling_in_a_relationship_with_past_trauma/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,,

I love my boyfriend very much but for the last 4 years we have some sexual issues.  I love sex and I love having sex with him but he seems to need more and more things to excite him.
I will explain, 4 years ago he wanted something exciting and fresh so he convinced me to join a dating website and we would meet multiple random guys a day and he would watch me give them oral sex then after a few months it progressed to him watching men have sex with me.  It then progressed to us having threesomes with him and another random man doing whatever they wanted to me then it was me performing oral sex on random women while he watched then after she left I would satisfy him.  He is now interested in trying things with a man or are transgender Male which is fine with me but he wants me to find and setup these encounters for him and I have been unsuccessful to date.
He has me feeling like a complete failure and has expressed that he is getting to the point to where he is hating sex and has no interest in it and only cums so hes not in pain.  I have never been in a situation like this in prior relationships so I'm feeling like a complete failure and a horrible girlfriend especially when he says hes disappointed in me that I cant find anything exciting for him.
Is there something wrong with me that I cant be enough to turn him on or excite him anymore.  I dress how he wants, wear my hair how he likes it and I'm very careful to make sure I stay in decent shape for him, I'm 5'1 and 105 pounds with long black hair.
I really dont want strange men touching me or having sex with me anymore but it's the only thing I can do right now to even remotely turn him on.  So again, I'm asking is there something wrong with me,?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1013680,public,self,Is there something wrong with me or my relationship?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqnr05/is_there_something_wrong_with_me_or_my/,all_ads,6,,,,,
