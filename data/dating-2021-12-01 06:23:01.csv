3,r6eeag,1638364170,I don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm supposed to meet women as an adult,"In grade school and college, there was plenty of situations where me and future friends and love interests were naturally stuck in the same place and wanted to talk to each other. But now that I‚Äôm 26, and don‚Äôt go to bars mind you, I have no idea what to do.

First thing‚Äôs first, bars. I don‚Äôt actually drink. So there‚Äôs that. But other than that, I‚Äôve definitely tried it. I‚Äôve had more fun at a gay bar than anything. I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúnatural‚Äù in a bar, so‚Ä¶meh? Then there‚Äôs of course everything else that isn‚Äôt work. For example, I like small conversation and being the guy that breaks ice well in a long line, I‚Äôm actually pretty okay at that. I‚Äôve even gotten into conversations that lasted a few minutes on the side after we were done doing whatever we were there for. With a woman a few times. But for the most part, I seem to be in the mentality that these people are in-fact strangers. They‚Äôre not friends, not even acquaintances or friends of friends so‚Ä¶why would I pursue them? Am I dumb for feeling this way? Because it‚Äôs not even a fully fleshed out opinion of any sort, it‚Äôs just me observing what I think I‚Äôm thinking when I feel 0 urge to ask someone out in this situation. Ultimately, they‚Äôre a stranger. So subconsciously I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúthat would be weird‚Äù. 

Is adult dating really all about pursuing strangers? It just feels weird.

On Friday, night my bf told me that he planned on staying up super late gaming with his friends. I said okay have fun and said we should stay up super late one night too. He said okay we‚Äôll do it Sunday night. 

I thought he was going to take Saturday night to get sleep so he could stay up again with me on Sunday but he stayed up till 6:30 AM gaming again.

Then Sunday comes and he falls asleep at 1:30 AM with me. Because he was tired.

I was kind of upset but he was tired so I can‚Äôt really be mad. And then the next two nights after that he falls asleep super late once again.

I don‚Äôt think he meant it in a rude way but it just hurt my feelings.

The main reason I‚Äôm super pissed right now is because he just called me half an hour ago (at 6 AM). We always call each other whenever we‚Äôre heading to sleep. BUT now I can‚Äôt fall back asleep, and it takes me forever to fall asleep. 

I just told him to not call me anymore once I‚Äôm asleep unless it‚Äôs emergency. I dont be woken up at 6 AM and then not be able to fall back asleep.

When he fell asleep‚Ä¶
Friday night - 6:30am
Saturday night - 6:30am
Sunday night - 1:30am
Monday night - 4:30am
Tuesday night - 6:00am

24,r6gwjj,1638371424,How to view yourself as a prize and have an abundance mentality when you haven‚Äôt had previous success in dating,"You‚Äôll often see advice that advocates for having an abundance mentality, or viewing yourself as prize. While this is a correct line of thinking and should be encouraged, it can be superficial to a degree.

Having an abundance mindset in dating doesn‚Äôt come easily if you historically don‚Äôt have a lot of success, or your most recent interactions with the opposite sex have been negative.

Getting over that initial mental hurdle can difficult, but there are some small actions you can take to view yourself as a prize and not get needy around an attractive woman, when you don‚Äôt necessarily have a lot of dating success.

1. Realize that physical beauty is common. Yes, coming into contact with a highly attractive  person can be intimating when you don‚Äôt have experience, but you must have the mindset that you need to see if you like them as well, not just that you hope she likes you. Focus on your passions, what you feel your purpose is, what makes you unique. If you don‚Äôt feel like you have a purpose or passion, you will need primarily focus on developing yourself and become an interesting person.

2. Get into shape. This might seem like basic advice, but having a healthy, well-maintained physical presence is key. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be muscular, be a size zero, or have a six pack, but maintaining your health and physical appearance will give you an innate sense of confidence.

3. Do things that make you uncomfortable. We all don‚Äôt like to do things that make us nervous or put us outside of our comfort zone, but this is what will yield the highest sense of confidence. Whether it‚Äôs pushing your physical limits or engaging in activities that make you confront your fears, social interactions will seem less intimidating.

4. Focus on your existing positive relationships. Whether it‚Äôs with friends, family, colleagues, teammates, etc. Visualize your support network; whether it‚Äôs a large group or one person. This will help you realize you will be fine without the approval of someone from the opposite sex.

You will get more no‚Äôs than yes‚Äôs, but the yes‚Äôs will give you the confidence. If you got rejected by 100 people, but got a yes from the most magnetic person you have ever met, would the no‚Äôs ultimately matter? You have to accept than in order to meet someone who is your ideal, you will encounter rejection along the way, and probably a lot of it. This isn‚Äôt to say that you should expect rejection, but it is just a simple fact that the majority of people you encounter will be ambivalent towards you, no matter how attractive or well-rounded you are. That‚Äôs why you need to figure out what type of person appeals to you the most, and put yourself in situations where you are likely to meet them.

A few spectacular yes‚Äôs can negate hundreds of no‚Äôs. You have to put yourself out there.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6gwjj/how_to_view_yourself_as_a_prize_and_have_an/

26,r6h1n7,1638371798,I lost my first chance at love because I couldn‚Äôt show interest properly,"I‚Äôve (22F) just started getting into the dating game after slowly recovering from trauma and fear of abandonment for most of my life. I‚Äôve never been on a date or had people interested in me romantically (since I locked myself indoors for years) until recently, so I‚Äôm having a rough time doing even the basics of dating that other people have learned by now. Things like communicating interest by flirting and drawing boundaries is hard for me, and it‚Äôs led me to lose out on a guy I really liked. It‚Äôs now making me very self conscious and kinda humiliated by it. 

He was a great guy who, for the most part, took things really slow. I knew from the second date that he wasn‚Äôt immediately interested in me because he said I wasn‚Äôt really the type of girl he goes for, although he wanted to see if he could develop feelings for me eventually because he liked my personality, so we tried it out. We met mostly at the gym (we both like working out) with dates sprinkled in between. Doing the math now, we were spending anywhere from 10 to 20 hours together every week, and really getting to know each other. I really fell for him, and he eventually started showing interest but I was never that good in showing him that I liked him back. I did let him know that I was willing to be in a relationship, but he told me he still needed time to process. I didn‚Äôt really flirt all that much after that because I tried to give him room to think. I also said things like ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt flirt with me unless you really mean it, because it doesn‚Äôt feel good if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù Which I‚Äôm cringing now at the thought. Super hardass, I know, but I didn‚Äôt know how else to express my boundaries. 

We tried to have sex but he stopped early on since it didn‚Äôt feel right. He told me that he thought I didn‚Äôt want him‚Äî that it felt like I wasn‚Äôt into him. I‚Äôm still a virgin, so I didn‚Äôt know how to react. I was nervous and trying to be enthusiastic, but I just couldn‚Äôt get my mind into it.

We ended up not working out, and he‚Äôs moving so we can‚Äôt see each other at the gym anymore. We went from seeing each other almost every day to never at all. This hurts me so bad, because it feels like my fault for not being able to properly show that I wanted him. The last time I saw him I told him I still had feelings for him for a while, and he said he never knew since I always looked so aloof. He said part of the reason why his feelings disappeared was because my lack of showing interest or actively flirting and I‚Äôm so broken over it. I know I could‚Äôve been flirtier or more open, but I didn‚Äôt know how.

Now I have to let go. We were never official, but the heartache and guilt feels unbearable for me. My friends tell me that it‚Äôs no big deal‚Äî that it‚Äôs my first time trying something romantic so of course it‚Äôll sting extra. That it was just a relationship that wasn‚Äôt gonna work out because the guy and I weren‚Äôt exactly compatible, but some part of me feels responsible for its failure and it‚Äôs really eating me up.

Then also growing up my mom would always go through my text messages and so whenever I was around her at like 12-17 I would hid my phone from her because I was terrified she was gonna look and see I did something wrong when I didn‚Äôt and ground me for it for some reason so I was always paranoid. Then when I was 17 I got pregnant with my 2nd serious boyfriend. I was super young and he cheated on me and slept with 2 girls one being his step sister and the other being his co worker. His step sister accused him of rape and went to the police when I was pregnant, both of the girls said the same thing that he was trying to get back at me for cheating in the past. They used the same wording so like it must be true right? How I found out is I looked through his phone and he would block the girl he was cheating on me with and at night unblock her to talk to her and they were talking about how terrible I was and how my baby daddy didn‚Äôt like me and just horrible things which really impacted my life and hurt me on a deeper level. It really traumatized me too he was abusive and hurt me when I was pregnant :( when I found out what he was doing and I was upset 
   I know it‚Äôs not right to look at someone‚Äôs phone and it definitely makes my ex think that I never trusted him when to me looking through his phone was like a reinsurance that he was being faith and I‚Äôm not 22 and it happened over 5 years ago and I‚Äôm still having a hard time with it, I want to get back with my ex in the future. I want a laid back relationship where I don‚Äôt feel they need to check my partners phone but my anxiety and coping from my past tells me to. I know some therapist from the past have told me that replacing a bad habit with a good one is super helpful but I can‚Äôt think of anything that I could do to replace that habit. I just would love suggestions like maybe you‚Äôve been through this and understand it and found something that helps you. I just want to become the best partner possible and trust again when everything inside of me tells me not too I just want to be free from the anxiety of being cheated on and hurt. I want to have trust in people, I would love your suggestion and please be nice, this is a sensitive topic for me and I know
Some will say that I‚Äôm being controlling but I just hope by the backstory I have maybe something will click tor you and you have good advice on my situation. Thank you so much in advice!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6her9/going_through_partners_phone/

About 3 years ago at my former company there was a girl working there that I really liked. This girl is my dream girl, I wouldn‚Äôt say out of my league either but she‚Äôs perfect for what I‚Äôm looking for. I never really interacted with her but we definitely caught each other‚Äôs eye several times and I met her once at a company party.

Fast forward to now and we‚Äôre at separate companies and I went on Instagram to look her up. Turns out her profile is public and she looks to be single. I‚Äôm wondering how do I go about reaching out to her and hopefully securing a date without coming off as creepy?

I really appreciate any advice.

31,r6hi6t,1638373000,Guy I'm talking to wants to have sex with me on the second date and says we'll be dating if the sex is good,"
I know this is a novel, but I want to get all the details in.

I'm a 22 year old guy who's recently realized that I'm not as completely straight as I thought I was my entire life. I've been talking to this guy on tinder for a few weeks. I'll call him JV. He's basically the perfect guy. He's very attractive and talented. He's a former model, he can sing and play a lot of instruments. 

He told me right when we matched that I was very attractive and hot, and that I was the cutest guy where I live. We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do dirty things to me. I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I like to take things slow, and said he understood.

 He's told me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I'm socially awkward, basically socially inept, so I've never been in a relationship or had sex before, and have only been on 3 dates so far, but this seems like something that I've been longing for for a while. The only potential issue is that we live an hour away from each other and I can't drive yet (I've taken driving lessons on and off over the years but I just have difficulty with it because I have a learning disability.)

 We videochatted a few days before we planned to go on a date. During the call, he told me that he was ""complicated"". He told me that he cheated on his previous boyfriend with older men because he has ""daddy issues"" and his ex boyfriend didn't satisfy his sexual needs, that one of his flaws is that he likes sex too much and that he blew JV off and didn't spend time with him a lot. This made me a little nervous, especially because me and him live an hour away from each other and JV and his ex boyfriend did too. But when I brought up my concerns to him the next day, he assured me that he regretted cheating in his previous relationship and that sex wasn't the only reason he cheated, and that they fought a lot and that he blew JV off a lot.

We set up a date on a weekend, to go to a diner near me for lunch. We were texting the night before and I mentioned the last date that I went on, last year, where the guy tried to have sex with me, and how it made me feel because I don't like to have sex on the first date. JV replied saying that maybe we should cancel our date and go our separate ways because we're too different of people. I told him that was probably for the best, as I didn't know where we could have sex because my family lives with my stepdad and he doesn't like me, my sister or any of his kids having significant others spend the night at the house. JV said that his ex stayed over at his house when they were dating, and that his family was fine with it, so I could too. He asked if I'd be able to fulfill his sexual needs and I told him that I think I could, and he said that he thinks that this relationship could work. 

We went on the date and it went well. He told me that he usually doesn't drive an hour to meet someone for the first time, and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things. We had lunch and then we made out for a bit. It was my first kiss. He asked if I wanted to go further, and I said that I didn't. After the date, we kept texting and we planned a second date. He said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date and that if it was good, I'd be his boyfriend. We started talking about what kind of stuff we'd do to each other and sending each other nudes and sexual videos. He asked if I'd take him to my room to have sex on the second date, and I reminded him that I couldn't do that, 
which I thought was kind of strange that he forgot, since the reason we were even still talking to each other was because he assured me that we could have sex at his house.


He said that it had to be in his car then, because his aunt is making his family move out unexpectedly, and that this made him not sure when he'd be able to see me again after the second date. I asked him if we would wear condoms, and he said that if we were dating, that we'd only be having sex with each other, so we wouldn't have to, and also that he wanted us to cum inside each other. He assured me that he was clean and taking medication to prevent getting HIV. He tried to text me his latest test but he said that it wouldn't send for some reason.

 I told him that I would maybe be okay with doing some stuff but nothing involving penetration, since I'm a virgin. He sent me some crying emojis and said ""but we've been talking sexually"" , and said that we didn't have to have sex yet, but that us possibly being boyfriends would be delayed until we have sex to see if it's good. He also told me that his ex has been contacting him and he's been ignoring it but that he's considering taking him back. I like this guy, and I don't want to lose him since he really likes me and might be my perfect match, but I don't know how I feel about losing my virginity in a car unprotected with a guy I only met in person once.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6hi6t/guy_im_talking_to_wants_to_have_sex_with_me_on/

Foreword: I am not trying to destroy this if it's real, I just feel it's a scam.

My mother met a guy online, instagram to be exact.  His claims sound outrageously ridiculous however I am here because I cannot disprove them off what I can directly find. He claims he is US Army based in Syria.  Gave his city location but not a base.  Claims to have been in country for over a year with ""no end in sight"".  

Sounds sus, yeah? Here's the fun part! She has facetimed with him numerous times and gotten to know him ""personally"".  He has asked for money on occasion when he had ""banking issues"".  Has shown her 'redacted and blurred' military documents in his physical presence to ""prove"" who he is.    It's an ordeal going on for nearly 5 months now.

I managed to get her away once by showing lack of evidence that he could actually be real.  He got her back to talking and she won't tell me how because his proof is ""op sec"".     

Sounds blatantly stupid.   I guess I need help at this point giving her hard evidence to support otherwise.   She lost her life partner to cancer about a year and a half ago and this is quite susceptible to a hopeless romantic narrative per se.

I picked her up for a second date this past weekend and it seemed to go good. However afterwards, when we were leaving she asked if I could drop her off at someone's house and that 'he lives a few minutes away'. Of course I was curious, and I asked if this was family or a friend of hers, and she had said 'More of a FwB than a friend' and she started going off on how he isn't nice to her, she isn't sure if the relationship is healthy, ect. It really made me feel uncomfortable and I actually wondered if I should've just turned around and dropped her off at home. I didn't really know what to do and I dropped her off at this guy's house. I texted her the next day asking if she made it to her house safely last night and she said she 'Stayed the night'. She texted me this morning inviting me on a date this weekend downtown. Am I in the wrong for considering cutting it off because of how 'inappropriate' it felt?

People who have regular Hook Ups, how the fuck do you do it. 

For half a year I am trying but I got no luck. I used Tinder, I thought it could be easy, I get about 1-3 matches per week, but even if I ask for a date, often they are to busy to meet and the chat fades out. 

Also when I ask what they are expecting, most are in search for a relationship( why does Tinder dont have a feature for it)

I know for girls it is often easier on Tinder, but I know girls who can go on a date every week. Also other guys here have 4 dates a week.

We are of the same Asian ethnicity although he is half white. This is important because he claimed to have a white surname. I fell in love with him helping him learn our native language and reconnect with his roots. We live in the same state, but on opposite ends of it. 

He seemed upfront with who he was at first, but some things seemed kind of fishy. Usually, when I date someone online, I‚Äôm able to verify that this person is who they said they were, but I wasn‚Äôt able to do that with him. He‚Äôs the only guy I couldn‚Äôt verify. His name yielded no results other than a professor that lived across the country and I knew it wasn‚Äôt him.

I dug deeper into it and found out he lied about where he lived, his first and last name, birthday, and more. His last name is the most  common surname in our culture and I think he was ashamed of it due to internalized racism. He claimed he was not a social media guy, but he did have some social media he used recently like Instagram and Twitter. I found nothing suspicious about who he follows though. It‚Äôs mostly family members and brand accounts. I know it‚Äôs good to be wary of people you date online, but I had dated online before and it worked out just fine like my online relationships would end on good terms.

I thought maybe he was married and wanted to hide that from me, but that wasn‚Äôt the case. He had no good reason to lie to me to this extent. There were times in the past 6 months that he‚Äôd admit to lying and gaslighting me over little things and apologize for it. I later found out that we had an irl mutual friend  via Facebook that I knew from college (he hadn‚Äôt talked to my bf in a couple years). I was able to verify that his real name that I found was correct (he had known my bf and his family since childhood although they are no longer close).

I thought I was the side piece, but he never seemed ashamed or cautious when he takes me out for dates. He lets me sleep over and I never stumble upon girl stuff when I‚Äôm there. He always spoils me and he‚Äôll get me anything I ask for and not in a sugar daddy way like he has never pressured me to have sex with him.

There were a lot of clear signs that she was into me, but the biggest was the fact that she told me she liked me. That was about a month ago and after talking to her last night about how I feel like I've been getting mixed signals recently, she said she isn't interested in anyone, including me. She said it is because she's working on a lot personally. She isn't doing well in school (we're in college), she had some arguments and falling outs with different friends, she wants to change majors and pursue a different career path, and more personal stuff that I won't get into. She said that just because she isn't interested in me currently that it doesn't mean it can't happen in the future. All of that is valid, but she knows about my past with a different girl and how she said the same thing just to string me along and she understands, but said it's unfair for me to make that assumption about her because she's a different person altogether.

63,r6l6h6,1638382503,So this Girl asks for my number...,"So I (M24)was at a fairly large work party and this girl (F22) came up to while I was being ""that guy hanging in the back and not dancing"". We started talking and she pulled me away for 2+ hours-until the function ended-and we got tipsy just talking about our lives. It was clear she was interested in me and at the end of the night, she gave me her number. I drunkenly texted her since I suddenly left and apologized.  


She was sad we didn't continue to hang so I set up a coffee date. I don't want to be an a-hole but I should say now that I wasn't that interested in her based on some rather touchy details she let fly during that night. But after pressure from my coworkers, I attended the aforementioned date. Might as well give it a shot right? 

&amp;#x200B;

The coffee date led to a dinner date which led to a ""walk in the park"" date. So there were 3 dates. Over Thanksgiving, she went to NJ to visit a friend and she made tentative plans to go rock climbing (Something I wouldn't mind trying lol) with me...but I haven't heard from her in almost 2 weeks now.

&amp;#x200B;

Each date all we did was talk which in hindsight, may have not been the best idea. Mainly because she's...a lot. He backstory is INSANELY sad and it keeps coming up. She also doesn't do a lot of activities that don't directly help her goals (Which are numerous yet VERY admirable to me) so it's hard to relate there. Lastly, she smokes a LOT of weed which while I'm not opposed to smoking/getting high (I prefer edibles tbh)...I don't do much of? Lol it's a bit of a red flag since she even admits she's prone/has a history with drug addiction...and it seems like being high is a kind of high-frequency coping mechanism. Thankfully weed is fine compared to things she's done in the past...

This is all to say that...well I don't like her very much. I think she would be an AMAZING friend but not a romantic partner. And it's weird since she has been so awkward when I tried to hug her goodbye too...and yet she keeps asking me on dates. Given some of her trauma though, I would definitely not want to be the person to initiate any form of intimacy. Besides all this, a part of me wants to keeping hanging with her since she is a decent and admirable person.

But going back to that timeline...it's been almost 2 weeks since we last spoke and I don't want to make the next move since a) I don't know her intentions, and b) I'm not interested in her. However, I don't want to be the person to ghost her either...should I just do nothing and (Almost hopefully) let the thing die, or confront her about it? The ball is in her court-I just don't want to be the a-hole.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6l6h6/so_this_girl_asks_for_my_number/

I personally think it‚Äôs a-okay to approach someone in just about any situation, even ‚Äúoff-limits‚Äù places like work, the gym, grocery store, etc. You just need to use your awareness skills in doing so.

I wanted to address this because I have never found a guy creepy for *simply approaching me*.

72,r6mhpo,1638385828,"Guys is pushy with my sexual boundaries and has an interesting stance on abortion, if unplanned pregnancy occurs.","Hello! I've been seeing a guy for about 2.5 months now. We're sexually active. However, there have been moments when we've been intimate where he's pushed my boundaries in some ways. For example, he's insisted on having unprotected sex since we started getting sexually active. I was not comfortable with doing something like that so soon (and still have not done it) but he keeps insisting that the only way he would get into a committed relationship is if he has unprotected sex with me (we have not had any discussions about commitment yet). He since agreed to protected sex, after trying on different sized condoms etc (his original excuse was that condoms make him uncomfortable and that he can't perform with one on). However, he's made comments in passing while we were intimate that he absolutely needs unprotected sex to feel close to someone. He's asked for other sexual acts that I am currently not comfortable doing and I've stated my boundaries clearly. However, what bothers me is that he keeps bringing these up, subtlety, and has not let my no mean no. He's also done certain things (that I'd rather not describe here but an example is: cumming in my mouth a little even though I told him I don't want to swallow during a bj), where in I felt uncomfortable in the moment and/or felt coerced into the situation sexually, solely for his pleasure or because he seemed to be so into the moment he seemed to forget I was there. He's been incredibly pushy and impatient with me since the beginning and while I tried my best to slow things down, I do think he could have done a better job of being patient.

All these, I know, scream red flags, but he's also got some really great qualities. He's intelligent, successful, kind/caring, and has been consistent and available. We've spent at least one to two days together over the last month and half each week, meeting up and hanging out. We've got on calls, we've texted, he's taken me out to movies, dinners etc. All that said, he does lack empathy. I've discussed the risks of unprotected sex with him (he got tested when I asked which was a plus) when I brought up STDS (that in and of itself was a struggle to get him to make happen). However, when I brought up the risk of having an unplanned pregnancy, he said he has a record of ""pull-out- method success"", and he went so far to state that if I happened to get pregnant, he'd want me to ""get used to plan b"" or he'd accompany me to get an abortion. I don't even want to get into why both of these statements are gigantic red flags and the lack of awareness into the implications for me as a woman once I take plan b or if I get an abortion (even if I wanted to).

He's stated that if I chose not to get an abortion, he'd be out of my life since he is not ready for a baby. All that said, I've been extremely vocal with him about this issue, speaking my mind and telling him why what he said does not align with my values (this was more recently and I've yet to hear back from him on his thoughts on this). It seems that no one has made him or he has chosen not to think about the implications of his comments/actions sexually, now or in the past. My question is, is it worth it moving on with this guy? Are these issues, that have been coming up so early on, glaring red flags that cannot be worked on going forward and that I should drop everything and move on to find other fish in the sea?

tlrd: guy wants unprotected sex but if I have an unplanned pregnancy, he says wants me to get an abortion/get used to plan b. he's pushed some of my boundaries in sexually in the past (ie: cumming in my mouth a little even though I told him I don't want to swallow) - want to know if this dude is a walking red flag or if he's being a dude that needs to be corrected with the hope of change.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6mhpo/guys_is_pushy_with_my_sexual_boundaries_and_has/

We'd only talked like twice before I developed an infatuation towards her and I really wanted to get to know her better and show her who I am. I guess I could have just avoided my feelings, but I couldn't find any strong reasons to avoid them at first. So, I tried to strike a conversation every time we met.

2. It made me look forward to seeing her more every day.

74,r6mj2r,1638385925,Trying to rekindle things after breakup?,"**TL;DR**: I seemingly met my dream girl. Dated for 3 months, then she started  going hot/cold for another 3. I tried to set up dates with her over 2 weeks and theyd go unanswered. I then broke up, but left the door open to her to date again. 

**Full Story:**

I \[32M\] was dating a \[34F\] i met from an online dating platform for about 6 months. On the first date, we truly hit it off, and we had a ton in common. There was no reason why things couldn't work between us, and in fact, we were a fantastic match. 

This girl has everything that I'm looking for in a partner, minus her emotional unavailability. She was previously married for 5  years and previously in a relationship where she was engaged after 3 years of dating.  Both failed for seemingly foreseeable reasons. 

I asked her to be exclusive quite quickly (within 1 month of dating), and to be my girlfriend within 2 months of dating. I thought that if we're on the same page, what's the point of taking things slow? (my mistake). 

Her idea was to go to europe at the end of august. We booked the trip and had everything planned to go. A few days prior she told me she was having second thoughts about us (things moved too quickly, her feelings didnt catch up) and that we need to cancel. The next day she told me she wanted to go. 

When we returned home, she made it clear she wanted to see me again.  We dated for a few more months. Things seemed to progress positively, then she would backtrack emotionally, and we would start over. It was quite frustrating. 

We had two talks. The first she told me that she hasnt felt love or lust since her mid 20s and that this has been a problem for her. I suggested she see a psychologist, to which she agreed. The second, she said that things ""cant continue at the same slow pace"" and that we should either move in together or go our separate ways. I told her that these are two extremes and we should continue seeing each other, and when the time is right, we can move in together. 

Afterwards, she became very sweet and loving to me. We had some nice dates. I would get some nice texts from her. Suddenly, out of nowhere, it seemed like she went cold.   I tried to set up a date twice in a 2 week period, and i was left on read. 

I came to the realization that i was quite miserable in the dynamic and that I couldn't do it anymore. I asked her for 1 hour of her time to talk. Surprise surprise, she was available the very next morning.

I told her i was unhappy with her not meeting me half way in the relationship, and that I'm going to date other women. It seemed like this was a relief to her and something she wanted.  I told her that i'll leave the door open for her, and we can date again, but she has to meet me halfway. We had a good conversation about life. We had a passionate hug and kiss goodbye. Things ended on good terms.  I felt like it wasn't going to be the last time i'd see her. 

I know that the relationship failed because of her emotional unavailability. Maybe she wasn't into me, or maybe i killed attraction.  Maybe she has issues with attachment. I don't know if maybe there was someone else in the picture (she said there wasnt). 

We've been in no contact for 2.5 weeks now.  It appears she blocked me on Whatsapp but left me on socials. I have no idea if im blocked on imessage. 

**How I'm feeling:**

First week or two were quite tough, but i've accepted that things are likely over at this point and i should date new people. However, I truly liked the girl as a person and wouldn't  mind reconnecting with her at some point. 

**Questions:**

1) Who broke up with who? I pulled the plug, but it seemed that she was already checked out. 

2) Even if she wanted to rekindle thing, I also know that she would absolutely never initiate conversation with me first. Should I wait for 1 month of no contact to test the waters? Or should I let her come to me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6mj2r/trying_to_rekindle_things_after_breakup/
75,r6mjvn,1638385982,I'm confused on whether she likes me or not?,"Im in college and I met this girl in the class we have in the morning. At first I didn't really think much, aside from the fact that she is attractive and if she did like me I would be down. I was more focused on being friends with people at this point. Fast forward a few months and short 5 min face to face convos turned into full on 2hr(at one point 3) long face to face convos. This is where I start to suspect that she possibly liked me. 

Texting wise we don't do it as much. That is to say that I don't always initiate the conversation. Whenever she wants to help me(without me prompting her or asking her) she'll text me. Whenever I ask her to hang out one on one she doesn't hesitate and says yes. She responds very quickly if I do text her.

Not only do we talk a lot, but she shares a lot of personal information that she hasn't told a lot of people. For example, family, her opinions on them, etc. 

The only reason why I haven't tried further was while we were talking about certain study partners, she told me in high school she went with her classmate and her friends suspected her of liking the study partner. She then told them no ""I don't date"". When I asked her why she said that she can but she's waiting for the right person. From other peoples experience I assumed this was her way of saying ""I wish I can find a guy just like you"", so wanting to keep my dignity intact I backed off and am now starting to treat her as a friend. 

Did I make the right decision? I want to be sure that I read the signs perfectly and that she sees me as a friend. I am not very good at reading signs and just based everything other experiences. My gut tells me that she actually likes me but she's scared of commitment, but I discarded that feeling as nothing more than just false love and hope.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6mjvn/im_confused_on_whether_she_likes_me_or_not/

So is this normal? I don‚Äôt know how I feel about continuing to see somebody two months after they told me that they weren‚Äôt interested. But, I don‚Äôt have a lot of dating experience so I need advice. 

Should I go on the date to see if my attraction returns or should I move on for good?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6myx1/dating_after_he_told_me_he_wasnt_interested/
84,r6n55r,1638387524,Is she attracted to me? Do I have a chance in the future or should I move on?,"I (21M) had a crush on this girl (21F) for about 2 months. I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she‚Äôd get dinner with me, but added that she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we‚Äôd get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don‚Äôt get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend‚Äôs birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn‚Äôt I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds. Then, I came to my senses and realized I should be moving on and walked away. Problem is that I‚Äôm finding it really hard to move on. 

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she‚Äôs drunk? Why did she say that we don‚Äôt get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I understand people might see me as the bad guy for going after a girl who just got out of a breakup, but I would rather get rejected immediately than wait around for her so that I can move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6n55r/is_she_attracted_to_me_do_i_have_a_chance_in_the/

87,r6nu7c,1638389299,Getting over a girl I'm too attached to,"I (23M) was led on by a girl (23F). We used to have pretty intense conversations online for about 6 months now and have even shared the darkest secrets to each other. I wanted to meet her IRL but then she denied meeting me saying it would count as a date ans she only sees me as a friend. So she wants to keep things online. 

I've become too attached to her. I keep waiting for her texts and can't control but initiate conversations. She does converse well but I want to move on from her. I did stop texting her for 3 weeks but I had this horrible feelings inside me the whole time and I couldn't help but text her back. Everytime I text her, I feel not so good but stopping to text is much more horrible.  It's become like an addiction.

I did read articles about how to move on but I want to hear from real people here. Your experiences and suggestions about moving on from this girl.

PS: finding other girls is not an option with Covid. I did vibe with this girl and the conversation just flows. I did try talking to other girls online, but not comparable to this.

90,r6o1t8,1638389843,Dating a girl I‚Äôm not sure if I like,"Hey, fellow Redditors! :)

For the last 3 months, I (M22) have been dating this girl (F18) after we met each other at a party.

I have had 1 relationship which lasted 1,5 years. She has never had any boyfriends, I'm her first ""boyfriend"".

For the last 3 months, we have been on about 10/12 dates where she asked me twice to hang out. I need to initiate a lot in this relationship, she isn't much of a speaker and I constantly need to bring up topics to talk about. When we get intimate with each other, she only receives when we do more than kiss. The only thing I get is blue balls haha. 
She is still a virgin and doesn't want to have sex yet even though she starts dry humping me when we kiss. When she is at my place she basically spends the night with me till about 2/3 at night and then I drive her back to her place and I go back to my place. Last night I asked her if she would spend the night with me(explained that we would just sleep and not have sex). she liked the idea but didn't want that yet. 

Last night she was at my place and I brought up and asked why she never really initiates dates and texts. She told me that she really doesn't know what she feels and if she's in love or not because she has never been this close with a guy before, she told me she would try to initiate more.

That night we talked and kissed but the topics we talk about constantly need to be brought up by me. 

At the beginning of this ""relationship"", I really liked her and thought it could become something, but after a while, it becomes harder and harder to constantly initiate dates and be the first to send a text. When I was with my ex we could text for hours and hours and still have stuff to talk about, I don't really have this kinda energy with this girl.

Now I don't know if I'm still with her because I miss something intimate and feel alone. Or that I'm still with her because I like her, I find it really hard to decide whether or not I should end this or keep trying to make things work. I feel lost in this relationship...

TL;DR
Been dating for 3 months. She doesn't really initiate dates/text. Don‚Äôt know whether I like her or just feeling alone.

I don't want to get weird. I just do. I start second guessing everything over-communicating. Then I lose them.

This is a frustrating pattern.

93,r6o7t5,1638390276,Found someone on accident,"I (27M) am from a small place, about 10k people. Everybody knows everyone, you get it. Me and my gf broke up about a year ago after being on and off for about two years. She now lives 7-8 hours away and I live in our fellow hometown, just landed my dream job and life is great.

All of a sudden, this girl who I have known for 10 years starts to push for something more, it seems. We‚Äôve always been friends, but never anything more, and we‚Äôve never hung out alone together. Now she wants to meet up, hang out, and she seems genuinely interested. She got a kid about 6 months ago, her relationship ended during her pregnancy due to the guy being an ass.

So, single mom. Her brother is one of my closest friends (I have no idea how he would react to me dating his older sister), and she happens to be the best friend of the step sister of my ex (who I am still friends with, mind you, but we don‚Äôt hang out whenever she‚Äôs home, just ended on good terms).

Now, I want to date this girl but don‚Äôt know how. To start dating a person you have gotten to know deeply on a personal level over 10 years, seems strange to me. And I know there will be reactions from my ex and her family since the girl in question sometimes used to be present at certain gatherings when I was with my former girlfriend and her family. So what do I do? Respect their friendships and back off, or do I give it a shot?

A friend warned me that this girl might just feel a bit ¬´desperate¬ª due to being a single mom, and I can see that, as she has never shown any interest before now, but on the other hand I feel like she is such a great person and she isn‚Äôt just ¬´settling¬ª for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6o7t5/found_someone_on_accident/
