We've been dating for 6 years. We started towards the end of high school and continued through the entirety of my college education. I graduated in December and moved across the country to start my first job out of college. My SO graduates this August after she's done with an internship this summer, so there's some element of a short-term long-distance relationship at play here. 

She just visited for spring break, only to drop a bombshell on me. I mean, we are talking completely out of left field here–but more on why I think that later. She told me that she caught feelings for another guy back home, also that she wasn't sure if she ever felt love due to the young age we both were when the relationship started (about 16,17), and hasn't felt happy in our relationship for quite some time. 

A complete emotional wreck, I attempted to figure out as much as possible why she's come to feel this way. Apparently, she's gone through some kind of major personality change, driven mostly by this one guy, and she doesn't think that we can reconcile the differences to preserve what we've built over the last 6 years. Even stranger, when she first described him to me, she said we were so similar its like I never left. So like... ??? What are the differences we cant reconcile if we're that similar? She seems to think that being happy with me is an impossibility going forward. 

I'm completely floored by this. Not only is this situation quite honestly the first hiccup in our entire time together (like seriously, we havent really ever fought about anything because we've always been good about compromise and problem resolution), we were talking about engagement rings and getting married literally weeks ago in February. It was a conversation that ended up with her being so happy she almost broke into tears. She even went and found out her ring size for me. She's never been one to be wishy washy with her feelings or with the way she feels about me, and is certainly not the kind of person who's ever given me mixed signals before. 

Admittedly, I haven't been doing the long distance as well as I could have, but I always felt very secure in our relationship, and this whole situation has kind of kicked me into high gear. I'm still wildly in love with her, and I want to jump into our relationship with both feet and make our relationship of 6 years that much stronger. As of right now, she wants none of that. 

Further complicating things is that she has an internship in the same city I'm living in, and we plan to live together for June - August for her internship. Ever slept in the same bed with someone who broke your heart? Yeah, I'm not looking forward to it if shit doesn't work out. 

As of right now, we've decided to pause our relationship (go on a break, I guess) until June rolls around and see how we both feel then. I guess I'm still in denial because I'm pretty confident things will work out for us. Cause if it doesn't, I'll have to face the near crippling loneliness of being half a continent away from anyone who's ever cared about me, and I don't think I'm strong enough to make it through that. 

I really think that we can fix things this summer. I think she's confused about her emotions for this other guy and she's seeking out short term happiness (a fixable problem) over long term stability and love (not something easy to build or find). I also think that she's beginning to feel the throes of graduation anxiety and doesn't want to ""give up"" (for lack of a better phrase) all the college friends, family, and other things that come from staying where we grew up. I just feel like her judgment is clouded somehow.

Fast forward a few months later, in February on Valentine’s day he hits me up and we’re catching you and he tells me that he really liked me in September and that he was disappointed when I stopped answering him, which was a shock to me because I thought it was one sided… So he tells me all of this and he asks me to come to a party because he wants to see me. I worked until 9pm that night but I still went home from my shift, got ready and went to the party. We saw each other for the first time in 4 months and it felt like we had never stopped talking, so much chemistry both of us we’re laughing and enjoying ourself I got to meet his friends and he met mine and at the end of the night we kissed.

From that point on, we’re back to texting everyday, two days after the party I see him and we talk for 6 hours. The week after that I go over to his apartment and we stay up talking until 5am.. he tells me that he’s never been able to talk to someone for that long and that I am beautiful and I make him happy etc.. We hang out like this three more times and then nothing …

He just ghosts me. So i swallowed my pride and asked him why he would ghost me after being so mad at me for doing it because I thought we were working towards something and all he said was “If I was ghosting you you’d be blocked on everything.”

I'm, the guy at the bar/club who doesn't see any action that night. I'm the guy no woman seems to be interested in other than the rare few. I have been going clubbing/bar hopping for years now with no change in this result. Even when it comes to women that are friends they immediately seem to be gravitated to my other friends than me, something which kinda hurts. All of my friends who were like me at the start of the university have experienced relationships, girlfriends, and growth. Including my best friend who found the perfect girl in the world who completes him (an extremely rare type of girl, trust me you wouldn't understand till you met her) and while I'm happy for him i can't help but feel envious of him too. My personality and who I'm inherent as a man is off-putting to most women except for some nerdy exceptions. I don't want to victimize myself, this is mostly a vent, but have any of you ever felt unlovable to the point you feel you'll never experience what others seem to experience in spades and take for granted?

Frankly, i hate what I'm as a person. Most of you may deny this but being an Indian in North America definitely matters. I have seen dudes just like myself who got lucky because they were Latino, black or white. Being my race is off-putting to most North American and European women. Race aside i also have a philosopher-type personality (discuss various intellectual topics, not into sports, etc). When you have only faced failure all your life I don't know how to succeed. I have had some minor success: SLept with 4 girls so far, 1 FWB, been on over 35 dates. I don't believe I'm an ugly guy, just short at 5'7/8 and super skinny which seems offputting to the female gender. I'm tired of living my life at the bottom of the barrel, I'm tired of women saying they're not attracted to me and seeing the women I have feelings for hook up with my friends. I fear I will live most of my life like this and be settled for by a woman who doesn't truly desire me but just wanted to settle. My sex life feels damned and I feel like I;ll never experience the vibrant life and love my friend does.

I know that I shouldn’t generalize people’s attractvtiveness based on their job-descions .

But did anyone noticed that typically guys who work in tech (IT, Programming etc.) tend to be generelly less attractive than guys who work in business/sales (or Lawyers etc. ).

Because what I experienced (I’m a tech guy myself), that most of the guys do pay less attention to their looks, for example bad style, missing hygene, too fat or too skinny body and don’t workout. They also don’t look after themself or try to improve their lifes, outside of work.

Where on the other side, guys who work in business/sales/marketing or other jobs where more communication is required, tend to be genereally better looking (better style, good hygene, healthy and fit body etc.) and take better look at their appearance. Also they tend to be more communicative and charming and risk taking when it comes to dating.

I think that’s where the rumors of “the lazy and unattractive tech-nerd” comes from.

I mean I love working in IT and Tech and I really find it interesting , but I don’t want to be considered as this “lonely tech-nerd” who’s lazy and sits on the computer all day and plays video games afterwards 

I’ve also done alot to improve my life. I quit video games and porn. I try to spend less time on the computer as possible. I workout 3 times a week and on weekend’s I go out with friend’s to talk to girls and socialize with other people (sometimes even under the week.)

I also got into meditation and reading self-help books.

I know that there are exceptions but this is (at least) what I experienced for myself.

Mind you, this was the first time I've EVER paid in an app to actively send a like. Started out really good, we were talking daily, finding lots of common interests between us. Sharing past relationship traumas, and what would need to be worked through. I felt extremely comfortable with this person, which generally takes a long time, past trust issues.  

Conversation moved from the app to text, and  I started trying to share more about my day, my life. When I'm happy, and into someone, I tend to be pretty garrulous.  Everything seemed to be fine for a while, then they said they were feeling overwhelmed. I had been messaging and they hadn't had a chance to respond, because of work and such. Ok, good, I can understand that, so I slowed down.  
  
After which, things started to stagnate? I was likely if I got a few replies a day, and little seemed to be meaningful. It felt like they were pulling back, and it sucked. Because I need to do it at times, when I'm feeling scrambled. I wrote out a message in docs. It helps me collect my thoughts, and keep from sounding like a broken record, which I have a tendency to do, without intending.  
  
I mentioned that this morning, because I wanted to share if if they were interested. There wasn't anything in it that was bad, mean, or otherwise. I just wanted to communicate, and be honest as we had spoken about. I've never had one relationship fall apart because we communicated our concerns, it's ALWAYS the other way around.

I have question, I recently break up with my ex after that I met this lady who was in to me.
I wanted to be friend with her but didn't want to move too fast.
Well that didn't work she was constantly showing up.
So after a few things that i said or I didn't show myself interested(difficult moments), then she realized that I couldn't date with her not now.
My situation is not a good one and When i was close to her I remind of my ex so I needed to give it little distance and by not explaining it to her well I break everything up with my distance.
(I've been offline for 20 days after a misunderstanding that she thought that I said I love her but I acted dumb And wanted to fix it by telling her that I will never fall in love with her.
While She was showing me that she was ready for a relationship.)
After that I explained myself to her why I acted weird.
She said that's ok but the fact was she was upset with me I apologized but nothing changed.
And now She is not answering my texts like she ghosted me while in mean time she follows me, watches my story's and Like my posts.
Kept me in her private channel of her close friends and people.
And I'm getting insane by can't Understanding what on earth is her problem.
I said I'm not ready she didn't say anything after that
She didn't answer me and like ghosted me.

I get emotionally attached to every girl i date (doesnt matter how much time i spend with them) usually after the second date i already develop an emotional wire, i dont really know why, this always happens with people i get along with and specially with women, i keep torturing myself over and over, thinking what i could have done to get things right, how that i wont get to date another girl ever, and those self destructive thoughts that god knows why i always think about, im not really ugly, you can check my profile to judge yourself, the thing is im an immigrant living in Spain (and where i come from we have a bad reputation) so getting jobs and dates is reeeeally hard for me, it may sound as victimism, but trust me, it is the case. Unfortunately with girls, i behave like im really needy, since im already 23 years and i didnt have much experiences with women, sadly. I was literally available all the time for her and this is a big mistake, my friends think she took advantage of that.

So there's this girl i meet on tinder, we dated for a whole week, brought her to dinner the first date, she was a bit cold but after a while we really liked each other, stayed at her mums house the next 2 days to play some videogames, we cuddled, kissed a bit, then i brought her to the cinema (the last date) and we ate together 3 times, all things were going really good, until in the last date, i left her at her apartment so she could change her shoes and something else, thought she would take like 10-15m to be ready, so i parked the car and told her i was going to a small shop to get some chewing gums, this was after the dinner, i felt my mouth was dirty so yeah, i told her via whatsapp that i was going for 5mins, turns out, when i was at the shop (literally a couple of meters away) she was already down there, and she got kinda mad for some reason, i asked her many times if she was mad, but she insisted she was not, im not really that dumb to believe that since we were going to a park to have some time but she just dumped me there and went to her mothers house which was 20 mins away when i had my car parked there, i literally texted her that i would be there really fast but she decided to leave and told me to meet her later. Called her, texted her many times, she ignored them all.

This got me really pissed off and ngl i was mad, so i told her to stop wasting my time and that now i understood why she never managed to get a stable relationship (ofc this got her sad and rightfully mad) but it was just because i was pissed at that time and i didnt have a cold head, not the first time she decided to change plans at the last minute, in the third date when i was going to help her move some things she asked me if i would stay, i told her i could not stay for too much since i already had plans with my friends, then suddenly she told me to just dont meet (i was already driving to her place) according to her she was mad and didnt want to meet with me because she got a discussion with her landlord, and that she didnt want me to see her in that state (it can be understandable but i didnt really know why she paid that anger with me). In the last date, after we finished watching the movie i brought her to the backside of my car so we could talk, hours before she told me to not bring up the discussion but i felt i really needed to, to get things clear (this was one of the few mistakes i made in my honest opinion) brought her to her place, and kissed for the last time ever, she didnt message me anything, couple of days later i found out she unmatched me on Tinder, so i sent her a message thanking her for the time we spent together and that it was really unfortunate that things ended that way, she replied some time after that she didnt think we connected each other and that i should learn how to handle my anger and proceeded to thank me aswell for the time and thats it.

At times i felt she was gaslighting me to make me feel guilty for everything, she told me that i was making myself a movie out of my head and that i was paranoid. I do agree with some of the things she said, but honestly that doesnt give her any right to dump me like that and change plans at the last minute when im literally on the way to her house. And, whatever she kept telling me, i never believed she was not mad, as women tend to say otherwise.

Hi! I need help, I have (27F) dating a guy (28M) since February 6, we get along pretty well and during the first month we saw each other 5 days a week every week, at the beginning of March he has become very distant, we see each other twice a week and sometimes hours go by (up to 10 hours) without answering my messages, this has caused me to be super obsessive to see if he writes me or not, I have no family or friends where I am and I try to distract myself but I still can't.

During February he didn't have his car and I would go to his house or I would drive to where we were going out, now that he has his car back we have seen each other much less, I have paid for several of the dates and even the condoms the last two times we have been together... I also had to buy lunch for him twice that his aunt sells and he invited me to the place and I had to pay for my lunch and order take out twice. I know he doesn't care much about me because he doesn't make an effort to make fun plans with me either, only when I invite him to bars and it seems like he doesn't want to spend his money on me or that he doesn't have to make an effort with me anymore and assumes I will pay for the date... this makes me feel pretty bad and like he is taking advantage of me, I don't know what to do to try to get him to treat me better or to stop talking to me.

I have extremely low self-esteem so I don't have the courage to tell him that what he is doing bothers me (I know it will be the first piece of advice), I am thinking of being more distant so that he either reacts that he is treating me badly or so that he can walk away freely but I don't know if this is the best option.

Talking to him is very interesting and sexually we have a good connection but I don't want to be treated like this and I don't know how to solve it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164128,public,self,How can I make a guy respect me if I have very low self-esteem?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tirbkc/how_can_i_make_a_guy_respect_me_if_i_have_very/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I’m a 31 year old woman who is interested in men and currently live NYC. I was in a exclusive relationship from 19-29 and then 29-30.  I’ve been dating since September - people I meet in real life and people off apps.  I’m currently looking for a meaningful connection that could lead to a relationship but I’m not in a rush.  I’ve ran into many guys on dating apps purely being in it for a hook up and aren’t ready for something serious even if they originally tell me they want me to meet their friends or on the app it says relationship.  It feels like they are using dating apps to find hook ups instead of relationships which seems strange because why wouldn’t they just use Tinder, and why would they put in all the effort to chat and go on dates? I missed out on my whole fuck boy stage and I don’t even know how to spot these people - I’m a very trusting kind person.  Is there questions I can ask to get honesty from men? At this point I’ve decided to take a break from the dating apps for a couple months to focus on meeting in real life and just enjoying my life.  Thanks for any insight! I’m new to Reddit so if this is the wrong spot to post this please let me know.

Generally, my standards for actual dating and not just making friends is just find someone not significantly more heavy than I am (kink and phobia reasons) and just being moderately straightedge, patient and caring about a long-term monogamous relationship. I have most of the bases covered in terms of myself, being caring (probably too much/too fast), having a good job, not being insufferable, being attractive, having interests and a few honest friends of my own. Though one issue is that I have self confidence, but I do not display it in the same way most people do, so most people mistake it as having none.

Does anyone have any suggestions for just finding more genuine people to interact with? or finding people to date? I have a few friends to work with and am going out to my first concert soonish with a also single friend, so hopefully we can have a good time there.

Basically the title. After taking a break from dating (broke up with my last bf around two years ago, and we dated for five years) I'm back on OKCupid. I've been approached by quite a few men with messages telling me to add them on Snapchat.

I'm not a fan of Snapchat, I've had it installed for a week tops. Using it for communication makes me feel like someone's little secret, as the messages get deleted.

I actually have told a few of these men to message me directly thru WhatsApp, Telegram, or ya know normal phone messages? I've given them my phone number, but they never follow thru.

Then they suggest Instagram, but honestly I have pics of me, my friends, and my life there. I don't want them to know where I work, or what the front of my house looks like.

Last time this happened I even got a snarky response from a 35 yo dude telling me that I should install Snapchat just so we could exchange nudes, and ""not to be a prude"". I told him I'm no prude and that I happily send nudes, the difference is the people I send them to get to keep them.

He changed gears FAST and started messaging me thru WhatsApp right away requesting nudes, but honestly I lost interest after he was an asshole to me so I sent him a few pics of ugly feet I found online and then blocked him everywhere, heh.

Do I have a stick up my butt or does it also sound sketchy to you when a person would only message you thru an app that erases all communications? Or am I too careful about Instagram?

As a side note, I also date women and they message me thru WhatsApp/Telegram right away when I send them my phone #

Hey everyone 25 (M) here. So I'm not in a relationship atm nor have I ever been so this is all new for me. I have been having problems with this girl I'm REALLY interested in. 

So here's the story. I met her a few years back in university and we became friends. I wanted to ask her out at the time but she was seeing someone and I didn't want to be an ass by asking her out. A few years passed and we drifted apart but we weren't on bad terms. It's just that she went somewhere else for schooling. 

During the pandemic, I started to text her again and when she did respond, we were vibing. 

BUT! 

She has this really bad habit where I would text her and weeks, sometimes months would go by and I would not get a response until I started a new convo all together. I should also say that I'm the one who has been initiating all of the convos at this point. When I asked her about this, she said she's really bad at responding to texts. 

Anyway, I asked her out at the end of February and she said she's not looking for a relationship right now but was down for a date and she was even telling me things we could do. When I texted her the place and time I planned, it took her five days to respond (two days before the date I planned and she told me that she was busy that day and didn't even suggest any other day she might be free but asked to reschedule). At this point because I felt like I was putting more effort into this than she was and she seemed to be repeating her past poor texting behavior, I told her to text me when she's free so we could plan something then. 

So far, no response. 

Now here's the thing. With other girls, that have rejected or ghosted me, I shrugged, laughed it off and didn't care. With this girl though I think it's become really hard because I see her as my friend,  we really click when we do talk and she's the first girl to agree to go out with me but now I'm stuck in limbo because I don't know what she wants with absolute certainty. All of this is to say that it truthfully hurts that she's treating me this way. 

Another issue I have is that I always try not to assume malintent if I feel like people are doing me wrong and that there is another side to the story that perhaps I'm missing. This sometimes leads me to not stand up to people as is happening in this case.

So here are my questions.

I know I'm not entitled to a relationship or even a date but am I asking for too much to be shown a little bit of respect or am I being a bit dramatic? 

Do I tell her how what she's doing is making me feel in a firm but not so douchey/ clingy way? If so how?

Seriously, I haven't liked a guy as much as I like him in years. Anyway, after our first date, he thanked me for the nice evening and asked if I had gotten home safe. I thanked him too and we exchanged some messages. He gave me a nice, sweet nick name and he started using it in his texts. Everything seemed to be going fine but the problem, I think, is that that I was too eager. I would not normally show too much eagerness and I would let the guy do most of the ""chasing"" but in this case, I was worried that he would think that I was not interested so I showed more interest than usual. The reason is that I was going to be very busy with a deadline for work and also my family was going to come visit and it was important for me to be 100% available for them during my free time since I don't see them very often. Because of this, I  was not going to be able to see him for two weeks. I thought that he might interpret this as me not being interested and using this family visit and being busy with work just as excuses so I texted him everyday for the next days and then I asked him for a second date a few days later. He agreed to come but after that he didn't text me again. I was so confused because... why would he be so interested, calling me a sweet nick name and then just ignore me? I sensed that he was overwhelmed by my eagerness but what he doesn't know is that I am not normally like that. It was just because of my family visit and the fact that I was worried that he would think I was not interested. Anyway, these two busy weeks are over and he didn't text me during that time. I recently  texted him and he was nice, called me the sweet nickname and we exchanged a few messages. But he didn't ask me out again. I told him that I would like to see him again and he said he would too as he really liked to spend time with me. I asked him when he would be available. He said he would let me know. It's been a week and he hasn't contacted me again. I guess it's over. So I'm wondering what happened. Is it really so off-putting for men when they see too much eagerness from the side of the woman?

These are two examples that resulted in her becoming extremely upset.

With my ex she wouldn't be direct. This was my first relationship so maybe I'm naive. In the beginning she told me what one of her boundaries were by talking about it like this:She was talking about her friends and she started talking about her male friends and said "" I only hang out with my male friends when there are other people around"". That didn't click, as in its a boundary, resulting in me later on finally realizing, "" Oh shit, maybe I shouldn't be hanging out with my female friends alone when dating her"" when I was about to.

There was also another time when I was working third shift, I explained to her why I need my sleep( 10 hr shift, work with hazardous chemicals, paying attention the details, testing,and I fell asleep on the road the week before but I told her that after the argument started). The argument was because I felt like she wasn't being direct with me. She always went to a pumpkin farm every year with her kids and she said I can come if I can make it, that if I need to sleep I can. The day comes and I said I need to get more sleep. She's very upset and this is when I told her I fell asleep on the road, that it's about my health and safety( she said it wasnt about that)and she still said I was being a bad boyfriend for not coming along and she didnt want to force me to be in her life.

Hopefully I linked the original post correctly. (At the bottom of this post.) 

So I communicated yesterday that I need to slow down, maybe take a step back and get to know each other more. I mentioned some things that I thought were important to discuss as a way of determining compatibility. He kind of blew up. Kept accusing me of spinning things and saying I changed my mind. He told his kids I was his girlfriend, but we never had any kind of discussion about what we were. I told him how I need communication and he kept saying it’s me who didn’t communicate. Five hours after the conversation started he said I should have had the conversation in person, which I was willing to, but I didn’t think of it; which he got mad and said I must have much more important things on my mind. By that point it was almost nine pm and I told him I would be glad to have it in person if he wanted that and had mentioned it earlier. He kept saying how he doesn’t feel like he needs to know me better in order to know that he’s in love with me, I’m everything he wants, etc and I don’t understand that. 
He ended up basically ignoring me for two hours after texting a lame, “ok.” And then saying he was about to fall asleep. Then this morning he said have a good day.
I told him I’m not interested in small talk, if he’s not willing to put in the effort to get to know each other on a deeper level, it’s best for me to move on. I also said if we’re not discussing sex or how madly in love he is, he has no interest in the conversation. So he said we can discuss topics that help us get to know each other, but later as he has a photography job to do. Four hours ago. 

I feel like the radio silence is just a sign that he has no interest to communicate for the purpose of getting to know each other. 

Am I asking too much? I feel kinda bummed. It seems like he’s just low effort and that depresses me because it keeps happening. All I’m asking is to communicate what we want, where we’re going, how we feel, and information about each other, preferences, etc. If he wants to do so in person I wish he’d just say hey let’s meet up for dinner and hash this out. But he’s ignoring it instead. If I don’t hear from him within the next couples I’m inclined to just delete and block him. Or send a text? Ugh.

Other than calling me beautiful once on like our 4th date he never compliments me. 
For the record a really like him and he’s physically affectionate so I don’t want to make him look like a jerk.
He gets very playful and says things to get a rise sometimes but always harmless. I have a couple big insecurities that I’ve mentioned, big one being a difference in the size of my boobs, almost a cup size I think. Makes me embarrassed and I hate it, rarely leave my boobs uncovered because of it. Last night he grabs the smaller one and says “ are they getting smaller?” I got embarrassed and uncomfortable and just said uhhhh no. So he grabbed it again, then the bigger one and said “ I dunno I think they might.”

I was silently devastated and didn’t think I’d be able to be naked in front of him again. I got no sleep but when I woke up I calmly told him what he said and why it hurt. He felt horrible and apologized a bunch. 
Then we were cuddled up and he said he didn’t know why I have such self esteem issues because I’m an attractive woman.
I don’t know why exactly but it bothered me a bit. Like would you not refer to your girlfriend as beautiful or sexy or pretty or something. I could be over processing it but I realized he’s only ever said I’m attractive or that he was attracted to me. 

Any women here know what I mean? Like somehow it makes me feel like I’m just acceptable, or adequate as opposed to you know beautiful. Mostly because he’ll refer to actresses and stuff as hot or a babe but I guess I’m not.
