My ex told me something when I was unemployed and looking for work. I was moaning about it and saying that I'll never get a job etc. He said this fact and it was so simple - ""everyone finds one eventually"" 

And I couldn't really deny it. Most people are able to find work eventually if they look enough.

Same with dating. Most average people end up in a long term relationships. Most people find someone and settle down in life.

 Hate to break it to you but if you're reading this now you are probably pretty average and most likely a normal, unremarkable person. So the odds are high for you finding someone. This is especially true if you're young

Plus if you're here it means you have already dated someone who you liked and it's very likely you'll find someone else you like again.

It's been two years since I had sex or a real date. 

In this time I wasted a hundred dollars or so on dating apps, tried to improve myself, get myself out there but...

It's failing. 

The apps resulted in two dates and around 4 matches in all. I got rejected 43 times in person and failed to secure dates. My ex found someone in a month or so by using Tinder to judge people for fun with her friends. It was my first relationship too. 

Everyone I know except a guy or so is in a relationship or having success in dating. My coworkers are all females and engaged. None know single women past 20. Had ""interest"" from mental health patients (Cmon I wont touch those, it's unhetical anyway.) and one of the girl I met on Tinder. But I didn't feel interest towards her.

I'm getting desperate. People from my culture are cold and closed to new people, they're quick to bundle up and settle and judge single people pretty harshly. Especially men. Especially since I'm from a more conservative, spread out area. 

I'm not ugly, but not conventionally average either. I have a lot of French and First nation blood. Unique face it makes. 

I got nothing for two years and it's exasperating me. It's just completely failing and I'm trying to not put pressure on myself, but Christ... It's always in the back of my mind and taunting me.

Honestly it was during the winter time and we would just go on dinner dates nothing crazy. I did take her to the beach and a vineyard though. 

We ended up reconnecting a year later and have been together since April. This summer I decided to go all out. I really wanted to impress her and win her over. I love her more than anything.

So I rented a boat about 4 times and a jet ski. Took her to the beach for a couple of days. I bought scuba diving gear so we could go snorkeling at the lake. We’ve been shopping multiple times. Took her to this Japanese marketplace they had all kinds of foreign drinks, food/candies. Rented a hotel twice like a 5 star. I bought a pool and a hot tub.

She’s a heavy stoner (me, not so much) but we do drink a lot and smoke a lot. 

Lately though I feel like I’m running out of ideas. It’s November (in Texas) and summer is over. I had called her today and said I wanted to do something crazy or start being more adventurous. She says oh really like what?

I opened with “well we have never been to a bar and shot pool before..”

She goes “oh my gosh I gotta go bye.”

Now she was in the process of giving her dog a bath but it still made me feel like crap. She constantly mentions my ideas are kinda lame and I just wing it..

Personally I do alright so money isn’t an issue and I have never really had a serious girlfriend it’s always just dinner and movie. Basic stuff nothing interesting… My friends tell me I’m over stressing and she’s not being fair to me.

I honestly don’t want to lose her or bore her so I’m trying to think of some ideas that are kinda out there. Adventurous… Again I don’t mind spending like $100 - $300 but nothing more. 

I really want to surprise her though and do something cool. Here’s a couple of ideas.. We are both in our early and mid 20s also.


1) Hot air balloon rental?

2) Luxury car rental?

3) Aquarium/Zoo

4) Escape Room

5) Horseback riding

When I unblocked him I’d not reply him and I told him that I cannot come to his house coZ I don’t want to have sex.

A pretty middle school crush type of deal.
Soon we would park cars next to each other and wjen sitting next to each other, sometime our knees or feet would touch and neither of us would move it.

Never got his number but we chatted through DMS on insta and he let me know he wasn't interested, weird ok so i backed off.

A year later, he slides back into my DMS to ""check up on me"" where he asks me if I am still interested. Obviously I lied and said no but asked if he was. He answered ""wydm"" and claimed he was just checking up on me, weird ok whatever.

Now, another year later, we have a few classes together once again. Only one is in person and he is again looking at me, sitting always behind me, and will wait for me to pack up before slightly following me to the parking lot.

A few days ago, we got placed into a group for another class and he was so on to me about everything! It was the weridest thing. There was another girl in the group and he barely acknowledged her... He would be like ""do you want to go before me, I'd love to hear your thoughts.""
""What are your ideas on blah blah blah"" 
""I love that idea so much you are brilliant blah blah blah""

I kinda stood close in case he was a creep and I was able to hear him speaking. 

He introduced himself and asked one of the girls there if she would like to play darts. She declined, and he left. That was it. Maybe a 1 minute interaction.

They then waved us back over to them to ask us if we saw that. They then went on about how creepy it was. Now maybe I don’t know what’s normal or not, but it seemed like a perfectly innocent situation. No creepiness, no ill intentions, just asked a girl to play a bar game with him. To me it seemed like he want about that situation as well and as confidently as possible.

I question how and they said I wouldn’t get it since I’m a man.

This got me thinking, they have all told me other instances of guys hitting on them and then being creepy, that I didn’t think was creepy or weird at all. I assumed maybe I just couldn’t visualize it. 

I’ve also heard how positive interactions with guys go and it isn’t any less creepy or weird.

Is this me seeking advice from strangers? Let’s find out!

As always: English isn’t my native language and I’m on mobile. 

So, I’m a woman, he’s a man, both around 30.
I should preface this by saying this is a job not a career. So as awkward as dating/breaking up goes I wouldn’t really put that into the balance. Think of something on stage/entertainment. And after covid it’s hard for artists and performers to find jobs so we found this job that does provide us with a job daily but also bad hours bad pay and most employees can’t wait to find better things elsewhere. 

So now, we are close and definitely have a special bond but I have a 15years history of being friendzoned or worst seen as a sister (ew).
I can find men to fuck but dating is a mess. I’m not ugly but I’m not hot HOT (Overweight so probably where the sister thing starts from).

Trying to be as objectif as possible, not including some self deprecating comments or overvaluing things that happen, here are some facts:
- As I was saying we do have a special bond, comparing to the rest of the team. We definitely have a top 3 friends but we text a lot LOT one on one despite a 3 people groupe chat already active. 
- we hugged, are affectionate.
- he stayed at my place twice as he live farther suburb from the job and I’m in the city and he would have had trouble to commute those days or early morning the next ones. But he would use termes like “crashing” at my place nothing ambiguous. The first time he slept on the couch and the second we shared my bed. I know. Nothing happened except hands “touching” under my pillow. And now I’m like, am a 17?! Wondering what our fingers brushing mean? Am I actually into something because holding hands is more intimate than fucking? 
We did drink a lot that night too and it was fun and we talk a lot and we were close but always on that line of nothing happened. Right after that night I had a early meeting so I left and then we had another one with our team and than we were not on the same schedule so it was kind of a “nothing special happened”.
But if I’m honest, I was harsher on him later that week because I felt more ignored or was it because he would would do something he usually does between us and our 3rd aforementioned friend, and that’s where you eyeroll: he talks about his dates! yay
Cause I know he’s been dating around. Like one girl regularly plus other dates than the regular stopped it I think. Now he goes on dates. I think with one same girl for about a month but still very much on all the dating apps. So that the thing, he’s a 30yo man who has been mostly in relationships and I totally get dating around now that he’s single. 
But.. *what about me?* 
Do I act on my crush/attraction? Is it useless as he probably just gonna say the usual “I like you but not like that let’s not ruin our friendship?” Am I gonna suffer either way? 
Should I just try to actually see there’s a spark? 
Is it a bad idea as I obviously WILL catch feeling from a fwb situation?

I guess it was both a rant and tons of questions. What should I do, you silly-and-wise Reddit?

We would text paragraphs to each other daily, met 3 times, and hit it off really well each time spending at least 6+ hours together each time. The texts would also be flirty at times, and sometimes we would end up staying very late and sexting (no lewd pictures).

Anyway, on our 3rd date, we were discussing about going to one of our places. She told me she likes to take things slowly with these, so we confirmed to each other we wouldn’t have sex. We went back to her place after having a few drinks (we made out and shared some sexual touches at the bar).

At her place, she immediately changed into a hoodie and a thong and we were laying next to each other kissing. She would make me touch her breasts, and also asked me to choke her and as things happened, dry hump. We touched each other down there through underwear, and would tease each other as if to take off the underwear but not doing it. The next day, she said she was so happy she brought me home and texted me all day about how fun it was.

We had plans to meet a few days later and she had said she would come to my place this time. But she texts me saying that she doesn’t want to because things progressed a little too fast, to which I happily obliged. Then she said “my words didn’t align with my actions” the last time, and blamed me and alcohol for making things happen that night, even though she made me do things to her both in the night and the morning once we woke up. This made me feel weird and I said I wasn’t trying to push boundaries, and I would like to restrain from kissing and physical touch just for our next date so that I could reaffirm to her that I don’t need physical touch, and that we can both move past what happened early for her while having fun in just each other’s companies.

She then called me later and said she highly regrets what happens, I should have not let it happen, and she holds anyone she sees to high standards of sexual restraint, so we can’t see each other anymore. I really liked this girl and I feel terrible, because she’s misremembering or ignoring her actions and choices in what happened. Did I deal with this incorrectly?

They argue that what I'm saying doesn't match my actions. (Wanting a family, but not actively looking for a real relationship)


My main argument agaist that was that I don't want to officially date anyone due to the way I talk to some of my female customers(no I don't harrased them, I been working at a bar for 5 years, I know when they are interested in me) , due to this interactions I feel like it would be unfair to any girl I date, as it would seem like cheating.


They claim that I'm not really a guy that anyone would date seriously, I'm not father material nor husband material, and that kinda stung a little. And looking at my coworkers, they seem right all of my coworkers are late 20s to late 40s and all of them don't have kids and seem depressed, only putting up smiles for customers. 


All of this stress kinda made me reflect and I realized that I haven't had a real relationship since my high school sweet heart almost 4 years ago. And I realized that all the relationships after that were either a 1 night thing or I was a rebound. 

I ask liz(ex gf) and she said that I'm just not build to a serious bf.

If I'm behind her, she'll glance over her shoulder, if I move to her other shoulder she'll start looking over that shoulder, she'll stare at me in class and she'll glance at me when she passes in the halls. If I look over and make eye contact, she'll look away quickly or it will last a few seconds. The staring has been going on for a few weeks, so 5 days after I text her I ask her after class if she got the texts, she did and she said she was at soccer when she got the text, and so she couldn't respond. She apologized a lot, and has still been staring the few days it's been since I asked.

There is a mutual friend that we have that said she sometimes won't respond to her texts either, and that she's mentioned me when I'm not around. When I was at her table, she'd glance at me a lot to she how much I was paying attention to the other girl at the table, and she'll talk to me if I end up next to her before class.

The issue is, she doesn't sit with my friends anymore, so I don't have an excuse to go talk to her and I feel like I should just text her, and not call as she's shy and I don't want to freak her out.

This does not apply to all men or women-only some. But it's simply a few tips you can use to facilitate actually meeting someone and avoid having your time wasted. Keep in mind I do not know what dating is like for women. I am just speaking from the perspective of an average guy who learned to date the hard way but now avoids many pitfalls dating. Here are some tips:

	1. Realize that many women online don't know what they want.

	You talk to the average girl online and many have created their profiles for fun. Some like attention, some like to just chat without any intent to date, some just wanted to download the app because they were bored etc. Avoid them at all costs. You can spend days, weeks, and months talking to them only to realize they still don’t know what they want. I've met some on first dates and they were still indecisive. Just drop it and let someone else deal with it. You will save yourself a lot of time in the long run.

	2. Pay attention to warning signs

	Early on some women will clue you in to their problems. If they always talk about drama in their life then chances are they are doing things to create it or not actively trying to solve it. Do not get involved as you will likely be caught up in it. Just drop it. 

	3. Being the nice guy never works

	This tip is crucial. If you're overly nice to some women it becomes a turn off. They will not be excited to meet you, they will not return your texts or phone calls and generally speaking any connection will die off. I'm not advocating being a jerk, but just don’t overly assert yourself and aim to constantly please some women online.

	4. Measure things by 24 hours and 2 weeks

	I stick to this rule rather firmly. If any girl can't decide if she's interested in texting, talking on the phone, video chatting or anything beyond the app or the website after 24 hours don't waste your time. It'll never go anywhere. I've spent days, weeks, and months and many women never come around. Just drop it. By the same token, if she doesn't want to hangout or go on a date within 2 weeks just drop it as well. At this point many are just too busy to date and aren't worth chasing. 

	5. Do not get mad

	Never bother explaining things to a lot of girls. Don’t go off on them. Many won't listen and some won't change from anything you say. Just let them go and delete and/or block them. 

	That's all I have. I hope this helps to save some time dating as it did for me. I'm sure this advice could apply to guys as well but again, I am only telling this from an average guys perspective.

I'm pretty angry- initially, everything was great. Super respectful, very romantic, the works. We went on two dates and then slowly things started to unravel. 

Near the beginning, he did this thing once where he went 24 hours without contacting me (I had texted him in the morning). I  texted him and I got worried and I said ""hey can you not do that? if you're super busy just let me know."" He agreed w/ me and said he wouldn't like it if I did the same thing so he'd for sure never do it again.

We only went on two dates because he said he was super busy all the time and that everything would 'settle' soon. As a COO I get being busy and he's in a family business so I was like, hey I get it! We can go on dates when you're ready. Just keep your line of communication open.

Well, he did it again. He went to the hospital and his brother called me and said it was no biggie and he'd be back soon. He went MIA for four days and came back and was like ""lol hey I'm fine"", and was, at first, upset that I was even upset. His reasoning for taking so long was that he take an MRI for his shoulder pain.. and it took four days (???). He apologized profusely after he realized the severity of how upset I was, and said he'd never do it again.

He did it again, it's been two days and he's ignoring my calls (his phone ""situation"" has always been weird- he never picks up when I call him and I just basically have to wait for him to call me back).

If midnight or later hits, would it be rude for me to send a text and say something like, “I don’t want to assume you’re not interested if something came up that kept you from calling, but I do want to ask if you’re interested in meeting me or if you’re not into it. The lack of follow through makes me think that it’s a lack of interest, but I know things come up and plans change, so I didn’t want to assume and wanted to check in and ask first.”

We'll call him J. J was very affectionate, loving, and gave me all the attention at the beginning of the relationship. We were only a few weeks into the talking stage and I had ghosted him a month earlier when he messaged me again the same day I opened up Tinder once again. I had nothing going on that day, so I was like ""what could possibly go wrong?"". And let me tell you, I regret ever responding. J made the effort in messaging me, responding to me, he would always initiate the conversations, and even would call me during his lunch breaks at work or while he was driving from work. I was impressed by how much effort he was putting on early on the relationship when we weren't even dating yet and thinking like ""wow maybe this guy is actually serious about me"". Fast forward 3 weeks I invite J over to the State Fair with my friends as a casual date. The whole day, me and him were immediately attracted to each other and the chemistry was there as my friends saw us talking all day with each other while we were at the fair. He also was a complete gentleman, every time we got off the rides he would offer his hand or hold my hand when I would get nervous. We both didn't want the night to end, and I honestly remember feeling so happy that night and he also called me after I got home to tell me how special he felt like everything was. Shortly after that, we planned our second date at an aquarium which was also very casual at first but then ended up becoming really steamy later in the night when we ended it with us both making out in his car right before I left to go back to my car and drive home. For the third date, I invite him over to my apartment. Now I wasn't intending for things to escalate, but they did and we ended up having sex the same night he came over. Again the chemistry was crazy, I was obsessed with the guy the passion was there. He stayed the whole weekend at my place and everything was just right about him. After that, he would drive almost every weekend to see me, he would commute the 1 hour to see me back and forth. I even visited his family's house and stayed over a weekend and I met his mom and his dad. I thought to myself ""Wow this guy introduced me to his parents, and he's constantly making the effort to be with me in this relationship"" what more could a girl want right? I was happy being with him, but then the more he came over, he was mentioning to me how he needs a place to move out to after I told him how my current roommate is leaving on such short notice. In my gut feeling, I didn't feel ready for this guy to move in with me even though he introduced me to his parents because we were still early on in the relationship. I was hesitant when he first brought up the idea of us moving in together telling him every reason why I'm saying no. Yet, he showed me this perfect version of himself when he would visit me. Cooking for me, taking care of me, being there, and cuddling me. I thought after he spent weeks convincing me again ""What could possibly go wrong?"". Everything went wrong after that. He broke up with me 3 weeks before he was going to move in citing that ""we're incompatible to be in a relationship"", mind you, we had just had sex the night before and were cuddling before he said that the day after. We had already signed the lease, I didn't have a roommate nor did I have another place lined up on such short notice. At first, I asked him if we could just take a break in the relationship and just focus on ourselves since the whole move can be stressful. He said, ""Sure. ig it could be a break"". I told him strictly after he broke up with me even though we were living together that we can't cuddle, kiss, or do anything like a couple then until he decides he wants to be in a committed relationship with me again. I tried setting up so many boundaries, I remember doing what I could to try and protect myself emotionally, but I still let him in. At first, respected my wishes for a few days, but then things would escalate. I would see the same guy I fell in love with the first time every time I saw his face I was thinking of potential, not reality. He would come sleep in my bed even though we have separate rooms. He would come late at night and cuddle against me and I felt like we could mend the relationship and work together to grow. But I was wrong. Every time I would establish boundaries again he would gaslight me saying ""You see me as some cold heartless bastard, then that's what you'll get"". Anytime I mentioned how I felt, how anxious or depressed I feel with how our situationship was, how he was hot and cold and never steady and consistently loving towards me, he would lash out against me. Then the next day he would come into my room to apologize and say he's sorry and that it won't happen again and then we'll have makeup sex and cuddle and I'll think that he's trying again. This cycle will repeat another few months until one day he decides to bring over a girl from work. Now I get at this point we are not dating, but we both have been involved constantly and he was always messing with my emotions since we lived together. I confront him about the girl (19F) she doesn't even know that me and him had history. Girl continues to come over saying I should get over him and move on with my life. The man that used to kiss and cuddle me and bathe me and take care of me had decided to lash out against me with the girl from work present in my own apartment. They both tell me that they're just friends, but I'm not fucking stupid whenever he would pick her up and she would stay the night in the same bed I gave to him. At that point, I let him think I didn't know and plotted to show the girl what kind of fucked up narcissistic manipulator he is. I set him up one night when I said I was really horny. He said he wanted a backrub and I obliged to mention it the next morning when the girl came over again. Ironically that same night girl texts me asking if J is with me. Girl goes crazy once she realizes that J has been using her like how he was using me. He had a new supply, as I was no longer helping him emotionally, physically, nor financially like before as I had a higher income than J. The girl and him were only dating for 2 weeks, but she told me how they have been having sex and sleeping together and J would tell her to not tell me that they're together. I was angry with the girl at first, but I should have been angry with J this whole time for discarding me like trash and disregarding my feelings. After that happened, I kicked J out permanently. I told him to pack his shit and leave as I didn't want to see him anymore after all the lying and cheating and manipulation. It has been about 3 weeks now since he was here. It still hurts so much to think that a man that gave you all this love and attention and made it show that he was serious about you at some point to realize that the man I met never even existed. He was this fake version he showed of himself because he knew no one would've fallen for the real him. J is so fucked up the fact that I was crying in front of him telling him to stop and he laughed in my face telling me to move on. I would never wish that level of pain on anyone. For the first 2 weeks, I couldn't stomach anything to eat, I lost 15 pounds already being so skinny. I couldn't sleep. All I felt was numb from the pain thinking why would he do something like that to me when all I showed him was love and kindness welcoming him into my home and buying food for the both of us? In my process of healing, as much as I wish I have never met him. I am thankful for the lesson I learned early on in my life with a narcissist. He's out of my life permanently, no longer even in the same State. I know I'll meet someone that is genuinely a good person, but right now after what happened that experience completely traumatized me and changed my perspective on love and trust entirely.

That same night he told me that was interested in me (after I told him I wasn’t going to sleep with him that night), and we continued talking the next morning as we took the same bus back home. 

He texted me the next day and he asked me out to coffee that week which went well and we were able to talk a lot more and get to know each other a bit better. 

This week I texted him asking if he’d like to do something and he said yes, suggesting thursday during the afternoon (which didn’t end up happening as I got busy). on Wednesday afternoon he texted me asking what my plans were for the day and then asking me if I would like to go to a pub crawl that evening. I said yes and when i showed up we danced a lot, made out a bit  and talked about what we want. I told him I was interested in getting to know him better and also asked him if he sees this as a one-night stand situation (aka is he just waiting to sleep with me) and he told me that he definitely sees it as more than that. 

I do think that’s he’s genuinely interested in me as he asks questions, remembers a lot of things I’ve told him and hasn’t tried to have me go back to his place or anything like that.


Butttt, despite me feeling like there is a mutual interest, aside from coffee, he hasn’t really asked me out on a date. He did text me yesterday asking me how I was and what my plans were for the evening (to which I replied saying I had plans), but I feel like at this point in time, it would be appropriate to ask for a more formal date, no?

I hear that it's a turn off to women. I'd like to think that being shy makes me really care and understand a girl's feelings. 

Girls say they want to take things slowly, not be used or taken advantaged of. But that's like what a shy guy values too. He just needs more time to get comfortable (this allows time for the girl to get to know him), shy guys aren't gonna just push sex immediately (they're scared just like girls).

But everywhere I go, I keep hearing that a guy has to be confident and smooth and not afraid of anything. I'm really trying my best to overcome my shyness but I believe I'm always going to be a bit shy.

I haven’t dated in a long time and I don’t know what I should do or be feeling. I’m scared to let go and enjoy myself. Especially since I feel bad for being a burden due to my past abuse. 

I have been with my ex 30 (m) for 4.5 years and for 1 year we were engaged. He was my best friend but things became abusive after awhile. There is a lot of issues there but the example I want to use is this. I’m 24 (f) and don’t have my license, I had a fear of driving after my dad was hit by a car and passed away. My ex played into it and wouldn’t let me drive “for my own safety”. 
I left him finally a month before our wedding. All I can think though is that he is the only one who would being willing to put up with me. He is the only one who can accept me and my past. ( I come from an abusive family and he did too). Now that I’m an adult and can’t drive, I feel like a burden to people. I always feel like a burden and that I’m not worth it. 
But I tried to date again and I met this amazing guy. We connect on everything. He went to college for what I’m currently studying, we have similar beliefs in politics, a lot of the same hobbies and it’s easy to talk to him for hours and never get bored. I know he likes me. He made the move for the first kiss, he calls me on the phone when he has a long drive and he keeps saying how happy he is when he sees me and keeps planning the next date. 
But I’m to scared to trust again and I feel like a burden to him. He knows I have a car since I finally just saved up money to buy one. It’s not on the road yet but I didn’t tell him about not having a license. I’m embarrassed by it. But I feel like I need to tell him the truth. But we come from different world, he grew up differently then me. He is from another country and moved to the US for college. He comes from a happy family and money. I have a lot of abuse in my past. 
I know I’m not obligated to tell him about my history right now but I feel like I can’t keep the driving a secret. He knows I have a fear of it due to my dad but he doesn’t know the rest. 
Before you give me any advice I just need to say a bit more of the situation. We met on bumble and we talked and got to know one another. Then had our first date on Halloween and it went amazing. We talked single day since then and had our second date on Nov. 4th that also went amazing. So we haven’t been dating to long yet. He stated he is looking for a real relationship and from how he speaks to me I can tell he is interested. He have a date planned for the 7th, he asked if I wanted to go to his house for movies or go on a hike. Then he said we should do a movie and he said I could sleep over and drive home in the morning. I reminded him my car isn’t on the road yet. That made me feel like crap. 
That lead me to a bad night of self hatred. Like why am I dating again? I’m just a burden. I’m not worth it to anyone. He doesn’t know about abuse, he shouldn’t date someone like me. He should be with someone normal.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1123987,public,self,Dating after abuse,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qntwli/dating_after_abuse/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,
