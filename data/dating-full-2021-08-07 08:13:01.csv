She hosted a event and got my number. We  texted back and fourth about the plans. A lot of ""see you then!"" stuff.  At a meal with friends she wanted to split a meal with me and we talked  some. She had her phone out and would show me photos of things like a  place she had been to or legit was reading a wiki of a dead politician  she knew to me. I thought it as cool.. She didnt use her phone to avoid  the conversation at all, it was more for finding something out with me..  like what a tree was called that we were looking at.. But when I tried  to flirt I bombed a little. Basically just told her she had cool eyes  lmao and I couldnt tell how it was received.  
I didnt feel at my best  though and was hoping to do better yesterday at another hangout. She  gave me a lot of eye contact before and also seemed to mimic me a  little, but yesterday was different.

there  were like 10 of us and she glued herself to this one girl and seemed  out of the overall conversation the whole time. I barely got a word in  and even as we walked to our cars it felt she was only interested in  talking with this girl.  When she did join the group conversation a  couple times it felt like she was bouncing her eyes around avoiding eye  contact with me at times.

There  was a moment when it was just me and her sitting and we had a good short  conversation, but then she said she wanted to get a refill of her drink  and that is when she got attached to this girl. I coudnt tell if she  had made an excuse or not..

I cant read her. I know I will probably get told to either forget about it or ask her out.

I  didnt let it ruin the night. I tried to read her and kind of gave up  and involved myself in the group conversation and had positive  conversations with other girls.

Either  she is nervous or really nice and never was interested. I could just  ask her out, but Id like a good conversation to warm up to asking. I am  also thinking maybe its obvious she isnt interested, but she seemed  weird last night.

... I think she  is super cute and seems really cool, but if I am struggling to read her  this much maybe its just not worth it even if she did sort of like me.  I'd like to think that maybe I just need to break the ice, but if after  breaking the ice I still struggle to read her then I dont see a positive  relationship.

At this point I dont know if I should just ask her out if I sense a good connection again or let it go.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,941764,public,self,"Think this girl may not be interested in me, but honestly confused. 28m",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ozs70t/think_this_girl_may_not_be_interested_in_me_but/,all_ads,6,,,,dating,,,

I’m sure some of you have heard of attachment theory before, in case you haven’t, basically you go after the model of love that was displayed to you in your childhood by your parents in romantic relationships. I had emotionally distant, authoritarian parents who I felt like I had to constantly prove myself to, so now, in my search for a partner, I tend to be attracted to emotionally distant and dominant/authoritarian figures who I feel like I have to “earn” their love. The problem is that most men who are emotionally distant/authoritarian tend to be either not looking for any type of commitment or abusive, and I definitely don’t want to date someone like that. And when a nice guy comes around that wants commitment, likes me immediately, and likes me for who I am, I tend to cringe and lose a lot of attraction to them. I’m seeing someone like that now and I don’t really know what to do. I’m not romantically attracted to him in the slightest, but he’s attractive and nice and seems like an objectively good candidate for a relationship. I don’t want to date someone I’m not romantically attracted to, yet I tend to only be romantically attracted to men who don’t want me.

We had been hanging out after a conversation that was unclear of if we were trying to be friends or not. Anyways, we started hanging out and through lack of communication, I thought we were hanging out and he thought we were dating. I was growing attached to him too.  Anyways, he got upset with me over some things I had been doing while dating him (which I wouldn't have done if i had known). So he felt we should just be friends.

We have been emotionally and mentally supporting eachother through our problems. We call eachother and talk on the phone. We have a ton of fun whenever we hangout, and spontaneously do a million different things. Anyways, i started realizing how happy I was whenever I was with him, and how much he brought out my adventurous side (my authentic self). I feel free when with him. I realized i was getting feelings for him and started secretly wanting to hold hands, be close to him, touch him, etc. I didn't though because he wanted to be friends and I was trying to respect that. I wasn't sure if he liked me as he was trying to avoid being more than friends...

Well, last night we decided to go swimming in the middle of the night when it was pitch black and windy as hell. We didn't have swimsuits, and decided to go nude. So there we were, swimming naked together. We got out and he was really cold and started shivering like crazy and couldn't stop. We started huddling together so he would have body heat. Then next thing you know, we were laying down cuddling naked on a dock under a blanket, just nonsexually touching eachother.  He was respectful the whole time which I really respected (didn't make any sexual moves). Then in the middle of it, he grabbed my hand and held it in that moment. I thought maybe it was just part of the cuddling but then I was like does he like me back???

We have been dating for 8 months and we were planning on meeting each others families although we never had the conversation about making our relationship official/exclusive, I assumed we were because of the all the things we've said to each other and have been doing. 

I practically moved in with him, we said we loved each other, hinting at future plans with each other, things seemed to be getting very serious. When I found out about the other woman, I told him and he immediately apologized and told me that he only wants to be with me and that he made a stupid decision to talk to her but thats not he wants at all. 

I wanted to forgive him immediately, but instead, I called it off because he lied about her when I asked him about it initially. 

A week later, and I miss him so much! We were so emotionally in tune with each other and sexually as well 😩. I've dated some pretty shitty men, and he was just so different and refreshing. I'm affraid I won't find someone else  that has some his qualities again. 

I'm fighting the urge to contact him. He hasn't contacted me or even tried to save face since we broke up and it hurts. I feel like if he at least tried to get back into my good graces than I would forgive him and take him back but he has been silent. 

I'm at the point where I'm questioning if I made the right decision or if I over reacted and we could have just had a longer conversation about it and worked it out together.

The general sentiment amongst people seems to be that if you are interested in a more serious relationship, you should delay sex a few dates. However, I wonder what people's real life experiences have been?

On the surface it seems like a good way to filter out partners (read, mostly men) just looking for a quick fuck. However, my experiences differ, as do the experiences of many of my male and female friends. 

Even though it wasn't where the general consensus started, once we got talking about our actual experiences, it seems like sex earlier on in dating yields better results. It waste less time, gets answers quicker and helps each partner open up more  It was a quicker way to filter people who just wanted to bang, since delaying the sex would just mean more dates until you finally bang and they drop off. It also helped both parties get more comfortable with each other and open up more. Out of the 3 married couples on our server, 2 had sex on their first date and the other couple were friends before hand, but hooked up the first time they were alone together.

After some more discussion and getting the experiences of past and current relationships, all the most successful and fulfilling one's had sex within the first few dates. 

The general conclusion of the group was that you shouldn't have sex just to have sex on the first date, but as soon as you both start ""feeling it"", you shouldn't delay sex in the name of getting to know each other, you should have sex to get to know each other. Whether that be the 1st or 10th date. But setting up arbitrary rules to follow, and ignoring your feelings and mentions is not a plan for relationships success.

He may or may not be returning March 2022, and I’m just sick of lowkey waiting for him, and risking disappointment. So I’ve slowly tried to dip my feet in the dating water. I’ve had a couple of failed connections thus far.

After talking to this one guy for a bit, we (m, 30 f23) finally went on a date. It went super well, and the attraction was instant and mutual. We went to an authentic Mexican place, and both of us had not even 2 full margaritas in not-so-big jars… but I think they must have been strong. We were both pretty tipsy, me moreso. I broke my rule of not kissing on the first date… we had full blown sex. In a secluded area in a park (it was dark, and it didn’t last long). This is something I normally wouldn’t do sober. 

He was a gentleman for much of the date, honestly. He paid for our food, and he made sure I got home safe. Even in our tipsy state, we both admitted we were looking for a relationship hopefully. We did text a little that night. The next day (yesterday), I was feeling uneasy and regretful. I texted him after not hearing from him in the morning like I normally do, and told him that while I enjoyed myself, that wasn’t usual behavior for me. He agreed that it wasn’t usual for him either, and that he had a great time… but his response times were more spaced, and I just could feel a slight disconnect? Today, I sent another text, and it’s been a couple of hours of him not responding. He hasn’t been initiating any conversation since our date(which was only 2 days ago).

I was diagnosed with Aspergers as a child when at 3 years old I stopped communicating and was zoned out completely from my surroundings. Most of my early life was met with difficulty in social situations, being bullied and having a huge cloud of anxiety hanging overhead. This only lasted up until my late teens when time spent in social situations finally allowed me to acclimate with being more comfortable around new faces. Today I have a stable living and a lot less anxiety in public. If you met me on the street or at a bar you would never notice anything was ""off""  about my behavior.

However, even with all that experience some of the quirks of my disability will slip through the cracks at times and unintentionally hurt my relationships with people. Whether I misunderstand something someone said or fail to keep a conversation going, it causes them to assume something is wrong with me emotionally when in reality I just lose my train of thought and can't control the flow. Initiating a conversation with someone is as hard as threading a needle mentally.

Another problem is in my body language. Early in life I had big problems with motor functions to a point where even walking straight was a chore. That has been mostly eliminated but occasionally I stumble or trip myself up when I get nervous. The biggest drawback would be initiating any sort of mutual physical contact whether it be hugging, dancing, or just holding hands. I have been on a few dates where we share an awkward hug or hold hands which felt uncomfortable and may have sent the wrong signals. Never made it to a second date and I always wonder if that was the part which killed it.

After practically growing up with him I will always have a place in my heart for him but I’m not in love with him by any stretch of the word and he definitely feels the same way as we have had many lengthy conversations that ultimately led to our breakup. The whole process has been a long time coming, but we have officially broken up since last month.

I wish I wasn’t as attracted to this man as I am because I feel like I should be mourning my old relationship.

He is a self proclaimed Christian man, so I assumed he would be respectful as far as the physical stuff goes. Our first date was fine. We got along really well and the conversation flowed naturally. He was a little pushy and kissed me about 20 minutes after meeting. Then he really wanted to make out. But he said he would never go too far. I met him in a class and he was always very charming and charismatic. We reconnected over Instagram a few weeks ago and I worry that he is only using me for the hopes of sex or physical intimacy. At first, he seemed genuinely interested in me but after our first date he only started texting me in reference to physical stuff or when he wants to meet up. 

About two weeks passed and we met up again. He lives over an hour away from me which I was originally upset about, but now I find may be a blessing in disguise. We met up at a park near my house. It was very hot out but I was originally fine with it. Right away, he took me into the woods and tried to made out with me. I am fine with this. When we were walking through the woods he didn’t make much of an effort to wait up for me. Then he wanted to lay down in the woods and get on top of me. Right away, he took his shirt off and started dry humping me just like we were having sex. Then he wanted me to take my top off and I told him no, I didn’t feel right about it and this was too soon. Because he was on me and it was very hot out, I started feeling like I was going to vomit. I told him I needed to walk back to the car to get my water. Now I think that I may have been experiencing heat exhaustion because I got very dizzy and had a hard time breathing. Afterwards he wanted to go back into the woods again. For a while, we sat on the bench my the lake and that was nice. When he made out with me for long periods of time, I started getting nauseous again. He was adamant that we go back into the woods and there he started getting more physical. Dry humping me, talking dirty, putting me into a bunch of uncomfortable position, and trying to get me to take my clothes off. I guess I was a bit bothered by the fact that he didn’t prioritize my comfort. He knows that I have never been.i with a guy before and I would rather this type of stuff happen in my bed or something...not on top of a bunch of sticks and rocks in the woods. Eventually I got so nauseous because I couldn’t get up for air. I ended up throwing up a little. This was so embarrassing but I apologized a lot, he seemed to be pretty understanding and still wanted to make out with me. Maybe this incident was a good thing too, it is possible this scared him off because he wasn’t a good thing for me right now. He still hasn’t contacted me but he usually goes days without texting if he knows we can’t meet up anytime soon. I should have been more assertive when it came to saying no but I was in shock and don’t fully process everything that was happening because it went so fast.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,942267,public,nsfw,"Had a terrible experience on a second date, need advice",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ozzf9b/had_a_terrible_experience_on_a_second_date_need/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,dating,,,

Honestly I got very sad and anxious bcoz of sudden change in his behavior and abusive language, I was very hurt so I called again and again asked him to go out of the apartment and speak to me but he refused to do that. He kept getting more and more rude to me. He msgd me his cousin ‘s Gf also thinks bad about me and thinks I’m crazy. That made me more hurt. All I wanted was to talk to him once and calm the situation down between us, just want him to speak to me privately for a few mins. I was only 5 mins away at his place. We can talk in person or on the phone but his sudden rude behavior made me very very anxious I said I’ll come talk to you if you don’t come. Bcoz why his cousin and him who are most close to my heart in the whole world are talking bad about me to the 3rd person ( bdw I’m friends with this person too but not very close friends)
It’s almost been 10 hours since my bf is there now we have a problem I wanted to solve it ASAP, why is he not giving priority to us instead hanging out watching movie with them,
I went to their apartment even tho he and his cousin said no don’t come. I didn’t know what to do and how much long to wait coz he’s not saying when he’ll come back, ignoring me and swearing at me.
When I went there he came downstairs to stop me from going up, I was literally into tears and crying my lungs out about what did I do so wrong that y’all are gossiping like that about me and why do I deserve to be treated like that?
His cousin came out and yelled to get outta there we don’t want you to come in and her roommate is sleeping in other room. I said I didn’t come to create a scene but to talk calmly since y’all are already doing it, I just wanted her to not think bad about me. Plus why would my bf and my best friend do it behind my back.
So his cousin (my best friend) until this day says that:
&gt; I shouldn’t have come to her apartment that was so wrong of me even to this date it makes him furious
Bcoz we shouldn’t go somewhere we’re not invited.
But how do we make friends in a foreign country? If I make a new friend i introduce them to my friends group so do others. Plus she is my friend too not thru him we became friends befor they were Gf/bf we’re just not close friends.
He would never invite a person sitting next to him even tho it’s his best friend or anyone if he’s going out or for Party or just any hang out with his group of friends if he get a call sitting next to someone. He says it’s in decent to bring other ppl, it’s not okay, it’s disrespectful.
In my opinion I like to involve ppl make them comfortable and help them make new friends bcoz we all are away from our families and thats how you make friends. And everybody else do it too except him coz how else you’ll make friends in a foreign place.
Anyways he also said his Gf didn’t want me to come and doesn’t want any drama here middle of the night. So I said you guys should’ve  told me if I knew I wouldn’t have come then I understand, so the cousin said NO you didn’t have to know that, we don’t need to tell you that, you should have just stayed.
I always felt bad that I was the only person staying home always if they hang out coz he find it indecent to invite ppl out of his group, but I made him friends with all of my group of friends and we always hangout together, I never wanna leave him alone at home.
He would invite my bf but just not me.

- Am I wrong for going there that day, is it that bad?
- Is it not bad that they spoke badly about me to the 3rd person?

I (25M) meet an amazing and wonderful girl (24F) a while back, probably around late last year through a mutual friend and I was interested the moment I laid my eyes on her. I ended up getting her IG and eventually messaged her, she responded with enthusiasm and things went well from there over text for a while. So we eventually meet up and started to hang to get know eachother better and man did I fall even deeper for her. After a while, she would get Hot &amp; Cold and this would confuse the hell out of me. Was she actually interested? Did she see me just as a friend? Why would she keep on agreeing to hang out with me if she wasn't interested? I never overdid it with texting her constantly, if anything I think I played "" the game "" well. So even with the uncertainty we would still hang out with eachother and I eventually told her how I felt about her. To my surprise,  she also said she liked me, BUT that she didn't want to  rush things because she was in a previous relationship with a friend that ended bad. She then proceeded to say she wasn't ""friendzoning"" and made me promise her that I wouldn't ghost/dissappear after that, I agreed and said we'll see where things would take us. 

Maybe I should of been straight up at that moment, I should of told her that I was looking for more and if she couldn't offer what I was reciprocating I couldnt wait around. Maybe it was the right thing because she did say she liked me, either way, it never turned into anything and we stopped talking for a while. After a while we would see eachother through mutual friends from time to time &amp; I could tell she was more interested in one of my friends. He's a handsome guy who knows how to talk well and also knows how to dance. She was never ""mine"" so It was a free game and my friend took advantage of it. They apparently had a ""moment"" and they both ( separate occasions) talked to me about it. My friend told me he thinks I read her completely wrong and she wasn't looking for what i was, she just wanted to have fun and meet different people. I see that clearly now and don't have a problem with that or her. I already kind of moved on from the time we stopped talking, but what really hurts is the feeling of was I not good enough? I go back to every scenario and situation thinking i should of said ""this"" or acted more ""alpha"" or whatever..maybe I'm missing the sexual appeal? I don't know, I don't have problems meeting other woman but this one girl had a grasp on me and it hurts just because it felt like she did really like me at one point, but I potentially did something wrong &amp; fucked it all up.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked.

As the title says, **I am convinced women care about your personality and looks, and not your money/prestige. The good news is. Both of these can be improved on.**

I have some advice that may help many men out there who are struggling to date, based on my experiences dating, and wanted to share.

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* My Success Story \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

I am a 27 year old man, average attractiveness, and below average height (5'7""). When I was between ages 17-24, I did decently well with very attractive women in my age range. I have had multiple long term relationships, many one night stands, many flings, dated short term, etc. Those experiences meant a lot to me looking back, and I'm glad I was able to experience them. Was I a wealthy, well employed man with a house and a boat and the whole 9 yards? Was I a trust fund kid driving a Mercedes and living the party life on daddy's dime?

**No. I was a completely broke guy going to community college, working as a bussboy/waiter in a restaurant and barely paying the bills.** I had no money for fancy dates. I had no more than $300 in my bank account at a time, student loans, etc. I also used online dating to some success as well during the golden days of tinder between 2014-2016. Was able to get a long term girlfriend off of there and many hookups.

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* My Failure Story \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

Fast forward to today. I am going to be turning 28 soon, and **the last 4 years of my life have been the single worst period in my entire life for dating**. I have had 1 short month long fling in the last 3 years, and that was in the first year. It has been a solid 3 years without dating or barely even talking to anyone. I've tried going out to bars or dancing countless times and have met a lot of people and got numbers but none of it has turned into a date.

So what changed? Did I suddenly become overweight, unhealthy, and ugly? No. I've been employed in a high status job, making six figures, living in a luxury apartment in SoCal. I've had work done on my teeth, I have money for expensive gyms, I am in the single best shape of my entire life. I look great, feel great, feel successful, but alas, my dating prospects are worse than they've ever been in my life. When women hear my job, they could care less. I have never once told a woman ""I work as an engineer"" and ever had them perk up. It basically brushes off their shoulder and they could give a damn.

I tried online dating throughout the pandemic. I tried tinder, bumble, hinge, match, okCupid, POF, CMB, Facebook dating, Christian Mingle, farmersonly, datemepleaseI'mdesparate.com.... you get the picture. And still, nothing. I had conversation with only 1-2 girls during that entire time and they didn't turn into anything. I went through the same process everyone goes through when this happens. Maybe its my bio? Maybe its my pictures? Maybe my text game sucks? To test this, I tried I recycling the same photos and bio from 2016 just to see if maybe I've become old and ugly. Still, nothing. I swiped hundreds, thousands of times, barely any matches and barely any luck. **Something changed**. Either people aren't using dating apps as much as they used to, or most women aren't looking to date men in their upper 20s. I think its the former. I think less women are using dating apps, and more are using them for attention, because they're bored, for only fans, or for followers.

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Proximity Matters \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

**So what changed? The only independent variable I can see that changed is: proximity.**

**I am no longer in close proximity to women. As a averagely attractive man who is below average height, my main ability to attract a woman is my personality, which is why I strike out at bars/clubs/online dating, but have been so successful in school and in jobs where there were women around. I have rarely ever been told my a woman that I am attractive. But I have been told many times that I am funny, intelligent, and can hold an amazing conversation.**

Working at my job, there are no women. You spend 50+ hours a week working with almost all men. From 7AM-7PM, I was hustling away at a job that kept me in an office not meeting anyone. By the end of the day I am exhausted. I do find a way to get out and either go to workout classes or go out dancing, but its not the same.

If you aren't meeting anyone, you no one is going to be able to appreciate you for you who you are. If you spend all day in a factory, you probably aren't going to meet anyone. If you spend all day doing male centric jobs, male centric hobbies, etc, you probably aren't going to meet anyone.

But hold on, my problems didn't just start when I graduated college 3 years ago. They started a whole 1-2 years before that, when I transferred to a university for engineering. See, at my community college, I shared many general education classes with girls from different majors, and met many in my classes. When I transferred to university, I was surrounded by 95% men in my engineering major.

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* The Lie You Need to Stop Believing \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

Why does this matter? You see, somewhere along the line, many of us were lied to, or at least misled, by some boomer advice. My mom, meaning well, drilled it into me how women want powerful, successful men with money. Now maybe that is true when women get older, but I am convinced that is mainly advice from the 60s, when women didn't hold high paying jobs. When women couldn't earn a lot of money, and wanted a family, then sure, maybe it was really attractive to find a man with a good job. But now-a-days, women earn their own money. They can focus on dating a guy that they really have chemistry with, and actually really like for who they are.

Some of you, and myself just as guilty, are convinced that once you are ""successful"", get that high paying job, that title, have the car, house, etc, that you will get women, and its just not true. You need to stop thinking this way, or else you are going to end up alone. **At the end of the day, she is going to be with you because of you, not because of what you have.**

And don't get me wrong, women do like ambition. They do like a man who is successful. But ambition doesn't automatically mean money. They want you to be ambitious about what you are passionate about. That might mean being an engineer, doctor, or lawyer. But it also might mean being the best damn bartender, or machine shop manager, or policeman, or whatever it is you are passionate about. She wants to see the passion in you when you talk about it. No woman thinks its attractive that you work some high paying job that you despise just because you get to say you're a lawyer.

**\*\*\*\*\*\* Some Anecdotal Evidence \*\*\*\*\*\*\***

I remember when I was 19, my long term girlfriend and I broke up. I was going to college for engineering, and ""supposedly"" was going to become someone successful. She cheated on me with, and started dating a guy who was 27, failed out of college, and made minimum wage with her and lived in a shitty apartment and had a ton of debt.

Directly after her I dated a girl I met in community college when I was 20. We dated for about 6 months and then mutually agreed to cut it off. After that she started dating a former classmate, who dropped out of engineering to go work at a brewery.

After her I was really into this girl I had met in another college class. She would study with me and we even kissed a couple times. I was head over heels for her, but she wasn't that interested. I remember when I got a new job, and she asked me.. ""more money?"". I replied enthusiastically ""Yes!"", hoping she would like hearing that. She just smiled, and said nothing back. At the end of the day, she wasn't attracted to me, and no amount of money or success was going to change that.

When I was 21, I dated this girl who was madly in love with me. We broke up, and she ended up getting married to a ""DJ"".

My last long term girlfriend (age 22-23), ended up getting married to a guy who worked with her at her job at Target.

When I was 24 I failed my last class and couldn't graduate college yet. Had to delay my graduation, sign up for another class, etc. It felt embarrassing. I was working as waiter and also driving a catering truck as a second job. I still ended up dating this drop dead gorgeous blond girl who I met at school. She could of been a model, and didn't give a flying fuck what I did for work. I started working in engineering once I graduated and her and I ended up breaking up soon after because I didn't have enough time to spend with her. I really wanted to continue it, but she wouldn't let me.

**\*\*\*\*\*\* Life Lived Through Experiences \*\*\*\*\*\*\***

When I look back, the best times of my life were in community college, when I was absolutely broke, working at a restaurant. It's because of all the people I met, experiences I had, and dates I went on.

The last 3 years of my life, being ""successful"", making over 100k a year, are honestly not times I look on really fondly. Yes, I'm proud of what I've achieved. But I am not happy. The last few years feel like a blur, because I spent it giving my soul to corporate America. I was happier when I was a busser and had $40 in my checking account but the girl I loved laying her head on my arm as I lay next to her.

My advice for people in their early 20s, or even teens: Don't dedicate your whole life to money. Focus your life on experiences and relationships. They are what we define ourselves by. It's what you will remember when you look back. You'll have more friends and a better dating life.

You might be curious, what am I going to do now? I am going to go back to working in a restaurant, and go to school for nursing. I want to influence peoples lives, create experiences, meet people, and make a real impact. I am choosing my soul over money. No it won't be easy. I've done my research and don't have rose colored glasses. No high paying job is easy. It's just a question of what makes it worth it. People are what's worth it to me.

TL;DR - **Stop thinking that money and success will make you successful in dating. Looks do matter. But what's going to make you the most successful is your personality and proximity to who you are looking to date. Women are very attracted to a man with a good heart and who can make them laugh. If you work a job that drains you and you aren't meeting anyone, the sad truth is you may need to reconsider it, if you want to meet someone at the end of the day. Your career is what you will spend most of your life doing, and the type of people you work with are who you will spend most of your life around. Think twice about choosing a high paying career with no women in it, because you think the money and prestige will make you successful in dating.**",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,942423,public,self,"I am convinced women care about your personality and looks, and not your money/prestige",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p01l6n/i_am_convinced_women_care_about_your_personality/,all_ads,6,,,,dating,,,
