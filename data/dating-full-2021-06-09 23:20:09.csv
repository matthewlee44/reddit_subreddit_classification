So for a little background, I [23] am really interested in this one girl in my college classes [29] and over the past month we've been texting quite a bit and hanging out a few times outside of class together. She was the person to initiate the texting and over text it feels like she is trying to flirt, but when we hang out in person it honestly feels more like friends hanging out with a little bit of flirting thrown back and forth. We joke around with each other and we laugh a lot but other than that not much else has happened. 

So onto what I need help with. We have hung out 3 times outside of class together, and after the second time I asked her if she was looking for a relationship or something else. Because I'm an idiot, I'm sure I worded it poorly and she looked caught off guard and only responded that she got out of a serious relationship a year ago and we ended up just saying goodbye. She later apologized that night for making it awkward and she just said she was caught off guard, but she still never answered my question. Despite this, we still text a lot and we even hung out a couple days ago for the whole day and it had the same vibe as before with a tiny bit of flirting. 

I really like her and I think it would be cool to try and start a relationship with her, but if that is not what she wants I am totally okay just remaining friends because I genuinely enjoy her company. My problem is I don't really know what to say or do without sounding stupid or jeopardizing the friendship. I was thinking of just asking her on a date (maybe for bowling and dinner) or the next time we hang outside of class just tell her that I like her but if that's not how she sees me then I'm totally cool with remaining friends. Would one of these be able to get my point across better that I would like to date her? There's a movie she wants to go watch and I was thinking of taking her to see it then get some ice cream afterwards and then tell her what I think of her. I'm pretty shy, so this is new to me, but I know if I don't say anything about how I feel about her I will regret it. The thing is as much as I would like a relationship, I do not want to ruin the friendship! Even if she says no or she is not interested I would like to remain friends.

We were in the same (small) social circle for most of the pandemic and we've hung out both by ourselves and with others in our circle. I guess I have been feeling lonely since the pandemic started, and she is a caring person, which drew me to her. 

She is a very open and non-judgemental person, so I feel that telling her about my feelings won't do much harm, but I'm also very hesitant because what we already have right now is great and I fear she'll start distancing herself from me when she learns this (happened with a different friend years ago). Another issue holding me back is our maturity difference. I know 4.5 years is not a huge age difference, but she has seen much more of the world and is much wiser than I am. In other words, I'm afraid that she still sees me as a kid. I acknowledge this difference, and I am happy to work around it but I'm scared to see what she thinks.

Whenever I match with a girl whos probably like a 4-5, she always sends dry answers, and acts super entitled. Many of them don’t have actual jobs but I still gave it a shot and asked a couple of them out to which they said “sure lets grab drinks” only to which they never suggest times that they are available or they just flat out ghost after that saying that. When I have met with them (grain of salt because its probably 3/7 dates I’ve had) they show up excessively late like 30 minutes, and/or don’t look like their profile pictures (+20 pounds). Obviously its a huge turn off and I’ve even had one of them expect me to have sex by pushing to come back to my place after I paid a $240 bill (not all guys want to have sex on the first date too contrary to what people think). 

On the flip side, I usually have very attractive girls (7+) who I’m wondering how i’ve even matched with, engage in meaningful conversation while showing genuine interest. 3/7 of the very attractive girls I’ve gone on dates with were on time and genuine about what they were looking for without a bs excuse (the last 1/7 was attractive but she probably had the worst personality of all). Even now when I match with a very attractive girl, they’re more open to sending me over their number even if the conversation goes no where eventually. They won’t say “lets grab drinks” unless they actually plan to follow through with it. On top of that, all of them offered/pushed to split the bill which I love.

That's happened too many times for comfort for me.

So a few days ago I saw this girl whose face and nothing else I knew from my high school which I graduated from last year. She's still attending and is about to graduate.

She was with a boy and a girl which I assume to be her friends and after standing around, going to McDonald's to gather my courage in the form of an ice cream cone and heading back I awkwardly asked her number. She hesitated but she was smiling at me and her face was beaming it felt like. I got good vibes from her.

I then messaged her that evening asking her out for a coffee date over the weekend but she then said she lost interest because she wasn't going to meet someone she didn't know. A little back and forth on the arguments later she became more frank so I gave her the ultimatum of me waiting for her at a Starbucks at a definitive date and time and I told her that she could be there or not and that would be her final answer. After she said she wasn't interested and that she wanted to save me the trouble, I pleaded and told her that I don't care about my self-esteem, that I want her to do me this favour and give me a chance.

I think I got blocked on Whatsapp.   


Now I'm not sure what to do. I definitely will wait for her on Friday, since I think that even if there's a slim chance, she's worth it. Maybe she's playing hard to get after all and feels pity on me.

I could also phone her and try to talk it out, but my psychologist tried to make me aware of the difference between persistence and border-crossing behaviour.   


I just find it hard to deal with rejection from girls that I actually find interesting. The little exchange we had sparked genuine interest in her, but she probably just thinks I'm trying to get in her pants. Sex is overrated anyways.

Am I being stupid? Is this stalker behaviour? The harder I'm rejected the more I assign value to her.

Me and my “significant other “ has been together for
About ten years. We met at work. We worked together for seven months before he was fired for coming to work drunk. 

We got close because he started paying me for rides to work after he crashed his car for driving drunk. After he was fired we stayed in contact for a year n then stopped talking for a year. I hit randomly n that’s when the real friendship began. I asked him to take
My virginity n that began the situation ship I knew he didn’t want a relationship I didn’t want to be with him but I trusted him. 

He has emotional issues. His mom died of cancer a year before I met him n he has never stopped grieving. His grandfather who’s as like his parent who he lived with for our entire relationship died last year which was another major blow. He also lost his best friend a couple years ago. He has experienced a lot of lost. Although we are not technically together I’ve spent most of our relationship being his support system.  Always there for him even to the point of helping him so much financially. 

I did start catching feelings we became so
Close he treats me like his girlfriend, tells me everything, brought me into his family and group of friends n his son loves me. He even mistakenly refers to me as his girl but states that as much as he loves me he doesn’t want to be in relationship.  It’s very confusing. But I have to say over this past year my romantic feelings for him are fading because I don’t feel like he is man enough for me. I don’t respect how he doesn’t work hard enough to put himself in a better situation. 

This year I lost my job. I have yet to receive unemployment but I am a freelance writer so I have some income. This year I have needed his support more than ever n he has let me down. I find myself helping him so much n I’m the one without a real job. He doesn’t ask if I need anything. If I ask for something he will give it to me though. 

I just resent him more n more each day. He has an entitled attitude. Everything has been about him. During sex he gets the most pleasure because he doesn’t like foreplay n refuses to reciprocate oral. 

We just had a argument because he said my last name wrong. I feel after 10yrs he should know how to pronounce my last name n he should remember my middle name.

Sometimes I feel used n taken advantage of but I also do feel like he loves me.

Initially, I was only looking for a casual but consistent dating experience, while still being open to something more with the right person, keeping in mind that I’m planning to do some travel starting in the fall and I’m not sure how often I’ll be in my current city. 
Then I met this guy about a month and a half ago. He’s been great and for the past two weeks, we’ve been seeing each other more and more and realized we really like each other. It’s been great spending time with him so far, but the problem is our timing. He is starting med school in august and I’ll be moving out of my apartment and spending some time living with my parents about 45 minutes away. I know the distance isn’t bad, but I myself plan on going to law school next fall, so I understand how hard he has worked to get here and don’t want to distract from that. We did talk a little bit about how neither of us was expecting to find someone we like this much, but that we are glad we did and want to keep seeing each other. 
I guess the point here isn’t that I’m hoping we’ll magically be able to make something work between us. It seems pretty clear to me that we should just have a good summer together and then wish each other the best and part ways. But my achey breaky heart has me nervous that we’ll get to that point and it will be extremely hard to let go—the whole head vs. heart thing. It’s not that I’m having a ton of anxiety over it and I’m definitely not head over heels for this guy yet, but I guess I just am worried about future me and future him. I don’t want either of us to get hurt even though I know it’s sort of inevitable, so in that case, I’d like to minimize the hurt.

The only thing I'm left wondering is if there's some kind of useful take away from the experience.

I was chatting with a guy online. Quickly he says he wants to meet, I tell him that's the idea but we should get know to know a little. Around this time his answers become less good; he ignores entire chunks of messages, keeps his answers vague and cryptic, repeats himself, etc. This combined with the fact he used a fake name for his profile made me wonder if he was cheating on a spouse or something, but unsure what it meant. When I notice something similar to a red flag, it typically always has meaning - the issue is finding how important or innocuous that meaning is. His haste about meeting also segued into a conversaton about chemistry a little bit, with him firmly in the realm of ""chemistry determines everything"" and me being in the realm of ""chemistry + making effort in the relationship determines the outcome."" 

So today we met, and things seemed to be going well. He looks like the photos and we're about evenly matched looks-wise, education-wise. The conversation is going well. But then 2 hours into it, he calls it quits even though it's still early. He says he didn't feel a spark and he has to prepare for work tomorrow. I'm like uh OK, and we part amicably. First date from OLD that was that short. Usually even after an entire evening I'm not 100% sure if there's real potential with someone, that decision seemed too soon.

I think I need to vent it out so that's what happened:
I was with her in my home when she said she was hungry so I went to the market buy something to eat. When I was back I noticed she was a little strange, more quiet than usual. But I ignored. When we're finished eating I asked what was wrong and she called me a liar and said that I'd disrespected her and seemed to be thinking about something. I hadn't understand why she said that at the moment until she'd told me via msg something like this:
""Why don't you search my name in your whatsapp and see what you said to your friends?""
I was dumbfounded, cause I'd told two of my friends about some very unnecessary things about our intimacy, like what we did when we were together, you know. I was so ashamed of myself that I really wanted to die. 
I don't talk to her anymore and don't want to because there are some other things involved... But I still feel something after all this time don't know why. I feel like it will never go away. Can you give me some advice?

So when a woman is insecure, its seen as acceptable and men wouldn't care or at least this particular woman gets told that men would still go after her. However, when a man is insecure people basically call him names and say no woman will go after him. So why does this double standard exist? Why exactly are women exempt from being insecure in certain situations, whereas men can't be in any way? Because from what i've noticed about posts with women being insecure is that people basically coddle her and say to her that her insecurities aren't a problem, they even try to remediate them. But when a guy posts that hes insecure there are several people that state ""you will never find women that will like you because you are insecure."" ""Insecurity is s turn off, good luck finding women with your insecurity."" ""Be confident, I can tell women don't like you because of your insecurity."" A lot of these comments are completely fucked up. Its not like you're even trying to help men with their insecurity problems, but you make them worse whereas when women have these issues people try to dodge the fact that shes insecure and literally just coddle women.

Me: let’s go to a game this weekend. I’ll take care of everything. You down?
Her: I’d be down! I haven’t been to a game in forever. I’m only off on Saturday. 
Me: Nice let’s plan on it! Not sure what your schedule looks like on Friday, but they play at 7 or Saturday during the day. Whatever works best for you.
Her: i might be able to leave work early friday lemme check and i’ll let you know!
Her: I can leave early!!
Me: Awesome!! Friday works for me. I can pick you up or we can meet down there
Her: i work at *******. i was thinking you could just pick me up from here!?
Me: I can definitely do that

Her: ugh sooo i just tried to tell my co worker and manager i need to leave early, my co worker came in to tell us she has an “emergency” and needs off all weekend so i can’t leave early aaaaand have to work friday-sunday 😭😭😭😭

Me: I guess you’re not great at texts either?!?! Lol want to make different plans tonight?
Her: not the best but better than messenger lol. Depends honestly I kind of just want to go home and sleep since I have to work on my day off tomorrow 😓
Me: that’s a bummer, I was really looking forward to hanging out. What days are you normally off?
Her: a bummer is putting it lightly 😭 but I don’t have regular days off or it changes every week
Me: ahh gotcha. Let me know the next day you have off and we can make some plans. In the meantime since our plans fell through let me at least buy you dinner. (Proceed to send grub hub gift card) food always makes things better right???

After a year of learning and loving myself, I genuinelly feel confused about why I should seek a romantic relationship? There is nothing that I really NEED a partner for, nothing important that I can't do or give myself at this point of my life. I feel secure and good by myself. I have loving friendships and I'm even working on strengthening my relationship with my family.

I've learned that, in the past I've ""needed"" a boyfriend because I wanted to escape myself and focus on something external. Or it's been pressure from my enviroment, not wanting to be the only single one or maybe even the fear of looking alone and like ""I don't have anyone"".

I'll be back at college by the end of August, at which point I'll start going on dates. However, I might as well do something in the meantime to improve my prospects. Here's what I've already considered:

Continuing to work on my interests: This should be common sense, yet I hear this advice getting thrown around all the time. I'm not gonna quit my hobbies and interests.

Exercise: I had already planned to walk outside more, do some pushups, stretch. Nothing as serious as weightlifting several times a week, just increasing physical activity in general.

Take Pictures: My profile has a bio listing my interests, a few facts about myself, and suggests some topics to discuss. I've got 5 images that pass all basic standards for clarity (right distance, not blurry, no bathroom selfies), avoid all common taboos, and portray various activities I enjoy while showing off my face and body in a clear way. As I've learned, just having above average pictures is not enough, so I'll strive to increase picture quality further.   

Improving appearance: I'm open to ordering makeup and trying various creams, gels, moisturizers etc. if that's what it takes. So far, I've just practiced standard hygiene: shower, brush teeth, floss, shampoo, wash face, which may not be enough. For full transparency, here's a recent image of me: [https://imgur.com/a/n3xCMiD](https://imgur.com/a/n3xCMiD) 

Here's what I'm planning on doing after going back to college:

Getting to know some of my friends better and asking them out: The gender ratio in my classes and clubs has not favored me so far, I know a lot of boys but not so many girls. However, at least I know some that I'm interested in and will speak with further.  

Online Dating: In case I get rejected by all the friends I'm interested in, I'll switch to online dating, which is why I mentioned taking pictures earlier.

New activities: I'm gonna join some intramurals, so far I see ping pong, ultimate frisbee, spikeball as potential candidates because I've enjoyed playing them in the past. My schedule is lighter than usual next semester, so I'll make time to rush for frats.  

Continuing current activities: I was in 4 clubs and am still going to actively participate in them next semester.  

So what else can I do during the summer? To paraphrase Churchill, I'm willing to put in the blood, toil, tears, and sweat that it takes to be successful. I know some people may say that you have to just relax, focus on your own stuff, and things will come naturally. However, there's nothing wrong with continuing your interests, enjoying life, and improving your dating prospects all at the same time, so such a remark is meaningless.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,828384,public,self,Improving dating prospects over the summer,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwh5bo/improving_dating_prospects_over_the_summer/,all_ads,6,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'u255IYYbD5VaeBj4z-gBD7cyNzv7UftXsTtPWJZnVAE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E5IYFMCuDeHOD1umCrsJdrrQ7zZujMwQvzs6BbNS5Xo.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b30aa45fa258714d5d24c7eb08a4f0bfdb59e521', 'width': 108}, {'height': 288, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E5IYFMCuDeHOD1umCrsJdrrQ7zZujMwQvzs6BbNS5Xo.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f2b43aea54044801e56c13f46ca89833a698edb', 'width': 216}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E5IYFMCuDeHOD1umCrsJdrrQ7zZujMwQvzs6BbNS5Xo.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f530070b242bb6400c706554b8e8266e5ec8b55', 'width': 320}, {'height': 853, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E5IYFMCuDeHOD1umCrsJdrrQ7zZujMwQvzs6BbNS5Xo.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16521456103c23fd8f3c3470ac6e0533e8f8586a', 'width': 640}, {'height': 1280, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E5IYFMCuDeHOD1umCrsJdrrQ7zZujMwQvzs6BbNS5Xo.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4d1b180b5fab23b0fad3a16091a97d80508b0f0', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1440, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E5IYFMCuDeHOD1umCrsJdrrQ7zZujMwQvzs6BbNS5Xo.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a753611ea33a21c3e730c9df09cdcfc8ca640a3d', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 4608, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/E5IYFMCuDeHOD1umCrsJdrrQ7zZujMwQvzs6BbNS5Xo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=259eaf8abc2e7bb04eb4e7dc4e73c085c397048a', 'width': 3456}, 'variants': {}}]}"

It took me this long to try it because of bullying for being fat in public school and mildly abusive parents; over the last several years I've worked through my problems and gotten into pretty good shape physically. 

 I've asked questions about dating/relationships/sex on several subreddits, and most of the answers were really helpful.

Why is it that NOBODY (especially other guys) brings up the time investment?! Yeah, it took plenty of time for me to work through my own issues and work on my physical health, but I'm referring mostly to the amount of time it takes to meet somebody, set up a date, and then go and make it happen.

And I found the women I dated through Tinder and Bumble, not through other means (pandemic aside, meeting people in person somewhere else would probably take more time). Even after taking the time saved via online dating into account, it was easily 4 to 6 hours of prep for each of those dates. Most of that time was spent putting extra effort into my appearance or cleaning up my car.

Spending that extra time made a huge difference in the way I was perceived, even with the limitations of online dating, but guess what guys! I have OTHER INTERESTS besides trying to put my dick into wet holes! 

Pardon the sarcasm, I'm just really tired of hearing other guys talk about this stuff as though it's all some effortless game. Even if I *was* just trying to get laid/have one-night stands, the effort and time investment would probably be the same, and it's nothing to sneeze at.

If other guys in my position read this (never dated before, past typical age, etc.), dating is a MAJOR TIME INVESTMENT!

My ex boyfriend is 21 and I am 23. We were together for 1.5 years. We recently broke up as he told me i broke two promises and humiliated him and that i have crossed his limit and he now do not care. When i ask him what i did, he refused to say it. He said he has given me chances but i blew it. Now we’ve been on and off for 3 times now. What i do when im angry is before dumping him is that i block him and later unblock him because i regret doing it. I blocked because I thought that i was done with him. I am someone who is short tempered but regret it early (another thing that ive learned), when i look back on the things i did, i am actually thankful at how patient this man is, i would block him after i say what i wanted to and not wait for him to explain anything.

 But him &amp; i would talk about it later and get back together. He was really wiling. Another thing that he hates is when I apologise for being me (in my defence, he used to make me feel so guilty of what i do that i feel sorry for me and would apologise), i did these two the last time we fought and i think those were the two promises. Do you think i crushed his ego or devalue him? He once told me to listen to what he says and respect me.

 I think ive really crossed his limits to the point where he cant trust me anymore with anything. I feel bad. I was angry and hence does the things he told me not to, i made a mistake, im just a human. Do men really take it to heart when we devalue them? I feel extremely bad but the chances he talks about, I don’t get that, we don’t usually argue that much for me to blow all his chances away. He said we should walk our separate ways when i texted him the day just after we broke up, is he saying this because he hasn’t cooled down yet? Or he really meant it.

 I know he is hurting and he has not blocked me or unfollowed be in any social media platform. I wrote to him and called him even to tell him that i am wiling to change and make this work, that i loved him. He couldn’t answer when i ask him if he still loves me btw. I begged him, I apologised, i think i did everything i could in my hand hand but he just wouldn’t talk. Now I don’t have any hopes in this relationship but i wanted to know from a guy’s perspective. So that i can be better for the next guy I’ll be with, God wiling.
Mind you, he has many girl-friends he talks to friendly rather than his friends who are guys. Do you think they have some influence in his decision?

Hi reddit, I'm having a real dilemma here about who to continue seeing. I've been dating two guys non-exclusively, but I'm getting stressed out over dating multiple people and would like to define the rship with one of them soon. I'm 29F, doing very well career-wise and very much looking for long-term relationships that hopefully leads to marriage in another 2-4 years (as I want children) - I'm risk-averse and really don't want to invest time and effort into another relationship that might end. They're both pretty serious about me and want to move things forward.

Guy A: Have been talking since March, went on many dates since then.

\+ Great physical chemistry

\+ Great emotional connection - we've had a lot of really deep conversations, we both were open and shared things in our past we're not proud of and were non-judgemental, we talk a lot about feelings and are pretty vulnerable with each other

\+ He's fun, teases me a lot; we have fun together and laugh a lot

\- Sometimes he feels immature and childish in thought (e.g. the way he talks about other people or his own experiences)

\- Recently had a lot of arguments over differences in personalities/ styles. Managed to resolve most of them relatively calmly.

\- Has never offered to pay for me/ always wants to split the bill equally

\- Has pretty different views on sex and intimacy - he has a much higher sex drive and is also more liberal with sex, sees my lower sex drive as affecting physical intimacy. Had an argument recently where he's upset that I didn't want to have sex.

\- Less long-term oriented; told me he wants to be in a serious relationship, but also wants me to focus on the present instead of worrying about future marriage etc.

\- His long-term plans are TBD - super smart person but due to his field of specialization, not sure where his career is going.

Guy B: Have been talking since April, only met 4x due to schedule mismatches etc.

\+ I feel more stable with him. He's always talked about finding someone for the long-term, he's settled into a good job that he loves, and we share similar views on family/ relationships. He pays me genuine compliments, doesn't really tease me.

\+ Puts in a lot of effort into dates and always offered to pay (finding places, giving me options; I also paid sometimes of course)

\- Uncertain physical chemistry. He knows I'm more conservative and has been very respectful so far, which I appreciate.

\- Have not had difficult conversations yet (no arguments, no discussions on past secrets in depth)

\- Conversations are less exciting/ fun, he's more introverted so I feel like he doesn't bring up as many topics.

I know they're each their own individual person and so different but I'm really at a cross-roads here. Any advice on how I should proceed or even what I should discuss with them about to come to a conclusion will be appreciated. I feel like I like Guy A more right now but that may just be because we've spent more time together and have stronger intimacy compared to Guy B who I just haven't had the chance to spend as much time with.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,828558,public,self,Who should I move forward with?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwj66j/who_should_i_move_forward_with/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Maybe I should be less picky or something and just settle with someone I don't have any chemistry with. I just miss being close to people even being an introvert. I don't want to shack up with dudes that hit on me. That or go for the ""couples"" that are probably just one guy looking for a hookup.

Most of the time I'm ok being alone. I feel like people look at me weird because I don't have friends that hang out. People think I'm unhealthy for spending so much time alone. I don't really want to be so alone. They're mostly on the internet. There's nothing wrong with phone sex but it's hard to even find phone sex partners. They tend to be flakey and run away to the next person. It feels like Tinder, Facebook, and online dating in general is a total shitshow. I don't know what I should do to be honest. It has been a while since I've had sex. 

I met with one woman on Reddit a few months ago. I took a 3-4 hour bus/train trip one way to see her. Her and I hung out, checked into a hotel room, got food, and watched TV. We cuddled but nothing else happened. I read the situation and it felt like that was all the intimacy she wanted. She didn't seem to want sex. At least that was the impression I got from her. I'm not very forward and confident. I was afraid if I said anything about sex she would be turned off and think I was some horny pervert. I'm going to let her go and delete her from my phone contacts  I'll just give up any hope of doing anything with her. I don't know. I guess I just manage to screw everything up.

Sorry, I know this seems like a depressing post. Look I'm not a very extroverted person. I don't excel at social interaction like some do. I don't know what to do, if it's just me, the pandemic, or what. It feels like women don't want me. It feels like they don't want to be intimate with me. I don't feel like I fit in with a lot of people. I feel so off the beaten path when I'm genuinely myself. Who wants a dude that's an artist who does puppetry, caricatures, etc?

That already kind of sucks, but the worst part of it is that I have only been flat out rejected twice. The other six times I got a yes, but no date happened.

Why is this a thing? Why say yes if you're not interested? When I was younger I thought rejection was the worst thing that could happen, but now I almost want to thank the two girls who didn't say yes because it's so much better to be told no immediately than it is to get a yes and then be disappointed when the date never happens. It's a lose-lose because not only am I extra sad and embarrassed when the date doesn't happen, but she's probably cringing the whole time I'm trying to schedule a date while knowing that it's literally a dead end. It just sucks because I get all excited to go on a date and meet someone new and cute who seemingly likes me, only to then be shot down in a way that is way more embarrassing, frustrating, and demoralizing. 

#1 forgot she would be out of town. 
#2 (same girl as #1) missed the rescheduled date outright, only telling me days later that she was in a funk. 
#3 met at a bar and got her number. Asked her on a date and got no reply, which I count as one of the merciful flat-out rejections.
#4 scheduled a date and she canceled the morning of. Said she would get back to me about rescheduling and never did.
#5 flat-out no from a girl on Tinder (thank you!)
#6 said yes and then blocked me several days before the date
#7 said yes but then missed the date because she wouldn't text back to help get it scheduled.
#8 (same girl as #7) asked her out again a couple weeks later since I thought she had been interested, but then she missed the date, claiming to have forgotten and offering to reschedule, but I found out through my roommate (one of her friends) that she only said yes because she didn't want to be mean by saying no, so I won't be trying to schedule with her again lol.

You would think after three or four my dumbass would stop getting so excited, but I just really want to meet someone and that yes is still euphoric.

He was honestly great, super attractive, fun, interesting and we got along. He also really seemed to like me, which was amazing. I feel like I’ve had a problem in the past of dating guys that don’t give a shit about me, and I’ve always made more effort and then ended up being rejected and ghosted by them. A couple of times I’ve gone on dates with guys and immediately known I’m not into them, and I’ve let them know, but most of the time I’ve been very into the guy and ended up being hurt by them. So this guy seemed great, ticked all the boxes and I was excited to get to know him. 

Enter: a friend of mine. He’s a new friend who I met recently through other friends. We immediately clicked and I think I had a bit of a crush on him from the start, but I was also very aware that I didn’t know him that well and I also wasn’t sure how he felt about me. I sort of brushed it off as nothing, but still really enjoyed hanging out with him as a friend and getting to know him. A couple of weeks ago, this friend ended up staying at my house with my housemates and I, as he temporarily needed a place to stay. Over the week, my crush on him grew and I became more sure that he liked me back, which my friend who is good friends with him agreed with. 

Now, this friend. This guy is honestly the best person I’ve ever met in my life. I know that sounds insane, but he’s so generous, kind, funny, intelligent and we click so well. I honestly think he has a flawless personality. I’ve been hesitant about getting into a long term relationship with someone and I’ve always struggled with the idea of marrying someone and being with them for the rest of my life. But with this guy, I can picture it. He’s just perfect in every way. And the chemistry and connection between us seems so strong. 

It was during this week when my friend was staying with us that I went on my second date with Hinge guy. This second date was okay, but I noticed some moments of the conversation not being that great, a few little things that I wasn’t that attracted to, and just a general feeling of something being off. I really can’t explain it because on paper, everything was fine. It was just a feeling of “I’d rather just go home.” I also have to admit that I kept thinking about my friend the whole time. I went home afterwards feeling very conflicted.

The next few days I found myself avoiding messages from Hinge guy and not really being keen to meet up again. He kept pushing to meet up as well, which kinda annoyed me. I realised I just wasn’t that interested anymore, despite the fact that he was a really really great guy. 

At the same time, I started chatting more with my friend and he ended up asking me to hang out just the two of us. We had an amazing day together and everything felt so perfect. I realised that I needed to let Hinge guy down gently. I didn’t want to do to him what so many guys had done to me. I wanted to be totally honest with him. I told him that I really liked him and enjoyed his company, but I had feelings for someone else, and didn’t want to string him along. That’s the truth. I didn’t want to keep him on the back burner for later - that would be really unfair. 

I’ve continued talking to my friend and am feeling really excited about getting to know him more and seeing where things go. I’ve also had confirmation through friends that apparently he really likes me too. It honestly feels like high school haha. 

BUT, despite all this, I’m suddenly feeling regret about rejecting Hinge guy. I don’t get it. I realised I didn’t want to see him again. I’m interested in someone else. But I can’t help but have this feeling of regret that I cut him loose too soon. I’m wondering if it’s because this is the first time I’ve rejected someone who I initially liked. All previous rejections have been pretty immediate for me, but this time, we actually did connect initially. It’s just that someone else who I feel much more compatible with crossed my path. 

Why am I feeling this regretful? Is it just a weird psychological thing of wanting more options? Or not being used to rejecting people?

Wow, this turned into a rant. Any advice is welcome.

Hello, I've been dating since I was 17 and I've been in a ""relationship"" with plenty of girls over the year. But, I've never felt that I've been in love with any one of them.

I met this girl 3 months ago and we've met in person multiple times but mostly we talk on the phone for hours every night and text throughout the day.

I'm not a very social person and mostly stick to myself - focusing on my career and living life. Marriage and having kids have never been in my future plans. I've never cared about anyone else but me. All this changed when I met this girl.

3 months ago, I was at my lowest point in life - lost my job, zero money in my bank account, etc. To top it off, my whole family (parents &amp; elder brother) got serious covid, I mean the stats were off-the-charts bad. I thought I am gonna lose my whole family in the span of 2 weeks. Very low point.

She was there for me during this time. Making me feel good and happy and telling me everything's going to be okay.

Fortunately, everyone in my family got better. The next day, I get the news that this girl has been tested positive for covid. And I was broken. Shit scared of the idea that something bad can happen to her. But, she got better in just 2 days, as in no more serious symptoms. I was with her throughout this period, comforting her. Everything's happening on the phone.

Earlier, she had told me that she liked me but I told her that I don't feel the same. All this changed during this ""low moment"" period.

Things got serious. I don't open up to people and keep to myself. I opened up to her, emotionally. I knew that I've fallen in love with her. It just happened, I didn't plan on it. I didn't want to rush things.

But one day during one of our calls, I told her that I like her. She instantly told me she likes me as well. I was so happy. I even started thinking about a future with her. I mean, she's the first girl in my 7 years of dating that I've actually connected with.

No matter what I'm doing, I always thinking about her in the back of my mind. I see those silly romantic Insta reels, I think about her. I started imagining us in that situation and how good it would be. She became a part of all my future plans. I couldn't wait to talk to her and hear her voice. This has to be love, right? I've never felt such dependency on someone. And, I really like being vulnerable to her, telling her everything, and learning about her.

So, she has this exam in late August. Her career and independence depend on clearing this exam. I've always told her to focus on this and give it her 100%. And, that I am always there when she needs me.

Last night, she told me that she's getting serious about this exam. I loved it. I want nothing more than to see her succeed and be happy. Then she says, for the next 3 months, she doesn't want any distractions in her life, including me. I was bummed but I understand how important clearing this exam is to her. I was not cool with it, but I supported her. Then she says, she's gonna go offline till the exams are over. No calls, no texts, no Whatsapp, no Insta. Nothing. This upset me. I mean, you don't ghost the people you love for 3 months straight. We had a fight/discussion and she told me that she just wants to be friends with me and nothing else.

I don't understand this situation because I've never been in this situation before - constantly missing someone, getting rid of all my stress just by hearing her voice, and all the things I never believed in before.

She became a habit, a ritual for me. And now that it's over, I feel so hollow. I can't focus on work, I can't focus on eating, I don't want to go out, I don't want to do anything that used to make me happy. All my mind is thinking is was I in the wrong? Was I not good enough? I don't like doubting myself this way, but I've lost control over this. I mean, I am so hurt by her actions, and all I can think of is how can I get her back.

She's a genuine and good person. She's been so good to me. I want her to be a part of my life, even if it's just as friends. But I am finding it so hard to deal with all these emotions right now, mainly because I've never felt such attraction and such feelings before.

I know it sounds ridiculous..all of it happening in just 3 months without meeting frequently. I used to think this way too. But something changed when I met her. I've never believed in the idea of soulmates, made fun of people who did believe in it with all my logic and rational arguments. Now, my emotions are winning over the logical side of me. With her, I was so sure that I've found ""the one"" for me.

Tl;dr: She liked me. I didn't. Later, I started getting feelings for her, we got together. Now she just wants to stay friends.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,828644,public,self,M (25).

1st time I've ever talked to this person....

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Hello. Sorry for the late response . I haven’t been on this site in a while and had almost given up on it. I just got a subscription to see the people who responded me and wow...You are absolutely gorgeous &lt;3. I wish you were here in the states though...Would love to meet you. I’m free to talk if you ever feel like it. No rush..I’m very patient.""

Girl: ""Hmmm ok""

Me: ""Good to hear from you! Not sure if you are still interested...I know these dating websites can be exhausting trying to find a mate. If you happen to have second thoughts, we can be friends for now....We can take it slow...Again, I think your gorgeous and would love to get with you. I love your flawless golden skin, beautiful eyes, raven hair, and even your braces. Very cute &lt;3. I’m actually getting ready to go to bed right now but I hope to hear from you again ❤️""

Girl: ""Oh thanks by the way""

HUH??? Like, WTF?.....F me right? Is it me or does she comes off as stuck-up?

I mention this to clarify that I know what type of affection is associated with certain stages of relationships.

I began dating someone. Knowing that they are leaving in 3-4 months to another country as her plan was to do a working holiday for a year. She approached me in this case so she kinda started this brief relationship. I think she wanted it as a FWB situation, but she knew that isn't something that I do.

Things seem to be going well. We are not all that clingy to one another to a point to be uncomfortable, but we both cannot wait to see each other whenever our schedule allows. Even when inconvenient, we will work each other in to our days. We are both adults so we control our own lives. It is clear that she wants to be with me as she shows the right physical affections, where we reach for one another to hold hands, hug, kisses, etc. in public and private. She surprises me with unexpected visits (the good kind, not where you check up on people). Messaging the right amount of back and forth and very playful convos.

Our sexual chemistry is going great. She was not willing to take birth controls before but she went to go get prescription for contraception as she knows I perform better without condoms. She mentioned that she has never let a guy be with her without condoms before but she made some exceptions during some heated moments.

Things are too soon for the L word, but the communication shows great affection for one another and I am not delusional about that part....at least I hope not. Everything points in the right direction telling me that this will lead to a meaningful relationship.

I told her straight out that I would be willing to wait for her as I find her to be the perfect fit for me. I have known her as a friend for a few years now before all this began, but I have always had a crush on her. She didn't feel the same way about me at the beginning, but she began this relationship, so I don't know if that means things had changed and this began at the right time when we actually both felt something for one another.

She told me that she doesn't want me to wait for her and she wants to spend these few months we have together as passionate lovers but let it end at that.

Either I moved too fast, or she was still not over an ex, she backed away and nothing happened. But we remained connected on social media. We've exchanged a few messages since and liked each other's posts. Judging by her social media interactions and replies, it came across to me that she was not interested enough to date me, but was okay having me around and replying to my messages. Having said that, she's ignored a couple of my messages before which ended the conversation at the time.

The last conversation we had over DM, I asked if she wanted to meet again but she ignored my message. I took that as she wasn't interested at all. Fair enough. 

Over time, I won't go into fine details, it came apparent to me that she was interested in someone else. It wasn't a great revelation but I accepted it. And then it also came apparent that he wasn't interested in her. 

Now, it seems like she might be turning her interest back to me, based on her social media activity. I've not responded to her social media posts recently. 

I get the impression that I was a backup or she liked the attention from me and nothing more. I think it was more the former tbh. But right now, I feel like walking away and not looking back.

What I'm not sure about is how to define if a girl is the right one or not. One reason of me being uncertain about this is that I never had a long term relationship. I had 2 relationships before that lasted about 8 or 9 months each. The previous relationship started similar to what's currently developing with the new girl I met. We met online, we are from 2 different continents (so there are some cultural differences), we enjoyed spending time together and became romantically attached. But after some months I felt that the initial exciting starting phase when every everything is new and fun was over and my feelings decreased steadily. So after some time the relationship was ended.

Now I'm wondering how to determine for myself what girl I can see myself with in the long term. We enjoy spending time together and like to see each other. On the other hand there are a few moments that make me think we are not that connected at some points and we don't share lots of mutual interests/hobbies.
