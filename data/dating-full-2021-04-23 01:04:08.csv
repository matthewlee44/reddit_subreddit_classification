I‚Äôve always been a hopeless romantic, I love thinking about dating and the future and sharing experiences with someone who I care about and who cares about me. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a person who needs someone else in order to be happy, but I do have lots of fun when I am with someone. The older I‚Äôve gotten the more I realized how hard relationships actually are. I believe my experiences with dating have taught me a lot, but I also believe they are causing me to be anxious about almost every aspect of the current relationship I‚Äôm in. 

For some context, I met my current boyfriend (18m) on Tinder around a week and a half ago. We matched and hit it off immediately. He asked me to be his girlfriend on the third date, and we‚Äôve been seeing each other every other day consistently since last Tuesday. We always have so much fun together and I feel like I can be completely myself when I‚Äôm around him. We can talk about anything and open up to each other and its great. 

The problem that I‚Äôve been experiencing rcenrly is extreme paranoia and anxiety that he‚Äôs going to leave. Whether that means he‚Äôs going to completely ghost me or decide he doesn‚Äôt like me anymore and break up with me within the next month. It sounds irrational, especially with how well he‚Äôs been treating me (texting me every morning and night, telling me when he can‚Äôt talk for longer periods of time, expressing his admiration and communicating with me about everything going on in his life with his ex/family) and I can‚Äôt help but think its because of the way I‚Äôve been treated for the past 3~ years. 

My last two relationships I was in ended very soon and abruptly. They were both very wishy-washy when it came to wanting to commit to me. My most recent ex also made the mistake of telling me he loved me as soon as we decided to be partners and it had only been about the second date. We got in the routine of saying this to each other and he broke up with me around a month later and said ‚ÄúI love you but I‚Äôm not in love with you.‚Äù This broke me and my perception of love and I feel very sensitive when it comes to that word. I also had a few encounters recently with men on Tinder who will talk to me for a few days (some who will even come to see me) and then completely ghost me out of no where. 

I sincerely don‚Äôt think my boyfriend will do that to me, he has been nothing but sweet and trust worthy and we take turns driving and hour to see each other every other day or so. His last relationship was 7 months and he also met her on Tinder, he told me had the intention of being in a relationship and not to just use it as a hookup app, which I was honestly thrilled to find out.

As I came in for sessions over the course of two weeks we started having nice conversations and getting to know each other. He would text me about books and articles we had discussed and told me to he wanted to hear my thoughts on them. Toward the end of the study I started noticing (what I think was?) flirty banter between us. It was subtle but he was doing his job in a professional work setting. (He asked me questions about my life, remembered things I told him, he seemed nervous around me, playfulness and teasing, etc).

I'll be 30 in a couple of months I know that hitting that milestone of 30 definitely changes everything. I just want to make sure that I'm doing all I can to set myself up for success. I've also been thinking about my goals and what I want to accomplish with dating, as I really view it as an avenue for personal development and knowing myself better.

I've been taking stock of what I bring to the table, so my strengths and weaknesses. As for strengths, I'd definitely say I have height on my side, I'm 6'1"" and I'm relatively built at a lean and muscular 200 lbs. I can say I'm relatively well-spoken, I did tend to be a bit verbose in the past because of anxiety, but I am doing my best every day to minimize that. I make a decent income, nothing crazy - I bring in 75k from my regular line of work and I'll probably net an extra 20k from side projects, so maybe around 95k. I am relatively self-disciplined, which makes following through on things easier than not. I also don't do drugs or drink too much. Overall,I think I have a high growth potential as a person but it will take time to hit it, which may not even be till my 40s.

Now my weaknesses, which are many, haha. I have/had terrible social anxiety as an adolescent/young adult. I've sort of grown out of over the past couple of years by personal development and increasing my self-esteem/self-efficacy but it's still there especially with attractive women. I don't have much dating experience. I hooked up a few times in college and afterwards in my early to mid 20s but I've never had a girlfriend. I know I'll be competing with guys who have much more dating experience and the women I'll be seeing will have had boyfriends and such, so I know I don't have a lot of room for error there. And also I unfortunately still live with my mom, though I plan on moving out soon. My 20s were not kind to me financially and I did my best to pay off my debt while living here. It was good I was able to support her financially and most importantly, emotionally - but it did not help my social or dating life.

I have a few timelines in my head as of where I'd like things to be at certain ages. I did eventually want to start a family but I know time is not on my side. I was wondering if it's good to just have a sort of hookup/casual dating phase just to ""get my feet wet"" so to speak and then start looking for ""marriage material"" or just go ahead and start dating with the intention for a LTR. I'm just trying to think of the most effective way to maximize my time and effort doing it.

So yeah, I'm just looking for advice so by the time quarantine is over, I'll be locked and loaded ready to just go for it.

I never send anything crass or sexual. I don't not put effort into it either with something like: ""Hi"", ""Hey, how's it going?"". I will pick something in a bio; comment something reasonably funny about a picture; or, if there's nothing to work with, ask a random question about something totally unique.

Usually met with silence (which is kinda normal for an average guy). Or simply an un-match. I gave a nice compliment yesterday and immediately was gone, haha.

Do women not appreciate being approached gently? With respect and dignity? Because it doesn't seem to work for me! I honestly lack the wit for one liners; I shudder at the idea of making puns from someone's name; and I am too well raised to be rude/sexual to a stranger.

I didnt realize he was sleeping with other people and despite being such a horndog ( he also watches quite a lot of porn) it seems like I was the only girl he couldn‚Äôt get hard for. It was a bit strange because he was the one who sexually pursued me pretty agressively and he assured me it wasn‚Äôt me, but I didnt understand because hes clearly not having this problem with other girls. That was also my only sexual experience ever so it was a huge blow to the ego. I ended it with him a while back because I was trying to be understanding with his problem but I didnt realize he was sleeping with other people.  Then shortly after that started talking to/ dating ( we didnt even kiss so im not sure if I can say we were ""dating"") another guy. He was so sweet and messaged me every day and we went on some really fun dates.  I was so excited talking to him, he was one of the most attractive guys ive ever talked to, but he ghosted me after a month. He didnt even do a slow fade, it was just consistent communication for a month and then disappeared. He‚Äôs the only guy ive honestly straight up cried for. Ive talked to plenty of people ( by talked I mean online or maybe one date but nothing after that)  and had feelings for them but never cried after a talking stage. My dating experience has been really conflicting. I can get dates, but nothing ever comes out of it. The most that ive done was with one person who couldn‚Äôt even get it up. I thought I was a decent looking girl and had no reason to believe I was ugly,   but my self esteem has taken a huge hit with dating and I‚Äôm kind of a little terrified of starting again because I'm not sure I can take feeling so unwanted by another person. I feel so strange embracing my sexuality due to this because I feel like I just dont have any sexual appeal and it would be extremely cringe to wear lingerie or initiate sex or post sexy photos online. I know dating requires thick skin, but I feel that it's still fairly easy for most women my age. You dont neccesarily feel sexually unattractive and after a few bad apples, it tends to work itself out. I‚Äôm not sure why I have such different experiences from most girls. Ive never been able to relate to being approached or asked out in person that really very very rarely happens for me and online dating has been a garbage fire for me.

But sometimes i think a lot of people may not know many things yet and i was wondering if we could use this space to share these little knowledges that made us grow on dating life. 

So, is there anything you guys feel like it not always an obvious thing but its a must for people to be aware on how to act/not to act/avoid on (online or not) dating/flirting/trying to get a relationship? 

I hope we can all help each other here.

This girl (20) and i (m 22)  have been texting for a couple weeks now, super flirty at first, said all the right things about wanting to meet up, even said she wanted to take a ‚Äúnap‚Äù with me. 

However she‚Äôs been super flakey about meeting up, keeps saying she‚Äôs busy cause of school work etc. Said she was ‚Äúbusy‚Äù this Saturday and working Sunday but that she‚Äôs not working next Saturday. At the advice of my friend, I did not reply to her for almost 24 hours, after which I replied how I was sooo ‚Äúbusy‚Äù and that she should hit me up the next day. 

Hilariously, she plays the same game, waiting exactly 24 hours to hit back! We talk back and forth, she asks what I‚Äôm doing I say chilling in bed, wish she was there with me, to which she responds she wishes she was and to ‚Äúinvite‚Äù her. She says how drunk she is and I say ‚Äúnext Saturday. U and me. We‚Äôre gonna get RIPPED hahahaha‚Äù to which she replay ‚Äúhahahaha yes I wanna‚Äù 

See a pattern here? All the right things being said but I still feel like she adds the ‚ÄúI wanna‚Äù in there cause she‚Äôs still not all in. Despite saying she‚Äôs off. Why can‚Äôt she ever just give a straight up yes?? 

Met a girl at the yankees game last night, took a pic with her and put it on my IG story to make her jealous earlier today. She saw it but didn‚Äôt unfollow or anything.

What do you guys think about this whole  situation?? Does it sound like she‚Äôs gonna meet up next week?? Why does she say how excited she is to meet and all this sexual flirty shit and then push it off??

I am just after a women's point of view. Any help would be much appreciated. I hope its okay that I am posting this in here, but I have done so as I see this sub is a very friendly and non-judgemental place. Most subs are full of sexist men and women, but this seems like a really supportive place.

I (26m) recently started talking to a girl (23f) a few months ago, and I really started to like her, and I honestly think she's pretty great, which is unusual for me, as I seem to meet a lot of fake people, and this person was very real and genuine I feel. I am naturally a very confident, nice and happy person, but unfortunately around that same time I started to become very anxious (unrelated to her) which made it really hard for me to communicate with her. I would often think the convo was going badly, when in reality it was going fine or quite well. This sucks as over the last year I was (extremely confident) and worked on myself so I wouldn't be nervous.

Anyway, we had met a couple of times, and it was all going smoothly, but on this date, I acted very nervous and acted out like a boy, rather than a confident calm man that I usually am. It pissed me off as I could tell the date didn't go as well as it could have (or as they usually would with me). We didn't talk for the next 2 weeks, however I hit her up, and was surprised she replied. She said she is going out with her friends to an event, and I said I would come. However unfortunately the day of I started to get quite nervous again, and didn't want to be nervous around her again, as that's not who I am, and not who I want people to get to know me as. I messaged a friend of hers who was also going, who is a good friend of mine, and said I couldn't come, but I didn't say anything to the girl I was interested in... I said nothing... Nothing at all. I don't know why, for the first time in my life I just didn't know what to do. I am a bloody man for christ sake. That was a month ago.

At the time I thought to myself: ""I will just go away for the time being, get myself back to my normal self, get myself right, and then talk to her, and everything will be fine."" But now that I am not so nervous anymore, I am starting to see that what I did was 'ghosting'. Like why would anyone want to talk to someone later on down the track, who ghosted them? Thats just rude and immature to ghost someone... But I wasn't trying to be that way. She is a really happy, relaxed and normal person, and those are great qualities and the things I like about her.

I knew IF it was to ever work, I needed to be a confident person again.

She hasn't contacted me since, but I think that's because what I did was technically rude? When it wasn't meant in any malice. She also hasn't unfollowed me on socials, so I can't tell if I am just overreacting or not.

Also I think another bad thing is, I was nervous so I put her on a pedestal.

So my questions are:

\- Could what I did be seen as ghosting? Or am I just overreacting?

\- Am I better off contacting her now and explaining the situation? (""I wasn't deliberately ghosting, I am not like that, I was just in a tough spot, and trying to do the right thing long term."").

\- Or should I just leave it for the time being until I am fully confident and message her then? (Or is that worse, as instead of ""ghosting"" for a short period, its more like 6 months or something.)

\- What do I say, do I just be totally honest?

I am very interested in her, but just feel like I am not ready yet.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much everyone, you're all amazing!

It was a very hard and confusing time as he had made such an effort moving to my country to be with me, and that didn‚Äôt stop him from doing what he did. Not to mention the girl knew I was in the picture, she knew he was living with me, she didn‚Äôt give two shits though as long as she was showing off her body for some sort of attention or validation (it was very obvious she wasn‚Äôt really into him when I saw their conversations). 
I never confronted her and she had every possibility to message me and let me know what he was saying behind my back to her. She would flirt and send him inappropriate snaps that he would somehow save that I eventually found in a vault app. 
There‚Äôs a lot more information that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing, but three years on I am still with him. Every single day I still think about it. Everyday I remember the pain, the hurt, the confusion and I am still over analyzing everything; trying to fit the puzzle pieces as to why he felt the need to be obsessed with her when at the same time he was saying loving things to me. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love him to the moon and back and the past year and a half he took it upon himself to change and be committed to me and only me.

I told him if he has hurt 5 girls this past year he has a major problem. Yet he blamed the girls saying they don't communicate.

I told him that you don't have to but dating them basically exclusively for 2 months is leading them on and hurts girls.

So until a few weeks ago I thought that I was Asexual because I had never had a crush on anyone before. Keep in mind I am in the 10th grade so I thought that if I was anything other than asexual then I would have felt something by then. Anyway though I have released that this is not the case. From what I can tell so far I am actually straight. 

¬†¬†¬†¬† So a few weeks ago me and my friends who I will call Ben, Chloe, and Tyler all went to see Godzilla vs Kong. Ben i had seen somewhat recently but Chloe and Tyler it had been a while due to COVID-19. Lets just say I was excited to see them. 

¬†¬†¬†¬† Me and Chloe got along really well. We had just gotten back in touch a few months earlier when we found each other on Discord. When I walked into the theater Chloe was already there. We chatted a bit and I was really starting to notice that she was actually very cute. I had never thought of her as anything but a friend before hand.¬† When Ben and Tyler got there with the tickets they asked who wanted to sit by who. Chloe immediately yelled ""Im sitting by Ryan."" Ben then handed us our tickets. I sat in between Ben and Chloe.

¬†¬†¬†¬† There where some moments where I could hardly watch the movie because I just couldn't get her off my mind, but was mostly able to enjoy the movie. After a scene jammed packed with action she randomly high fived me. During the final battle Ben was upset at us because of how crazy excited by the action we were.

¬†¬†¬†¬† After the movie ended and we all got out of our seat and were about to walk towards the exit I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was Chloe. She then hugged me and I hugged her back. We went out to the lobby where her mom was waiting to pick her up. Her mom agreed to take a photo of the 4 of us. Chloe put her arm around me. Now i wanted to do the same but I didn't want to make it obvious that I liked her so I also put my other arm around Ben. As Chloe was about to go the two of us hugged one more time. No she didn't hug anyone else.

¬†¬†¬†¬† That night the four of us hoped on a discord call. Tyler greeted the 3 of us with a simple ""Whats up Ben, Whats up Love Birds"" Both of us were pretty pissed off at what he said. We both denied that we were dating (which we aren't) and denied that we liked each other in that way. Me and Chloe can talk for like hours if we are aloud to. We once spoke for 8 hours of the day. I am realizing that I like this girl and that I want to be with her. 

¬†¬†¬†¬† I know it may pretty obvious that she likes me back with the hugging and insisting that she sits by me, but I am too afraid to tell her how I feel because of that 2% chance that she only likes me as a friend and that I that I will make things awkward between us. The two of us are very close and have similar interests and like the exact same personality.

Things were going quite well until about a week ago, when he went off the grid for a few days....for very legitimate reasons. He told me what was going on (personal, family things) I have no reason to suspect otherwise.

He re-surfaced a few days later, but without the same rapport and vibe that we had prior to his break. But, we were still in communication, I just took it that he would probably just need some time to return to ""normal"" after a likely emotionally taxing few days.

I mentioned to him yesterday that we needed to get together. So, he asked me how my schedule was for Friday. I told him. I was hoping to see him today, actually, but I was fine to wait till Friday if that was what would work for his schedule. We didn't make plans for Friday, but continued to talk.

So, then, late afternoon, he suggests that we could go out tonight instead. Which that's what I was hoping for yes, but I would have been hoping for a little bit more notice. He mentioned that he would need for it to be an early night due to lack of sleep the night before. Well, by the time I could have gotten showered, ready, etc., I didn't really want to have a quickie date and be rushed and him be tired and so on. I'd rather just wait till tomorrow, when he would feel fresh, we'd have more time, and so on. So, I told him no, that he should get some rest, I made up something about me feeling kind of tired too so he wouldn't feel bad; he was very disappointed. At one point he says to me, ""After all that, you don't want to go out after all?"" Which isn't what I said. He kept insisting he would be fine, but he understood.

So, finally, before I go to bed, I ask him when he works tomorrow, what his plans are....he then tells me that he probably won't be able to see me tomorrow. He won't know till in the morning, but he probably had a lot of work to catch up on. And, he has plans tomorrow evening.

Just the fact that....he has the opportunity to see me, and doesn't want to.....well, that's what led to the physical reaction of being sick to my stomach.

Their accounts have been based on a number of things from fitness to comedy to cooking. 

All of these girls have been so focused on constantly reminding me about their social media presence. I understand they are proud at being successful at something, it‚Äôs a part of their life and at first it‚Äôs great to see someone driven at building something but when they mention it everyday it slowly becomes a ‚Äúlook how great I am‚Äù thing and gets very tiring as it dominates their conversations.

I‚Äôve picked up another commonality with these people that they seem to think everyone likes them or finds them attractive because strangers on the internet find them engaging and they x thousand likes on their posts or they get x thousand of DMs from people trying to slide in, when in reality they are a little bland/basic (subjective to my perception).

Maybe this is a venting post rather than a question but I‚Äôm pretty sick of the value people place on magic internet points and the fact they‚Äôd rather constantly boast about it to stroke their own egos vs. have a different conversation.

But I kind of need to get this off my chest. 

I recently went on a date with a girl with a tick issue, could be Terrets I don‚Äôt know she was in the middle of being diagnosed. To explain met on a dating app. We hit it off because I was being my natural autistic self this is not a pun either. I am on the spectrum, but that I feel only plays a little into this issue. 

So anyway we were talking for about a month. We talked about a lot from sex, to politics to viewpoints, personal stuff. we even started snap chatting each other every day. We were planning our date out and everything because time related issues we couldn‚Äôt meet up. I was always double checking and triple checking with her on things because well I‚Äôm a strong built person and while she was the same height as me I could easily lift her. She knew I worked out and stuff and I am of the opinion that girls should be given the comfort of safety before anything else during the date.Then she told me some news that was kinda a kick in the dick. 

There was another guy she was talking to for a while and thought nothing was going to happen but she told him about me and he got jealous and so our date was to test the waters to see which guy she wanted to go with. She never had this happen before is what she told me. So when We finally we worked up the courage to go on this date for Chinese. Me being autistic dumb ass was uncomfortable giving physical touch to someone who wanted a hug who I technically just met face to face for the first time. So I was hesitant for giving a hug. We couldn‚Äôt go into the restaurant cause COVID. So we ate in her car. It‚Äôs important to note she was having ticks this whole time but I didn‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs not the issue that bothered me. Because to me everyone has baggage, but I was too entranced by her to care.

I ordered basically finger food because I was too nervous to even eat. (Being my first date in years)while she ordered rice and noodles. At this point the date was going fine we laughed and talked and it was going good from my perspective. 

But when we had to eat in her car she from what I could tell was getting upset because she couldn‚Äôt pick up her food. Because she didn‚Äôt have a table. Which made her tick more. 

So I took initiative and hand fed her. Now before someone says I babied her or something she didn‚Äôt mind she thought it was sweet actually even telling me this. After a few dozen bites that felt like they took forever to get down for her and her being nervous we went bowling.

We drove my car which I thought was messy due to me having to replace parts etc. but her car felt the exact same in cleanliness if not just a little more clean than mine. We listened to her music my suggestion because I wanted her to be as comfortable as possible.

She was actually really good at bowling, way better than me and I cheered and supported her the whole time. Even during her ticks and kept ensuring her I was having a good time and didn‚Äôt care about the ticks. 

She then ordered a large lemonade drink that she then kept trying to pour on herself but not the the extreme as was in her car.

After 3 games we drove back to her car we left at the restaurant and sat and talked for 2 hours.

During those 2 hours she started to have worse and worse ticks again this time trying to pour her drink all over herself so I took her drink and held it for while she drank from a straw.

I held her hand because that‚Äôs what I thought I would want if I was in her shoes and told her that I didn‚Äôt care about her issues or any of that. I told her if we worked out I would be there for her even if what ever she had was worse than what the doctors thought. 

I did that for a while and made circles with my thumb because that‚Äôs what I do when I‚Äôm nervous. When I felt she was uncomfortable I let go immediately as soon as I realized it. 

I complimented her on her ticks every time she started to feel embarrassed or scared and said I enjoyed them because it was well her. I don‚Äôt know where I messed up at really. I did comment on a few of her ticks sarcastically but not in like jabs or making fun of her. I even told her that and tried to make myself as clear as possible.

We talked about random stuff a little more she then left, I walked her to her car gave her a good night hug because that‚Äôs what she wanted. Then we parted ways.

Regardless she chose the other guy that Sunday night over me. Our date was just that Friday... and I told her I wasn‚Äôt going to fight for her attention and stuff because that was her choice and said the other guy must have been special. I was willing to fight for her heart but when the lady makes her mind up I won‚Äôt fight it. So She left me thinking about her and thinking what could have been and I‚Äôve been having a rough couple weeks since then.

But I caring on, even when it feels like for every step I take. It‚Äôs two backwards as well.

Sorry for any misspellings, or grammar I work nights so I get scatter brained. I tried to retell everything that happened as best I could to my memory and tried to be clear with my actions. Because I really don‚Äôt know how to feel about this whole thing or if I‚Äôm at fault any for my actions. 

TL;DR: went on a date with a girl with a neurological issue, she had ticks and spasm that led to me having to hand feed her, and kind of reinsure her it was okay. I tried to make her feel as comfortable as possible and watched my actions because I didn‚Äôt want to make a wrong impression. I even reinstated this through vocal questions asking her if it was okay. Because I rather not get ‚Äúme too moved‚Äù by accident for mis interpreting a social queue for being autistic spazz.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,732127,public,self,Going on a date with a girl with A disability,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwrstb/going_on_a_date_with_a_girl_with_a_disability/,all_ads,6,,

As far as I have seen, most of the questions revolve around same things. Some are exhausted of trying on online dating apps, or not finding a good partner, or having a bad dating experience in general.

Here are a few pieces of enlightenment:

* **Why so desperate?**: I have seen many posts of 16-20 yr old school/college kids fed up or their dating life. There's enough time for all of you to find a partner. Life has just started. So relax. ***Don't go hunting for your partner***. Good girls/boys aren't going to finish. It's not a limited sale!! 
* **Go Slow**: Most of the bad experiences are because of non-compatibility. And then I see posts asking for advice for a person you like but have met only once/twice. Slow down! Let things grow naturally. It takes time to know a person - what's their goal, their outlook for various things. Once you know a person, then you love a person! And lesser the chance of having a bad experience.
* **Friend-circle**: Sometimes you don't need a relationship, but a person to talk to. So, have a group of friends (not just social media connections) who know you and you can talk to them about anything. They'll know what's good for you if you are ever confused.

So this is something that I really want to stress. Sometimes we like to vent on reddit or to friends, strangers whoever about an issue we have with our partner or someone we have gone on a few dates with.  Yet a lot of the time we fail to have an open and honest communication with the person themselves. I wanted to share two experiences I've had where honest communication( that has either been initiated by me or the other person in the scenario) has really helped me and the other party move forward.

  
A few years ago I met a girl on tinder who i really liked. We spoke almost everyday for a fourth months and eventually we went on a few really awesome dates. At one stage, thinks were really good between us, we would message non-stop, she planned one date herself and she even told me she wanted a relationship with me. But then after a while and a few more dates, things would begin to fade out from her side of things. She would take days to respond to my texts(whilst I saw she was posting other stuff on social media), when she would respond she would become very dry and not ask me any questions back and she bailed on a date once. During this whole fade out period my anxiety levels went through the roof, because I felt left in the dark and didn't know what to do next.   


At first I tried to 'play it cool' and act like I didn't care. But the longer things progressed; the worst thing's got for me, I struggled to sleep and eat, I was coming to work late. I was venting to my best friend non-stop. I was making posts on reddit about this. And it wasn't until someone suggested that I should tell this girl how I was actually feeling that really got to me. Eventually, I summoned the courage to message this person. I told her it was awesome to have met her, I reassured her that  I was cool with the idea of her not being interested in me anymore, and that she could always feel comfortable telling me how she really felt about me. It was through having an honest conversation with them, that I was able to figure out how she was actually feeling. Whilst I still regret to this day, not having a conversation with her about it earlier (when I first felt there feelings began to fade out), I feel like that gave both of us a chance to move on, and we were able to remain friends.    


Now about a month ago I faced a similar situation with another person but this time roles were reversed. I knew someone for 3 weeks and we we had a first date that was nice - but I just didn't feel that she was right for me. After our date they were texting me and I was struggling to communicate to them that I didn't see them in a romantic way. I made a lame excuse that I was 'busy with study'(something I'm not proud of) when they asked if i was free one week. I was scared to hurt them because I did like them as a friend. And then they send me a similar message letting me know that they felt anxious and insecure in figuring whether I felt I wanted to see them again; and they would prefer to just have an honest conversation with me about this. So I ended up telling them how i was actually feeling and that I wish I told her the truth straightaway, and we ended up sincerely ending things .  


Thanks for listening to my vent everyone. Offcourse, there are times when I think we should move on rather than addressing an honestly an issue with someone. No ones anyone a full explanation of how they are feeling. And we should always be mindful about the other persons perspective and their side of the story .

I put friends in quotations because I don't even know what our relationship is anymore. To give some back story a couple of months ago I and (f) became closer with both having an interest in each other and eventually, I asked her out. She sounded really up for the idea but as soon as I planned some dates.... she found excuses as to not to. I eventually confronted her about this and she said that she really doesn't want a relationship as she's not ready and apologized for leading me on and wanted to stay friends. I was cool with that until recently I've noticed some weird behavior. First of all, I can tell she is still nervous when texting me with many awkward phrases in texts as well as in person. We don't even talk at social gatherings and it just gets really awkward unless we are in private talking. She also has brought up the topic of sex in the past couple of times I've talked with her and its really throwing me for a loop things like ""This guy wanted to hook up with me at a party"" and even divulging the fact that one of the friends in our friend group asked if she wanted to hook up. But the biggest thing she said happened yesterday when she started talking about how she really wanted to fuck some guy at a party. This topic occurred randomly in a car and it was very weird. She kept going on about how he looked like he could fuck good and ect. She then mentioned how she shouldn't really be talking about this since I had a crush on her. Awkwardness followed. My thing is I'm finally getting over her and wanting a normal friendship but these incidences are kind of reopening a wound I have. So my question is: Is she trying to say something to me? My gut is telling me something is up and I honestly have no clue what. Is she playing games? Using me for attention? Idk.I'm really tired of this and don't need this in my life. I asked myself if all the stars aligned and she wanted to get back to dating I would do it within a heartbeat. I understand this is not the case but maybe I'm still holding on to something I need to let go of. Or there is more to this story.

We talk about meeting in person next month.

But lately I've noticed things have changed, like he just responds with one word texts or emojis. He doesn't put any effort into the conversation like he did before. I thought, well he's not interested and kind of stopped talking to him, but when I do that he texts me again asking me how am I doing and sending memes and so on. Then he does the same thing again, sends one word replies.

We talk again about meeting in person and doing a call this next week, so I guess he's interested? 

I'm just confused, to be honest. Because he seems interested, but then he does that thing. 

I've been also trying to keep my options open, and kept talking to more people, but it feels wrong somehow. And it's exhausting... 

I'm a bit insecure, but I don't want to feel bad because someone I haven't even met has changed.
