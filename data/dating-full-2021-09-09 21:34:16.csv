They say ‚Äúfriendship is more special‚Äù.

THEREFORE, wouldn‚Äôt a ‚Äúromantic‚Äù relationship be being with someone you care LESS about? Especially if you can‚Äôt trust them to tell them certain things, things that you CAN TELL FRIENDS???

But if sex is ‚ÄúSO SPECIAL‚Äù, isn‚Äôt it something you‚Äôd WANT to have with your best friend? 

Should sex just be SEPARATED from any emotional connections? Isn‚Äôt it kind of NATURALLY emotionally bonding? 

Why is it that ‚Äúsex with friends can ruin the friendship‚Äù, if sex is THE ULTIMATE BONDING EXPERIENCE? Is it because they‚Äôre not REALLY your best friend? OR, you‚Äôre just SCARED of getting closer, fearing you‚Äôll have MORE TO LOSE if the relationship ends?

i'll try to keep this as straightforward as possible but there is so much to unpack. i apologise if the story diverts from the main topic from time to time as i have a bad habit of going on side tangents.

my best friend ""kai"" (20M) and i (19F) share mutual romantic feelings towards each other. we've known each other for quite some time, and through the course of our friendship, we've gone through a lot together. what we share has the notion of ""more than friends, less than lovers"" as we do things that couples would do, but haven't established any sort of official relationship. 

to give some context, kai is a very private and withdrawn person. he's very mature is not affectionate in the least and hates being touched. the way he shows his love is by doing things like cooking my favourite food, doing my laundry when i stay at his place, looking out for me when i do dumb things, etc. he's got a very sharp tongue and is often quite blunt with me so you can't expect any sort of honey from his lips. 

i, on the other hand, am on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. i show my love through physical touch and words of affirmation. from time to time, i do things like cleaning up his room, buying him food when he's hungry (i'd cook it myself but i am a klutz and cannot be trusted in the kitchen at all) and doing things he enjoys to do like watching his favourite shows and learning to play his favourite games with him. 

another thing to note about him is that he hates receiving things and would rather be continuously giving, so when i offer to do something for him whether or not it involves money or the simple act of going with what he has in mind, he often shoots me down and i end up relenting and not going through with him for fear it will upset him. as a result, i feel like the whole ""relationship"" for lack of a better word has been about me and it has been tearing me down. 

i don't want him to feel like it's his responsibility to make me happy and want him to know that i want to make him happy as well. he claims that seeing me happy is enough for him and the smallest things are enough so i shouldn't try to go out of my way to do something for him. but i want him to know that he shouldn't just be content with the bare minimum and that he deserves so much more. especially because he gives his all for everyone in his life.

It fits with the story so I have to add it. I don't have the best relationship with my parents. They've always neglected me and put themselves over me. Therefore, I've always been struggling really badly financially like to the point where I'm scared I could be homeless one day. I don't have a car, I have to rode my bike everywhere I go. And because I struggle financially I can't save up for a car, I can't even pay all of my expenses atm. I've tried to find a good job here none of them will hire me nor lots of people here. The most I can make is like 1100/mo and my expenses are about $1200. Because I have to work so much I did bad In school and I can't go back unless I pay for it. So I work at this restaurant and I left for a little bit because I got what I thought was a better job but it ended up being a worse job. So I left that job and got a glass job but that job only wanted me temporarily and didn't tell me that so I went back to the restaurant. There's this girl I work with at this restaurant and she's gorgeous and amazing and one of the girls I've had the biggest crushes on in my life. And before I left I could tell she liked me too. Even my friends who get hella girls and the other waitresses thinks she liked me and thought we were going to get together. I didn't get many opportunities to talk to her though because it's always busy there. So when I come back it's still going well, I'm talking to her and getting good reactions and making her laugh. I was talking to her and we were near another co worker and he looked angry I was talking to her but also he was having a terrible day so I just figured it was that. But I was talking to my friends I was playing video games with and they had mentioned she went on some dates with that guy that was getting mad I was talking to her. So I talked to her about it and she said she's not dating him they just had a couple dates and have been talking but nothing serious and I'm welcome to keep talking to her and I'm not crossing any boundaries. So I been snapchatting her and we talked for a whole day and she responded a lot and made quick responses too for the most part and I told her if she ever wants to hang out outside of work to let me know and she said it sounded great and she will let me know. All the way up to this morning where she said she was going to class. I told her to have a great day at school and told her I was going to work and told her about how I got called in. She left that on read, which is completely ok. She's at school and busy. I got to thinking though maybe she thinks I'm a bum and a loser cause I have no money and no car and am not in school and the other guy is in college. So I told her that if my military recruiter doesn't come through (because I got disqualified for failing hearing test 3 years ago and have to wait to see if I'm allowed to re try) that I'd try to go into law enforcement. Therefore she sees I'm striving for success and have a mission. She left that on read also.

2 days later I caved and got his number off the work phone and texted him asking what his name was because I really wanted to follow that up,  We chatted a bit over the course of the week but it wasn't like super non stop texting it was just here and there chit chat,  4 days later he texts me to ask if I'm working and comes in but can't stay and talk because I had a line-up of customers so when he left I texted him laughing about his timing,  he said well I live close would you like to pop by for your work break today I'd like to see you. 

Keep in mind he had never seen me without my mask on. 

I screamed internally not knowing what to do but eventually decided I felt safe enough to take the plunge and go to his house. 

We talked for the entire duration of my break and he didn't stop smiling and neither did I and the conversation was going really well,  he had said he's not one for texting and he's a bit old achool when it comes to technology and he was more comfortable talking in person,  he said he had wanted to ask me out for a drink within the first few times of seeing me but didn't because he didn't want to be one of

Next day he texted to say he had to cancel because he had to get ready for a sports camp and that was a week ago and he hasn't been into my store at all which is out of character considering what we sell so he may be out of town. 

Am I worrying that he's lost interest or is this guy just old school and wants to do things in person? I don't want to be the type of girl that texts him a lot because he seems really busy in his life right now and already said he's not great with texting.

They‚Äôll also help you on the 4th or 5th or 6th date too.

1 - Arrive 10 minutes early

Or at least be on time.

2 - Don‚Äôt Talk About Your Ex

They‚Äôre in the past. And your focus should be on the present.

3 - What She Feels, She Thinks

You want her to think good thoughts about you. So make sure she has fun and feels comfortable.

4 - Take Her To At Least 2 Places

This gives her the emotional experience of going on more than one date with you.

5 - Let Her Touch You First

When she likes you, she‚Äôll touch you. Then you‚Äôll know.

These 5 tips will put you in the best position to be successful on your dates.

The most important of these is what she feels (emotionally) when she‚Äôs with you, is what she feels when she thinks about you when you‚Äôre not with her. So make sure she has a great time when you‚Äôre together. She‚Äôll be thinking about having another great time when she sees you again.

Today he mentioned going out on a date, but then asked if we can have a phone conversation first since we never talked on the phone before.

I got really excited because I think hes really cute and can't wait to get to know him, but I was in the middle of fixing dinner and was very hungry. So I asked if I can call him in just 15 minutes and he said yes.

So I rushed and got my food together and ate as fast as I could not to keep him waiting. My roommate even asked if we could watch a movie together we have been wanting to watch, but I told her not tonight so I could talk to him.

Anyways after 15 minutes I called him and he didn't pick up. But then he called me a minute later and said hes playing xbox with his freinds and what time I'm going to sleep. But I really didn't know because every night is different. So he asked if he could call me 45 minutes later. 

But I said since hes going to play xbox with his friends if I could go watch the movie with my roommate and we can chat tomorrow night. But then he said what about tomorrow day but I told him I was working during the day. So I asked about tomorrow evening again and then he said he already has plans tomrrow evening. So I just told to text me and we'll plan some other time.

But I don't know how dont why he couldn't just wait for me 15 minutes and we can chat. Why couldn't he tell his friends he was about to talk to me like I did my friend. I felt bad he rather play video games than chat with me.

But since then, I've been studying with a friend of mine much more (both in the same class in med school, so lots of studying). I eventually developed a big crush on her, much more than ever with my previous gf. Eventually told her, but she wanted to stay friends and not feel like a rebound. Totally respect that and was okay with it. 

Just decided to work on myself by getting in the gym a lot and studying extremely hard. We stayed good friends and still studied together. I always felt a special connection with her though. We make each other laugh a ton, lots of smiling together, great conversation, etc. She also has the cutest laugh and is so damn sexy. When one of us is away for a weekend, we constantly text/snap each other. 

Anyways, quite a few weeks after she kinda friend zoned me, we hung out, just ourselves. Nothing crazy happened but I went for the ol' reach around which worked in my favor and wow...the dopamine levels were high lol. More than anything I felt in the 6 years with the past gf. Even just holding hands with her now is amazing. 

We're going on our first official date next week and we're both excited.

It feels like a mindfuck because if I back out it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm hiding something and like proving his point. But if I go, it‚Äôs like ewww he gives me jerk vibes. And what if he‚Äôs offended by my body when he gets there? Again it was on full display in my photos, I have nothing to hide.

One day I had matched with a girl and talked a little bit here and there. After a few texts I need up trading Snapchat‚Äôs and we talked for awhile and made things officially a few months later . There was many red flags in the beginning as anybody who‚Äôs experienced relationships like this already knows . From there being a time she had posted a friend (male) she was hanging out with and complimenting his eyes in a not so friend like position. This relationship went on for a while with us having occasional arguments like me not being able too open up too her so quickly because of my past experiences and child hood and little things like schedules. The first breakup was within 5 months of the relationship  because at that moment I had known I had personally been having issues with financial problems and it was causing me too be in lousy moods which I admit too being wrong for that and so we talked things through one day when she came too pick her belongings up and we got back together. 


Then we continued for another month or so and it was New Year‚Äôs Eve we got into and argument about something dumb and she got her things and left at that time I had a hard head and didn‚Äôt want too apologize but that was my mistake again being inexperienced  ,but she had started talking too one of her friends brothers and started flaunting it in my face within the time of the break (1 week) and she was having a hard time picking between me and him ,but I was opening up a little during this time and promising change in areas where I had messed up ,which had happened when we got back together but one thing I had noticed she would create arguments over little things that wouldn‚Äôt make sense and would be disrespectful too me in front of friends when I was being nice ,and at this time I had been changing in all the areas I could , we had gone good for a week or so and she brought up a situation where she had too move in with her aunt that she had problems with in the past ,me caring for her situation I gave her advice ,telling her that it could be good for her financially in the beginning but who‚Äôs too say the problems don‚Äôt comeback and she started yelling at me ignoring my advice ,so I already knew where her mind was and I supported her decision. She then had told me it would be hard to see each other and do things privately. This is where I started to question somethings , and I asked why ,she responded with unusual answer. This was near Valentine‚Äôs Day and I had something planned with her for the day too atleast give her an experience that she hasn‚Äôt had . she decided last minute to change up the plans and go on road trip with her aunt too New York ,I got a little mad because it was the day before Valentine‚Äôs Day and she told me hours away . 


So she had came over late at night 2 days after unexpectedly expecting something big but I didn‚Äôt have anything big planned because where I wanted too go had been closed . She seemed distant and argumentative when she came over and my sister had noticed her temper tantrum but we went too my room and spent the night watching movies . After this she had been distant for a whole week ,I‚Äôd try too call she wouldn‚Äôt answer or she‚Äôd pretend too be sick or argue . I kept calling too see what was wrong if I could help but she wasn‚Äôt allowing me too help her ,she broke up with me a week after and I was devastated because through the whole month I had started too emotionally open up and show that I had changed but I had been in contact with trying too reconcile and she kept conversations short but something had been going on within the last month so when she had started changing her moods and attitude towards me I wanted too look at her social media just too reassure that maybe it was just me but there had been a guy in her face book comments complimenting her and I had asked numerous times about this person she had just said it‚Äôs a random guy who won‚Äôt leave her alone and when prompted her too delete him she said no .

So later after the 3rd break up I find her relationship status had not changed and she had a new relationship date that wasn‚Äôt ours . I saw her having back fourth playful conversations with this guy and then soon too my dismay she had been cheating .I was devastated too the point I‚Äôd get back from work and spend an hour crying my eyes out ,this last 3 weeks and within those weeks she had gotten engaged and married a week later this had all happened in a short timing .

I added him on FB and he accepted right away. I thought ‚Äúok, cool!‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and then I messaged him asking if he was down to hangout. My friend said it was a bad idea. He hadn‚Äôt seen the message so I deleted it. 
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶a couple hours later he said he had just got back from the movies and still saw it but didn‚Äôt know what I had put. So I fess up and I tell him I asked if he wanted to hang.

Things have been awkward at work since. So yeah, let‚Äôs just take in how cringy that was‚Ä¶..I clearly was lonely and probably desperate.

Talked with a man online (met through mutual acquaintances) for a month. He asked me out I said yes. We spent maybe 6 hours plus together that day doing an activity we enjoy. 
I saw him some days later for a few hours then again another day for dinner. 
He had mentioned several places to eat and after the fact he had mentioned one of the places we didn‚Äôt go to was by xyz store which carries a product for an activity we enjoy doing together. He said he would have gotten me some of xyz product (which is a single use product) but kinda pricey maybe &lt;$50 / unit. (We didn‚Äôt do eat there bc of open hours.)

Now why‚Äôs this bother me? He‚Äôs very subtle in other ways. He seems down to earth and nice. He isn‚Äôt pushy physically. 
But it just made me feel kinda weird. I feel weird in general when ppl try to buy me things or give me things. 

Is he doing it to get laid? Or am I making too much of it? 

He doesn‚Äôt struggle for $ I don‚Äôt believe. So I may just be unaccustomed bc my previous relationship he was not well off financially (which was fine) 

Overall we‚Äôve been taking what 5-6 weeks I guess 3 dates another planned. 

To be fair and counter jt when we meet up I have to get a sitter. So if we go out fit 6 hours it costs me $70. So in consideration I probably actually have spent more $ than him on dates. 
He also pays for that. I offered 

Thx for your replies in helping to navigate this. 

Tldr: Basically I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a red flag. Guy subtly suggested he‚Äôd get me an item fir an active we do together. 
It‚Äôs kind of an attempt at a gift but not really bc it‚Äôs for an activity we‚Äôd do together.

I dont want to judge someone specially cause she was being nice to me, but she asked me about babies and that even tho she didnt wanna have kids she would have it if it was my wish.

She asked on what age i wanna get married and wanted videochat with me (covid is on the way for go on a date). She said she wanted to give as much attention to me (texting) as much as she can. She said she liked me in all aspects since the moment we matched. 

We have different religions and not only myself but also my family would consider that an issue. Its complicated this religion thing. 

But i wanna ask you guys if there is red flags on this cause i was talking to her last time and conversation ended (she was sad for her own reasons). 

The next day i did not text her and she didnt also, even tho we have Facetime scheduled. She was just on her own. Like ""ok the vibe with you is over‚Äù kinda thing. 

I posted stories, pictures (this girl who said i was the one for sure didnt even hit a like on the pic)

There‚Äôs this girl F(22) that I M(23) hang out with regularly during last semester. I‚Äôve know her for 6 months and I‚Äôm going to ask her out next week I‚Äôve been nervous to do so as it‚Äôs my first time asking a girl out. 

Good signals: 

1. She opened about her depression and said she wanted to die last year she said she‚Äôs only told this to a very small amount of people 

2.  we were in a group watching friends. The theme song comes on and she starts singing it and pointing at me. I‚Äôm so confused and then she saids this song has the potential to describe us in the future.  Went home and I searched the lyrics and the lyrics seem very romantic it‚Äôs talking about always being there for each other etc.

3. I was in a room with the girl I like and 2 other people. I was talking to these two people and the girl was cleaning. I then tell a story about how this girl approached me and complimented my hoodie and asked for my snap. This girl completely stops cleaning and I see her watching me as I‚Äôm telling this story and she frowns her face so she‚Äôs obviously Interested  in my other interactions with other girls otherwise she would have kept cleaning as for the previous topics she never showed any interest till I brought up another girl. 

4. She also told me we have never been on a date when I asked her a question about the date (day month) which she misunderstood for a Romantic date and she really seemed like she wanted me to ask her to one she didn‚Äôt even seem in disgust.

5. One time I was talking to another girl saying she‚Äôs going to make me listen to jucie wrld and then the  girl I‚Äôm Interested in gets involved and saids I thought I was the only girl that could make you listen to juice wrld I thought what we had was special. 

  Some bad signals 

1. We are in a room full of all her girlfriends and I‚Äôm sitting by myself chilling on my phone as they are talking about dating guys and she saids she could never date Mediterranean people and I‚Äôm from the Mediterranean she was obviously sneak dissing me. 

2. Then as the conversation continued she saids some crazy stuff like I don‚Äôt remember where I spelt last Tuesday but I know it wasn‚Äôt in my room sounds like she was implying she had sex. I‚Äôve never in my life seen a girl admit to having sex especially in a group setting normally girls are very lowkey  about there sexual life‚Äôs since girls are judged more harshly for having sex etc. I truly believe she was bluffing and trying to get my reaction like how do you even forgot where you sleep in the first place. I even asked her how do you not remember and she give a cheeky smile and said I don‚Äôt know. 

3. Then she said she wants a boyfriend that has a black car which is obviously hinting at a specific guy in the collage that she occasionally hangs out with and he drives her. I hang out with this girl way more then this guy does. This guy still scares me because he‚Äôs Pakistan and she always looks at Pakistan models on Instagram so she clearly has a preference for Pakistan boys. She also said I bet my Bluetooth is already connected to my future boyfriend car. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs saying this stuff to see my reaction or she if actually likes that guy with the car.

I didn't offer because he didn't ask.

I just wanted to get over him because he does not want relationships. .

But I noticed that I'm again going back to the checks of loving him....

He didn't ask .I didn't explain. 

He still seems to only want physical relationship. During our late night talk.. He was talking about how he wants the bachelor life...I just said.. If that's what he wants he should go and get it .. He said maybe...

I haven't talked to him since and so has he....

Everytime I ask him to call. He says he can't wait to talk to me and yet never calls... Gets busy or tired...I have stopped asking...

I'm so confused.. Should I tell him how i feel or let it be? I don't want to bring relationship problems in friendship... And he is a great friend. Because he has been there for me when no one was. .

Then he added, we should txt in the coming days. I was out if town for 5 days, but we kept more or less sexting in the meantime.

I told him I would appreciate next time if he either sent me a Pic he just made but not something he is sending around to everyone. Be said ok. 2 days later we txted and we were both totally turned on and then something he txted completely turned me off. In an instant. He asked if I squirted and when I said no, he responded :,, that's a shame..bzt I will fuck you anyway "". I told him, he just completely killed it. He said it was meant as a joke and that it is not must for him and that he only had a woman to squirt twice. (face-palm) But I just found it idiotic and told him sorry, we are not happening. He said ok, if I see it that way, he can't force me. I said that yes, I see it that way and that I am not coming along with people without tact.
