1,o3odnb,1624132377,woman of r/datingoverthirty have you ever never texted first to a guy you really liked and what was the reason behind it?,"So my situation is currently a little bit complicated so that I dont think I can appropiately make a objective and understandable case so I try it a little bit different and hopefully somewhere in the answers I can find a little bit hope for me.  
Because my gut tells me she likes me, I can hear it in her audio messages but  my head says I am an idiot my friends say I should go radio silent and see what happens. It is now day 4 and I need all my willpower to not message her even though I am not sure this is right thing to do.

2,o3oryf,1624133512,How/when do I communicate that I'm looking for a cuddle buddy.,"I'm interested in having a friend to cuddle with and make out with.  But I don't do hookups; I need to really get to know someone before being comfortable having sex with them.

Will women who want something casual lose patience if we don't have sex early enough?

When do I mention this?  Putting this on a dating profile may be too forward too early.  Is there some way to put this gracefully?

6,o3pt59,1624136644,New relationship anxiety,"I've (F33) recently met someone (M35) through a mutual friend, who I've been dating over the last few weeks. I realise this is very early stages yet, but something about this guy feels different in a way to anyone else I've ever been with. A bit of background, I've had a few relationships that have ended badly where I've been cheated on or dumped out of the blue when I thought things were going well. As a long-term singleton, I feel confident and secure in myself. However since I've met this guy, I've now realised how my past experiences have absolutely knocked my confidence in myself in a relationship and how my partner sees me. Despite the fact we have only had wonderful dates, I'm over analysing our messages and interactions and worrying that I am the one who is more into it than he is and that I am expecting to be rejected at any moment. I only want to date someone if there is a possible future with them, and while I don't expect either of us to know that yet at this stage, I'd hope we both feel that this is the goal. I've tried to talk about this and open up about my experiences, and we are different personality types in how we communicate - I am an oversharer, he is much more reserved. I feel this doesn't help when all I need from him is a bit more assurance we are on the same page.  On our last date I asked him to always be honest with me if he wasn't enjoying things and he seemed genuinely shocked why I'd think that, so I know I am probably being ridiculous. But how do I effectively communicate to him that I do need more affirmation from him without coming across as a needy psycho? I've honestly never felt like this about anyone before to be honest, and I'm terrified of messing this up.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o3pt59/new_relationship_anxiety/
