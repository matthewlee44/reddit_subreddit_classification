Was real romantic , gave her chocolates and a flower .. we spent the whole day in DC valentines weekend  just talking with each other going to different coffee shops bookstores.. told me that was her best date she’s ever had and asked her if I could kiss her she was joyed and said yes. We made out , told me after she appreciates asking fist before I kissed her. We always got alone very well, tells me that she really enjoyed being around me. ( side note I think she might have had a bad break up before, told me that she’s really bad at expressing her emotions)

Cue to a few days ago she didn’t text back for a good day which I found odd, so I texted her again later on if everything was ok. She ended up responding telling me how she’s really enjoyed getting to know me how she’s never met someone so fun and genuine etc . SHe told me she thought long and hard about us And saying that she did not feel the spark and would like to stay friends.

The thing is I told her that I really do have hard feelings for her now, I Think she is an awesome person  we share a lot in common and honestly would probably make a really good friend. I told her I need some time to be alone while I process this and she told me she fully understands and take my time. I was gonna see how I feel after a week or two. One of my female friends told me that she thinks she may have unresolved feelings over her break up so not wanting to get into a full fledge relationship but dosnt want to loose my  company. She told me she suggest not messaging her anymore that if I’m too available it’s not going to make her realize that she does want to be with me.

I’m over here thinking  can this be true what my friends say ? Or can we really be just friends after that? Hang out like normal , and that’s it. Or is she just too nervous to actually say we are “dating “ so wants to just throw out the friend card bc she’s still not sure but dosnt want to loose me?

Edit: it was been a week since this happened and I did end up messaging her being okay with friend ship If she actually JUST wants to be friends I have no problem looking for another for another girl for a relationship while just staying friends and limiting the amount of attention I give her (she is a genuin fun person to be around ) she just confused me a bit on what she wants . When I did text her back she responded saying she was really happy that I chose to stay friends and I can always change my mind if I want to, now she wants to go with me to the gym next week .

But I dated a guy for a couple months last year— talked/texted consistently every day, saw each other every weekend, communicated that we weren’t seeing other people, even talked about future plans.

I’m not one to date multiple guys. I let other conversations fizzle out when I meet someone I’m interested in, but apparently everyone doesn’t do that. 

It’s driving me CRAZY to not know if new guy is talking to anyone else, but I don’t want to freak him out and demand we be exclusive yet.

I’m just now wondering if this is something to be bringing up to him as a concern? He’s obviously more than entitled to have female friends but should there be boundaries when he’s in a new relationship?

We’ve been dating 3/4 months now and he’s never brought her up before.

Long story short I was chasing after this girl for like 4 months and she gave so many mixed signals and in the end she was just leading me on. She choose another guy and is literally all over him  and keeps begging him to make official till this day whilst he wants to keep it as friends.  This whole situation ended up hurting my mental health and I was in my feelings for the longest. I cut off the girl in September and haven’t spoken to her since. 

My best friend the person who I basically hang out on a daily basis with and have know for 3 years has always been friends with the girl and he only meet her a bit after me and I meet her through him 1 year and a bit later.  So I guess he must have meet the guy through the girl and now all of a sudden he’s having Instagram chats with the guy. Today when he was showing me something on his phone a notification popped up on his phone from the guy replying to him and he was like oh no and he tried to swipe up but he stopped halfway as he probably realised it’s too late and swipe up too quick would make him look guilty. 

After this I feel really blindsight and betrayed. What friend especially best friend starts to talking to the guy who pretty much took the girl you were obsessing over. It’s just so weird. I really feel like cutting him for this because the whole time this situation has happen in general I have felt no support from him and people who I’m less closer to have shown more support and I feel like this is the icing on the cake and just proves that’s he’s a fake friend. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting. Should I have a convo with him. I’ve had a few convos with him about the girl and it seems like they end well but then 1  month later he will do  something else that upsets me and we have another convo.

I have a dog with whom I hike daily and I own a home where I love to have campfires under the stars but I’m completely open to relocation. I’ve had a varied and successful career with a ToN of learn is from various times when I could have gotten it better. I now believe in a balanced life. I’m excited for what comes next work wise. 

I’m ready to be a mom and am open to however it happens (single dads don’t be shy!) I believe in therapy and self work and that both people should give equivalent energy to a relationship. That’s not that they are giving the same thing, I believe in space and independence and tapping in and out, but that it all shakes out in the end.

I’ve noticed a couple of the girls in my friend group say the dumbest stuff about men recently. And used it as a reason not to date someone. 

I’ve been dating this guy and recently he took me to a very fancy restaurant in Chicago. We had a great time. I showed one of the girls the pics as she asked to see him for the first time.  Immediately after mentioning his height, she says “yeah but the face mask tho”. I’m like “huh?”. And she says “what kind of face mask is that. It looks like it has flowers on it, I wouldn’t date him. Why would he wear that?”

I was fucking dumbfounded. I basically said let’s focus on the fact that he treats me very well, is very generous and respects me.. like who talks shit about a guy because he has flowers on his face mask.. any type of perceived feminine aspect to his taste makes you dislike someone you’ve never met? How stupid. 


And then my other friend said she thinks everyone in our group dates ugly men. Meanwhile she complains how she can’t find anyone to date on apps. And how she can’t find a man she likes. And that she can’t base her affections off how someone looks in a photo. And that it happens after shes spend a lot of time with them. My guy is also 6’7 (I’m 5’9) and she said he looked like a tree. Like who the fuck talks about peoples body like that. She’s kinda chunky as it is. Like no shit Sherlock, swipe on people that seem like you have shit in common, give them a chance and go from there. 

Both of these women are 32, single, and just complain about their dating life. I’m sure men do the same thing but I’m starting to wonder if they have a point about dating being incredibly more difficult for them.

Today I was wondering about emotions I feel when I approach unknown girls outside. I feel fear, I am doubting my sexuality, thinking about turn and walk away, but at the same time feel strong desire for this person, I feel like I want to talk to her. It feels bad when she has someone and it feels great when she gives me her Instagram. I feel more ""falling-in-love"" type when I have this kind of acknowledgement with girl.

On the other hand we have online dating, where this first ""emotional packages"" is lost. Your first approach is her online profile with photos and bio. I can speak only for myself,  but this type of approach does not give me any strong feelings. When we first meet in person I already know a lot about girl and it feels like I meet a friend, with whom I can have sex or take trip to Berlin.

Now, the question is - it is true? I feel like getting known someone on Tinder kills initial approach (when you fear, doubt, mumbling) and it prevents in 99% building strong connection in feature. If it is true (in one way or another), could you share some materials to read about this ""first encounter offline without prior knowledge of the person""? Also, I would be really happy to know your thoughts on the topic.

8th grade I start gaining a lot of weight. Not eating well at all, not doing anything good for myself. I Also dressed like shit. This carries on until 10th grade. Coming into 11th, I start caring about what I wear. I then realize how chubby I am because of the clothes that fit me and it lowers my self esteem. However this motivated me a ton, and I got a gym membership. I also start fasting techniques to cut down on my fat and gain muscle. Lost my virginity senior year, and then increased my body count by several which led me to be good in bed. Also got into my first relationship. I did pretty well from 12th grade to sophomore year of college, not including some terrible things that happened to me in freshman year. But the start of sophomore year is when it all changed. 

Before the sophomore year was my freshman year, also known as the worst first college experience because of covid. I also got into my second summer job at a H&amp;M. I was able to really step up my fashion game from there (even though h and m is nothing crazy) and even found my own style. I got more fit, dressed better, but also started to get more stares. 

Next is when I started to work on my head. No, not that kind of head you dirty thinker, I mean my physical head. How my hair looked, what conditioner I used, made my own face routine, started to get natural supplements for clearing up my skin (Zinc and Turmeric), face and body moisturizer, and started to eat very healthy food. Basically my face has really good skin and my face is more defined leading to a nice jawline. Working out and drinking a TON of water a day helped with this a lot too. 

Sophomore year comes and it is my first time at campus, and Im dorming! There are also many attractive girls on campus. I start noticing a ton of stares, eye contact, glances, blushing, etc. Then One of my female friends said that her friend liked me but thought I was out of her league. After this happened I start doing a little more when walking around campus. I start by smiling at the girls I make eye contact with. I get even more smiles, some shy “Hi…”, and more blushing faces. My flirting game got great as well, I sorta discovered my flirting “style” which I will never give out btw. Then my confidence took the final leap when I found out of that a lot of girls on campus talk about me in a very nice way. Some of them have literally said that i am out of their league. Ive also seen girls from campus describing me on Yik Yak and reddit as well. So yeahh, it has been going really well. 

Here comes the actual advice. 


Although physically I was great, this wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for my mentality. I have a dark past as well and have suffered from trauma and PTSD (please do not ask, it is personal), truth is that Im not “perfect” on the inside. Not one person on this Earth is perfect even if they seem like they are. But the dark parts in my life helped motivate me even though I still suffer from it sometimes. In a weird way I am grateful for my trauma because it build my character and personality to the best. My advice to people who are still improving themselves: turn the negative into positive. You can’t expect to do better from negativity, it doesn’t work that way. Of course you cannot avoid *all* negativity, but you can learn to put away some and get through it.

Let me clarify that, it’s not because of him, it’s because this feeling is scary and new, and obviously I don’t know how he feels so it could be something that could hurt me. That being said, am I naive or is he not interested?

We’ve been friends for a few months but only within the last month or so have gotten closer and more comfortable with each other. Last year (calendar year, not a full year) I thought he might’ve been interested as he would sit near me when given the opportunity, remember little details of things I said, brag to mutual friends about my accomplishments, tease me, always offering to help/helping when I needed, and sent heart eyes/heart emojis (although this is normal for anyone now I feel). This year, we’ve definitely been hanging out more and it feels more comfortable/natural. He took time and helped me with some work while out at a bar with our friends this week, still teases me in a fun/joking (I think this is a bit flirtatious) kind of way, we hang out a bit more often now and it’s always fun when we do, I enjoy spending time with him. Also when we hug to say goodbye he slowly rubs my back (I feel like normally friends don’t rub your back like this to say bye). He also never really pulls the busy card (I think once and for a legitimate reason) and is otherwise usually available if I ask. He doesn’t usually ask often (or as often as I’m like at least) but he will typically find me on campus and then when I break, come with me or ask to get food together then. 

I feel like I am holding back at this point because I am nervous to admit I have feelings if he doesn’t and maybe I possibly read this whole situation wrong, maybe he’s just friendly? So then I risk losing a friend. So not quite sure where to go at this point and I feel a little stuck at the moment.

About 4 or 5 days ago I came across this girl here on Reddit on the r/ForeverAloneDating group and we definitely had something going for a couple of days.

We firstly just started messaging eachother on Reddit and then we exchanged phone numbers and we started calling eachother and such for a couple of days and things went pretty well up until yesterday.

Yesterday she sent out kind of a long text message to me saying that she felt overwhelmed and was really anxious when she saw the crap ton of other messages that she got from other guys and so she wanted some time to get into a good mindset and I respected that and told her I would check back with her soon to see how she was feeling.

So then this morning I asked how she was feeling and then she replied a couple of hours later saying that she was fine but she just told me that she doesn’t quite want a romantic partner yet which really bummed me out because I got feelings for her pretty dang quick and I actually told her that pretty early. 

Another thing that I should state too is that when we first met, she made it pretty clear that she just wants to remain friends for now until we meet up and I respected that but I still ended up getting feelings for her pretty quick anyways.

So yeah I think at this point in time, I think as someone who is not looking for a romantic partner at the moment. She definitely knows that I have feelings for her and that she doesn’t want to friendzone me.

So then I asked her “so is this goodbye?” And I’m pretty sure that she made it pretty dang clear that she just doesn’t want to drag me on or something like that and I said okay and then just full on deleted her from my contacts list.

I also told her that I will definitely save her number somewhere in case there is a point in the future that I would like to get back to her to see what’s going on and she said that she is okay with that and then we both said good bye and went on with our lives.

So is this a good idea or should I handle this differently and tell her something else? I mean despite my feelings towards her, I don’t mind just being friends with her as of now but to be honest at this point I don’t know what I should do plus I’m super bummed out right now.

I mean when I first contacted this girl I was really happy and even got emotional too because I actually thought that she was most likely going to be my one but now I’m bummed out because I found out maybe not.

So yeah.

Anyways about my obsession, it’s not just getting a girlfriend that is an obsession of mine. It is also my dream job and that dream job is being a game developer and game enterpenuer.

And I feel like I’m balancing the two obsessions horribly because I feel like I’m focusing more on getting a girlfriend rather than my dream job and I feel like it’s fucking up my mental health.

I do definitely fantasize about both obsessions but I feel like I’m working more towards getting a girlfriend rather than my dream job.

I mean I get the “when you work on yourself the women will come thing” but I honestly have a hard time trusting that because I just can’t figure out how women just randomly come in.

Plus another thing that I should state too is that I feel like “when I try to get a girlfriend often” I come off as clingy and desperate.

And so I think there is a middle ground that I need to set when it comes to my two obsessions.

What do you guys think?

Also here is another question that I really want to ask too and it’s about masculinity, and that is do girls/women really care so much about well built men?

Because I’m starting to feel like “being well built” is something that men tend to focus on a lot when it comes down to working on themselves in order to get the women they like.

And here is the thing, I am not a well built person.

I’m just a 19 year old boy who is 6,4 and is about 200 pounds.

I’m definitely not fat or anything but I also don’t have tons of muscle.

So is working out really going to be necessary when it comes to working on yourself alongside my dream job and such?

God I have so many questions lol.

But yeah for those of you reading this, please answer all of the ones I have asked in this post.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160131,public,self,Is being obsessive about getting a girlfriend going to hurt my chances?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sww8e5/is_being_obsessive_about_getting_a_girlfriend/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,,

I've made a similar post on r/asexuality with more details than here, but also more centered on my asexuality. Feel free to go read it.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, I don't have much experiences, be it romantically or sexually. I've had a few flings in high school but nothing serious. In the first half of my twenties I've had a major crush on my (at the time) best friend. Nothing really ever happen between us, either because I failed to make my interest known or because she wanted to keep me around as some kind of backup plan. Probably a bit of both. Or she knew and wasn't interested, but then I can't fathom why she wouldn't talk about it and why she did some of the things that she did (like asking me to move to a new city with her to be her roommate).

After living together, as roommates, for a year, we had a bit of a fall out. This helped me realized that ""pursuing"" this girl for as long as I did was clearly unhealthy and would, very likely, lead nowhere. I moved back home with my parents, and a few months later found the job that I held until recently. The thing is that that job made me work week-end and nights quite regularly. So I had very little free time to hang out with friends. So, when I had some, my focus was very much on enjoying the time I had with them and not on making new acquaintances / finding a romantic partner, especially with the last two years that restricted even further my possibilities to hang out.

This brings us to today. I've recently changed jobs (and city), and I'm no longer working nights and week-end. So I want use that ""extra"" free time (not that I have more, it's just at a more conventional times) to find a relationship. But the thing is that I've been single for 10+ years. And my last dates goes back to when I was in high school. And IMO, dating as a high schooler should not the same as dating as an adult. I also should state that I'm quite shy and introverted, which certainly doesn't help me since, as a man, I'm mostly expected to make the first moves. And, to that you have to add my asexuality. Even though I'm sex-favorable (I like and want sex, I just don't experience sexual attraction) and have a fairly high libido, at some point that subject will have to be brought to the table, and I'm afraid of that. I'm afraid that it will drive a potential romantic partner away. I'm afraid because asexuality is quite often misunderstood by allos (non-asexuals). I'm afraid that I might end up single for the rest of my life because of it.

But enough of that, this post ain't supposed to dwell too much on my asexuality. I've recently (like two months ago) installed tinder and bumble. And though it hasn't been a resounding success (no dates so far), it hasn't been a total disaster either (a few likes and matches, but not as much as I would like). But it very much feels like I don't know what I'm doing, like I'm trying to be someone I'm not (a guy for whom doing the first moves feels natural, though I have to agree that it is way easier through a chat than IRL). It should also be noted that I'm looking for something serious, and I'm not sure that dating apps are the right place for this (but it's better than nothing, I guess).

So if anyone who has been in a similar situation (trying to date after a long period of celibacy), has any advice on how to proceed, or on how to be more at ease with the role usually associated with my gender (something I feel like I'm very much not built for).

However it had no bearing on the case since his lawyer told him since he lived in a commonwealth the judge would inform the jury that the only thing they needed to find him guilty was ""the testimony of the 'victim' "" so he took a plea agreement for indecent assault.

So I am a man in his early 30s, living in the US. I have submissive tendencies. I admire powerful, strong women and prefer a female led relationship. 

Based on my previous relationships, things did not worked out no matter what, if the partner also had submissive tendency, or had no interest in anything kinky whatsoever. After many frustrating relationships in my 20s, I stayed single for a very long time. I am thinking about giving it another try, but I don’t intend to waste time and energy for something that wouldn’t work.

Let me directly get to the question. What would you feel if the man you’re dating says he is submissive? Would it be

(1) a dealbreaker, block his number immediately 
(2) very creepy, even offensive
(3) understandable
(4) interesting

If it is not (1) or (2), when should I open this up? As I stated above, I plan not to waste time and would like to figure out whether my date would at least be interested in exploring a bit before things become anywhere serious.

I've been on 3 dates with a girl(20F) now, the first was kinda awkward as we hadn't seen each other since high school and we were both extremely nervous, we went to a cinema, nandos and played mini golf. The 2nd was basically the same except this one was alot more relaxed, we played a few arcade games, got something to eat at a restaurant (usually I'm terrible at holding a 1 on 1 face to face but everything just flowed) and played mini golf again.

The 3rd date, this being the most recent was the best I've had with her, I went to her place and watched movies in her bed, I managed to persuade her to watch a horror film, this caused her to get a little scared and cuddle up which was amazing, not like a full cuddle but like a lean on the shoulder and face in the shoulder when she got scared. By the end when she was walking me to the train station I asked for a goodbye kiss and she accepted, this was my first kiss with a girl so I'm not sure if it was good or not, it did feel nice I guess.

I'm now at the point where I wanna ask her for a fourth date but I'm not sure how this will go. I said to her after the 3rd date when I got home, that I had an amazing time and we should do it again, she said so did she and defo.

Now what I dont know is will this keep happening, I ask her on a date, she maybe says yes until I eventually ask her to be my girlfriend.

Right now I'm in the latter, hence why I'm here. So a few days ago I went to download some OLD apps and basically all of the popular ones had a bunch of recent bad reviews saying that each platform used to be good but now locks even basic features behind a paywall (which sounds like a great way to lose your entire userbase), so that seemed hopeless so I passed. The only one that seemed like it may still be worthwhile was Coffee Meets Bagel, which I may give a try sooner or later (even the tradition OLD websites like Match and eHarmony sounded like they've gone to shit). It just feels very disappointing that there isn't one large platform/website that all single people use where you can enter all your personality traits and interests and an advanced algorithm matches you with people that align the best, and you can pay for perks but there could be shit tons of ads to keep it free for the basic user. But I digress.

I know this question gets asked all the time, but has anyone had *recent* success dating online? Or are most experiences generally as bad as the reviews I read? I've been considering posting on r/r4r or r/foreveralonedating but that feels kind of hopeless too. I've heard some success stories but those are extremely rare. And as with all OLD, there are way more guys than ladies (I'm a straight male). I don't necessarily need to stand out, I just want the right person to see me. But it's so easy to get drowned out that I kind of have to stand out. But I also just want to be myself and hope that someone who's right for me will notice. Of course it's a longshot and I should have low to no expectations.

To anyone who has posted on r/r4r or related subs looking for serious dating/relationships, what was your experience like? I'm especially curious about the straight female perspective, since it's probably totally unlike the male experience. Also curious about any LGBTQ+ experiences. I assume it may be even tougher than for straight guys, but maybe not since there are fewer posts to sift through, so even if you can't find what you're looking for, you at least waste less time on false hope.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160150,public,self,Online Dating and Dating through Reddit - experiences and success stories?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/swzejb/online_dating_and_dating_through_reddit/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,,

I've been on 3 dates with a girl(20F) now, the first was kinda awkward as we hadn't seen each other since high school and we were both extremely nervous, we went to a cinema, nandos and played mini golf. The 2nd was basically the same except this one was alot more relaxed, we played a few arcade games, got something to eat at a restaurant (usually I'm terrible at holding a 1 on 1 face to face but everything just flowed) and played mini golf again.

The 3rd date, this being the most recent was the best I've had with her, I went to her place and watched movies in her bed, I managed to persuade her to watch a horror film, this caused her to get a little scared and cuddle up which was amazing, not like a full cuddle but like a lean on the shoulder and face in the shoulder when she got scared. By the end when she was walking me to the train station I asked for a goodbye kiss and she accepted, this was my first kiss with a girl so I'm not sure if it was good or not, it did feel nice I guess.

I'm now at the point where I wanna ask her for a fourth date but I'm not sure how this will go. I said to her after the 3rd date when I got home, that I had an amazing time and we should do it again, she said so did she and defo.

I (26M) am autistic, and I have an anxiety disorder for which I take medication.

I have never dated, nor put any effort toward trying to. This has been due to a combination being afraid of rejection, being effectively incapable of reading subtle behavior, and not feeling fully comfortable in public settings. I kind of view myself has having to different sides. There is my private self, who I am able to be around my friends and family, and then there is public me, who tends to stay quiet and withdrawn. 

A few months ago, I met a woman at my work who is in another department from me Let's refer to her a ""S"". Despite this, my duties take me to that department several time a week, if not several times a day. From the beginning I found her very attractive and kind, but I kept my head down as per usual. I had noticed her looking at me on occasion, but never gave it much mind. 

In early December I had a really bad week where I lost my oldest dog and then had to cover as the lead for my department without any forewarning or training during the weekend. I had just finished a job over in her department and as I was preparing to leave, I started feeling a bit dizzy (this happens to me when I am feeling overly stressed, which I was at that point). She was walking by and stopped to ask if I was okay. I said my anxiety was worse than usual because I was dealing with a bunch of stuff I hadn't been trained for. She told me not to worry, because ""You've got this"", and went back to work.

I ran into S again the following Monday when she had to help me with a job, and while we were waiting on a patient, I thanked her for what she said, because it had helped me feel a bit better. I told her that the combo of losing my dog and the work had been difficult, and then we talked about pets we had both lost while we finished waiting.

A few weeks went by where I wasn't over at her department all that much and I didn't talk to her again until Christmas day. She asked me how my Christmas had been, and I joked that it hadn't been much of one since I had yet to re-watch Die Hard. S told me she had never seen it, but was planning to watch it eventually, and assured me that she wasn't one of those people who watches Elf every year (I like Will Ferrell, but I am sick to death of that movie).

The next day S had to join me to transport a patient she was assigned to watch, and while we were waiting, we chatted briefly. This was the point where I realized that I was not only I comfortable talking to her, but actually enjoyed it. while we were getting ready to head back, the patient, who was a bit stoned at the time, sincerely asked me if I was wearing a wig. S assured the patient that it was my real hair, while also laughing so hard she had to bend forward. Normally I would have felt a bit uncomfortable in that situation, but for once I was able to find the humor in it, and even joked that I wasn't sure how to take the comment, since I had seen some pretty good wigs as well as some frankly horrendous ones. The rest of the trip back was uneventful except for some chuckling. Since then, I have noticed S looking at me when I'm around and even smiles at me when I make very brief eye contact (I've never been good at making eye contact). She has also made something of an effort to talk to me when just walking by.

Now this is where I run into problem. a few weeks ago, I started thinking about asking her out, but I haven't been able to. There are a few reasons why: 

1. I am not good at reading people, so I'm afraid that I could be severely misreading her level of 	interest in me. I know there is the stereotype about men being bad at it to begin with, but my neurological issues make it even harder for me than for a neurotypical male.
2.   I am having a hard time believing 	that someone like her could still be single, and that I would only be putting myself out there only to end up the fool.
3.   Now here is the biggest problem. Last Friday, I thought I had finally psyched myself up enough to finally talk to her about this, but when I went to approach her, I froze. My anxiety shot up to the 	point where I couldn't even move, and when she noticed me and asked me if I needed help with something, all I could do was look at her wide-eyed and mutter ""um"" a few times before mumbling ""no"" and quickly walking away to a quiet spot where I could try to pull myself together. Since then, I have been around her a few times, but I have felt too embarrassed to make eye contact or talk to her, and I'm afraid I may have screwed the proverbial pooch. I have noticed her still looking at me from time to time, but we haven't been in close enough proximity to truly interact.  

I really need some advice on where to go from here. I want to try and salvage this and finally ask her out, but I really don't know how. I had thought about writing her a letter explaining things, but as an adult, it worries me that it could come off as a cowardly method a high school student might use. I just don't know what to do, and I can't stop worrying about it.

The 'victim' was over 18. He took a plea agreement after spending a year in jail because he was on probation when he was again wrongfully accused of rape. There was a negative result on the ""rape kit"" and He passed a polygraph in regards to his charges.( Ie did you rape her... no. ...
. ...No deception detected...)However it had no bearing on the case since his lawyer told him since he lived in a commonwealth the judge would inform the jury that the only thing they needed to find him guilty was ""the testimony of the 'victim' ""meaning anyone in a commonwealth can get someone hemmed up by claiming rape and they need literally nothing but the persons word that it happened to convict..... so he took a plea agreement to get out of jail as he had been there almost a year fighting it.. and his lawyers told him just take the plea.. it don't matter If you did it or not regardless something will stick and you will go to prison for a number of years.. if u take it you leave jail today..  so he took the plea for indecent assault a misnomer offense.  He is currently registered as a  sex offender and from what I can see he is about ready to kill himself  over it at this point. Anyone who knows him ( me included) can tell you he isn't even capable of rape.  Nicest most considerate guy I know. Anyway He just had open heart surgery and was in the hospital for 2 YEARS.(1 whole year was devoted to physical therapy because he was in a medical induced coma for the other year) he weighed in at 80 lbs when he got out of the hospital and went to the party where he was accused of rape. And it was all for pissing  off a girl that slept with 4 guys Prior to him and she even keept one of them hostage in the bathroom for several hours.  The people at the party literally had to send a search party to find them because they were MIA for so long ( the cousin of the guy that was being held against his will [also 1/6 of the people this girl screwed that  night initiated the search]  so when he couldn't keep his dick hard he lashed out on the girl verbally calling her every name in the book which lead to her Decision to say he raped her. I should mention the girl then went on to screw another guy after this. Before telling him that she was just raped.  ...,....


Anyway my question is are there women out there that would take the time to get to know him and make their own assessment of his character Before either stop talking to him as soon as they find out he is a sex offender, or not talk to him at all because of the 'fact'  . And are any women after making this assessment willing to live with him knowing the public believes he us q sex offender. How is he supposed to find his other half when he has this stigma hanging over his head? How is he supposed to broach this topic if or when he does find a woman he is into? 
Her story was they were sleeping on the couch and she woke up to him  Anally penetrating her. She then stood up and stated what are you doing? He said nothing then she laid back down with him. She then fell back asleep and then woke up again to him vaginally penetrating her. She then stood up again same question and same answer... don't add up to me. 

Please any advice would help.  Please respond with any Thoughts, questions, or concerns . I'm literally grasping at straws here to help him. So reddit do your thing.

I can list a lot of things that have made dating so much harder: not liking online dating, not being in an area where there are a lot of people who are LGBTQ+, how people don't think I am into girls because of my physical look, my want for an emotional connection first, being in the military (soon to be getting out), not wanting kids, etc. This may sound annoying, but truly everyone around me is dating *someone*. I'm the only woman in my working department and friend group who is still single, and things get lonely. I want a connection irl with someone (long distance isn't preferred, unless if they are in a place I plan on being next). On top of that, seeing posts of people my age and *younger* getting married and having kids has made me feel even more lonely than ever. I always get the questions of ""Are you dating anyone again??"" ""When are you getting married??"" ""When are you settling down and having kids??"" ""Are you having kids??""

Do other women encounter fixations from past partners/love interests on you, especially in the case of it not working out (and usually because of them i.e being non-committal, or messing up) and they don't want you or screw things over but still seem to have this need to keep tabs, and have some sort of insight into your life?

This is a pattern I notice. Not with every single partner, mind you, but with a lot of them, and as I am bi, this has happened with both men and women.

To better explain.

I dated a guy in July of 2020 and we broke up in December of that same year because he overreacted and dumped me via text over nothing. He ended up coming to his senses, realised he loved and missed me and was into what I was and represented, apologised, turned things around, improved some areas of his life such as kicking alcohol, and then after this big song and dance and making changes ended up reverting back to the same shitty ass behaviour and this time I walked because I could see he hadn't changed and it was all lies.

Guy has issues, I need to state this.. a LOT and is undoubtedly BPD (a doctor told him as much and I've seen it on the papers) and I did used to feel for him being that I could tell he was struggling, but after a time I saw through that, and regardless of his PD he is actually just a piece of shit dude.

Anyway, after the second go around, I blocked him over everything. That was in about April last year.

Again, he is blocked on everything.. Gmail, all socials, and phone.

I have a separate artist account for my paintings and process, and yesterday afternoon in complete surprise I noticed he was snooping all my stories. This account is not linked to my original personal account and my artist account is not my name or in any way resembling it. So, I was a little ""huh"" and also it's been months, but he was watching all stories.

Because I know how he operates, I sent him a ""fuck off"" and blocked him this morning from that artist account. I noted he's got a new partner, and it seems after seeing my posts (I checked his account yesterday to see if it was him as I could only just tell from the small icon in my stories) and he has gone and posted a bunch of his own art, clearly spurned by my paintings and I guess feeling some kind of competitiveness or something, I don't know, or hoping I'll see his page and want to connect. Who bloody knows! All I do know is I had to block him as I'm sure he was going to reach out with a sob story or something to get me to forgive him (not because he actually feels remorse) and/or try and weasel into my life.

Thing is, this kind of thing isn't new, and with most partners (not all, but certainly most) or love interests been a thing. Where they fuck up and then have this habit of popping up to check in or observe my life from a far, and usually checking in, which is obviously to gauge something.

It tends to be a recurrent thing from those that have done me wrong, and I wonder why this is? Like, if you want a good thing (say, a really nice car you've always wanted) you wouldn't save up and then crash it into a telephone pole on purpose. So why is this a thing with people and me? And I can generally sense when they're about to or that they will, which is bizarre but I can.

It's happened with this idiot, with a girl who messed around with my feelings and has many years later had to keep some thread connecting us, ostensibly through friendship, and others who've done wrong in some way. I get this behaviour must stem from guilt or fascination, but why then conscientiously hurt me or lead me on or abuse me in some form, only to then create this kind of sentence for themselves where they only get me from afar, if at all.

I just find it strange and figured I cannot be alone in this phenomenon.

I used to be shit with my boundaries but am a lot better at it (like this dude to rack off as I did this morning and blocking him from yet another account) but like... why is it a thing?

Sometimes I wonder if I give off a vibe like manic pixie dream girl.. where I'm not quite ""relationship material"" or something, but there's something they can't let go of?

I'm not walking around upset by this, it's more this observation over time that is so obvious and given it's come from a range of people, I wonder why that is.

The girl who broke my heart (basically asked me to come stay with her while I was traveling in her country after we met up in person after being mates online for years and feeling a connection) only to end up being emotionally/romantically stony towards me, and then, over a period of four or 5 years go back and forwards on what she felt and thought (total HEAD FUCK of a situation) but one that still stings a little because I really fell for her out of the blue, and we had an undeniable pull and sexual attraction that she blocked (and is also a massive wtf.. I'm cool as painful as it is to accept rejection) but her neither here nor there over the years that followed (I didn't want to come across as a fuck boy, our chemistry was and is there, I feel some kinda way about my life so wanted to reach out) tells me she's still and may always be a little strung up by what did/didn't eventuate (on her though!).

I'm an offbeat kind of person, so I imagine it's my free spirited individualism that is what compels them, but it's this kind of annoying pattern and I don't really want to be some novelty or fancy, especially when with some of these people there has been substance and I believe genuine feeling and gravitational pull. I know some of it is about boundaries for sure (if someone keeps popping up shooting them down) but some of it is this confusing territory because like ""clearly I'm in your mind so why are you like this"".

I don't get wanting someone but keeping that at a distance.

Any other ladies encounter this?

I really hope this doesn't come across as self indulgent or conceited. I actually have terrible self esteem a lot of the time!  It's just such an overt, consistent pattern and I wonder why it is that people that hurt you/have guilt feel this need to keep tabs.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160170,public,self,Fixation from previous entanglements on me... why is this?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sx2z3o/fixation_from_previous_entanglements_on_me_why_is/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,,
