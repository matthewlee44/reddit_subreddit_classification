Tbh,  his reasons did seem legit but every single time we've planned on meeting I've cancelled on other people for him and him cancelling the very last minute every single time has been extremely inconvenient for me. 

I do really like him and I've really looked forward to meeting him. That phone call was the last we spoke. If he would've called me or even texted later to genuinely apologize I would've let it pass but he didn't.

Quite sporty, more on the skinny side and 6ft tall.

I  have been paying tinder for 6 months and recently deleted the app  because of the poor experience. I got around 10 matches per month and I  was able to set 4 dates in the whole 6 months. None of them went into a  second date or even a kiss.

1st  one was a younger girl new in the city, we were texting the whole  afternoon abot and I finally told her I was open to meet at the weekend.  She texted me a couple of days later and we decided to go for a walk  this afternoon. We spend a couple of hours talking, I think she laughed a  lot and we had a good time. When I tried to kiss her goodbye she  refused and after that she ghosted me. Now I think since she was new in  the city just went out with the first polite guy (clearly not a rapist)  who made her feel safe to go on a walk.

2nd  was an older girl, she wanted to meet right away the afternoon we  matched. we shared similar career profiles therefore we had a lot of  things to talk, she was quite sporty and she suggested seeing each other  again and going for sports. I didnt find the right moment to kiss her  but I wasnt worried since she suggested seeing each other again. A few  days later I tried to meet her again and she told me she was busy and  later on she told me she left the city. Now I think she was bored at  home and wanted to meet just for one afternoon.

3rd  was a younger girl, she is living in a little town and I am living in  the city, I told her she could come to my city and visit some places. Of  course she did, we spend the whole day talking, walking and having  drings. She clearly stated she does not kiss on a first date (aka dont  try to kiss me). I told her no problem, and I enjoyed the rest of the  afternoon  with her. Now I think she wanted to get out of her little  town and come to the city with somebody and I was a safe option for her,  polite, educated, not a weirdo.

4th  was an older girl with similar career profile at 2nd. I was working for  some days on her city and matched with this good looking girl. She  wanted to meet right away this afternoon. I told her I was only going to  spend a couple of days on her city but she wanted to meet anyway. I  bought a little gift for her because I am grateful with people that want  to spend time with me, I obviously wouldnt try to make any move because  we were not going to see each other again. We had a good time together  and I enjoyed the time with her. She CLEARLY stated she was bored at  home, new in the city and without any friends there, I didnt care about  this and told her that was great to match and spend some good time  together. But, Now I think, as the previous 3 girls, she just was bored  at home and kind of utilized me as a safe option to hang out when all  the main options are not available. Thinking twice, I should have  refused meeting her, it was CLEAR that she was not interested  romatically on me because I dont even live on her city, she would rather  dated another guy from her city if she had the option. I feel stupid  now.

4th girl texted me week  later, but we live like 2500km away. I didnt understand that though. I  answered politely because at this time I hadn't analyzed my whole  experience . Was she playing any game? I dont know. Now I am feeling  like shit, because I always try to care about them when I go on a date  and the very few dates I got after months paying tinder were just  utilizing me when they are bored when there is no other option.

Reading  many girls on this subreddit I learnt that when a girl is interested  she puts herself on your scope, texts you, waits for your answer and  they are really willing to spend time with you OVER the rest of the  things. I also learnt that attractive guys here have girls that  GENUINELY want to spend time with them.

I really think I have many things to share with a potential partner, either for something casual or something more meaninful. I am 0% clingy and I care a lot for other people. I am trying to put my self out there, but dont want to pay tinder anymore and my options are close to zero. How to stay motivated in this situation?

She started avoiding talking to people sometimes when she is depressed too much, but i was patient with her, i didn't push her or anything. sometimes when we are chating i tell her ""MARRY ME"" she said 'YES' everysingle time, even tho i've never confessed my feelings for her, but she knows i love her, anyways to keep this short, since im really hurt, she asked me to meet her for a last time to see if she has feelings for me, she said that she will do her best to be in a good mood since in our last date (50days ago) she wasnt feeling well, and she said maybe her bad mood ruined her way to know hat she feelis towards me, now the date will be next week between 2-6 January, and i accualy don't know how to approach this date, because if she feels nothing she is gonna break up with me, but i LOVE HER :'(

It pisses me off because I don't even think people who do ghost others (and tried to eventually come back) understand how damaging it could be, or they just completely disregard how it will effect them in future relationships.

I'm a guy (37m) that is pretty much a workaholic and have just been focussing on work and advancing my career the past few years.

As a result, and as you can imagine, I don't really get out much and me at social gatherings is becoming a rare sight, so I have virtually no interaction with the opposite sex outside of work.

In the last two years I have noticed a trend on Facebook with long-time female friends of my friends contacting me and asking if I would like to go out for a drink with them. Some of them I know from high school, others from my partying days in my 20's, some I've never even spoken to directly and others I'm a bit more familiar with.

My usual reaction is one of surprise as they tend to be totally out of the blue and unexpected and up until now I have never followed up on any of the requests to go out with them.

I might be guilty of essentially hiding behind my work and using that as an excuse to avoid any kind of social interaction, although I am also genuinely busy most of the time anyways.

Last month I got another request to go out for a drink and it was from a female I have known for some time. The last time I met her in person was a few year's back at a friend's wedding. She was dating a guy back then and I believe their relationship of a few years didn't end well and she has since been stuck on the dating app scene.

I genuinely like her and want to take her up on the offer but at my age I'm not really looking for drinking buddies or casual friendships and I'm afraid this might land into one of those categories.

I'm guessing I should just go for a drink with her first and see where things go from there. At the very least I will have an idea of what she wants and then I can decide if that is something I want too or not.

1. First and foremost, the height thing, don't let that get you down:  If someone is going to be that shallow, then move on. They are not worth YOUR time, which is valuable. Time is the only thing here that you cannot get back. Always keep your head held up high.
2. If they don't have a car, move on: Unless you live in a city with really good transportation, I would want to know why someone does not have a car, either way, I do not want to be their taxi driver/uber/lyft. And trust me, if you date someone that doesn't have a car, then that is exactly what you will be.
3. Same thing for if they don't have a job: I don't even get onto dating apps if I wasn't working because I should be spending that time, to look for a job. Why should this be any different? How do you know that they can even keep a job, or will even work? You don't need dead weight. If they are not working, then next.
4. Keep your standards reasonable: By reasonable, I mean, don't have them too low(most of the time of what I see) or too high either. Be realistic about your expectations. Once you can zero in on what you can get, don't let anyone tell you that you don't deserve it.
5. Stop the sex talk: Ok, I get it, you want to get laid, but talking about sex right away, just makes you look desperate and pathetic. Stop with the sex talk, and no sending d%\^k pics either! The last time someone I knew did that, I was at a party, and EVERYONE saw it! Keep that for when you have established a relationship.
6. Again, your time is valuable: I can't repeat this enough. I had a date this morning with a woman that went on and on and on about her child custody hearing like I gave a shit. I am not Dr. Phil, and I cut the date 30 mins short, made an excuse and left. I won't waste my time on someone and you shouldn't waste your time either. If the date is not going well, or you see red flags, get the hell out of there. 
7. Paying: Kinda goes with #6, I don't mind paying, but if we got to a public spot and I am getting red flags, then I am splitting the check. If you already know that it will not work, then there is no point in paying. And don't do it thinking you will get sex either, because even if you do, with all the red flags, it still will not be worth it. Five seconds of heaven is not worth the drama or the hassle. Be strong.  No restaurants/drinks on the first date either. That is a bad idea and is either setting you up to either be used for money, or some sort of #metoo action. 

That is all I have so far. I don't know if everyone will agree, but just figured that I would put it out there. This can also be reverse engineered and used mostly for women too, but I don't think women are sending d%$k pics tho haha.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1143474,public,self,Dating Advice for the Men on here.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsdfho/dating_advice_for_the_men_on_here/,no_ads,0.0,,,

However, I was only able to see her because I had moved to near her area for work, I knew I would be moving after about 2 months of seeing her, and so we ended up going from an exclusive relationship to a casual one as trying to see her on a regular basis was difficult and we mutually decided it wouldn't last.

She has recently asked that we don't see each other anymore as a result which I can respect, but I'm filled with a horrible feeling as she has told me she has seen other people since I moved away from her. Even though we mutually agreed to have a casual relationship I can't help but feel a bit betrayed, I had myself gone out and met other girls on nights out but I could never bring myself to do anything as I just felt a lot of guilt about it.

I had asked to see her for the last 3 weeks but she has seemed very on and off about me seeing her, probably because she has been seeing someone else.

We had the first date 2 weeks ago, just a drink at a bar. The connection was huge, but things didn't do any further that night. 
We kept texting alot after that that, and we started having deeper conversations, and is obvious that we start having feeling for each other, so not just a casual hookup (which was never a option for either).
After a week of texting, we had 2 other dates this week. 
The first a drink at my place, the next day a walk by the city, followed by dinner and drinks at my place.
Those two moments at my place lead to the beghinning of physical contact, with kissing, cuddling, and alot of touching (not sexually). 
So, those two times, in the heat of the moment, I tryed to go further. The first day, at a moment were my intention were clear, she asked if we can go slower, and I said ofc, and stoped. The next day, in the same situation, she asked me to calm down a bit, and I did. After both those moments we kept kissing, cuddling and caressing each other, with alot of feeling involved. 
We never talked openly about sex, but after those two moments, and using euphemisms, she said that is a matter of time. 
That said, I totally understant the ""taking things slower"", and not beeing ready to have sex, even when we'r at moment were everything points to that.
The ""problem"" is that I'm a very sexual person, with a big libido, and I'm kinda getting scared of she not beeing like that, which could be a problem on the long run, regarding compatibility. 
Also, after those two moments I'm affraid of trying anything again, since I don't want to have more of those ""stops"", or look pushy. 
So I don't really know what to do... Should I openly talk about sex with her, so early in the realtionship, and considering it's a never touched theme until now? Should I just wait to see? That scares me, that we reach the time of having sex, just to find out that we'r not on the same page, or don't have the same needs, I don't want to do that to her.

Prior to us breaking up, we had lived together in a shared apartment and had a very close and strong relationship. We both were deeply in love and behaved akin to a married couple, and she was very much in love with me.

That summer, she accepted an offer to an internship and I had mentally spiraled again, and she could no longer deal with the situation as it had deeply hurt her. It was not an amicable breakup in any sense, but was necessary and I recognize and understand why we broke up as I had done a lot to hurt our relationship. We kept in contact somewhat, especially given our shared space, and she had been consistent from the start about wanting us to be together again in the future.

Since this all happened, I have been serious about fixing my flaws as a person and in our relationship, and making the serious relationship we had before work with all of the experience I have gained since. A week ago, I found out she would be returning from the internship sooner than she was originally supposed to due to being fired. This was her dream job, so she has taken this hard and of course isn‚Äôt as enthusiastic or jumping right back into things. Since then, she has come back and is living temporarily with her family even though her things are still here, but does seem to want to live here again. She is firm about us getting back together, but that we need to take things slowly and she needs to figure out how we will proceed together to make things work. I‚Äôm autistic, and I am working to understand what she means but I do get what she is saying. I know this is normal when exes attempt to get back together, but it feels weird to imagine us not being serious or who we were before. I don‚Äôt know what we can do to make things like they were before when it comes to the love we shared and us living together, and I told her I could only feel comfortable with us not living together short term as we had lived together for nearly two years and I had moved down here so that we could live together and start our lives as a couple. I even was very close with her family, and temporarily lived with them.

What do we do now? What can I do to show her that I want to make this work and that I understand her? She is serious about wanting us make this work, but how can we proceed naturally and what would I be able to do to best maximize our chances of living together and getting closer to what we were before sooner rather than later? How can I best show her I‚Äôve changed and that I am serious when it comes to everything?

We live 2.5 hours away from each other and are going to be moving in together and renting in a flat next week.

The new flat will be 2 hours away from her current house, and 1 hour away from my place.

The job my gf is getting, she‚Äôs been trying for a very long time to get it, and got it in the city I‚Äôm living in, hence where the idea of renting and living in together came from. My situation at home is already complicated, so having the discussion of moving out with her was stressful but as it‚Äôs an opportunity she doesn‚Äôt want to lose out on, I sort of said I‚Äôll move out with her as we are also a couple.

I‚Äôm the only child and me and my mum have lived together since I was born. She‚Äôs always been there for me and raised me up. My dad who currently lives with us, only just came back from living abroad 2 months ago. He‚Äôs going to return back abroad at the end of January, which will leave my mum alone. He‚Äôs not lived with us for around 6-7 years as they‚Äôve separated.

My dad is early 70s and mum is early 60s.
My GFs dad is early 50s and her mum is early 40s. There is a big age difference I know which puts me at a disadvantage.

Now that I‚Äôm moving out very soon (in 3 days), today my close friend said to me if it was him, he wouldn‚Äôt move until February and he‚Äôd spend as much time as he can with dad before he goes back. Now I‚Äôm reevaluating all this. My GF won‚Äôt be happy as she really loves me and is very excited to move in and start this on another level of living together.

I didn‚Äôt really want to move out in the first place, but compromised as I originally jokingly hinted at my GF finding a job in my city, and moving here so we can live together, she took it serious and after months of interviews she got the job which starts next week.
It‚Äôs the job she‚Äôs been trying hard to get. We were originally planning to buy a house together but I realise it was a BIG NO as we were only together for 10 months! She refused to rent as she says it‚Äôs a waste of money, but I managed to convince her and we are going to rent now.

But as my parents are getting old and weaker, and I‚Äôm the only child, my mum doesn‚Äôt want me to move out as she‚Äôll be lonely and she says I‚Äôll only have one mother. It makes me sad when she talks like this.
This made my decision really hard to move out, I don‚Äôt want to but feel because I originally hinted at the idea to my GF, and it‚Äôs become a situation where I‚Äôve made her feel hurt for changing my mind all the time, I felt I had to rent.

What should I do?

If I stay 5 nights here and 2 nights at the new flat for the next month, does it seem like it will be a problem for my GF?

Things we starting to get serious and then her insecurities and mental issues blew up the relationship.

I'm finding its incredibly easy to pick to women and it's incredibly easy to have sex with different women.    Like super easy.

Sounds great yeah?   Well NO!!!!  

Yeah sex is cool.   But I'm not looking for hook ups.   I'm looking for a long term relationship.   You know settle down.   


I'm finishing an epidemic of avoidant women, terrible communicators,   lots of women preach they don't need a man, then admit they are terrible at relationships / don't know how to be in one.  


What's gone on with the world?   I don't want to be juggling a load of women having casual relationships. 


I want something stable, long term with a women that is secure in a relationship.     To be honest I know I can have attractive women but it's not a deal breaker for me. 

Personally is key for me.  

Looks don't even matter to me.   I would happily date a women that wasn't considered conventualy attractive as long as the personality connection was there. 

When I connect everything about a women becomes attractive, and they become so beautiful to me. 


Anyways...   

I keep finding attractive women who just want casual with me, the women not so attractive have super crazy high self esteem issues.   

All I'm finding are fearful avoided types (seems to be the default) and I cannot stand fearful avoids disfunctional daring style. 

I'm secure, would like to date secure women or even on the anxious side of things.    

I say I don't mind anxious because my stability and personally usualy makes these types edge towards secure.   Plus anxious are open to communication. 


I don't like avoidants because I find they are terrible partners, that run from everything and are scared to communicate.

1. We already rescheduled once, and then she put it 3 days out. I think anything over 48 hours is a bad sign, but her reasoning is because she wanted it to be on her day off..understandable.
2. Today, I asked her if she was excited to see me and her answer was ""Kinda"". I told her that she did not have to see me if she did not want to, as I want someone who is just as excited to see me as I am excited to them. She then blamed her work and her kids(who are adults) and said that she was overworked. Said she would call me when she got off.
3. She did call me and told me that her daughter might have Covid and if not, then she would come. Two hours later, still not hearing anything, I texted her and she said that her daughter did not have covid.
4. We got the location picked out but she said it was too far for her even though we live in the same city. I had to go and pick another location which she seemed to be fine with even though it was almost the same distance.
5. After we got the location picked, she then said that she would pay for herself as she didn't want to have a ""spending limit"". I have never mentioned a limit or implied anywhere that I am cheap or do not pay for dates. Plus, we are going to Starbucks..how expensive can it be? When I asked why she said that, she said it was a joke. (im not laughing)
6. Now due to all of this, I am heavily suspicious and I think she is only meeting up to be nice it sounds like. I asked her if she gave any thought as to how it will be when we meet, and she ignored the question.

Keep in mind that after she rescheduled the first time, i was not able to answer her for most of the day due to being sick, and she messaged me saying that she hoped i found what i was looking for. I had to call her and leave her a message telling her i was sick and i had to go into work the same day. It seems like she likes talking to me, but is too quick to let someone go.

I'm a 23 year old guy who's been perpetually single for a while now. I've dated a bit here and there, but I keep having the same experiences, and I'm wondering to what extent it is a flaw in how I'm perceiving dating and to what extent it is just the women I've dated. 

Multiple times now, I'll meet someone, befriend them, know them for a little while, then start dating them. As soon as I start dating them, the tone shifts, and there's a disconnect. The primary thing being that I start to get invested, and they are going on dates with multiple people, which makes me lose interest.

I guess I'm just trying to understand what the general protocol is on dating, if there's a general logic to the madness. I could easily see my view on dating being at a high school level, as, when I start dating a person, they are all I focus on. The idea of dating a different person before breaking it off with this person is aberrant to me. This could also be because I see so few people. There are pockets of time between people I start and stop dating, so scarcity might just be making me hyperfixate.

But no matter how I think about it, intellectually I just think (unless obviously you're poly in some capacity) that exclusivity in dating is a given, and not necessarily a commitment. If you're not interested in the person, or you're interested in someone else more, break it off and go see that person. That's what makes sense to me. Obviously that becomes more complicated as you've invested in a person and built a relationship with them. If you start to develop feelings for someone who isn't your partner, you have to examine what your needs and wants are, and if you're really attracted to someone else or if you're just fundamentally unhappy in the relationship, but that's tangential to this post. I just think that if you're going on dates with three different people a week, how are you going to be engaged and receptive to the experience each date has to offer, good or bad?

The crux of what I'm asking here is, to what extent is exclusivity a commitment? Should I reexamine my values here or is it a normal thing to lose interest when the person you've started dating continues to see other people while seeing you? Is there a general number of dates where you can start to anticipate exclusivity? Or is there no rhyme or reason to anything and I'm just grabbing at the void here?

Thanks,

\- I've got myself into a casual relationship with someone I like who wants a casual.

\- he uses to text me a lot. but now days it's pretty minimal. 

\- i saw from a distance that he's been texting someone on messenger (with the purple bts theme on messenger.. so as if it's not a girl lol - i also need glasses so everything is blurry, can't see properly lol. and it's more lengthy messaging too compared to me). 

\- I know he was out during the day on Wednesday, and I saw him on Wednesday night because he had this parking ticket for Wednesday (didn't look through it, i just glanced at it). (He also had a backpack and his hat out near his desk. Lol I think that he maybe out with this on the day.)

\- He was especially warm and bubbly that day. And super smiley on the phone. 

\- It may seem like i'm overthinking at this point. But with  these data points in my face.. i only gather this because out interactions are almost shallow and these are the only things I have gathered from my recent visit. 

\- i think we've both been super introverted to each other. i honestly don't know how to talk to him. i think it's me and it's him, a two way thing, that we ended so quiet with each other. it's odd because i can be so much more talkative with anyone else. so i know i'll need to open up and try to make him open up too if i want a sustainable friendship at least.

\- verbally we're pretty distant. but in terms of actions, we show consideration for each other. 

\- the fact that i have a crush on him. i don't know what I am suppose to do.

\-  even if a relationship doesn't work out, i think i have too much affection for him to not see him anymore. seems like sex is the only way to see him. to be clear, he's not a bad person, he just make his terms clear too.

Now mind you this was a girl I had met a few months prior through a social gathering where we talked a bit but not much, nothing happens and we don't talk until months later during summer where we see each other a few times, I suggest and she turns me down.

Basically we haven't known each other for years or since childhood or anything like that. I haven't bothered to reach out to her and kept the discussions pretty short and straight to the point since then.

On Xmas eve I get a text from her being super snarky: ''Even though you don't talk to me anymore, merry Christmas.'' 

Big ew.

I don't get why women are so obsessed with 'being friends' even though we've never gotten to that point. Maybe it's my version of friendship but for this case we were never really friends, just mere acquaintances but somehow that's seen as such a terrible thing. I've had this happen a few times now, I manifest my interest in dating a girl and get turned down, afterwards they give me the ''But we can still be friends!''...I didn't ask? I'm not interested in that?

Personally if I find someone attractive I can't be friends with them, but again that's just me. I think friendship with attraction is never going to be genuine since it's always going to be hanging over our heads. But the sheer entitlement coming from women surrounding friendship makes me think that it's the female equivalent of the guy who buys you a drink and expects sex in return.
