1,qrgwfp,1636620247,Does this hypothetical situation count as cheating. A debate.,"Hey guys. I’m trying to settle a debate with my friend on a hypothetical scenario and I’d appreciate y’all’s input. I’ll keep it short.

Say there is a guy wanting to end a relationship with a toxic woman. One night he randomly meets another women online and after talking for a bit discovers they share multiple interests and overall just click very well. Nothing explicit is said or shared. He tells the new girl right away his intentions of breaking off the current relationship. He also says he really wants to see her however he needs to end it with the current gf first. Is this considered cheating? 

My friend is convinced this is considered cheating because he’s talking to someone he is technically interested in. 

I argue it’s not cheating and more of a grey area because he intends on ending the relationship before proceeding further with this new person which, IMO, is the right thing to do. 

What do you think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qrgwfp/does_this_hypothetical_situation_count_as/
2,qrgxi3,1636620373,Why can’t I convince myself to kiss them,"
TL:DR I get an overwhelming sense of guilt just before I go to make the first move even if I know they like me back and I don’t know where it comes from. This has recently completely jeopardized my chances with a woman I would have done anything for

Problem description 
     I have never been able to make the first move when it comes to any form of physical intimacy because it makes me feel like I’m doing something unethical. I have had some light experience with relationships and am very comfortable in my sexual identity but seem to lack the power to engage 

I am a (19m) and I have just recently noticed a strange pattern in my dating life. I essentially don’t have that hard of a time finding a date or even getting asked out on occasion. However I can never seem to make it any further than this. I manage to make it to about the third date most of the time and then things fall off because they think I’m not interested anymore. This is most definitely not the truth but it’s because I have a weird inability to initiate the extra intimacy. I don’t fully understand what the problem is because when I ask them out I’m not overly nervous about rejection. I also love touch it is definitely my love language but I get this felling of extreme guilt right before I ever lean in to kiss her. The thing that really confuses me is that although I have been kissed by 2 women ( I’ve literally never done it first) and really enjoyed it. One of which actually lead to a small relationship. I just can’t seem to do it myself. I’ve talked to a couple of my friends about it and they suggested that it was just because I didn’t have genuine feelings for any of them. And although this explanation does make sense for a couple of the women, this problem recently ruined my chances with a girl (20F) I could see myself dating for years. We meet over the summer and I swear my buddies kept track but we saw each other around 21 times in August alone. And I mean it when I say I was head over heals for this girl, just the purest and strongest emotion I have ever felt for another person. It was obvious that at first it was a one way feeling but it did eventually become mutual. The root of the problem however was that I was going to move hundreds of kilometres away in September for school and she had to stay for hers. But despite my feelings and the best before date looming overhead I couldn’t do anything with it. I’ll spare you the details but we did some really fun and personal things together that gave me ample opportunity to make a move. But long story short I never did. After I moved we stayed in contact and I ended up telling her essentially what I am telling you now. She admitted that she really did want a relationship and for me to make a move and was disappointed that I didn’t. This absolutely gutted me and has been taking a really heavy toll on my mental health and now my self esteem too. Please if you have any wise words or have experienced something similar help a bother out and let me know. I appreciate anything you can offer in guidance both for breaking this strange self restriction and distracting me from spending hours not sleeping thinking what could have been. 

Thanks for letting me spew even just typing this out has been relatively therapeutic.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qrgxi3/why_cant_i_convince_myself_to_kiss_them/
3,qrgy1k,1636620432,Pretty New Relationship But this is something that’s been bothering me lately,"Hey everyone, this is my alt account as I know she knows my main Reddit acct.

Little back story: We march on dating up “bumble” in beginning of September and didn’t have our first date until end of September. It was then when we had many dates and meets and things we did together until one of the big festivals recently we’ve attended which brought us closer. 

Since day ones I’ve noticed something that bothered me when we are out in public (social) place like a restaurant or bar primarily. I feel as if she only wants to go to these places to stare at other guys and girls and it is noticeable like it is not just a quick look, it’s more of a very visible stare with her even turning head 10+ times around. I had a little hint of a conversation about it about a week ago mentioning I love how aware of surroundings she is and I saw that she understood exactly what I meant by that.

As we know we are all looking at negatives in everything as humans, but during this stage of relationship I am trying to obtain trust and whether she is worthy of it as you know of it. When researching on google it seems to me it is a horrible sign and I should already be dumping her as “I am just another person to fill her time while she is looking for next big thing”. 

I know she and I have gotten attached to each other and we meet at least few times a week including spending weekend or day on weekend together.

BUT, this whole looking at other people situation so persistently in social scenes is driving me a bit crazy. I just never met a girl and I dated many (not to brag I just have experience) and see red flags very quickly, but this one is just different and I really like her in many ways. 

Little background on her: She is into rave festivals scene type of girl. She had two 2 year relationships with latest one being with bi guy (I am straight fully if that matters). 

At times really long shot I wonder whether she is promiscuous but she is just not exhibiting some obvious traits and things we talk about are just so close to both of our hearts.


Maybe I’m just over exaggerating this and best solution to just straight up ask her and not to waste both of our times on what exactly is she looking at. It’s just to the point of being uncomfortable for me as I get this stare from other guys like is that guy her boyfriend or a friend and should I approach her (and yes we are very touchy in public as she grabs my arm everywhere we go).

Almost 300 pounds. Big guy and brought up after I was talking about Hawai’i (which I used to live there with my brother) I’m (25) 5 foot 7. About 150 pounds. And was just like “One time I was considering breeding with a Polynesian girl because we would make giant athlete children” 
Not only did this hurt my feelings because I am nothing of that type of woman- it’s a model he followed recently on Tik Tok. A 6 foot something Polynesian girl… (back story- we’ve been fighting lately about him following half naked girls on social media. I’ve told him it makes me uncomfortable and he agreed to stop and then did it again so we had to talk about it all over again and since then he’s unfollowed a few people but I have noticed he still follows a couple girls he has attempted hitting on which I can see from their public profile and his old comments about how stunning they are or the fire emoji and heart eyes emoji)  so immediately I blurted out “oh just like the model you followed recently” and then the fights begun. &amp; said he was talking about a girl he knew from high school and it was all a joke and blah blah blah but is it wrong for him to even say stuff like that on a date?? 

We’ve only been dating five months and it’s feeling like I’ve started dating a 30 year old man who’s never lived with a girl or seems to of had a long time girlfriend even though he says he has (he was in the military until he was 25 and traveled a lot but he’s been in the city for 5 years now) He’s uncomfortable opening up about his feelings and it feels like I almost annoy him with asking questions about how he feels or touching him too much. I ask myself why isn’t he all over me then I tell myself it’s just not who he is. Or maybe it’s just me…

My ex and I had broke up in March and I wanted a hot girl summer before I left for my European adventure. One of the guys (26M) I went out with and I just clicked and dated casually, but intensely for the rest of the summer. When it came time for me to leave, he flew out with me and we spent a whirlwind week and a half in my new city together. We tried to have a talk about what was going to happen with us for the next four months, but I truthfully didn’t want to be tied down by anything and we agreed to just “try.”

Flash forward about a month of me being gone, and lots of great communication and missing each other, and he asked me to be exclusive with him. I agreed happily because I wanted to move forward with him and liked him enough to sacrifice some elements of my European experience to do it.

He then tells me a month later he is buying a plane ticket to come out and visit me for my birthday. I have been swooning. It’s been hard of course being apart for so long, but I have felt so connected to him and have felt like we have actually made so much progress in our relationship already.

Then, the other day, we started talking about how things might be different when I come back and we aren’t distant anymore. I asked him if he could see potential for us for a long-term relationship and his response was, “I can’t make any judgments about our longevity until you get back.” This was pretty crushing to me as I have felt like we have spent months now working towards that and I have given up a lot to do it. I sent him a 10 minute audio message explaining my feelings and how I don’t think we have been on the same page and his response was “thank you for explaining. sorry for the disproportionate response, I don’t want to make anything worse.” I was hoping he would talk to me about his feelings, but it seems like that was his attempt to spare mine.

I met a guy a couple of weeks ago during a tabletop gaming night. We sat next to each other and chatted a bit.

Over the next weeks I did however think I saw some hints of flirting from his side, but I'm a terrible flirt in real life and don't think I have responded like I wanted to respond. I have been thinking about asking him out (via text), and working up the courage to do so (also to actually show that I would be interested), but after the last time seeing him I'm terrified that I have it all wrong and that asking him out would make things awkward between us and in the group.

It's definitely not a habit for me to ask someone out, but he is the first in a long time that I would consider asking. For some part that means something to me, but on the other had what if I only see what I want to see and I see it all wrong?

Could someone give me any advice? Should I just text him and ask it? Should I first start some small talk (but then I have no clue what to say)? Should I wait some more?

Hi everyone,

Over a month ago, I (31 W) met this guy (29 M) on an app. We had an enjoyable conversation on the app and decided to go on a date some days later. We had a coffee during the day, and the connection was so great. We were initially were going for drinks later in the night, but as I was in his neighborhood, he wanted to have the coffee, and we still met later in the evening.

&amp;#x200B;

**History of the experience**

The evening date was so magical. We talked about our spirituality, our relationship with the world, and everything between the sun and the earth. It ended up in a scorching kiss, but I told him I had to cut it short as I was leaving for a weekend trip. We texted a couple of times while I was away and decided to meet up on Sunday when I got back. He came and brought the beer I liked, we started watching a movie, it got hot and heavy, and we went all the way. Something in me felt like I had landed in a place I wanted to be, and I could sense he felt the same. In the following weeks, we both were busy with work and other things. We both got sick, so we did not get to meet up for three weeks. On our third date, we decided to go to the Spa and dinner. It was so magical that I was super nervous, but he kept making sure I felt safe, holding hands, kissing me, and taking the lead on the conversation. We went back to mine and got intimate, and he stayed the night, had lunch with me, and left. In between our dates, we did not text as I wanted to give him space between to feel it out and see if he would take the lead.

The following week he (M 29) reached out and came over Saturday night. We went out for drinks, played games, flirted, and went back to my house for an intimate shower, where we both agreed we were connecting. The following morning we stayed in bed, watched movies, and I made us lunch. I did not want to suggest what we should do after as it was better to give space for him to leave if he wished too and I would respect that. He wanted us to go for a walk around the city and have coffee. It ended up being us strolling for hours, kissing, hugging, and holding hands. He was cuddling with me, we were joking and laughing a lot. We later decided to sit down somewhere, and my friend came by, and we had conversations with the people around us at the restaurant. We moved to another place, where he said he wanted to go, and my brain went fast and said, oh, after spending so much time with you, I felt strange about you leaving, but don't freak out it is just because I have had fun, and I know you need space alone as do I. He said it freaked him out a bit, and I assured him. It was not meant like that.

We (M29) (W31) started playing chess, and he (M29) suddenly wanted to play with my friend (W33) in the middle of the game, and I was surprised but told him it was fine then another guy came and asked to play with him. I told him it was ok as we both wanted to go home soon and it would probably be more fun. We were joking and playing as a team. He then wanted to go, and I said I would join as I also needed to go home. While we were standing outside the bar, him talking to one group and me another, he was asked if I was his wife, he said no, his girlfriend, and I said how sweet, but that it was not the case between the two of us, no one heard us speaking.

When we left, he reassured me that he did not think that. I told him (M 29) no worries, we just started meeting, and we were not there to make any decisions, but I liked him(M 29), and I (W 31) guessed he liked me too, he confirmed. But if he wanted to speak his mind, he could do so. He expressed he did not want a relationship and did not see me as being one for him and that the day had made him feel drained. It hurt my feelings, but I told him I understood, but I was open to it, and if the door is closed, it makes it a bit hard to move freely to the unknown. we took a taxi together, and I kept quiet, he kept telling me that there was nothing wrong with me, but he did not want one. I told him I understood and that we were adults and it was fine, and that I respected feelings, and asked if we should cut connections. When we got to min, he got out of the car to hug me and said maybe we could sleep on it. I said, if you know what you feel, it might be better to leave it. I told him I understood and hugged him and left.

He (M29) has not texted me since. My guy friend tells me to text him (M29) and see if he might have been embarrassed and that he might have felt hurt. However, my girlfriend tells me to leave it and never connect with him again. It has been two weeks...

E. Prochazkova, E. Sjak-Shie, F. Behrens, D. Lindh &amp; M. E. Kret

*Nature Human Behaviour (2021)*

&amp;#x200B;

Humans are social animals whose well-being is shaped by the ability to attract and connect with one another, often through brief interactions. In addition to physical features, a choreography of movements, physical reactions and subtle expressions may help promote attraction. Here, we measured the physiological dynamics between pairs of participants during real-life dating interactions outside the laboratory. Participants wore eye-tracking glasses with embedded cameras and devices to measure physiological signals including heart rate and skin conductance. We found that overt signals such as smiles, laughter, eye gaze or the mimicry of those signals were not significantly associated with attraction. Instead, attraction was predicted by synchrony in heart rate and skin conductance between partners, which are covert, unconscious and difficult to regulate. Our findings suggest that interacting partners’ attraction increases and decreases as their subconscious arousal levels rise and fall in synchrony.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qrhugb/interesting_its_ur_heart_beats_that_bring_u/
17,qri14k,1636625090,Is she losing interest? I'm confused lol,"Hi Reddit. So, a few weeks back, I met this girl at a bar. We chatted for a bit, the convo was flowing really well, and I managed to get her snap. 

Honestly, I had a great feeling about her. She was genuinely smiling, and most of the time we got to spend chatting was with her and I alone (her friends and mine dissapeared out of nowhere lol) btw I'm a bit of an introvert, she really made me feel confident about myself and I didn't feel forced to talk to her at any point. She on the other hand, is more open and preety much an extrovert. 

Anyway, next day, I knew after leaving the bar that I wanted to see her so I shoot her a text and she shows interest in seeing me again too which was great, so I setup a date. Couple days later, we meet at this cool restaurant where I got us a table (fancy but didn't look too romantic, I mean... Why play the romantic cards right away if we met in a bar and got to chat for a limited amount of time?) And most importantly I really wanted to get to know her and not force things and see if there was at least room for friendship.

As a result, the date went SOOO WELL. We got to know eachother, talk about literally everything and nothing for 5 HOURS. Time flew with her, but we were having a blast. She even said it mid-date as we saw time flying. Also, I could feel some form of mutual attraction in the date from the way she was looking at me (and the way I was too), there was even some lip biting going back and forth for most of the time. And we laughed quite a lot too that night. And sadly the tables were big AF so we were quite a part, so no physical contact was really made with all that was going on. 

Now comes the moment we say goodbye, sadly I wanna say... No kiss, but we kissed eachother on the cheek saying we'll see eachother soon. Then as she walked up to the bus she turned and gave me a genuinely happy/reassured look. Man I felt so good. I know the old insecure extra-introverted me would've NEVER go as far as I went (even getting her snap lol) 

Now it's my turn to get home, then when I arrive, I see that she sent me a message saying she had a great night and ended by ""hope we can see eachother back soon😘"" 

Made my night twice as good as it was lol. I reply and as she told me she had a busy week I thought I'd send her a message on the week end (a few days later), so I do, she lets me know when she's available, I suggest a good time where we could see eachother, then she leaves me on read for almost a week. I ask her if we should do this another time, while in the meantime not overthinking things and saying to myself like ""is she ghosting me or wtf? What have I done wrong?"" 

I mean ghosting would completely contradict what has seem to come out of the first date, if that makes sense.

Anyway, she gets back, and we end up agreeing on seeing eachother on the following Saturday (like 2 days later). I suggest a date idea, bowling and a cool place I know she'll enjoy, then nothing but a ""read"" Until sunday where she says sorry for not getting back and tells me she was partying all week end and she accidentally slept all day on Saturday. I tell her we'll take the week to get properly organized for the next date. 

We get to talk a little bit on snap the following days. Then the time comes for me to, (for the last time) set up our date. I tell her a date and a time but sadly she can't and she tells me when she's available and I see that we have a day off in common so I tell her ""Friday works perfect for me as well. My offer from last week end still stands, you never told me if that sounded good to you (oh yeah because I asked her in case bowling wasn't her thing)"" Then got a response back 2 or 3 days later saying she won't be available again. 

Idk, for as long as I have her snap and for as long as she doesn't say that she's not interested anymore, I don't see why I should be dropping the towel, because she seems to be showing a ""minimum"" of interest by suggesting other days we could see eachother and not straight up saying ""no I can't see you this week ."" Or ""I don't want to see you anymore"". By the way she suggested other possibilities of seeing eachother the next week, but she's preety much saying that every time. 

This time what I did, I left things on her to tell me when she'd be interested in seeing eachother. I told her the days I was available, so I guess it's her turn to tell me what day she wants to see me. If she says something it's cool, but if she doesn't I feel like I'll have to take it as a pass. I mean.. It's almost going to be a month since we had the first date and since she started pushing things back every week. 

At the same time I don't want to invest too much of my personal time on one person IF barley no effort is spent on her end to see eachother like she said she wanted to, but I also think about how good was the first date and how good the next one MIGHT be? 

So yeah I'm quite confused about all of that. Thanks for taking the time to read, I hope to get some clairvoyance out of this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qri14k/is_she_losing_interest_im_confused_lol/

We went on a date and it was like never before, you know you can just enjoy your true self without worrying about the other get concerned because she is basically the same.

It feels like we continued where we left.

So after the date something clicked in me and I just can't resist chatting with her, sometimes I feel like I am too much.

How do you know that you are going over the line? How do you stop yourself of chatting all day? I am afraid it might have a negative effect on us and our ""relationship""

Deleted the old posts out of respect for the other person.

There is this girl at university that I fell in love with, unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. But I already knew from the first meeting that she was the one.  
I confessed my feelings to her and told her that I hope for more than friendship. What can I say, I still can't believe it myself: She feels the same way ...  
She lived through the same thing as me and knew from the first meeting that our relationship is something special. We talked and cried for 3 hours, but she doesn't know what to do. She wanted to make it clear to me that she chose her boyfriend. But I knew that this was your lie and I also told her that, which she confirmed without much fighting. She also said things against her relationship with her boyfriend. She said she wished she hadn't met him so that it wouldn't be so hard with us and that if the time hadn't played against us, she would surely be with me today.  
We are left with nothing because she obviously doesn't know what she wants. But I think what she's doing to her boyfriend is wrong, he doesn't know anything about it yet. I also find it difficult when one develops such strong feelings for another man in a relationship. What do you think about that? Now my question is what should I do, I want to fight for our relationship ...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qriku0/update_i_25_in_love_with_a_woman_24_who_has_a/

Last night on the phone he told me that he thinks we should just be friends for the next little while as he sorts his life out and gets it back on track. He said he still cares about me and wants a life with me but that he cannot be the partner I deserve and want right now. 

I am so torn and don’t know what to do. A part of me wants to wait for him, but I know in my heart being just “his friend” would devastate me. And there’s no promise he would be with me again when he is ready.

Have any of you been in this position before? How did you cope? What did you decide to do?

TL;DR - Partner of 2 years wants to break up to focus on himself and his mental health and career. Wants to stay friends with the hopes of rekindling our relationship when he is more ready.

25,qrlc3m,1636637367,Weekend Trip with new GF for Birthday,"Dating 23F (me 29M) for almost 2 month. See her once a week (except this week twice). She started texting me very often for the last 2 weeks (initiating, fast responses, etc...), but before that she was veeery slow to respond.

Now I invited her to my birthday weekend and she said yes initially but canceled 2 days before weekend saying she was aaa little ""scared"" to meet all my friends and all, and after she told me she though it was the weekend after (seemed fake...) and made other plans.

Anyways, we had our date still that day and it went very well. Except for the part where she canceled on the weekend were i couldn't really hide my ""disappointment"". She even asked if we could see each other on the monday after that (which seemed like her trying to make up for it) but i say I would be probably busy (I was just a little annoyed at that time so I said that).

Anyways, after our date i took her home and he message to me was a little colder than usual. I replied that way too (both our message were still nice just a little shorter than usual and we just said good night).

Now I don't really know if I need to be initiating contact (she usually is, but I guess i have to do my part there too) or give her some space (as she canceled plans and was a little cold last night). With a step back, I understand perhaps the weekend was a little stressful for her but at the same time I am really frustrated that she canceled last minute and that she says she has other plans (2 parties) that she is going to instead of my birthday (even if i suspect she is using these also as an excuse not to go because she might be a little stressed out about going).

TL;DR: I want to establish online/phone communication with a girl I like -- to continue communicating with her after class ends (very soon). She hasn't responded to my Facebook friend request. On the chance that she doesn't check her Facebook. How do I proceed?

I (M25) like a girl (F21) in my class. I was able to strike up a 20-minute conversation with her. In the next class, her friend asked me for my number. I was able to save the situation by asking her to place all of us in a group chat -- on Facebook Messenger. I was able to use a class assignment as an excuse to create a Zoom meeting with the girl I like and a few others in the group; the Zoom meeting went well. Our class is ending very soon and I want to establish a connection with her on social media and etcetera before I may never see her again. The next day I decide to add the girl I like on Facebook -- since we're only connected on the group Messenger chat. It's been a day since I've sent the friend request and she hasn't added me back and now I'm wondering what my next move is?

Should I wait until I see her in person again to ask her for her number or Instagram (which is awkward since we are already technically connected on Messenger)?

Should I send her a direct message on Facebook Messenger and talk about some random school stuff?

30,qrm4r5,1636639829,Sharing my mini heartbreak,"We met on Tinder in August when I (24f) had travelled alone to the city he (24m) lives. That city is 700km away from mine. 

We hit it off immensely and got physical the second time we saw one another. I travelled once more to that city, and spent one night with him. 

We texted a lot in between, and talked to each other once or twice every week. We had so much in common. He appeared to be very interested in me - my vibe, my background, my work, my physical features, everything. It also went both ways. He had said multiple times that he will definitely come visit me in my city whenever he gets a break from work.

Last week he texted my saying he misses me and wishes he could see me. I told him that well, that’s fortunate, because I’m visiting a city 300km away from his in the following week and he can come catch me there on the weekend. He got pretty excited and told me that he couldn’t wait. 

Flash forward to two nights ago. He texted me saying that he wouldn’t come because he’s “working too much”, “needs some rest”, “it would be too much effort for something that wouldn’t last long anyway”. Even though we never officially dated or were serious in anyway, this kinda hurt. Did he *just* remember that he finds driving to be a hassle when he’d told me 100 times he wants to see me in a city a lot farther than this one? Did it *just* occur to him that he’s not willing to put in effort for something that wouldn’t last? I feel rejected and frankly, a little stupid for that I was excited to see him. 

Yeah so, that’s all that went down. I didn’t have that many people to tell about this, so I kinda needed to get it off my chest. I already had trust issues from an abusive ex, and I really didn’t want to carry the skepticism to this new phase of dating, but it seems like I should.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qrm4r5/sharing_my_mini_heartbreak/

I (23F) have recently been seeing a guy (26M) that I met from Hinge.

We’ve been seeing each other every week for a month and a bit now and I feel like it’s been going really well.

Recently even we’ve been acting a tiny bit more couple-y, the sex is great, I feel very comfortable opening up about things to him, we have a lot good meaningful convos about our backgrounds, past relationships, work, aspirations etc.

Neither of us have deleted our Hinge profiles yet though and I recently noticed that he’s updated his? 

I definitely plan to bring up whether he is talking/dating others next time we see each other to know where I stand but is too early for me to potentially ask for him to stop looking if he is? Or is it generally a bad sign already that he might be actively using Hinge still?


I wrote a whole “signs he likes me / signs he doesn’t” list and genuinely the signs that he does are 15+ and signs he doesn’t are like 2, which are both just based on the Hinge profile update.

I was reading up on different dating coaches theories and they outline how knowing multiple languages is seen as attractive. I wonder if it is universal  attractive trait or if its primarily a part of the Anglosphere.

For instance, there are some countries where people speak two or three languages. I believe that there might be no, ""Wow factor"" from knowing those languages. Since everyone is already capable of.

43,qrnqf3,1636644539,Men’s advice. The importance of framing a positive self-perception when interacting with strangers,"Utilizing social skills is often compared to physical exercise—the more you interact with others, the stronger your social skills will become.

However, the repetition aspect of social interaction is often what’s emphasized, not the ‘warm-up’ or preparation. It’s often encouraged to approach women with a certain line or faked energy, even if one’s confidence or mental state is less than ideal. The thought is that confidence and success will come from purely from repetition, after the initial fear of rejection has been met. However, this leads to endless approaches with the same result; guys often wonder when the confidence will eventually come, but what they don’t realize is that an initial insecure or negative self-perception sets the baseline for negative interactions.

When you go to the gym, play a sport, or physically compete with others, do you just run in without any preparation? Of course not—you stretch, you mentally outline how you’re going to approach things, you warm up. The same approach needs to be taken before you interact with a strangers, particularly women. They are highly perceptive to the energy you convey, which is determined by your state of mind. ‘Fake it to you make it’ does not work for long until the facade fades.

When you are interacting with a woman in public, your energy is far more critical than any line. How you feel is more important than what you say. You can have the best line on the world, but if you are unconfident, feel like you are bothering her, or outcome dependent, you will most likely fail.

Before going out and interacting with others, briefly visualize moments in your life that have made you feel the following ways. If you don’t have experiences to draw from, visualize a scenario where you would feel this way, an idealized version of yourself. Spend 30 seconds to a minute thinking of each scenario.

You are interesting. Think of what you do that makes you interesting or unique. Your passions, your hobbies, your knowledge or experiences. Get to the point that you feel like anyone you interact with will have

You are fun and whimsical. Think of ways that you irreverent and self/amusing, how you don’t take the opinions of others seriously. This is critical. You want to always interact with women with a genuine sense of fun and not taking the interaction too seriously, that you’re afraid of rejection.

You are attractive. Recall a few particularly positive interactions or compliments you received form women that really stood out and made you feel confident. Really get in tune with how it made you feel in the moment. I have had a couple of women tell me that they appreciate how masculine, yet fun and kind I was at the same time. Those really struck a chord with me, and what I reference mentally. If you don’t have these type of experiences, visualize what you would like women to say to you or treat you if you are the most attractive version of yourself. It might be difficult at first, but take a moment.

You might have other ways of getting yourself in the proper mental state, but always cultivate your self perception. Instead of worrying about bothering someone, you will view the interaction form the perspective that you are giving someone an experience they won’t have with anyone else.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qrnqf3/mens_advice_the_importance_of_framing_a_positive/

Last December I went on 3 days with someone, let’s call her C. Two video calls, one in-person date. The last date went hours later than she planned to be there because we were having such a good time, but then a few hours after it ended she sent me a very ambiguous text about maybe just being friends. Maybe a stupid part on my move but I asked a clarifying question about if she was saying she wanted to go on one more date to figure out her feelings or if she wanted to end things there. Well she ended up exploding on me, saying I need to learn to take no for an answer (note - we didn’t even touch during the date), and then blocked me on all social media. Whatever, I moved on.

In March, she texted me out of the blue apologizing for ending things so quickly and in the way that she did. That I didn’t deserve that. She asked if I wanted to talk as friends, I accepted the apology and apologized for anything wrong that I may have done and then we agreed to talk that weekend. Weekend comes and… nothing. I text her Sunday evening asking if she still wants to chat… and then I get blocked again. Whatever.

Well in September all of a sudden she shows up as a suggested person on Instagram (we didn’t share handles so she didn’t block me there). Out of curiosity I go to Facebook and notice I’m unblocked again. Then I notice she had created a Twitter account under her name that month. Completely blank account. A week later she makes 1 post about dating troubles, hasn’t posted a single thing since.

45,qrnvak,1636644930,Girlfriend Throws me Under the Bus at Times,"I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (19F) for a few months. We met at work. She asked me out. It's the first relationship for her, whereas, I've been in both serious and casual relationships.

Things between us are great. We flirt, we talk, we meet frequently and got a great sexual chemistry too. However, one thing which has happened a few times is ""whenever she's in trouble, she puts the blame on me as a get out of jail free card"".

To give you a context, she comes from a conservative family. While her parents know about us dating, they don't like us meeting too often (once a week max). Her parents also don't like her going out (they prefer us meeting at her home).

Both girlfriend and me prefer meeting a bit more and going out. So one time, we hadn't met for a while, and I mentioned ""I feel like meeting you"". She was home alone and invited me. Before I reached, her mom came. While walking up to her stairs, I could see gf and her mom talking. Her mom asked ""Why did you have to call him today"". GF said something along the lines of ""He wanted to meet and I couldn't say no (it was more like he forced to meet""

I heard that and was upset. Gf told me later she had to do it ""to make an excuse to her mother"".

A couple days back, we talked on call. It was after a few days, so we talked right till 4 in the morning. It was me who had to end the call saying ""Got work tomorrow. We should sleep"". We also had a fight during the call.

The next day, I went to meet her and while things were great and fun between us, I noticed a text on her phone (she gave me her phone to show something on WhatsApp). She had told one of her closest family members (who she shares everything with), that she felt sleepy whole day because ""I"" bugged her to talk and hence she couldn't sleep. 

Her relative replied somewhere along the lines of ""Sleep is important. Switch off your phone if he forces you to talk during sleep""

Now I didn't tell gf that I read it but it pissed me off. Anytime gf is at trouble, she easily makes me out to be the bad guy. She doesn't actually think I'm the bad guy because she stil keeps calling me at night to talk but she pushes me under the bus so easily that I'm worried if her conservative parents know we got physical, she might even accuse me of forcing her?

49,qro7su,1636645962,It was confirmed that I ruined things between us,"I'm a socially awkward 24 year old who's never been in a relationship before and only been on a few dates. I started talking to this really attractive guy on tinder two years ago. We both really liked each other. He told me that I was really hot and the cutest guy in town. We went on a date and made out a few times.

We kept texting afterwards and he told me that he was obsessed with me, falling for me, that he could see himself spending his life with me, and that he might be my perfect match. But I him lose all those feelings by being clingy and needy when he said that it seemed like I wasn't sure if I wanted to be with him because I said I was concerned that we might not be sexually compatible because he was very sexual while we were talking and I'm a virgin. And then I ruined it completely by not letting him have sex with me to see if he could get those feelings back.

I went back and forth between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me and being upset that I lost him. I messaged him on social media and asked him if he really liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me and he confirmed that he liked me and then I ruined it.

I had a really attractive guy who really liked me and of course I had to ruin it, like I ruin everything. I guess I don't deserve happiness in my life. It really pains me to know that I'll never be able to hold him or kiss him again.

Here’s the rub. My mother had the same diagnosis. It was not a good childhood for me. She was non compliant with treatment, she self medicated with drugs, gambling, whatever it be, with a few rehab stints, the last one ending in her taking her life when I was 21.  

I’m in my 40’s. While I had a very rough life, I’m a stable person. I’ve been through a lot of trauma, I surely have scars, but I’m stable, raising a child with a career, social life, all that stuff. 

I was very triggered finding out this information. I am happy he was honest. But I got literally scared. I do like him, and I am an empathetic person who doesn’t want to walk away because of his illness. Most would say “run” as it is early on. I don’t think that is the right thing to do.

I am afraid though. Having a mother with that disease was traumatizing. 

My plan is to have a talk with him explaining my experience with a mother with the same Illness and to lay down what I will and will not tolerate from this illness. Because the ones you love are often the targets, never ever the outside world .

A couple days pass by snd I ask her what she wants snd she said she doesn’t want something strictly casual and that a FWB would be something she would be interested in but she would want to set boundaries.

She said she was busy this weekend with work, but next week I said we should talk it out and set expectations, she wanted us to get STD tested too(something I’ve never done lol), and ya.

Like she used to have like such feminine characteristics and have beautiful long hair, wear cute clothes, she seemed so gentle, and now she’s more into of a punk aesthetic, she shaved her head, wears a lot of black, and like I wouldn’t like this girl if I didn’t know the old her. She was like more of a sunshine and now she’s like rocky and grungy.

This is all to say that I don’t know if I even like her either, so I feel like she wants to test out the waters without commitment or like being tied down, but I guess we’ll talk about it in person.

He hasn’t really ever given me a reason not to trust him. I do know that because of my OCD spirals there’s some things he won’t tell me because he doesn’t want to trigger me or cause me stress. 

Now to get to the question. We’ve been together for almost 4 years! I was raised in church all my life so i made the decision to not have sex (intercourse) until I was married. My fiancé has known this from the very beginning and is fine with it! Recently (&amp; I’ve been known this) he was watching porn (no biggie); however, I found a picture of a porn star in his phone and I went into a spiral because of that. So we decided that he wouldn’t watch porn anymore. He also said that he didn’t want to watch it because he didn’t want it to affect his sexual performance. I can tell he hasn’t been watching it (either at all or not as much ) because he’s always on me, constantly touching me and wanting to do sexual things, which I like.

Today, I had his phone and went through his email (I was looking for an email from one of our friends) so I looked in the spam email section and saw some spam emails saying stuff like “I’ll suck you off” and things
Of that nature. So I questioned him about it and he was like “they’re spam, I have not watched porn.” But like how did they get his email?

92,qrsdmw,1636657379,Has anyone used a dating coach before?,"I’m a 30/M whose dating history doesn’t have much beyond a four month relationship with a woman five years ago. Typically I will go on one or two dates per year via a dating app (which already seems a bit low) and if I like the woman I will follow up the next day only to receive from her the dreaded “there wasn’t any chemistry” or “I didn’t feel any sparks” text. When it comes to self-questioning, bringing up the typical speculation of “are the pictures on your profile honest?” or “do you smell?” or “do you talk too much?” doesn’t really help me, because those are questions I’ve already examined before and with honest friends too. Some of this may be in part because of the way online dating works, where many people expect intense and immediate sparks upon meeting a stranger and move on if it’s not present because they know the next date is just a swipe away. On the other hand, if I’ve been chronically single for so long there are probably factors of my own at play.

This leads me to wonder if an individualized approach would be better for empirically discovering what the actual problem is rather than asking for yet more speculation from strangers.

93,qrson0,1636658188,"I (M/27) Feel Like Women Respond to a Version of Me that I hate, and Unmatch the More Authentic Version of Me.","**Context** (you can skip this part if you want): A few years ago I started OLD after a long-term relationship. The first couple of years were miserable. I'd go weeks without matches and the overwhelming majority of matches that I got flamed out pretty quickly. Over a two-year period, I had one date and it didn't go anywhere. Since then, I've improved my quality of life outside of OLD, I've optimized my profiles with better pictures and prompts and I'm getting matches daily on all three sites. *HOWEVER*, while I managed to improve my profile to attract more matches, I still struggled to get dates with the women that I matched with... at least until recently. 

**Current Predicament:** So, I decided that I wanted to try to figure out where I was going wrong conversationally with my matches. I read (listened) to some audiobooks, I did some of my own research/ AB testing to see what worked and what didn't work. As a result, I'm seeing an uptick in my dates (I have two this weekend), women are sending me nudes, double and triple texting me, and the results seem to be paying off. The problem is that it is legitimately difficult for me to keep up the persona that women seem to be attracted to over an extended period of time. It is so far away from who I actually am. I'll give you some examples: 

&amp;#x200B;

**Things that women respond favorably to:** 

* Playfully arrogant humor
* negging
* sexually suggestive humor (depending on the site, vibe, and/or rapport) 
* douchey af fake connoisseur vibes 

**Things that will get me immediately unmatched:** 

* Joking about using/producing/selling hard drugs
* Self-deprecating humor
* Really any sort of joke that paints me in a ridiculous light for humorous effect 
* emotional vulnerability 

Here's the thing, I'm not ripping on myself all the time or trying to spill my guts to strangers, but I have lots of friends (men and women) and many of them would probably consider me to be one of their closest friends. I make strong connections with people and people are super comfortable being vulnerable with me and opening up which makes it easier to form meaningful relationships. Part of that is because of my natural tendency to be open, vulnerable, liberal, self-deprecating, non-judgemental, and to not try to out-alpha every guy I meet. So, it's just so counter-intuitive to try to shut all that shit down and to be a totally different person when I'm trying to attract a woman. And, to be clear, I get it. I get that emotional strength, masculinity, and confidence are all attractive qualities in men to women. I want to project those characteristics, but it just seems like there's no room for my more authentic, goofy, self-deprecating, emotionally open and vulnerable self.

94,qrspn6,1636658263,Should you only ask a girl out if you are very sure that they also have feelings for you?,"I have developed feelings for another intern at my internship. The internship will be ending soon, so I am thinking of asking her out on the last shift (to avoid any awkwardness if she says no and I still have to see her, and to be professional). She has done/does some things that are good signs/at least not bad signs (always eager to talk to me, long eye contact when talking, rembering facts about me, sometimes stands very close to me, etc). However, there is nothing she has done that makes it obvious that she likes me, so I am not very sure at all if that is the case. Should I still go for it/ask her out, or should you only do that if it is fairly obvious that they are into you?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qrspn6/should_you_only_ask_a_girl_out_if_you_are_very/

97,qrt0co,1636659079,I want to break up with my partner,"Where do I start, we have been together for two months now and it was going great until we got more comfortable being ourselves with each other. Of course there were some red flags I noticed early on, but I’m not perfect either so I just kind of ignored it. Recently I have gotten very tired of this relationship because it feels like I have to be like a parent to her since I have to tell her what she needs to do (college, etc.) and she’s in constant need of emotional support for problems she causes for herself. I can’t always be the strong one, I struggle myself quite a lot and I cannot carry two struggling people in one mind. This is my first relationship and I’m not enthusiastic to let it go especially after such a short time, but I have to, even if it means I’ll never find anyone else for years to come.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qrt0co/i_want_to_break_up_with_my_partner/
98,qrt8gs,1636659712,"Well, I just made a new friend.","I (19M) had this girl (about 24-25) who lives in the same condo resort as me walk past me with her dog about a week or two ago, and he growled and barked at me. I wasn't exactly nice about it though, and I have to admit I kinda overreacted (he was a small little dog, on a leash, and I was saying stuff like ""if he fucking bites me, he's gonna get it"", etc).

Come to find out a day later from one of my coworkers (53F) that she actually used to work at the same place I work now, about 6 months prior to me starting there, and that I also actually made her feel scared for her dog's safety. I felt bad after hearing that, and I decided I should talk to her, so she gave me her phone number for me to do so, which I did later on over text. She responded with forgiveness, which was glad for, but I also decided to just avoid her from then on, just to avoid potentially having another conflict.

Fast forward to a few days ago, my coworker from before, along with another coworker of mine (45M), ran into me after work one day, and they actually proposed to me that I try hanging out with this girl, and also smoking her out (apparently, she doesn't wanna smoke downtown with them at their places because there's cops patrolling, but she and I live out in the rural countryside where the cops very rarely ever come). The lady even offered to incentivize me by baking me a cake, supplying me with weed, etc, and the guy was talking up how I'd be hanging with a cute girl, etc.

I don't know why they were trying so hard to convince me, it sounded like a good idea to me from the start. I decided to take them up on that, and texted her asking if she wanted to get together and do something, and she responded by inviting me to come out with her on her nightly walk with her dog tomorrow. Then shortly afterwards she texted again saying that another coworker of mine (and ex coworker of hers) was coming over for pizza that afternoon, and she invited me over for that as well.

So I spent a couple hours at her place eating pizza and talking story. She mostly talked about her job and moving back into town again after she left, etc, and it was really interesting. She seemed like a pretty cool person, and I'm glad I decided to hit her up. Oh, and she gave me some treats to give her dog, and now he's totally calm with me.  Then after my coworker left, we went out on a walk, and we ended up stopping by at my workplace, where I decided to walk her around and give her a tour (of the outside of course, we didn't break in or anything). After that, I walked home with her and we talked for a little bit more before I petted her dog and gave her a hug goodnight.

I'm sure I'll definitely be hanging out with her again. Only thing is, it really seems to me like my coworkers were/are trying to set us up, like romantically. I'm not really feeling anything like that though, and I'm not getting any signs or signals from her either. Then again, we've only properly known each other for what, 2 days?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qrt8gs/well_i_just_made_a_new_friend/
