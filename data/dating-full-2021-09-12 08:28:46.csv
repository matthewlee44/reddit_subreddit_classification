When you spend time on dating multiple people with hope it will turn into something - it's a waste of time. You can't make anyone fall for you, no matter how hard you try.
2. If you date on popular apps - you chances are low. You can look at someone's pics and feel attracted but in reality there will be no right chemistry. If you still try to ""make it work"" because they physical appearance is attractive, you will end up bitter after multiple ghostings, breakcrumbings and other fancy words to describe the situation when two people don't match.
3. Each one of us have that one person in mind. Our hearts, our bodies - they know who that is. Follow it. 
4. When you go on dates with hope that in the meanwhile you meet someone right - you waste yours and the other person's time. None deserves that. 
5. When you casually hook up without telling the other person that it's just to kill the time until you meet someone right - it's cruel. Nothing justifies this. 

When you meet the right person, you will naturally know. Follow your heart in this, it does not make mistakes. When you have initial feeling that something is ""off"" - listen to that, it probably is.

We both had gone through recent breakups and were working on healing. Neither of us expected the feelings to grow, and they did. So we started talking about our future together, asking each other important relationship questions. We would talk to each other every chance we got. He was extremely loving and romantic with me, attentive. He was always asking me how my day was, if there was anything he could do to help, etc. This went on for about a month. 

One night he said he ran into a friend and they decided to see a movie. Something felt off but I ignored it. Three hours later he comes back saying they didn’t see a movie and they were sold out. ( ?? ) so he said he needs to think about stuff and go to bed. I asked if I should worry and he said he can’t answer that. (Uh?) So I left it at that and I went to sleep. The next morning he breaks up with me saying because of his depression issues he’s not emotionally reliable right now, and that maybe we could try again once things calm down for him, and we could be good friends.

Well we were trying that for awhile. It was painful af but I was doing it. Then a bit later he’d initiate sexual convos and I was confused thinking he wanted me back. I loved him so we ended up sexting a few times. He hinted at wanting a picture once but I’d always been shy. So I finally ask him once if he’d want one and he said “you need to remember we’re not dating.” (???) like no shit but dude you’re the one being fine with being sexual? And things felt off like he’d start to get really hot and cold with me. Sometimes he’d be so distant and give me one word answers, yet others he’d be initiating and sending me memes and talking so I was so very confused and hurt. Every time I’d feel something off, I’d ask him and he always reassured me I was fine. Yet during times when I would be spending time with a friend who happened to be male, he’d suddenly either start messaging me or want to show up. It happened a few times. 

So one night I find out from our mutual friend that he shared vulnerable messages I wrote to him and described me as “trying to date him” and that I wasn’t ready for a relationship emotionally ((?)) , he also told the friend we weren’t doing anything sexual which pissed me off because he broke my trust and lied to him and lied to me that things were fine. I also found out he was “kind of back together” with his ex, which he never told me. So I confronted him, he cried and said my message to him made him feel like he’d rather die, and that he’d do anything to keep me around as a friend. He said his feelings for me were genuine, and that his “ex” only started talking to him again that week. He said him and his ex “aren’t really going on, they’re just complicated” so I questioned that because he told me, that relationships weren’t on his mind at all because of his issues, and he said “I’m not in a safe place right now, so I can’t really commit to anything.” I’m having such a hard time trusting him, that it even feels like this is a lie. 

So he promised me he wouldn’t ever be dishonest with me again. So tonight I was trying to strike up casual convo, and he hits me with me “get some sleep”. At 1am, on a Saturday. I’m like if that’s you trying to tell me not to bother you, say so. He’s like you need sleep. (??)) So here we are. I really don’t understand this hot and cold dynamic and I’m hurt, tired, confused and sad.  

Tl;dr - Guy I had a thing with who is currently a friend is giving me a lot of hot and cold signals, he’s lied to me I confronted him, he cried and begged for me back. He’s initiated things sexually with me since breaking up despite talking to his ex again that he didn’t tell me about, yet claims he “can’t commit right now.”",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1002761,public,self,I’m so tired of this and I need advice.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmpc7n/im_so_tired_of_this_and_i_need_advice/,all_ads,6,,,

First of all, I must say that I am **NOT** a native speaker, so there could be many mistakes in my post. I apologize for that and hope you get my point :) 

I am 25 years old (male) and I am currently doing my Master's degree. I live in Germany, but I have moved plenty of times from one city to another one (due to my parents jobs). Till 2016, I never stayed more than 5 years in one city and I always had to find new friends and adapt to the new school etc. Finding a girlfriend on top of that was just not feasible for me. In 2016, I started my Bachelor's degree and this was the time, where I actually started looking for a girlfriend.

My main problem is the fact, that EVERY girl I know (through college, friends or at work) has a boyfriend. I am not joking around guys, it's the truth. My college degree program does not have many girls but at least 30 % of them are female. My Bachelor’s degree program was a bit complicated because you have to chose a specialization after the first semester. The one I chose was the least „popular“ one and there were only 40 persons in total and only 15 girls or so. Literally none of those 15 girls (at least the one's I considered attractive) were Single. I never asked them personally, but we follow each other on Social Media Apps or some of my friends were also their friends and knew their boyfriends personally etc. 

I seriously thought, that I would find my girlfriend in college, but that wasn't the case. I also had some project studies with several girls from college, where I had to work for more than 3 months with them (and get to know them better), but they were either not my type OR they already had a boyfriend. Even though I normally instantly lose interest, if they already have a boyfriend, I always tried to be friends with them and maybe get to know some of their female friends, but I quickly realized, that those college girls just ""need"" you for help e.g. giving them old exams or helping them during exam periods. Some of those college girls were totally isolated and had no friends at all. 

In my opinion most of those college girls wanted to ""exploit"" me because I am a rather chill and open-minded person, who likes to share stuff regarding college. In the end, I deleted their numbers and realized that they weren't interested in friendship. Now you might call me a ""bad person"" for not constantly helping them, but it just doesn't make ANY sense to me, to help them if they don't even want to be friends with me and only text me, if they need some college stuff. I am not their personal baby-sitter, who makes sure that they get their college degree and to be honest, no one helped me during my whole Bachelor's degree.

That's the college part. Now I don't have many people I could consider to be my „real friends"". Sure, I have some guys who are friendly and who were my college mates and we hang out during lectures, but I never had a real friend who would go out with me on a regular basis e.g. go to a club every weekend. I have three guys who are 3 years older than me (also Single, but they literally don't care at all) and who rarely go out with me (have a drink and so on), but that's it. I sometimes go to house parties, but it's always the same. There are ALWAYS the same girls (who are already taken) and guys and it's just a waste of time. I will not be able to meet new people or find a girlfriend through my ""friends"". I must admit, that I was never so lonely before and NEVER had problems finding friends. I was quite ""popular"" in my hometown (were I graduated from high school) and I wouldn't be single there. Life there regarding girls was so much easier, even though the city is way smaller than the current one.  

Besides college and my ""circle of friends"", I really had high hopes to find a girl at work. I started to work as a working student in a big company, but the only girl in my department is not single and isn't my type either. 

I was so desperate that I started using Online Dating Apps, such as Tinder, Bumble, Badoo or Jodel (Jodel isn't a real dating app, but you can meet new people there). I dated 18 different girls, some of them more than once, but most of the time, they weren't looking for a serious relationship, wanted ""fun“, were only looking for friends or they were just not my type (thanks to Filters everybody can look like a different person nowadays). In the end, I deleted all dating apps and I will never use them again. It’s just a waste of time for a guy because you have to compete with many, many guys and sometimes you get ghosted as well.  Nevertheless, I could gather some dating experience and I have no problems talking to girls or having a conversation with them. Sure, 18 different girls are not a lot, but at least I gathered some experience.

Unfortunately, I don’t have a brother who could give me some advice or help me in some way. I only have an older sister who also struggles to find a partner. I can't go with her to a club or so because she isn't the person for that and let's be honest, using your older sister as a wingwoman is just not a good idea...

I am not constantly looking for a girlfriend and I wouldn’t consider myself as „frustrated“ (at least no one would ever know my feelings if they get to know me in person). I am a very open minded, rather lighthearted person who likes to hang put with people, but the last two years were exhausting for me. Dating gets way more difficult if you get older because most of the girls tend to have a boyfriend if they get older. It’s simple math in my opinion. I wouldn’t mind if my girlfriend is 3-4 years younger than me, but I never meet girls who are in that age range.  

My problem still remains and I don't know what to do. I have never approached a girl in real life because I always think that they are not single and in my mind it's a waste of time. This is especially true for attractive girls because I always think, that they MUST have a boyfriend, if rather unattractive girls also manage to have a boyfriend. I am really afraid, that I will not be able to find a partner and I don’t want to be Single in my early 30’s. I really take care of my appearance because I know, that most girls want an attractive partner. I always wear nice clothes, my hair is always in shape and I work out. 

Is here anyone else in the same situation and has already found a solution?

Things weren’t great at the beginning because of differences in personality and ideals etc. Despite these, we found job in each other’s company, having travelled to many foreign lands together, attended fascinating cultural events together, and having a semblance of a domestic life together when he was living in my town. Although we never lived with each other, there was some sort of domestic life as he had his place and I would go up to sleepover frequently. 

He was living in my town for about 8 years and he was frankly sick of it by the time we met. I was thankful that he stuck around for another 4-5 years to work whilst dating me.

However, he was frequently bemoaning the pain of living in my town because of various cultural reasons and he wanted to move back home. As much as I wanted to leave with him, I was either in school or couldn’t find a job in his town. So 2 years ago he left home for good and everything was suspended in the air. 

We discussed and decided on having an open relationship. The openness was something quite vague although I was careful to not fall in love with the guys I dated and he was committed / loyal with me throughout. I don’t doubt his loyalty as he had proven his commitment to me during our time together. 

We did not have a plan together and we did not discuss one either. He was waiting for me to settle down in wherever and he would make plans around it. This uncertainty was made worse because of the pandemic, making cross continental travel all but impossible. In fact, we did not see each other for 1.5 years due to that. The last time we met was in March 2020, and since then we have only communicated through text messages and phone calls. I was losing faith that this relationship would ever go anywhere because neither of us had made an concrete plans. 

A few months ago I received a scholarship to pursue postgraduate in a country near his. To make the most out of my time before school, I left my job early and flew to his hometown just to spend time with him. When he tried to be intimate, I could not feel the desire to be intimate with him. I was annoyed and disappointed by several of his behaviours which made me more certain that things are never going to be better with him. 

So two nights ago I told him everything: how I desire to be free now that things have changed and that I no longer felt that love and affection with him. It was heartbreaking to say the least because it took me such a long time to come to the realisation that it was time to move on. My friends on different occasions have been telling me to move on and leave, but I was denying it all along. I think part of me was unwilling to hurt him but another selfish part of me was aware that the only way I can find true happiness is to leave him. 

So I did. It hurts for both of us. I still love him but I don’t think we should be together anymore. And I hope that I have the strength to go through this grief and loss.

And we did this for the next three days, and we talked at school.

So like on the fourth day, we were talking as usual but then there was this dead silence, and I tool another leap of faith and said...

""Yo, like I really like you and we have a really great vibe together. You are the most fun and interesting girl I have ever met and would you like to go with me for coffee sometime?""

And she rejected it?????????????

And we haven't talked since, which is about a day and  a half.

And I can't understand, why did she do that? Like she clearly liked me, she was flirting with me and I was flirting back, she indirectly told me she liked me many times both over text and in person and she was even saying stuff like ""oh you are so cool"", ""I have never met a boy more interesting than you"" and ""you are really funny"" and all kinds of crap.

My Opinion : 

I feel like You don’t and you can’t. We can’t predict the future. Relationships can fail for all sorts of reasons. The insistence on absolute assurance of “happily ever after” is unhealthy, I think, because it obscures a rather important truth:

Successful relationships take work. Lots of work. Lots of hard work. Lots of work that you resist and really don’t want to do. It isn’t all “fall in love and everything works out magically

So you can’t know that you’ve found the one you’ll spend the rest of your life with.

BUT: you can get a pretty good sense that you’ve found a compatible partner, with enough commitment, maturity, and healthy sense of humor to do the work to maximize the relationship.

Hello Reddit.

I am looking for subjective opinion on my current situation.

Essentially, I work with Sarah (F24). I first met her after working on a project together. Being two young professionals, we worked well and the office noticed. Some even passing comments on how we should go out. We both laughed this off. Anyway, about five weeks ago, I took her home and asked her for a date and a number. She refused to give me her number, but did say to find her on social media (I understand that some people prefer an open platform, than that of a personal mobile number). I found her on social media and we started to speak.

The first thing I noticed about her was that her replies where horrendously delayed. I am talking hours. I was a little love struck, so I brushed it off. Sarah stated she had gone back to her home town which was a few hours away, and due to seeing her family, wasn't using her phone much. I totally get this. She did give me her personal mobile number after a few day of speaking, so I felt it was progressing a little. About a week later, I felt like she wasn't interested so I decided to stop texting also via Snapchat, for my own respect and pride. We didn't speak again for about two weeks, so I decided to remove her from my Snapchat (as I like to only have people on their I genuinely talk to almost everyday). About another two weeks passed again, and I suddenly get a random text from her, asking how I am and how is work. We speak briefly, in which she confirmed she was back in town and would be in work the following week. I asked her if she wanted to get a catch up drink, but she stated she was busy the next day, or she would have. The next day, a colleague told me that I should ask again, but give a few days choice, and if she wasn't interested, she would probably stated she was busy every day. I asked, and the following morning (yes, this is how delayed her replies are), stated she would like to go.

We went out to a nice restaurant. She called it the first date, not me, so I thought it was a good sign. We spoke for two and a half hours over dinner. She admitted an extremely troubled passed which included a four year relationship, which ended in 2019, were she was punched, kicked, spat at, headbutted, etc. Sarah also detailed that dating has not been any better since that relationship ended, dating lads who were creepy and cheaters from the start. One thing I did find extremely strange, was a man she was dating, who was also dating number others behind her back, and she still went back with him. This to me is a major red flag, as it details that she likes chaotic lifestyles. Anyway, I took her home, and she was in no rush to get out of my car, sitting in it for another twenty/thirty minutes. I asked her if she wanted a second date, to which she replied, playfully ""If you are lucky"". After she exited my car, she went into her apartment and I went home. We text back and forth for the night, before I fell asleep.

The following morning, she text me again. She thanked me for the date and stated she had a lovely time. I text back saying she was welcome, and if she wanted to do it again. She never replied. I text her later that day seeing how her day was and she replied. We spoke a little again, before I went to bed.

The following day, she was back in work. Supervision were made aware of our dating as per the businesses policy on workplace relationships, which protect her and I. The day was professional and we spoke a little about the date. As Sarah does not have a car, I took her home. Sarah said she liked teasing me as when you ""get together"" it is like being married already. I found this funny and promising.

On Friday, I asked her what her feelings were towards all of our dating. She admitted she did not know, as she likes to shut down, to prevent getting hurt. I get this, as her previous relationships have been awful. She text me last night, after attending a festival, stating she wanted her bed and company. I was working, so I couldn't come and wouldn't anyway if she was intoxicated. This morning, she told me her friend had bailed the second day of the festival, which is travelling to, and is going alone. I find it strange because if I was her, I'd rather see the person I am dating.

A little backstory is...things have been rough lately. Communication hasn't been great.

But, today, he came over to my house. It's the first time I had seen him in a while. It's kind of amazing how easy it is to pick right back up with each other...when it feels like things have been so off lately.

But, ultimately, I decided it was time to have The Conversation with him. Nothing as cringe-worthy as ""What are we?"" Gosh no, and frankly, I don't even care about those labels. But...I did convey to him what I wanted from him, how often I want to see him, and that I felt like I wasn't asking too much. My main point that I told him was that I didn't think I was asking too much.

His responses, as follows:

1. He pointed out that I had traveled to his town, without telling him. Now, this was a conversation we had already hashed out, but in my defense...I was there, on a Tuesday during the day, and I presumed him to be working. (I was wrong) He said that it didn't hurt to ask.
2. He then said that he thought my toilet needed to a new flipper/flapper? Asked if I heard it running on and off.
3. Coming somewhat back to topic, he groans: ""God, it was such a busy summer.""
4. Gonna provide some context here. He had been giving me grief about a decor piece of mine all afternoon. About how it was functionally incorrect, would make more sense on another wall, and so on and so forth. I told him that I didn't care about the functionality of it, and I put it where I put it, because I liked the look of it. End stop. But, he wouldn't let it go.

So, at this point, after the ""God, it was such a busy summer."" And then a couple of minutes of silence, he says, ""You know what? I'm starting to come around to it. I'm even starting to think it's pretty."" My interpretation of this was it was some sort of olive branch/buttering me up situation.

And...that was pretty much the end of the conversation, as it moved on from there. He never actually addressed my concerns head on. I had mentally prepared myself for his response. ""Maybe we shouldn't see each other anymore."" or ""I can't be as communicative as you want me to be."" or on the better side of things, ""You're right, you deserve better."" or....anything.

So, I really don't know where he stands with what I had to say. His attitude didn't really seem to ""change"" after the conversation. I know some men can get quiet or grumpy. He seemed fine. He was just as talkative and touchy-feely as before. He did ask about (maybe) going to dinner this week. And, we made tentative plans for that. I kind of feel like...whatever happens with that might say a lot. Is he going to make an effort? Is he going to rise to the occasion?

A couple of things that came up over the course of the afternoon that....they may have been nothing, but they sort of prickled my spidey sense. And this may be one of those things where I am overthinking and if I am, feel free to say.

1. He mentioned that I should move overseas for a couple of years. He added that I would be considered ""exotic"" over there.
2. I was talking about getting food, and he said I should probably put on some clothes first. He then said. ""Or maybe the guy at the window will be a hot guy.""

Now, I think the above were jokes, I know they were. But I guess...even in jest, I don't know why he would talk about me trying to appeal to other guys.

3) Back to that stupid piece of decor. So, he actually said ""If I come back here again, I hope you don't take it down."" If. I'm sorry, if? In the next portion of the conversation, he corrected himself and said, ""Next time I will plan..."" blah blah. But, the fact that his first instinct is ""If I come back here"" is a little worrisome.

Again, I may be dissecting words at this point, and making a mountain out of a molehill. But, they are things I picked up on.

Am I getting myself in a tizzy over nothing?

We talked quite a bit about the wedding and he told me he felt like we really clicked and he wanted to ask me out that night. But he didn’t because he’s never been one to chase after other people’s girlfriends.

So we had a nice dinner and drinks and by the end of the evening he was holding my hand as he walked me to my car. He asked me if we could get together again next weekend and I said of course. Then he kissed me on the cheek but I grabbed him and gave him a real kiss goodnight. He was a little surprised but he ended up kissing me  back. It was the best kiss I think I’ve ever had.

Last month (m 24) I was talking with a girl (f 20), there was a kiss involved and she was able to make me fall for her even though she was the one who approached me. 
After noticing mixed signals I asked about them and she said she didn’t want to commit because she probably had to move for uni. ( even though I am certain that she had fallen for another guy). 

Yesterday a common friend said that she didn’t pass the exam needed to go for uni and said that she’s realizing that the guy isn’t into her, and to expect a message in the following weeks. I honestly even though I still like her A LOT I don’t like being the second option and I don’t appreciate the fact that in order to not dump me she said a series of lies to me.

This guy is also from the countryside, but he’s living in my nearest city at the moment. This city is about an hour and a half away when driving, but I don’t have access to a car all the time so I take the bus (which takes two and a half hours). 

As somebody who has lived in this city and now lives in the countryside again, I can understand why this guy expects me to come to him rather than the other way around. After all, in the city there’s a lot more to do and it’s a more fun environment. 

However, this is the third date now and he still doesn’t seem interested in actually travelling to meet *me*. Rather, he is staying where he is and I’m travelling to meet him. 

Normally, when it comes to dating, I think it should be 50/50 during the early stages (until you’re in a proper relationship, in which case I feel like it’s more acceptable for one to travel more than the other because you’ve already established that you both want to spend time together). 

We’re going on the third date next week, and I think it’s kind of presumed that I will travel to the city again. I travelled back and forth throughout college, and the hotels are pretty cheap, so it’s not really a money issue. 

I’m just a bit worried that if this guy had to go out of his way to meet up with me, rather than the other way around, he just wouldn’t be that bothered about seeing me. I don’t feel like I can really bring this up without sounding insecure, especially for only a third date.

I’ve taken a different approach to online dating in the past few months and my success rate for securing and going on dates has gone way up. I went from not getting many dates to getting at least 3 a week. I’ll share here in hopes that you too might find success in this method.

Assuming everything about your OLD profile checks out (5-6 good pictures and bio, some prompts to start a little small talk), I’ve found that asking for a date within the first 3-4 messages must be the best way to go about getting dates online. It also circumvents a few big problems guys have when OLD. I’ll talk in detail below.

If the girl responds to you after an initial hello text , steer the conversation immediately to an activity that could prompt asking for a date. Ex:

M: Hi Sarah!
F: Hi Sam! How’re you?
M: I’m good! Do you like ______?
F: *affirms or denies liking said activity*

If they like the activity, easy peezy! Ask her out!

M: Want to (do said activity) with me this week? I know of a few good places in the area to (do said activity).
F: *affirms or denies interest in doing said activity with you*

Then, ask for her number or other contact info. FaceTime to ensure she isn’t a catfish.

This method eliminates these problems for all of you guys looking to date:

1. Using the platform as a method to get to know a girl. I’m of the impression that online personas are fake. Most messages and social media don’t represent how you two may hit it off IRL. Limit the interaction via the app- you’ll weed out girls who are only looking to chat online while taking their time to swipe on more guys.

2. Validation. You ever feel like a girl is just right swiping on you because she wants to know she’s cute? This method stops that. Get to the point of going on a date- if she refutes, she’s not using the app to date, which is not the point of dating apps. You might hear “Sounds great, I just need more time to get to know you.” Refer to point 1 (and continue to assume your profile gives her ample opportunity to ask you about yourself)

I might edit this post. Hopefully it helps some of you guys to secure a date!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1003010,public,self,A take on online dating,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmsb4f/a_take_on_online_dating/,all_ads,6,,,

He's a bit older than me (I'm 23 and he is 38, not sure if it matters but we're both guys), but we really got along and I really appreciated his company.   


After the dinner, which he paid (I offered to pay my part - I don't really like getting my meals paid, but he insisted, so I let him), we went to his Airbnb, talked for like 2 hours straight.  


He offered me some tea, and then things got steamy and we almost had sex, I mean, we did oral to eachother, but not penetration.   


He was very tired because he had arrived the night before from Switzerland (We're in Portugal, by the way), and I couldn't make him cum. I also didn't cum, but I never do, idk why, I just get really nervous.   


I'm not sure if I did something wrong? He was always complementing my body, saying I was hot and everything he liked, but I mean... I'm not dumb, a lot of guys said that to me and then never really showed any interest. I don't think I'm ugly, I have a slim body, kinda cute face, nothing special.  


After that, almost 1am I catched an Uber (he also wanted do pay my Uber but that was where I drew the line, I really wasn't confortable with him paying everything, although I know he had a lot of money), so I paid my own Uber.

When I got home, I sent him a message saying I arrived safelly. He said: ''Great! That's awesome, good night, sleep tight'' and sent me a kissing emoji. I said: ''Thanks, you too!'' and we went to sleep.  


Today, I didn't messaged him because I wasn't sure on how he felt, but he texted me at 11am saying ''Have a great Sunday!'' and I answered him: ''Thank you, wish you the same!''  


I went out alone today, as I usually do, and posted some instagram stories, which he saw. Does that mean he's interested? Should I call him out on a second date? I'm really bad at this kind of situations, lol, can someone please help me on what I should do or say?  


I might add:  I'm kinda sensitive. Ok, REALLY sensitive. He's on a work trip, so he's gonna stay here in Lisbon until December, so I don't know if I should go out with him anymore, because if I start catching feelings and then he leaves, I know I'm going to be an emotional wreck for at least 2-3 months.

I'm doing pretty good but this thing is really nagging at me. I've been dating this girl exclusively for two years now. We're both 30 years old already so we're both under pressure to settle down. She already confessed and also consistently shows her love and care for me and she explicitly said that she respects the fact that I want to take my time to officially commit to us. I am dating to marry and start a family after all. 

I sincerely care for her. However, I have a few things that I was strictly looking for in a partner before I met her - being smart/wise, being strong (someone you'd see as an achiever), and not being too clingy (someone who welcomes some time apart to individually work on ourselves including our careers), but unfortunately, I don't think she ticks the boxes. I'm also worried about how good of a mother she will be in the practical sense. We've lived together for a while before and it became obvious that she is kind of careless (doors unlocked, water/appliances left running, food safety issues, etc.). I realized all these late (or maybe I subconsciously chose to try to overlook them and failed) and now I'm not sure what to do. I wonder if these are just trivial stuff and I'm being worried for nothing but I can't think of a way to reassure myself. I really do not want to risk committing to marriage if I knew there's a huge chance it would be unhealthy. On the other end, I do not want to lose and hurt her if it turns out I'm just being silly about all these. There's also the time pressure that is keeping me from ending things carelessly.

It feels like I'm forced to play games in order to keep the dating going, and that is because the other girls were the first one to test me and put challenges. I dated two girls which lived alone and none of the two were willing to have sex in their homes, even though I tried to flirt with them into it. All of everybody I know that got into serious relationships, never got tested or went through games with their partners. And I want that. My best friend tells me that I'm the one that goes after girls with problems. But in one case, there was literally a girl who came to me and gave me my number, which baffled him. We dated for a few days before i called it quits. Everything was going great, we held hands, went into romantic dates, until one moment when she said that she wasn't interested on me, even though she was looking forward to date me and it was really confusing. And then when I got a shiver down my spine and moved my head a bit, she misunderstood it as I was going to kiss her and she reacted by turning her head in blink of an eye, which left me a bitter taste, and never called her. What if I was going to kiss her? Every time that things seem to head to somewhere I get left with a turnover of the events. It makes me wonder if I have a sign written on my head that says go ahead and play me and then leave. Dating should be about having fun for me, not enrolling to some CIA program were everyone is an enemy. Now I don't know how to deal with it any with it anymore.

I have always been a lonely person- been through an abusive relationship, got out- and immersed myself in an online game where I met someone. He was always polite and kind and things got further. Due to covid we haven't been able to meet although I wanted it very much, so promises were being made, fantasies and so on. We liked to call each other a couple but I guess we never were one. We used to talk every day, tell me about his day, me telling him about my day, etc. He is a separated man with 2 children mainly divided between both of them but he always made time for me. Recently I have become more fustrated due to the fact he was avoiding meeting... I am 33 and he is 47 years old (age gap, I know).. I became more fustrated towards him and so was he.... recently he more than me decided to be just friends- I tried to, although I did not agree it- but he was colder every day, until this morning when he said he is quitting everything and wishing me all the luck in the world. I told him everytime that this is becoming harder and he always tried more and we ended up with the same argument every time. 

I know what is the hard reality but I do not want to hear it or see it yet... I don't know how to cope with  this and don-t know how to react. I don't know why this is happening to me and I wish to stop hurting. I wish I was not that naibe and be more mature about it... but it hurts so damn much.... I have no friends, moved to a foreign country 3 years ago and focused only on work, and then covid happened and then the online game happened and then him... He seemed such a nice and understanding guy, and was always there, but as always I push everyone away.

I just don't understand how someone can change so fast...

I know it's me.... and I want this to stop, I want to be a more selfish person.

I thought maybe she was really comfortable but she was completely as usual later. I didn't try for anything else after that.

Met a girl at work who started to sit next to me on break and talk to me everyday we worked together. 

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me she hadn’t really been in a relationship and had never even held hands with anyone. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1003236,public,self,Is it possible she was telling the truth and is just as upset as I am?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmuwa4/is_it_possible_she_was_telling_the_truth_and_is/,all_ads,6,,,

- He respects that I am not ready, so the alternative would be to allow him to have sex outside of the relationship. He is willing to wait a few more years for me but I am not sure when I will be ready (even more so now since I feel pressured).

- He still loves me and want to have sex because it is important to test out our sexual compatibility.

He is my first boyfriend and my first for almost everything relationship-wise.

He still cares about me and thinks I am beautiful and amazing, but he's afraid he will hurt me if we go on as a couple. We cried a lot, we kissed and hugged one last time and I let him go.

Back in October last year, I matched with this girl on Tinder and we chatted for a while. It was fun because she was very talkative and made some good jokes. She had my attention for the upcoming days and I wasn't really texting anybody else because I was pretty satisfied talking to her only. We set up a date like a week later, and by then I was unsure about whether I liked her or not. I didn't like her looks that much, to be honest. I was told this was a shallow way of thinking back then.

I would eventually take gradually longer to respond to her texts...I wasn't feeling it anymore. She began sending me texts asking me to not take so long to get back to her because she got worried (she said this was because of my motorcycle riding, but she eventually admitted this was due to her trust issues.) I said I'd try to answer her texts, but I didn't. I didn't tell her why I was taking so long. I felt a bit guilty, but I just wanted to spend some time on my own - I do that a lot. I don't have the habit of telling people this. I just leave my phone and go for a walk, and I could be back 5 minutes later...or I could be back hours later. I never know how long I'm gonna take.

Our conversations pretty much died because there wasn't much we could talk about anymore and I wasn't putting too much effort into them. I eventually started ignoring her texts altogether. She texted me like a month later and I still ignored her. I definitely feel like the asshole here.

That being said, back in May this year I had already been going through a lot of introspection for a while and I figured I'd text her and apologize. I was as honest as possible, although I didn't want to tell her I wasn't feeling it. I didn't lie to her though, as there were other reasons. I didn't intend in dating her again, although I did have this gut feeling that she could be a great match for me due to what I thought were her core values. She said it was all fine and that I hadn't done anything too bad. She was just confused, but thought I had my reasons.

I began developing feelings for her some time later and decided I wanted to date her again, but I knew she would probably not want to. I knew I had to be very honest with her. We had been texting for a while, but she seemed a bit cold, so I told her I wanted to talk about what I felt...and that I'd leave her alone if she wanted me to. I really would've left her alone if she wanted me to.

So we talked, and she seemed pretty cool with everything. For the next few days, she would flirt with me subtly, then pull back...it was pretty weird. Until one day we just talked for hours about things and we came to a conclusion. She figured I was being honest, and I really was, and she wanted to try things out again.

Everything was fine for the upcoming 2-3 weeks. We had been flirting a lot. She changed immediately and had become very loving as opposed to the rather cold person with mixed signals she was before our conversation.

That said, she wanted me to meet her parents before we began dating again. I thought that was way too early, but I wanted her to know I was being honest and I figured facing her parents (who would be skeptical of me) would be the right thing to do.

I went to her house, met her parents and everything was fine until I went home. She texted me saying everything was fine, but I stayed way too long and that she'd tell me the house rules for the next time. I had no idea how long I should stay since I had never met anyone's parents before, and she had never brought someone over for that purpose either.

A few days later she asked me why I wasn't going to an university yet and that she'd want me to be ""on her level"", ""maybe even ahead of her"" but ""never behind her.""

Another few days later we went on another date and things felt pretty cold. I questioned that over text and she said she wasn't feeling any chemistry between us; she said we had too many differences. She said she enjoyed watching movies while I didn't; she doesn't like motorcycles while I do. We met up in person to talk things over and I told her I thought that aside from the chemistry thing, I thought these reasons were very shallow and that I'd try to make things work, but that I can't do anything if she doesn't want me to. We agreed on being friends and that was it. She said I was lucky she hadn't blocked me, as she will block people for lesser reasons than those.

We barely texted at all after that, just a short conversation every here and there. I thought we were on good terms until she suddenly blocked me.

But the truth, most men have NO IDEA why they choose the women they do. Which is why when you ask a guy what he wants in a partner, he’ll describe someone very different than the woman he ends up with.

Research into the male brain has discovered that men choose women based on ONE THING: Whether or not he’s INFATUATED with you If you can’t trigger infatuation in a guy... No amount of trying to CONVINCE him how wonderful you are will make him choose you But… If you CAN make him infatuated… By tapping into his primal infatuation instinct…

He’ll completely lose control over you… And will go to desperate, even embarrassing lengths to secure your love Researchers at Rutgers University recently discovered an emotional tripwire in the female brain… Once you set off this tripwire… It wakes up a powerful urge inside a man…

Which completely focuses his attention on you…Wiping all ‘logical’ concerns out of his mind And making him ABSOLUTELY SURE you’re the one for him That’s why it doesn’t matter if you’re his ‘perfect girl’… Or if you have all the qualities he THINKS he wants… You just need to set off this tripwire… And he’s yours.

Secondly, I feel like I've been spending more money. I asked him out on our first date and paid for him, which I didn't mind because I had asked him. Since then, we haven't gone on a formal date. And by formal, I mean like him taking me to dinner or something. We have hung out and gone to the pool and just been outdoors and stuff. We took a day trip to go hiking and I paid for the rental car and park entrance fee. He paid for McDonald's breakfast, parking, and gas. At the end, I paid $35 more than him, total.

When we got back to town and were getting dinner, we went to 2 separate fast food restaurants because we were craving separate things. He paid for his meal and he didn't offer to pay for mine. When I asked him if he was going to pay for mine, he asked me how much it was first, so I said never-mind.

He just came back from a boy's trip before we went on our hiking trip, and I know he has mentioned that he is going to start being better with his money and saving more, but I feel like if he has money to travel with his boys, he can have money to date me.

I know things should be an ""equal exchange"" and one person shouldn't be doing all the work, but I guess I mean to say I've never met a guy who WANTS to put in work, and I've met guys in all age ranges and walks of life.

Problem being we haven't met, reasons being I haven't quite been vocal about it and might have mentioned it twice with no serious intentions, she on the other hand has this notion of having to get to know someone to a certain extent then meet them IRL, level of knowing unknown reasons for having this prerequisite unknown. 
I kinda seem to wander off and loose interest though for the time being I have restricted my female interactions to just her, so that I don't get this feeling I didn't try enough.
