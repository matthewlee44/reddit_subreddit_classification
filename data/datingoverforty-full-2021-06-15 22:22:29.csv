 I thought perhaps this thread would have some wisdom for me, it just sounds different coming from a 40 year old. 

He texts me the he misses me every time we're apart. We spend the day with each other, he drives home, and within a couple of hours he texts me ""I miss you"". If two or three days go by, he texts me things like, ""Want company?"" or ""Can't wait to see you again,"" and gives me lots of nice compliments*. I don't respond positively to those texts or sometimes even acknowledge them. Currently, I haven't seen him in four days. We were spending a loooooot of time together, and I wasn't getting my shit taken care of, so I needed to get back into alone time and be productive. These four days are driving him crazy. Just bonkers. He starts off the day without any information from me:
""I'm not gonna see you today am I?"" 
Then he tells me, out of the blue, no conversation happening thst would make this a sensible thing to say: 
""I'm just going to put this out there, but your like a drug, my brain releases oxytocin when I'm with you, as well as all the other feel good signals
And I'm going through withdrawals from not being with you. ""
I told him he was acting like he's infatuated, and that I'm not responsible for those feelings and not to put them on me because I dobt feel the same way. He said he understood, that he could see he was being needy. 
Then later on he says, after begging me to let him come over and telling me how horny he is, ""Do your thing, we can talk later. But I want to be with you cuz on the inside I feel like I've been dumped. I just want you. Please don't push me out of your life"" 

Dude. It's been four days. We've been dating six weeks. We text all day long. 

Can anyone help me understand why this makes my skin crawl? I want to be able to articulate it to him in a constructive way, he does take feedback really well and I want to give him the chance to make changes before I give up/run away. 


*I'm pretty blunt, so I've told him I don't like it, that if I want visitors, I'll do the inviting, and asking if I want company implies that it might not have occurred to me that I did want company and would like the suggestion, as if the only reason wed be hanging out is becasue he suggested that I might want company, and not becasue I invited him over myself.

I don’t look my age (44F) and I’m always told I look like I’m in my 20s, even by people who meet me in person. It’s both a blessing and a curse. 80% of the men that match me are under the age of 30 (not going there) and 15% are over the age of 60 (not going there either) which leaves a small handful of decent men my age. I had my age preference set but had to change it to “not a deal breaker” because there weren’t enough men in my age preference. I don’t exactly live in the best city for dating: there are a lot of fake accounts and sex workers that make it difficult for us normies. I’ve even had several guys question whether or not I was real and I’m starting to think perhaps that’s why a lot of them don’t message me or respond to messages I’ve sent. I’ve tried including what I’m looking for in my bio and had a guy tell me I came off mean and another one tell me I sounded bitter (he also kept changing his profile in attempts to match me 4 separate times so maybe he was the bitter one). I eventually changed my bio tho. I’m obviously not the only one struggling or this sub wouldn’t be so big. I’m beginning to think online dating at our age is a lost cause.

Edit: Note to self *people don’t like it when you say you don’t look your age and will downvote you because they assume you’re trying to say you look good and better than all of them because they associate youth with beauty.* Never said I looked good, I just said I don’t look my age.

I’ve been in 2 relationships over the past 27 years (both of which I ended). I’m new to dating, specifically OLD, and I want to know what others think is appropriate. I’m 5’10” red haired, and keep it very short, as I’m bald on top, and not wealthy. My advantage is that I’m around 10% body fat, and look muscular without gym workouts. I’m an outdoor endurance athlete, and I’m proud of my physique. I’ve earned it for myself and feel like it is part of my personality. 

But, when I had women review a kayaking shirtless photo of myself on photofeeler.com the photo got trashed. I could’ve put up a picture of a dog turd and it would have done better. I believe that I get it though: the photo was from a bright and hot day where I was wearing a large hat and sunglasses. The comments for it were mostly about not being able to see my face well, and I understand that many women might feel catfished if they thought initially a guy was hot and it turns out that he had an ugly face, so they might need to see the whole package at once.

Recently I had started talking to someone from a dating app; I felt like she was fairly easy to talk to, and we were conversing daily.  We met up twice this past weekend, and she said she really liked me and could see herself falling for me.  I was a little skeptical at first, but I started to really like her as well and could see falling for her as well.  I had told her everything about things that have happened to me recently (including my divorce last year and being heartbroken by another person I had seen earlier this year).  She was understanding, and she said I could tell her anything.

She was a Christian and I'm not, and at first, from what she said, it seemed like that wouldn't be a big issue.  Then just yesterday, [she said she decided it was a big issue and she called things off with me](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o0hyp1/we_started_to_like_each_other_but_she_called_it/).  I felt like I was getting my hopes up, and I feel disappointed and a bit down now.  We were texting every day and being very open with each other, which felt nice.  She was even being fairly flirty with me and was attracted to me, which is something I feel is unusual for me.  We had only been talking for about a week, so it doesn't feel like the end of the world, but I feel like I can easily get my hopes up and then be let down.

I know it's common for things to come up in the early stages of dating and it's natural to feel down when someone calls it off, but should it really feel so disappointing?

Before this, I had been seeing someone (who I also met from a dating app) for about 3 months earlier this year who had said she was looking for a friend that might lead to a long-term relationship.  She was giving some of what I felt like were mixed signals &amp; said she liked me, and I liked her too; I developed strong feelings, and then she said she wasn't ready for a relationship and later ghosted me.  That whole experience had me feeling really down and I think got me into a bit of a depression.

Perhaps meeting someone in person through events, clubs, etc would be different as you get to know the person as a friend first over time? Kind of like familiarity?

I'm 41 and last November last year my wife of 15years and I split. I've never been good with women, my ex-wife was my second girlfriend in my whole life. (yes at 26 I know...) I recently went to OLD mostly to get company, I really miss the cuddling (yes sex is nice, but not my primary reason).

So I meet someone, we have a lot in common, she has godly eyes that melts my knees, we have a good first date that I think will end with a small kiss goodbye... however it ended up in a 3h marathon of passionate kissing were I totally lost myself, it was good! However, something was bothering me.. but I didn't knew what it was.

So today we meet again (6 days later, we talked each day since then), again we had cool chat, but it quickly becomes physical, passionate and we get intimate. But this time I don't lose myself as much, in the heat of the moment I'm don't know what's happening... I had a hard time (pun intended) getting it 'on'... In retrospect, I found what has been bothering me: I don't find her attractive.

I really think she's into me and while I would really like to see her again for talking, sharing and cuddling I'm afraid that she'll expect this relation to keep being physical. I'm especially afraid of being seen as one of these losers who just want to ghost after getting intimate.

Anyone had similar situation and what have you done?

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope this doesn't makes me a bad person, I'm so bad at dating and relationship, understanding my feeling...

I always like older guys . He was 17 years older then me and overweight. I don’t care as long as I feel attraction.
He started to MAKE ME FEEL VERY BAD ABOUT MYSELF. USED TO SAY I AM NOT STRONG WOMEN BECAUSE I HAD NOT COURAGE TO LEAVE MY PARENTS AND FOCUS ON MY LIFE .

I am very good looking and in shape but I started to feel very bad about myself.
It was not easy for me to leave my parents in a new country and walk away.

Recently he asked about my family and I asked if it was okay if we waited a bit to talk about that.  His reply was that he didn't think it was going to be a good fit because I wanted to wait to talk about them.  I replied that I understood but I didn't want to divulge something so personal until I was sure someone knew me on a base level and liked me for me.  I assured him that I wasnt kicked out of the family for any delinquent or immoral reasons but it was a choice I made to be a healthier person and feel I am happier because of it.  He replied that I eased his mind for now.  I've not responded because I've been thinking on it the last few days (we dont message every day) and I am not okay with the exchange.

If I was caught up in family drama i could see but not if it's a situation I removed myself from and have a happy healthy life. Am I off base?

We went for a nice coffee date by the sea, and spent a good 3 hours just talking and walking along the seafront, even a really nice kiss to end the date.

We kept chatting, but she was a bit evasive about setting up a second date, and eventually told me she had quite a bit of anxiety about committing, labels, and relationships. So I did something I'm usually really crap at, I was completely open and honest about my feelings, how I was also really nervous - we both had crappy past relationships, and we were both old enough to not use labels and decide what we wanted to do at our own pace.

That was 6 weeks ago, and things have moved on pretty quickly since then!

My anxious attachment traits- I am needy emotionally, I do find myself engaging in 'protest' behaviours when I find that he is not meeting my need for connection. Working on myself but it will take time.

His secure traits- introduced me to friends and family v early on, not afraid to be close and intimate me. His avoidant traits - seems to pull back once we are about to move to the next stage in our relationship, not expressing his feelings but suppressing them and then pulling back unexpectedly. 

We otherwise both want marriage, kids, or so he says.
W do enjoy spending time w each other. Do all manner of things together from cooking to laundry to groceries and daily jogs to keep fit. I don't know what is keeping him from taking the next step except perhaps the fear that we are not completely compatible and he would feel the need to pull away again.

The messages have been very spicy to say the least and this afternoon we made plans to meet for a walk this evening. 
I did however feel the need to make it clear that there were no promise of sex or anything else and he seemed fine with that. 
Then we were supposed to arrange where to meet and he started asking if I was sure I wanted to meet up and I said that I already said yes and that I was getting vibes from him that he was hesitant. 

Anyway we did make the plans and 20 minutes before we were supposed to meet he texted me saying that he had a “friend” coming over because he really “wanted to go down on someone tonight” and that I seemed hesitant to let him do that (yes that’s exactly what I wrote to him). He apparently didn’t take that cue from me. 
I’m not saying it would never happen on a first date but jeez, can we at least have a chat first?

So I wrote back somewhere along the lines of “Wow while I do appreciate honesty this was obviously just for sex (not that I didn’t notice) so maybe let’s just not meet up” 
He then replied that I seem to be a very cool person but that he got feelings of control from me and “girlfriend demands” and that kills all the fun and playfulness. 
I guess speaking your mind and not promising to put out the first time we meet is controlling as far as he’s concerned. And the “girlfriend demands” I have no idea where he got that from. 

My first initial thought was that I had been leading him on but I scrapped that thought, we are both adults and not teenagers (at least I am)

Y'all always seem to be a fount of knowledge, so hopefully you can lend me some insight.  I took the plunge and downloaded Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge two days ago.  I took some photos and made a basic but honest profile.

I ended up matching and chatting with about 30 women since then in the different platforms and have scheduled 3 dates.  This is good but I'm still getting matches and I don't have the time during the day to talk to all these folks.  I'm also not sure how many dates I can and realistically should schedule.

And yes before someone flexes on me, I'm sure lots of folks get more and this is not really a big deal.  Its just something to which I'm learning to adjust.

I've seen some women talking about how they filter but I haven't read much about how men filter their matches and figure out which women to focus their time on.  

This is just such a different way to do things than when I last dated in the 90s.  I'm not sure I'm handling this right.  I don't want to be a jerk to anyone and I've had some good and genuine conversations that I've really enjoyed.  I don't necessarily want to ignore new matches or miss out on interesting people but I have a realistic limit as I work and focus on my responsibilities as well.

What is the right and respectful way to manage? How do y'all do it? Maybe I should delete one of the apps? It seems tinder has the least information about each woman and the chats there seem to have the least depth.  Maybe I should delete that and focus on the more meaningful engagement on the other two apps? Maybe that'd give a better signal to noise ratio.

I hate to curtail it too much though.  What if all these initial dates ghost or flake?

Also, its weird that I get so many matches from tinder as I mostly swipe left there. I'm guessing it has to do with their algorithm maybe? or maybe just more people on there in my city?

Anyway, if I'm crazy or off base or if this is just how it is and I need to suck it up and figure it out, then please let me know that.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,50974,public,self,Need some insight on online dating,0,[],0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o2c8ti/need_some_insight_on_online_dating/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since I was 16 I wanted nothing more than to have a husband/boyfriend. I had a string of men be abusive to me, even though I was nice to them. I didn't really like them, I just wanted a boyfriend. Meanwhile the guys I liked never liked me, no matter how hard I tried, including buying presents. I wasn't ugly yet struggled to meet good guys. In my 20's I was a model yet once again the guys I liked didn't like me so I took what I could. That was horrific because not only didn't I like them, they were mean. I had guys be verbally abusive and steal from me. One guy was a pimp and tried to sell me and when I said no he dumped me (and drained my bank account).

I stopped dating these guys in my 20's and figured I preferred being alone to them and hoped God would send me my husband. I went to every single group I could, tried phone dating, and tried to find men where I worked and at school with no luck. Meanwhile, I start seeing my friends all get married. I figured I was a late bloomer and eventually I would meet the one. At 39 a guy from my past came back into my life and figured it was about time but he dumped me again.  Just try dating at 39 when you don't want kids or guys with kids and see what's out there. I know bad people who steal and cheat who found the one yet I never did. I would have bent over backward and done anything for a good guy yet rarely met good guys.  When I was younger I stupidly slept with men thinking I was their girlfriend and so excited I finally had a boyfriend then they dumped me.

We're not in our twenties and the pool of potential life partners who don't already have kids is steadily shrinking. I imagine a single mother would be splitting time and attention between her children, and possibly co-parenting with the father, and dating, in addition to her job and general life stuff.

But with less time together I fear we're less likely to see each other as great... so that's a Catch-22.

At first, OLD was fun!  But, as time went on I found myself on it less and less or getting on it for a week and then deleting my profile.  I get many matches, but it’s all based on looks.  I haven’t been on OLD dating since before the pandemic, but just joined Hinge today and the first guy I matched with commented on my looks immediately with a “you are beautiful”, after saying “thank you”, he carried on with more of that and “you are so charming, I can tell by your pics”.  Which immediately turned me off.  I want someone to get to know me based off of my personality, and while I know and understand that you have to be attracted to your partner, I definitely realize at this age that looks with be fading and personality and things in common with someone are so much more important.  I want substance!!  I am a sapiosexual, so I don’t know what I am expecting, but for once it would be so nice to get an out of the box response to my profile.  It’s always the same old crap and I am over it.  Meeting someone organically for me would be ideal, but it’s virtually impossible for many reasons currently.  Even when I have tried that, it’s been hard. 
I am not a negative Nancy, not at all.  But, who else has found themselves in this boat?

I've installed Bumble, Match, Hinge, and WooPlus.  Fairly soon (almost immediately) after I signed up on Match, I had a match on there with someone who was fairly open and talkative and flirty who really liked me, and after about a week of talking, I met up with her twice last weekend.  We were starting to like each other and saw we could develop feelings, but this past Tuesday, she decided not to continue with me due to religious differences (I've been feeling disappointed about that).

Other than that person, I currently have 8 conversations going across the various dating apps. The conversations don't seem to be flowing nearly as easily, and I haven't met any of them in person yet.  Some profiles say they aren't in a hurry or just want to see where things go etc., but I feel like it's really hard to keep a conversation going much of the time.  I'll ask about things in their profile, things they like to do for fun etc., and sometimes comment on stuff.  But often it has been feeling like a bit of a chore.  It's like many people don't really want to open up.   Maybe I should try to open up a bit more and bring up something random?  Also, as a guy, is it creepy for a guy to flirt?  Admittedly I tend not to flirt, but usually just try to converse about various things.

I used some dating sites in my 20s, and it seemed conversation was easier then.

Another thing I've noticed is that on a couple of the dating apps, it seems my matches based on my filters are running out or have run out already.  One of the apps (WooPlus) started to say ""come back tomorrow for more matches"", and since then, it has started giving me matches that are a lot further away (honestly, farther than I'd want to drive).  Match has been showing me profiles multiple times occasionally.  I've wondered if my search parameters are too narrow.  I've been looking for women who don't smoke (dealbreaker for me), and have unchecked many of the religion checkboxes (religion could be a major factor), and I'm looking for women who don't want (or don't want more) children.  Also, I've been setting my distance to about 25 miles from me.

Yesterday I set up an account on eHarmony to see who I might match with there.  I noticed one profile on eHarmony that I've matched with on Match (one of the slow conversations).  I'm hoping to match with more people there though.

I am someone who is looking for a LTR, have tried for years on dating apps and met someone about 6 weeks ago. I finally felt ready to pursue a LTR, was interested where this could go (as in dating, friendship or LTR), and wanted to go very slowly which I communicated. We didn't do anything physical except hugs. 

In a conversation about concerns, she told me tonight that she didn't think I felt sexual attraction to her through my body language and that sex is more important to her in bonding than me it seemed like. I told her sex is important to me but when I go too quickly it doesn't work and in the past, she told me that when she has moved too quickly it didn't work for her either. We will not be going on dates anymore.
 
Frankly I thought she was happy or OK with the pace, she said she was happy but couldn't read a sexual pull. I do admit I wondered if we had chemistry. To me though, sexuality and that pull was something I wanted to explore or it could have been explored in a less fluid way. I thought it was kind of cool that not everything was overt and yes it was romantic. She even had demisexual in her profile and even though I am not, I guess I was acting like one 😂. I don't trust that spark or that wild desire which I have had in the past. 

A quick breakdown: We're both women - I am 40 and bi, she is mid 30s. I am more outgoing, she is introverted. I have avoided relationships most of my life. She still lives in the joint-owned house with the person who she had a long-term relationship with. I am confident she doesnt like him anymore and it is hard to sell up etc. We had also really weird things in common and the conversation flowed. She is a very kind and empathic person but not very assertive. She was so great around consent. I felt attracted to her, she said she felt attracted to me tonight when we said we wouldn't date anymore but who knows. I started to have feelings for her a couple of weeks ago. 

With my history of sexual assault and trauma in my early 20s, I have also never had a good romantic encounter with a man plus I have body image issues. I have been avoidant around sexuality and last had casual sex with an addict around 3 years ago which turned out to be awful, the aftermath mainly. 

(Please be kind around this. I will not be defined around it and was excited to explore like I said.)

Do you think it's just two people who collided with different needs and some miscommunication? I don't want to be held back from a LTR because I'm not moving at the ""normal"" pace. I opened up a lot and think I can meet someone but mate they have to be patient.

The reason: I didn’t reflect his “value”. 

First date: 
Since I’m new to the area my date (M50’s) picks a great place and tells me he’s happy to take care of the dinner order. He orders a strawberry lemonade, a pretzel and a cookie — to share!!! I find out during dinner that he’s been on unemployment for a few years because he hurt his back a while back. So I figure his frugal ordering is.... understandable. He’s been using this time for mindfulness, self care, healthy living, etc. etc. I can respect that. I also find out over dinner that he’s been on a strict Keto diet. I asked how long he’s been off the diet (refer to dinner order) and he says he’s still on it. No elaborating on the cookie he’s shoving in his face. Anyhoooo.....

Surprisingly the conversation was good enough for me to join him on a walk after dinner — he’s smart, funny and nice. His belly started hurting a bit apparently (I wonder why!).  When it was time to call it a night he asks if I can drop him off at his apartment. I offered to let him drive my car so he doesn’t have to navigate me and he said he can’t because he doesn’t have a drivers license. He just hasn’t renewed it (reminder: this man is in his 50’s). I drive up to his apartment building and he asks if I want to come up to smoke a little weed (from our conversation it became clear he smokes weed abundantly and often). I tell him I need to drive, so not a good idea. We say bye. 

The next couple of days he sends light, witty, funny texts. Super casual and brief. I respond in kind.

He asks me out again. I reflect on the first date. Clearly we will never have a future, but overall I had a nice time and I’m really trying to get more comfortable with the whole dating thing. I figure... it’s not like I need someone’s money or transportation. I myself smoke every so often. If he doesn’t have the same life constraints and obligations as I do, who am I to judge? If it’s not serious, why not have fun like everyone advises for those of us trying to get back out there? 

Second date: 
I tell him upfront I’d like to split the bill (I wanted to actually have dinner!). I had a great time without the pressure to overanalyze the potential. He asked if I wanted to hang out at his place after, just to continue enjoying each other’s company. I told him I wouldn’t mind as long as it was “good clean fun”. He got the message and was very positive about it and an absolute gentleman. Great second date. 

The texts proceed as they had before. Just fun and light. I had A LOT going on on the work and parenting front so maybe my responses took a little longer but generally I would reply the same day. I was getting more and more enthusiastic about what seemed to be a really cool budding friendship above and beyond the dating thing. I kept my work and “mama drama” out of the picture. He’s super complimentary the whole time. In one of my responses, I say “you’re awesome” — totally sincere and within appropriate context.....I think??? 

Apparently he found my compliment patronizing or insulting somehow. Next thing I know I get a looong text about how he doesn’t need anyone or anything to show him his value. That when his environment doesn’t reflect it then it concerns him that he isn’t being seen or heard in a truly intimate way. That when he’s being the paragon of gentlemanliness and it isn’t reciprocated he must accept that lest it poison and turn his good intentions against him. (That’s literally how he communicates). And that my waiting 1-3 days virtually every time to respond to his texts in no way conveys my desire, and he wanted more. (I went back on our texts and confirmed to myself that I replied 1 day later exactly two times— the last time being after 3 AM because I was working until after 2 AM - maybe all that weed makes it hard for him to track time idk). That’s only a fraction of his text but you get the gist. He ends with saying my company has been a great pleasure and “thank you for your time”.

What the actual F$&amp;K ??? My friends warned me about the instant gratification often expected in modern dating but this guy literally switched on a dime!

I (F) am done with OLD and hoping to meet someone in person.  So I know a guy in person who reached out to me and we got to know each other through texting.  He is extremely attractive, objectively a 10 and completely my type.  He mentioned he likes the FWB arrangement and I said I can't do it without getting attached, and it's not what I'm looking for anyway.  But we've maintained a pen pals type of connection and we made out once.  

I decided I want to have sex with him, and we tried to make arrangements to meet up this week, but his roommates were going to be home all the time so we couldn't go to his place.  And I live further away and he doesn't want to drive it. (I work in his town, so I'm there anyway.)  I asked if we could hang out in public even if it means sex is not going to happen, and he just never texted back.  

And it just hurts.  I feel like I'm not worth his time unless I'm in his bed.  This feeling kinda is a surprise to me.  I am actually ok with an undefined relationship.  I can be curious just to see what happens.  I already know it's unwise to control/force a relationship to fit into cookie cutter expectations.  Just let it be what it is; life's messy and beautiful.  

This is probably a FWB rule.  I've never done a FWB thing, so IDK, but I guess it's logical for people avoiding attachment.  In my heart, I do not understand it though.  It's so cold.  

This has seriously cut into my self worth.  My last BF dumped me because I'm not sexual enough, even though I massively opened up and tried new things, it wasn't enough for him.  Is my ONLY value to men sexual?  

I DO want sex.  AND I AM interesting and fun outside of the bedroom too.  Do men think I'm not interesting or fun or loving?  Am I not worth their time?

I don't know why. Brains are weird. I kept thinking there was insane potential there that just didn't turn into actuality. I think I said / done a few things that painted me with ick I'm sure. My footing just got all screwed up. I think we were both just awkwardly nervous.

Those dates would give anyone a headache of nervous chatter. I know enough facts about her to write a novel to be honest. It's just so weird learning that much about someone just to have them end it.

I don’t want to move to the burbs, but am constantly matched with people whose location says my city, but they are actually in the suburbs. Wondering how others in this situation handle this. 

Asking someone to come downtown and find parking is a hassle. And I have no need to maintain a car living where I do. I walk to work or hop on public transportation. I’d be willing to take a train to the suburbs for a date. But not sure that is a realistic way to pursue someone when I wouldn’t be interested in living out there.

Does anyone have success stories about dating someone this way? Or is more realistic to stick to my location boundaries and deal with the smaller dating pool?

So in this thread I got some good advice, a suggestion to post my profile for feedback, and a request for an update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o2c8ti/need\_some\_insight\_on\_online\_dating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o2c8ti/need_some_insight_on_online_dating/)

My profile is here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/3FVgQp8](https://imgur.com/gallery/3FVgQp8)

So I had tinder, bumble, and Hinge active for approximately three days before I took the advice to pause or hide myself and work through my matches.

I had 30+ matches, not sure how many.  Some of those on bumble never made the first move and expired.  Some of those turned into chats where the women stopped responding/fizzled out.

Two of them sent me messages in the middle of the night inviting me over.  I was asleep both times.  Both times, I could figure out how to properly say I wasn't interested in that kind of interaction.  Both times they disappeared somehow before I could answer them.  I'm not sure why that happened but its probably for the best.

Also, I want to be clear that in the description below these women are very nice people and I respect and appreciate them.  I also recognize their have their own thoughts and feelings about these events and you are only getting my side of it.  Out of respect for them, I am giving them nicknames.

I went on a date with RollerGirl today.  She was awesome.  She is the first date I have had in a very long time.  We met at a Palateria that had mangonadas and talked for a long time.  She was very attractive, more in person than even her profile, very nice.  She seems a bit jaded by the dating process, which, I gather from here, seems normal and probably a healthy response.  She gave me good advice, told me about herself, and we had good conversation.  We laughed and just generally had a good time.  She sent me a message after that she'd like to see me again.  I would also enjoy her company again.  She seems to be a nice and genuine person.

My concerns are that she moves every so many years.  Her current position is as permanent as she likes but she is already contemplating future moves.  She also let me know she doesn't usually date men with children and has some hesitancy about that as she is child free.  I truthfully told her my position on that is that my ex-wife and I co-parent well and amicably.  My children already have a mother and, while I would certainly want any girlfriend of mine to get along with my kids, I don't expect or want anyone else to parent them.  I want a girlfriend to spend time with ME and I want to spend my free time with and on her.

RollerGirl told me during the date that it was important that I experience the dating apps and date other people. I believe she said this as a genuine attempt to help and because she is a sweet person.  It did make me wonder if she was having a good time though.  But as the date went on I was sure she was and I feel like her expression of a desire to see me again is a confirmation of that.  At least I hope so because I really like her.

I do have other matches and conversations though.  But I feel like RollerGirl set the bar really high out of the gate.  My only worry if we do hit it off is how long she will stay in town.  A year or two probably but beyond that? I don't know.

Buddhist and I chatted on the apps and then moved to texting.  We have a date set up for the 29th at a local restaurant known for casual and fast dining but still a step up from a Mcdonalds.  I know the advice is not to do that but I figured since we've been chatting a bit we could probably converse well.  We have had some pretty deep conversations about life and rough past experiences and some fun philosophical conversations on a wide variety of topics.  She is fun to text with.  I'm not sure how that will translate in person but I guess I'll find out then.  Buddhist has tried to get to know who I am and what my beliefs are. She liked the answers thus far.  She has texted me very sweet things and nice well wishes more regularly.  I respond in kind.

Systems Analyst and I matched and chatted in the app over the span of a couple days and agreed on a dinner date on July 1st.  I need to pick a place and message her with the details. She and I have also had some deep conversations, covering some of the same topics as above and some different ones.  She is smart and interesting and engaging.  Again I'm not sure how that will translate in person but we'll see.  Systems Analyst has tried to understand what I'm about, what I want in a relationship, and where I'm headed in life.  After a wonderful and deep set of conversations we haven't messaged in a bit but I will follow up with her soon to plan the date.

Librarian and I chatted in app and then she aske me to call her. I did and we've had several phone conversations but haven't set up a date yet.  She is more interested in understanding and connecting with me as a busy parent and professional as that is her struggle too and she identifies.  I haven't tried to pin down a date yet, although I feel like I should.  Its just that conversation with her is so easy.  The trouble is its very amicable and nice and I really enjoy it. But it doesn't feel romantic.  Even though she says she is seeking a partner, and I believe her, and her profile is nice and attractive, I fear if I go to long without setting up some kind of romantic interaction I'll come to view her primarily as a friend. 

The rest I have not set up dates yet because I need to figure out my schedule as I don't want to date the weeks I have my kids.  My ex and I do a 50-50 week on week off sort of schedule. so I have just messaged them.

Nurse and I have only messaged in the app but have had on ongoing conversation for awhile.  That while not super lengthy is nice and could lead somewhere.

Disney girl and I have talked alot about...wait for it...Disney.  I think she really likes talking to me and messaging me but I'm not sure if there is more than that here.  I suppose when I try to set up a date we'll see.

Assistant Principal and I have been chatting about movies.  She takes a while to respond so just when I think the conversation is going to fade she ups the ante with more about herself and a question.  We'll see if I can keep this going or if it fades.

Runner and I chatted a bit and seemed to connect but she's been silent long enough that I think this one will probably be a fade.  Honestly, I probably didn't give her enough attention in the beginning because my mind was on other matches.  She seemed nice.  I hope I didn't hurt her feelings.

Distance Learning Teacher was super into me at first and then got real quiet.  I think this may be another fade at this point.

Traveler is sexy and interesting and we've been messaging back and forth for awhile.  But she is totally remote and can work from anywhere and moves regularly. She has told me about all the cities she's been to and the ones she wants to go next. Ultimately though, I want a long term relationship.  I recognize you cant rush that or place expectations but it feels like even if she and I hit it off she would be gone eventually and that's not my goal.  I'm going to keep chatting with her and maybe set up an actual date but on that date I intend to ask that question and accept and understand her honest answer.

Goth Girl is very hot but messages sporadically in volume and intensity and is all about heavy metal concerts.  I would very much like to hang out with her and see what she's like but I suspect that while she enjoys the attention from the messaging that she may not ever want to meet up as she seems to be avoiding the topic.

Homeschooler and I messaged and she seems really interested in meeting with me but he is a self-described free spirit.  I proposed meeting up a couple weeks out and she said she doesn't know her schedule that far out.  I told her I would get back to her as we got closer to set something up. I guess will see but I have some concerns about how that kind of loose calendaring (no judgment intended) will mesh with my work &amp; parenting schedules.

Kinkgirl also seems very interesting and was interested in me at first but has gone silent.  I suspect she may have found someone more attentive than I while I sorted through these matches and has moved on.

Reader and Physical Therapist seem to have gone the way of Kinkgirl.  I think I should have paused the apps sooner and limited my matches more.  Both seemed very eager to talk to me at first but have really dialed back their messaging.

If you made it through all that, I'd love some feedback/advice about my profile or the best way to respectfully and honestly handle these matches to hopefully find what I'm looking for and still treat these women with the respect they deserve.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,51106,public,self,Profile Review and Update,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o3vobt/profile_review_and_update/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Ec1_OaVrR7MYrVwYl33q1gs_FkCo4T5Sweehmfa1nAs', 'resolutions': [{'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/40xNf1fJDU6uMHMmhB1vodKJcQEg5W8SXn1MmNoJbsw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb0c9a238da9baf387eac288bfa27bfd72dc319d', 'width': 108}, {'height': 432, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/40xNf1fJDU6uMHMmhB1vodKJcQEg5W8SXn1MmNoJbsw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60378dbee2a8335a11ac1b7afd17dd4dcf54c351', 'width': 216}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/40xNf1fJDU6uMHMmhB1vodKJcQEg5W8SXn1MmNoJbsw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=466014e7ceea937ab10717ada2b9949cb7dd0e03', 'width': 320}, {'height': 1280, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/40xNf1fJDU6uMHMmhB1vodKJcQEg5W8SXn1MmNoJbsw.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5f2f861e2673cb890ce5aab46f97aca3c716f34', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 1792, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/40xNf1fJDU6uMHMmhB1vodKJcQEg5W8SXn1MmNoJbsw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9a892830bb84f0e28fab6a7144b27de676c4497f', 'width': 828}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,

   I’m a 47m, single professional with no kids and I live in a relatively large (3 million) but very conservative /old fashioned mid western city. I moved here 3 months ago and have found dating incredibly had here. Even though I’m tall, fit, relatively attractive and well mannered I’m also fairly liberal, non religious and child free by choice. I have a great career and have done well for myself but its a dating wasteland for me here. Being that I’m relatively un attached, not married to this area and I have the means, I’m willing to look beyond my local area for matches. Airport to airport is good for me.   

  I realize that this isn’t everyone’s ideal situation, but it might be for some. Especially those I’m generally attracted to (single, child free, career driven etc). Does any one have any advice on how to out my self “out there” so I can be found at a distance? Most folks seem to use GPS related apps, so I don’t think that would work. 

I hope this post doesnt wake up the angry Sunday post stompers, as I’m not talking about lying about my location nor am I trying to scam people. I’m just someone taht feels if I met a really awesome woman in say DC, I could easily make it work for at least awhile untill bigger decisions need to be made.

So… I (50 M) and her (51 F) have a complicated past to say the least. Short version we started dating 5 years ago… After about a year (4 years ago today, actually), I caught her in bed with her ex-boyfriend. I take a lot of the blame for that. I wasn’t 100% emotionally and physically available to her and although I was taking steps to rectify that behind the scenes, she, quite reasonably got tired of waiting. Literally weeks later she got married to a different man she had just met. They moved out of state and were married for several years. They moved back here and he unceremoniously divorced her after spending all of her savings and running up her credit cards. I also partially blame myself for THAT. Had I been a better partner she wouldn’t have been driven into a conman’s arms. We started talking again and it seemed like she was a completely different person for the better. I obviously loved her and before long we were exclusive within a few months. We continued like this for about 8 months at which point we got into an argument over a situation that I probably overreacted to… And we separated again for about 8 months. At which point, we started talking as friends again. That was around the beginning of the year. Both of us had had a pretty awful time dating, and we were both taking a break from it because it had been such a shit show… So, we weren’t ""dating"" each other, but we weren’t seeing other people either (or so I thought). But because of our history, I was reluctant to do anything more than friends, despite the fact my feelings for her were as strong as ever. It also felt like she had zero interest in anything more than friendship. So, I protected myself. Guarded. Didn’t get any expectations up. And then suddenly, one day in April (a year from the LAST time we broke up) she texts me, almost angrily, asking why don’t I love her? She’d gone on some dates and :nobody compares to me"". The chain of texts were very confusing, and she finally says that “she’s relieved she told me”. I’m like “what did you tell me, cause I’m totally confused here?” She told me that she told me “she loves me and wants to be with me”. I explain to her that I’m surprised by this sudden revelation. And start listing off all the little shit I do for her that I sure as hell wouldn’t do for somebody I didn’t fucking love. My time is limited and giving it to somebody else is one of the most significant ways I can show my feelings for someone, (But, Im also extremely affectionate in traditional ways as well- flirting, physical affection, compliments, etc). And I add, I’ve always loved her, even when I was pissed off at her. I tell her I want this time to be different. No secrets. No stupid impulsive decisions. Pure transparency… That’s my condition of entry. She agrees. She could have looked at my phone at any time and I would have given it to her (all she’d see is my stupid comments on Bitcoin and Gamestop). I never asked her to look at hers. I’m not sure what she would have said… I was always afraid shed get offended by it. Regardless, we make it official and we continue on right where we left off…

WE start making plans… Things WE BOTH love… Concerts. Trips. (Some of the absolute best times of my life have been at both with her). I tell her I’m buying tickets for a concert in late 2022 and will she go? “Of course!” And I’m making longer term plans. I bought a diamond ring. Nothing huge. Just something to show her I’m serious and not fucking around. But I hadn’t given it to her yet when I got wind of some red flags. I found out that when we started talking again (but before she decided to make us official) she was seeing someone else. And he was cheating with her. I then found out that the boyfriend I caught her in bed with way back when, had gotten married the same week (maybe the same day?) that she decided “I was the one”. More red flags. I confronted her and asked if the married guy she had been seeing was the same ex bf from before, and was it all really over? She swore up and down it wasn’t the same person and that it was over and that I shouldn’t be worried about the past. And turns it around with why am I throwing him in her face? She has “nothing to hide… I’m her first choice… She loves ME!”

I believe her. I WANT to believe her. I’m nuts about this woman, and anyways. It makes no sense for her to cheat on me with someone WHO JUST CHOSE TO MARRY A DIFFERENT WOMAN!!! One of the things I love about her is she’s smart as hell. She’s got to see this guy, if it was him, that he just wants a piece of ass on the side and has no respect for her… There’s no future there, which I’m sure she wants with SOMEBODY. I’m doing everything to show her I’m in for the long haul. I go to family dinner with her adult children, their SOs and her ex-husband (even though it makes me nervous as hell, I do it, because they’re my future). I hang out with her friends because they’re my future. I beg her to take me to the places she goes with her friends, but she seems reluctant… Like I’m a secret? And the more I do to show I’m in, the more I feel her getting distant.

And then, Friday I found out the ex-bf went to her house the day before… and they cheated. Him on his new wife. Her on me.

So. I confronted her. I started by asking if she loved me. “Yes!!!” I asked again if she was sure. “Yes!!!” If she had any protests about our relationship, I wanted her to have a chance to tell me. Then I asked her if anything had happened the last few days that she regretted? “Nope?” I then told her “I knew everything” and if she had done anything she regretted now? I wanted to give her a chance to explain if something happened that went too far, to say so, apologize, and we could work through it, whatever result that means. Nothing can be fixed if one person doesn’t acknowledge a problem. “I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Then I started telling her what I knew.

At first, she denied anything happened. “You’re just crazy”. Then She tried to minimize- It was just lunch- “You didn’t tell me you had lunch with him.” “I didn’t know I was… he just showed up unannounced.” I knew it was much more than lunch and gave her some details… “Ok, we hugged”. I told her it was more than hugs. She almost accused me of stalking her, that I must have been outside her window (which she knows isn’t true… She has two dogs who go insane the second I get out of the car, let alone near the house… Plus I don’t have that kind of time…) It took a while but I think she finally realized I had enough details that WE BOTH KNOW she cheated, regardless of her protests. I know the truth. And she knows I know. At which point she starts telling me that she’s been having second thoughts about us. Second thoughts she had every opportunity to talk to me about prior to getting caught.

So… I gathered up the stuff I had at her house (again, another sign I was serious, I was keeping the things I needed to stay with her more, and have about a half-dozen amazon orders of crap for her house, still on the way) and left. Before I left, she said something very weird… “I don’t hate you”. Which seemed like an odd declaration. First of all, I’m the one who has the right to feel emotions like hatred in this situation… I’m wondering if there wasn’t some strange Freudian admission wrapped in that statement? Or, maybe she was just reeling from having so much dropped on her so fast… I don’t know. I’ll leave it for the armchair Psychiatrists of Reddit to unravel that statement. She also said she ""never meant to hurt me"", but I hear that as ""I didn't care if I hurt you, until I did."" Which is a real lack of empathy. It seems to me if you ""never want to hurt someone"" you tell the married ex-boyfrend (who, btw, fucks up your life every time he comes around), to piss off before you do.

My dilemma. I’m mad. I’m hurt (again). But I do love her. I don’t know right now if there’s any future with her… Again, this is all raw right now. She has the worst self esteem of anyone I’ve ever met. And the last few years since the disaster-marriage have not been good to her, emotionally or physically. But I’ve tried to show her it’s the other stuff I’m attracted to about her and that I would help her in any way I can. But its almost like her self- esteem is so low that if somebody REALLY wants to commit to her (as opposed to just use her for respect-less, sex on the side) she thinks there’s something wrong with THEM for picking her in the first place. Like the old Groucho Marx line-"" I would never join a club that would have ME as a member..."" Yesterday she promised she was going to “work on herself” for a bit. But I’ve heard that every time we split, and from what I can see she doesn’t. Or doesn’t have the tools or resources to really do it. I know if I try to help her, she’ll just retreat (she already has, not sure I’ll hear from her again, because she knows I love her and it scares her to death).

And I'm sure people will read this and think I must be some sort of loser to put up with all this... But... I'm really not. I'm a tall, decent looking guy, in good shape... And to say I've got my shit together is an understatement. The last few months I've had more women than usual approaching me. Its just a coincidence really, I started teaching and other teachers, and even my student's mom's have blatantly flirted and even asked ME out. A lot of them were very attractive and if I was single would have been very interesting... But I was committed... And ignored the attention, or politely but firmly declined when that didn't work... I've missed a lot of opportunities... And I feel used... Hurt... And like I've wasted a lot my time... But I still love HER....
