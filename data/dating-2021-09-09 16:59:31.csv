5,pl8k17,1631227764,What‚Äôs the difference between romantic relationships and friends with benefits?,"In a romantic relationship, you should be BEST FRIENDS, right? Basically best friends who have sex (assuming not asexual), right?

But women say they only want to be friends with guys sometimes. Which is maybe just a nicer way of saying she doesn‚Äôt like him that much, right?

Women say having sex with a guy friend can ruin their friendship.

They say ‚Äúfriendship is more special‚Äù.

THEREFORE, wouldn‚Äôt a ‚Äúromantic‚Äù relationship be being with someone you care LESS about? Especially if you can‚Äôt trust them to tell them certain things, things that you CAN TELL FRIENDS???

But if sex is ‚ÄúSO SPECIAL‚Äù, isn‚Äôt it something you‚Äôd WANT to have with your best friend? 

Should sex just be SEPARATED from any emotional connections? Isn‚Äôt it kind of NATURALLY emotionally bonding? 

Why is it that ‚Äúsex with friends can ruin the friendship‚Äù, if sex is THE ULTIMATE BONDING EXPERIENCE? Is it because they‚Äôre not REALLY your best friend? OR, you‚Äôre just SCARED of getting closer, fearing you‚Äôll have MORE TO LOSE if the relationship ends?

In THAT case, wouldn‚Äôt sex WITHOUT an emotional connection be better? Being EMOTIONALLY DETACHED? 

I‚Äôm very confused. I don‚Äôt know what exactly a ‚Äúromantic‚Äù relationship is, but isn‚Äôt it supposed to be the MOST SPECIAL type of relationship?

Therefore, wouldn‚Äôt, or shouldn‚Äôt, a ‚Äúromantic‚Äù relationship be BEST FRIENDS WHO HAVE SEX?

8,pl8yf8,1631229105,i need advice.,"TLDR; i have feelings for someone who is unable to receive the love i give them and  would like to learn how i can do so. 

i'll try to keep this as straightforward as possible but there is so much to unpack. i apologise if the story diverts from the main topic from time to time as i have a bad habit of going on side tangents.

my best friend ""kai"" (20M) and i (19F) share mutual romantic feelings towards each other. we've known each other for quite some time, and through the course of our friendship, we've gone through a lot together. what we share has the notion of ""more than friends, less than lovers"" as we do things that couples would do, but haven't established any sort of official relationship. 

to give some context, kai is a very private and withdrawn person. he's very mature is not affectionate in the least and hates being touched. the way he shows his love is by doing things like cooking my favourite food, doing my laundry when i stay at his place, looking out for me when i do dumb things, etc. he's got a very sharp tongue and is often quite blunt with me so you can't expect any sort of honey from his lips. 

i, on the other hand, am on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. i show my love through physical touch and words of affirmation. from time to time, i do things like cleaning up his room, buying him food when he's hungry (i'd cook it myself but i am a klutz and cannot be trusted in the kitchen at all) and doing things he enjoys to do like watching his favourite shows and learning to play his favourite games with him. 

another thing to note about him is that he hates receiving things and would rather be continuously giving, so when i offer to do something for him whether or not it involves money or the simple act of going with what he has in mind, he often shoots me down and i end up relenting and not going through with him for fear it will upset him. as a result, i feel like the whole ""relationship"" for lack of a better word has been about me and it has been tearing me down. 

i don't want him to feel like it's his responsibility to make me happy and want him to know that i want to make him happy as well. he claims that seeing me happy is enough for him and the smallest things are enough so i shouldn't try to go out of my way to do something for him. but i want him to know that he shouldn't just be content with the bare minimum and that he deserves so much more. especially because he gives his all for everyone in his life. 

he's told me before that he had given up on ""us"", but i know despite saying that, he still tries and tries. and i feel like i've only been letting him down. there are many flaws about me that i recognise and acknowledge, but most of them are things that i do unconsciously. sometimes i catch myself doing or saying things that he dislikes but don't know how to get back up from. it's not that i'm stubborn or unwilling to learn, but it seems that way to him because it keeps happening over and over. bad habits are difficult to break and change doesn't happen overnight, but i can feel his patience getting thinner and i don't want to lose him. i don't want him to give up on us.

So I have never dated anyone and have always wanted to. And I often skip dating people I have kind of liked but wasn‚Äôt head over heels for. Now I don‚Äôt like anyone deeply, but I have a few people I admire mildly, I wouldn‚Äôt mind dating them. My question is do you date people you mildly enjoy but don‚Äôt have the fiery passion with?

We had some talk getting to know each other but it swiftly flipped to him randomly saying things like ‚ÄúI would love if you rode my face.‚Äù 

I laughed it off and changed the subject but then told him I wasn‚Äôt into FWBs. He again made it clear that he would like a dating situation.

Why is dating so dang hard? It‚Äôs one thing when you misread signals, but I can read English just fine and he said it in plain English that he was looking for consistence and dating. I guess I still misread the signals.

47,pldlis,1631246467,Getting rejected helped me instead of hurt me pg 1,"So here's  a little background of myself first! It fits with the story so I have to add it. I don't have the best relationship with my parents. They've always neglected me and put themselves over me. Therefore, I've always been struggling really badly financially like to the point where I'm scared I could be homeless one day. I don't have a car, I have to rode my bike everywhere I go. And because I struggle financially I can't save up for a car, I can't even pay all of my expenses atm. I've tried to find a good job here none of them will hire me nor lots of people here. The most I can make is like 1100/mo and my expenses are about $1200. Because I have to work so much I did bad In school and I can't go back unless I pay for it. So I work at this restaurant and I left for a little bit because I got what I thought was a better job but it ended up being a worse job. So I left that job and got a glass job but that job only wanted me temporarily and didn't tell me that so I went back to the restaurant. There's this girl I work with at this restaurant and she's gorgeous and amazing and one of the girls I've had the biggest crushes on in my life. And before I left I could tell she liked me too. Even my friends who get hella girls and the other waitresses thinks she liked me and thought we were going to get together. I didn't get many opportunities to talk to her though because it's always busy there. So when I come back it's still going well, I'm talking to her and getting good reactions and making her laugh. I was talking to her and we were near another co worker and he looked angry I was talking to her but also he was having a terrible day so I just figured it was that. But I was talking to my friends I was playing video games with and they had mentioned she went on some dates with that guy that was getting mad I was talking to her. So I talked to her about it and she said she's not dating him they just had a couple dates and have been talking but nothing serious and I'm welcome to keep talking to her and I'm not crossing any boundaries. So I been snapchatting her and we talked for a whole day and she responded a lot and made quick responses too for the most part and I told her if she ever wants to hang out outside of work to let me know and she said it sounded great and she will let me know. All the way up to this morning where she said she was going to class. I told her to have a great day at school and told her I was going to work and told her about how I got called in. She left that on read, which is completely ok. She's at school and busy. I got to thinking though maybe she thinks I'm a bum and a loser cause I have no money and no car and am not in school and the other guy is in college. So I told her that if my military recruiter doesn't come through (because I got disqualified for failing hearing test 3 years ago and have to wait to see if I'm allowed to re try) that I'd try to go into law enforcement. Therefore she sees I'm striving for success and have a mission. She left that on read also.

In the past, which this is the 4th girl in a row I've gotten rejected from and I don't go after girls often unless I feel for them and I think I have a chance and I don't have many girls to talk to around here like I said I don't have a vehicle and don't go to school and work all the time so my girls options are pretty low. But when I got rejected in the past I would get depressed and my self esteem would get drained. I would think that I'm ugly and weird and have no life and am a loser but for this rejection it made me think of the future and made me very motivated and even more striving for success. And I'm not gonna make it awkward when I see her at work. I'm gonna tell her hi and ask her how her day was. Maybe she just needs to feel comfortable around me or she has feelings for the other guy or she never felt anything for me. Whatever it is I'm not worried I'm motivated. I'm going to exercise like crazy which lately I already have been and I'm gonna achieve my goals. The only thing I'm concerned about is I don't want to watch them flirt with each other at work. But if they do I'm not going to be upset because I'm going to be thinking about the girl of my future.

I started college a month ago (and of course my ex decided to go to the same school), and I was told by almost everyone that I would find new friends and get better. 

I have done everything I can and have joined several clubs, but I have made no friends and I'm more alone now than I was when I was self isolating and in crippling depression. I am running out of hope for a happy future, and I can feel myself falling into that depression spell again. 

Having a new friend group and support system was the biggest motivation I had to recover, but it hasn't come. I want to meet new people and find someone I can love and someone to love me back, but I've tried everything and I have had zero success in even finding a new friend.

2 days later I caved and got his number off the work phone and texted him asking what his name was because I really wanted to follow that up,  We chatted a bit over the course of the week but it wasn't like super non stop texting it was just here and there chit chat,  4 days later he texts me to ask if I'm working and comes in but can't stay and talk because I had a line-up of customers so when he left I texted him laughing about his timing,  he said well I live close would you like to pop by for your work break today I'd like to see you. 

Keep in mind he had never seen me without my mask on. 

I screamed internally not knowing what to do but eventually decided I felt safe enough to take the plunge and go to his house. 

We talked for the entire duration of my break and he didn't stop smiling and neither did I and the conversation was going really well,  he had said he's not one for texting and he's a bit old achool when it comes to technology and he was more comfortable talking in person,  he said he had wanted to ask me out for a drink within the first few times of seeing me but didn't because he didn't want to be one of 
(those guys), he complimented me a lot and was a complete gentlemen offering me food and drink and didn't get handsy or weird,  when my break was done we both kinda said wow that went way too fast,  as I was leaving I told him I had a good time and he said he'd like to see me on my break the next day.
Next day he texted to say he had to cancel because he had to get ready for a sports camp and that was a week ago and he hasn't been into my store at all which is out of character considering what we sell so he may be out of town. 

Am I worrying that he's lost interest or is this guy just old school and wants to do things in person? I don't want to be the type of girl that texts him a lot because he seems really busy in his life right now and already said he's not great with texting. 

My last text was right after he cancelled and I said no problem you know where to find me üòâ.

52,pldyli,1631247929,5 First Date Tips,"These 5 tips will help you succeed on that first date. They‚Äôll also help you on the 4th or 5th or 6th date too.

1 - Arrive 10 minutes early

Or at least be on time.

2 - Don‚Äôt Talk About Your Ex

They‚Äôre in the past. And your focus should be on the present.

3 - What She Feels, She Thinks

You want her to think good thoughts about you. So make sure she has fun and feels comfortable.

4 - Take Her To At Least 2 Places

This gives her the emotional experience of going on more than one date with you.

5 - Let Her Touch You First

When she likes you, she‚Äôll touch you. Then you‚Äôll know.

These 5 tips will put you in the best position to be successful on your dates.

The most important of these is what she feels (emotionally) when she‚Äôs with you, is what she feels when she thinks about you when you‚Äôre not with her. So make sure she has a great time when you‚Äôre together. She‚Äôll be thinking about having another great time when she sees you again.

Remember, there is no certainty in dating and relationships. All you can do is show up and be the best version of yourself. And go have some fun. Be her best option. Make her choose you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pldyli/5_first_date_tips/

I have over 6,000 likes on Tinder (this is not a brag or accomplishment because I match with rarely anyone and I‚Äôve had the same account for over 3 years). I obviously have a type, as does anyone. I feel like no one is matching my vibe and it‚Äôs throwing me off. It‚Äôs boring me. Should I just delete the profiles and start over? Or is it even worth it? It feels like such a waste to even be on them. No one excites me. The one time I met someone I had a genuine connection with recently I was ghosted out of nowhere. It makes me feel ‚Äî yucky. And NO ONE wants to genuinely go on dates. Just meet up and sleep with each other. Like ew. Yes we may be online but I‚Äôm not meeting you after an hour of meaningless chatting unless you‚Äôre my soulmate????? It‚Äôs just weird. And extremely disappointing. 

It‚Äôs also very annoying because most people I know have met someone or at least go on dates. I feel envious. Is there something wrong with me? Are my expectations too high? I would hope not considering it took me forever to realize I deserved more and didn‚Äôt need to settle. I just feel bamboozled. I don‚Äôt intentionally match with people who clearly want FWB or hookups. I make sure. But sometimes they slip through. I don‚Äôt know. Now I‚Äôm just ranting.

In fact, our second date was so good the couple next to us told us we seemed very into each other just by the way we looked at each other. We ended up spending 12 hours together that day/night.

Unfortunately, we ended up losing contact. We both have very busy work schedules and he didn't answer me for a couple days (he works nights and sleeps during the day), and I ended up missing his message when he did text me back and didn't respond for over a week. He followed up a week later asking how I was, etc. I apologized for not answering and asked him out for drinks. We had a date set, but he ended up ghosting me (not sure if it was because he was offended I ""ghosted"" him first or he was no longer into me/met someone else).

Anyways, I felt sad about it. He always watched all my social media stories/liked all my pictures (not that that means anything necessarily but I thought it was interesting). This week he texted me out of the blue saying he ""owes me one"" and wants to potentially go out again, but he didn't set a date. Our conversation has since trailed off, and I don't know what to do.

I feel like if he really wanted to take me out he would set a date/time, but he didn't. If he doesn't want to go out, then I don't know what the point is for texting me again. Should I just risk it and officially ask him out again? Usually I would be totally against this, but he's one of few people I've ever genuinely liked. I don't necessarily even want anything serious from it, I genuinely liked him enough as a person to be friends/would like to stay in contact, but I don't want to push it if he doesn't feel the same way.

Anyways after 15 minutes I called him and he didn't pick up. But then he called me a minute later and said hes playing xbox with his freinds and what time I'm going to sleep. But I really didn't know because every night is different. So he asked if he could call me 45 minutes later. 

But I said since hes going to play xbox with his friends if I could go watch the movie with my roommate and we can chat tomorrow night.

Woo!!,"Got out of a long term (6 years) relationship a few months ago. But since then, I've been studying with a friend of mine much more (both in the same class in med school, so lots of studying). I eventually developed a big crush on her, much more than ever with my previous gf. Eventually told her, but she wanted to stay friends and not feel like a rebound. Totally respect that and was okay with it. 

Just decided to work on myself by getting in the gym a lot and studying extremely hard. We stayed good friends and still studied together. I always felt a special connection with her though. We make each other laugh a ton, lots of smiling together, great conversation, etc. She also has the cutest laugh and is so damn sexy. When one of us is away for a weekend, we constantly text/snap each other. 

Anyways, quite a few weeks after she kinda friend zoned me, we hung out, just ourselves. Nothing crazy happened but I went for the ol' reach around which worked in my favor and wow...the dopamine levels were high lol. More than anything I felt in the 6 years with the past gf. Even just holding hands with her now is amazing. 

We're going on our first official date next week and we're both excited.

I‚Äôve been talking to this guy for over 2 months now. Everything was good at first. We went on a lot of dates and we talked on the phone a lot. But lately our schedules have not been lining up and we went 2 weeks without meeting or talking. We just texted here and there. 

This past weekend I tried to text him to schedule a time to chat but he was either busy, with friends, or sleeping. I got really annoyed that he couldn‚Äôt spare a few minutes to talk to me. I asked him about it and he says that work has been really crazy. But work has been crazy for me and I still found time to reach out.

I‚Äôm just wondering if I should cut it off before I get too invested or try to make it work. He‚Äôs a nice guy and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs intentionally avoiding me but I feel like if you can‚Äôt spare an hour a week to talk to me then maybe we are not compatible or it‚Äôs bad timing. 

I feel like I am waiting on this guy to be available instead of me finding another guy who is more eager to talk to me. How long have you tried to make it work with someone before moving on?

After a few days, she messaged me first,  I told her I was surprised because generally guys are expected to make the first move, she said she doesn't care about arbitrary social rules, I asked if she had a topic in mind since she is the initiator, she said yes and asked me ""where"" I worked, I answered then asked her about her job, then...crickets.

This interaction perplexes me. Notice I said she asked where I worked, not what my job is. My job is visible in my profile so  I doubt she changed her mind based solely on the location, but I mean what do I know. I'm curious what her thought process was.

70,plfgyh,1631254855,My ex(20) of 10 months Married a guy within 3 weeks of our break up,"So I had been on dating apps that my friends had suggested . One day I had matched with a girl and talked a little bit here and there. After a few texts I need up trading Snapchat‚Äôs and we talked for awhile and made things officially a few months later . There was many red flags in the beginning as anybody who‚Äôs experienced relationships like this already knows . From there being a time she had posted a friend (male) she was hanging out with and complimenting his eyes in a not so friend like position. This relationship went on for a while with us having occasional arguments like me not being able too open up too her so quickly because of my past experiences and child hood and little things like schedules. The first breakup was within 5 months of the relationship  because at that moment I had known I had personally been having issues with financial problems and it was causing me too be in lousy moods which I admit too being wrong for that and so we talked things through one day when she came too pick her belongings up and we got back together. 


Then we continued for another month or so and it was New Year‚Äôs Eve we got into and argument about something dumb and she got her things and left at that time I had a hard head and didn‚Äôt want too apologize but that was my mistake again being inexperienced  ,but she had started talking too one of her friends brothers and started flaunting it in my face within the time of the break (1 week) and she was having a hard time picking between me and him ,but I was opening up a little during this time and promising change in areas where I had messed up ,which had happened when we got back together but one thing I had noticed she would create arguments over little things that wouldn‚Äôt make sense and would be disrespectful too me in front of friends when I was being nice ,and at this time I had been changing in all the areas I could , we had gone good for a week or so and she brought up a situation where she had too move in with her aunt that she had problems with in the past ,me caring for her situation I gave her advice ,telling her that it could be good for her financially in the beginning but who‚Äôs too say the problems don‚Äôt comeback and she started yelling at me ignoring my advice ,so I already knew where her mind was and I supported her decision. She then had told me it would be hard to see each other and do things privately. This is where I started to question somethings , and I asked why ,she responded with unusual answer. This was near Valentine‚Äôs Day and I had something planned with her for the day too atleast give her an experience that she hasn‚Äôt had . she decided last minute to change up the plans and go on road trip with her aunt too New York ,I got a little mad because it was the day before Valentine‚Äôs Day and she told me hours away . 


So she had came over late at night 2 days after unexpectedly expecting something big but I didn‚Äôt have anything big planned because where I wanted too go had been closed . She seemed distant and argumentative when she came over and my sister had noticed her temper tantrum but we went too my room and spent the night watching movies . After this she had been distant for a whole week ,I‚Äôd try too call she wouldn‚Äôt answer or she‚Äôd pretend too be sick or argue . I kept calling too see what was wrong if I could help but she wasn‚Äôt allowing me too help her ,she broke up with me a week after and I was devastated because through the whole month I had started too emotionally open up and show that I had changed but I had been in contact with trying too reconcile and she kept conversations short but something had been going on within the last month so when she had started changing her moods and attitude towards me I wanted too look at her social media just too reassure that maybe it was just me but there had been a guy in her face book comments complimenting her and I had asked numerous times about this person she had just said it‚Äôs a random guy who won‚Äôt leave her alone and when prompted her too delete him she said no .

So later after the 3rd break up I find her relationship status had not changed and she had a new relationship date that wasn‚Äôt ours . I saw her having back fourth playful conversations with this guy and then soon too my dismay she had been cheating .I was devastated too the point I‚Äôd get back from work and spend an hour crying my eyes out ,this last 3 weeks and within those weeks she had gotten engaged and married a week later this had all happened in a short timing .

71,plfozp,1631255919,I asked my coworker if he wanted to hook up and things have been awkward since,"Okay, I did it‚Ä¶.I shat where I ate last weekend üòî
I have had a small attraction for a coworker I‚Äôve never met (since we work from home) but he‚Äôs 2 years younger so I mean I thought that if something were to happen it‚Äôd be very short and meaningless. I haven‚Äôt been in a relationship in 9mos and I have 2 kids so I didn‚Äôt really want to complicate things and imply anything serious. Thinking back I should have left it alone but anyway, here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶.
I added him on FB and he accepted right away. I thought ‚Äúok, cool!‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and then I messaged him asking if he was down to hangout. My friend said it was a bad idea. He hadn‚Äôt seen the message so I deleted it. 
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶a couple hours later he said he had just got back from the movies and still saw it but didn‚Äôt know what I had put. So I fess up and I tell him I asked if he wanted to hang.
Then he told me  he would pass because he had homework to do‚Ä¶..at 10pm ü§£ü§£ü§£ 
So I left that alone‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and then I got piss drunk and left him a message about how I wanted to hook up ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I mean I read it when I was sober and I literally told him straight up that I wanted to hook up casually, that I found him and his voice attractive and if he‚Äôs not cool with it because we work together or what not I understand but I wanted to be honest‚Ä¶..ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
He told me point blank ‚Äúthank you for the offer but I like to keep my love life and my work life separate.‚Äù I think he said something else but I deleted the message after he Unfriended me on FB. 
Things have been awkward at work since. So yeah, let‚Äôs just take in how cringy that was‚Ä¶..I clearly was lonely and probably desperate. I told him I respect his response and Let‚Äôs just agree to forget this happened. Now he gets quiet and avoids me during our meetings. I just feel bad that I made things awkward for the both of us. 
I don‚Äôt really know if I wanted advice or if I‚Äôm just here to vent. I just haven‚Äôt been able to think straight knowing I made it weird for him‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and also that I got rejected. Clearly I have NO GAME. But that‚Äôs not the point, the point is that I made my coworker uncomfortable and I‚Äôm punishing myself for it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶anyway I‚Äôm going to stop here.

Talked with a man online (met through mutual acquaintances) for a month. He asked me out I said yes. We spent maybe 6 hours plus together that day doing an activity we enjoy. 
I saw him some days later for a few hours then again another day for dinner. 
He had mentioned several places to eat and after the fact he had mentioned one of the places we didn‚Äôt go to was by xyz store which carries a product for an activity we enjoy doing together. He said he would have gotten me some of xyz product (which is a single use product) but kinda pricey maybe &lt;$50 / unit. (We didn‚Äôt do eat there bc of open hours.)

Now why‚Äôs this bother me? He‚Äôs very subtle in other ways. He seems down to earth and nice. He isn‚Äôt pushy physically. 
But it just made me feel kinda weird. I feel weird in general when ppl try to buy me things or give me things. 

Is he doing it to get laid? Or am I making too much of it? 

He doesn‚Äôt struggle for $ I don‚Äôt believe. So I may just be unaccustomed bc my previous relationship he was not well off financially (which was fine) 

Overall we‚Äôve been taking what 5-6 weeks I guess 3 dates another planned. 

To be fair and counter jt when we meet up I have to get a sitter. So if we go out fit 6 hours it costs me $70. So in consideration I probably actually have spent more $ than him on dates. 
He also pays for that. I offered 

Thx for your replies in helping to navigate this. 

Tldr: Basically I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a red flag. Guy subtly suggested he‚Äôd get me an item fir an active we do together. 
It‚Äôs kind of an attempt at a gift but not really bc it‚Äôs for an activity we‚Äôd do together. The item is pricey, but it‚Äôs implied it‚Äôs for us to spend time doing, and to be fair I‚Äôve spent more seeing him due to sitter costs.

I met this girl on Tinder. She has a good job, moved to her own place lately. But she said she felt that i was the one and that her instincts never fail. 

I dont want to judge someone specially cause she was being nice to me, but she asked me about babies and that even tho she didnt wanna have kids she would have it if it was my wish.

She asked on what age i wanna get married and wanted videochat with me (covid is on the way for go on a date). She said she wanted to give as much attention to me (texting) as much as she can. She said she liked me in all aspects since the moment we matched. 

We have different religions and not only myself but also my family would consider that an issue. Its complicated this religion thing. 

But i wanna ask you guys if there is red flags on this cause i was talking to her last time and conversation ended (she was sad for her own reasons). 

The next day i did not text her and she didnt also, even tho we have Facetime scheduled. She was just on her own. Like ""ok the vibe with you is over‚Äù kinda thing. 

I posted stories, pictures (this girl who said i was the one for sure didnt even hit a like on the pic) 

Its been some weeks and she kinda disappeared, even posting some stories on her house.

81,plhetk,1631264841,Based on these interactions and signals what are the chances this girl will say yes if I ask her out,"

There‚Äôs this girl F(22) that I M(23) hang out with regularly during last semester. I‚Äôve know her for 6 months and I‚Äôm going to ask her out next week I‚Äôve been nervous to do so as it‚Äôs my first time asking a girl out. 

Good signals: 

1. She opened about her depression and said she wanted to die last year she said she‚Äôs only told this to a very small amount of people 

2.  we were in a group watching friends. The theme song comes on and she starts singing it and pointing at me. I‚Äôm so confused and then she saids this song has the potential to describe us in the future.  Went home and I searched the lyrics and the lyrics seem very romantic it‚Äôs talking about always being there for each other etc.

3. I was in a room with the girl I like and 2 other people. I was talking to these two people and the girl was cleaning. I then tell a story about how this girl approached me and complimented my hoodie and asked for my snap. This girl completely stops cleaning and I see her watching me as I‚Äôm telling this story and she frowns her face so she‚Äôs obviously Interested  in my other interactions with other girls otherwise she would have kept cleaning as for the previous topics she never showed any interest till I brought up another girl. 

4. She also told me we have never been on a date when I asked her a question about the date (day month) which she misunderstood for a Romantic date and she really seemed like she wanted me to ask her to one she didn‚Äôt even seem in disgust.

5. One time I was talking to another girl saying she‚Äôs going to make me listen to jucie wrld and then the  girl I‚Äôm Interested in gets involved and saids I thought I was the only girl that could make you listen to juice wrld I thought what we had was special. 

  Some bad signals 

1. We are in a room full of all her girlfriends and I‚Äôm sitting by myself chilling on my phone as they are talking about dating guys and she saids she could never date Mediterranean people and I‚Äôm from the Mediterranean she was obviously sneak dissing me. 

2. Then as the conversation continued she saids some crazy stuff like I don‚Äôt remember where I spelt last Tuesday but I know it wasn‚Äôt in my room sounds like she was implying she had sex. I‚Äôve never in my life seen a girl admit to having sex especially in a group setting normally girls are very lowkey  about there sexual life‚Äôs since girls are judged more harshly for having sex etc. I truly believe she was bluffing and trying to get my reaction like how do you even forgot where you sleep in the first place. I even asked her how do you not remember and she give a cheeky smile and said I don‚Äôt know. 

3. Then she said she wants a boyfriend that has a black car which is obviously hinting at a specific guy in the collage that she occasionally hangs out with and he drives her. I hang out with this girl way more then this guy does. This guy still scares me because he‚Äôs Pakistan and she always looks at Pakistan models on Instagram so she clearly has a preference for Pakistan boys. She also said I bet my Bluetooth is already connected to my future boyfriend car. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs saying this stuff to see my reaction or she if actually likes that guy with the car. 



What do you think the chance of her saying yes will be?

But I think he feels as if he is missing out on like and what else is there....

I don't really confront anyone but once when he asked me any relationship...

When asked what he wanted and he told me and he wanted someone to just have fun and experience.... Like physical relationships...

I didn't say anything but I was hurt... But conversation from my end decreased a lot....

I stopped contacting him for 6 months and he kept asking me what's wrong for all those months... Not everyday but like once a week or so...

I missed him so much... But I thought I'd get hurt...

But eventually I texted back and he was happy that I'm okay and didn't even touch the topic of why I vanished without an explanation.

I didn't offer because he didn't ask.

I just wanted to get over him because he does not want relationships. .

So I thought if I went physical with him it'll be over. I tried and it was amazing. I never experienced something like that with anyone.... And he said that he felt next level...

But I noticed that I'm again going back to the checks of loving him....

Sooo I stopped kinda.. Kept the talk only at a friend's level and ignored his advances without explanation..

He didn't ask .I didn't explain. 

He still seems to only want physical relationship. During our late night talk.. He was talking about how he wants the bachelor life...I just said.. If that's what he wants he should go and get it .. He said maybe...

I haven't talked to him since and so has he....

Everytime I ask him to call. He says he can't wait to talk to me and yet never calls... Gets busy or tired...I have stopped asking...

I'm so confused.. Should I tell him how i feel or let it be? I don't want to bring relationship problems in friendship... And he is a great friend. Because he has been there for me when no one was. . But will not let me be there... Goes silent with his issues.. And I don't want to pry.. So I just say that I'm here for him if he needs me....

He did not txt me afterwards but when I txted him 2 days later if he is up for meeting again, he responded right away that he would love to but already has plans for that night. Then he added, we should txt in the coming days. I was out if town for 5 days, but we kept more or less sexting in the meantime.

I told him I would appreciate next time if he either sent me a Pic he just made but not something he is sending around to everyone.

He asked if I squirted and when I said no, he responded :,, that's a shame..bzt I will fuck you anyway "". I told him, he just completely killed it. He said it was meant as a joke and that it is not must for him and that he only had a woman to squirt twice. (face-palm) But I just found it idiotic and told him sorry, we are not happening. He said ok, if I see it that way, he can't force me. I said that yes, I see it that way and that I am not coming along with people without tact. He said again it was meant as a joke but that the train has left. And he said sorry for being tact less and it is a shame that it ended, as it could have been good. I said yes, it COULD HAVE.

92,pljdno,1631274226,FINALLY!!!... I have finally found my soulmate over an app,"So I have tried every app in the book, and I have come to the conclusion that people pick based on pictures. We tend to search for someone that we idolize, even though their life on Tinder pics or Insta is staged as possible. My luck has turned after trying Hangoo. It is purely voice-based and you have to meet someone's character through a blind chat. After a while, you see their images, but it gives you so time to delve into someone's character. Feel free to try it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pljdno/finally_i_have_finally_found_my_soulmate_over_an/

At the time she seemed interested and at the end of the date wanted us to plan for something after. Then after a few more messages she ghosted me till today. We chatted through insta (no I cant even see her profile), what did I do wrong and whats the best way to make sure things ended good ( shes a Uni classmate)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pljjdx/what_did_i_do_wrong/
94,pljpp2,1631275585,Do guys only care about physical appearance?,"I'd a debate with a friend. A guy once told me that he liked my physique and compared my body to another girl's and told me that we are of his type. I was disgusted at him talking about our body shapes and curves like that. Recently I mentioned this to a friend and he didn't see anything wrong in this. He said men only care about physical appearance and sex appeal. Also, they prefer a subservient girl who earns less and is dependent on them. 

Men, is this true?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pljpp2/do_guys_only_care_about_physical_appearance/
95,pljxho,1631276458,"how does open relationships really work? women who are into a partner who is polyamorous, how do you deal with jealousy?","i had never been before into polyamorous relationships... it's just hard for me to imagine how all parties get satisfied and without stirring enmity

a guy called me asking whether to be friends or lovers, says i can have just as much as i want even the same things with his gf... he had his gf's permission... he have many other ""buddies"" or gfs... he says he is still just in the process of looking and choosing... but he seems a one woman man when it comes to marriage... 

i might have been more understanding if i would be the special one... but even if he says he could treat me the same... i didn't like how i felt like just a side right from the start for how her gf has a say whether or not he could be with me... and having access to our communications... while i did not give nor he asked any permission to share our chat... nor he even asked my permission if he could make such advances on me

it's maybe too late to think about what's already been 6 months ago that i refused him... but just if in case similar thing comes along...

how does open relationships really work or does it ever really work?

women who are into a partner who is polyamorous, how do you deal with jealousy, or don't you ever feel jealous, why not?

i would love to hear your experiences 

thank you",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pljxho/how_does_open_relationships_really_work_women_who/
96,plk0ma,1631276815,Did I get ghosted or?,"went on 2 great dates in one week. Met on OLD. I went away for 3 weeks on holiday and he texted me the entire time and asked when I was back and made conversation. He went on a boys trip and messaged at the airport so I said ‚Äúsend pictures of it all!‚Äù He said he would the next day when he took pictures. I didn‚Äôt reply to that because I assumed he‚Äôd send pictures and I‚Äôd reply to those. But he never sent pictures or messaged when he was on the trip - which is fine, I didn‚Äôt text because he was on holiday. He‚Äôs back and I‚Äôm back but neither of us have messaged.

97,plk3y3,1631277165,Should I ask him to come over?,"Bit of a weird question.

Had a bumble date with a very handsome man couple of weeks ago and we had sex, which was great. He spend the night and left in the morning. Had a little bit of contact after and I asked him if he wanted to see me again and he said he would like to because he had a great time. But then he never set a date or contacted me after that. I'm not looking for anything serious with him, I honestly just want to sleep with him again haha. 

But how can I ask him that? I've never been in a 'fwb' relationship so I don't know... should I just text him if he wants to come over? Or should I take the hint that he is not really interested?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/plk3y3/should_i_ask_him_to_come_over/

99,plko3w,1631279165,"Dating feels impossible for me and it breaks my ,heart","25m. Meeting a girl who I am attracted too, I feel comfortable with, who I want to spend time and do things with, who I respect, who I trust, this feels so hard. And to have her feel the same way about me? Completely impossible. I have always been a loner and never had much in the way of friends. Anti social. I still try and go and do things(alone). Go to meetup groups for interests I have, go shows. Many times I find people frustrating to deal with and annoying themselves. Right now I live in a city where I don't know anybody. I don't think my appearance is ugly but I have a negative charisma score, I feel like I never know what to say to people and my tone and the way I speak is awkward. I can say hi and that is about it. I have an unlikable personality and don't know how to fix that. I don't think I am interesting, and having few friends seems like such a massive turnoff for most women it causes me to not even try. Being anti social is by far my biggest insecurity and always has been. I have been in therapy for years but no therapist has ever helped. I am destined to be alone forever and it causes me so much sadness. I have so much envy for people who can get into relationships. Whenever I go out and see people together it hurts. Reading about it on reddit hurts. The fact that I know others deal with the same problem hurts because it just makes it seem like some of us are destined to be alone and there is nothing to be done.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/plko3w/dating_feels_impossible_for_me_and_it_breaks_my/
