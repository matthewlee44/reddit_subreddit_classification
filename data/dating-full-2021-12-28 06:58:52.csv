 Today after a day as We had a gap because gym is shut on every Monday so today when I went to the gym as everyday she was present yes there was that elder lady as well maybe I could see a small effort from end but not that big one she looks serious while she works out honestly I couldn't speak to her today upfrontly as I was kinda nervous and never wanted to look desperate

We were distant, which we both knew would happen and we talked a little about it. Only today, it all kind of tumbled together when I thought he was ignoring me. (He wasn’t.) I completely just told him to F off, and he shouldn’t be with me if he doesn’t want me. Not very nice things, I did apologize profusely and reattempted to talk to him about how I feel and such where this was coming from. He was understanding, a little hurt initially but understanding. Only, I don’t want to keep this happening. I can’t let him be the one who holds us together, he can’t always be the one to fight me on us while he’s fighting his own shit at the same time.

The reason is I honestly spent way too much time infatuated with poeple that I had a lot of eye contact and maybe subtle flirting with, situations that never went anywhere. But I spent so much time talking about these people and thinking about them and whatnot. Maybe like 2 years over someone I only had a few conversations with.  When those situations closed up (all were unavailable), so to speak, I tried to move on. The rest of my 20s- I used dating apps but the problem is if I didn't feel that overwhelming passion for the person, I just stopped meeting them. Looking back, I think I should have went out with some people more than once or twice or even given some people a chance that I asked me out and I didn't accept. Because what I would really be doing is I would really be giving me a chance. A chance to maybe feel something later or at least have some fun. 

But no, I was a big romantic I guess. I wanted to feel big things about the guy and if I just felt they were nice but we didn't have chemistry, from ONE freaking meeting, I politely moved on. 

It's funny because I have always been the type of person who has never taken love or relationships that seriously but my dating history doesn't reflect that. Looking at it, people might assume I'm the kind of person who only wants to date for something long term or I am afraid of heartbreak or whatnot. But I've never been. I'm not afraid of relationships ending, I'm not afraid of short-term connections. The only thing that ate me away was unfulfilled potential. If I looked at someone and felt like we could be something and it didn't happen. I always genuinely  felt that if I went out with them I would cool down a bit and if we even broke up at some point I would be okay. Sure, maybe I wouldn't be okay if it really happened, but I do have a somewhat optimistic view on life and I would atleast be happy that I had him for a while. I've always told people ""I don't mind short term things as long as they're real and genuine and add something good to my life. Who knows where things go?"" I've just wanted someone that I really feel something for, even if it's not for long. And now I think I wrote some of those guys (that I didn't have feelings for) off way too soon just because they didn't make me feel the way some other guys did, that I probably romanticized in every way. But still, chemistry is a thing. The thing is online stuff needs time to develop it. And now I feel kind of sad that I didn't date more people during my early and mid 20s, when things are less ""serious"". I'm kind of sad that I wrote people off when I should have dated them, even got in a relationship, because who knows. But do people even do that? Get into relationships with people they aren't super attracted to? People can grow on you though. I should have given things time. 

And then, for a few years in my mid 20s, I stopped using dating apps. I just wasn't into it and I wasn't pining for a relationship either. I felt like if someone comes along good but if not, okay. 

But now I wish I had done more. I don't know. Anyone relate? Some days I'm at peace with it all. I mean, if I wasn't into dating apps for a few years and if I didn't meet anyone in person at the time then who cares? If that was my decision then, then why does it bug me now? Age is just a number.

We met for the 5th time on the 23rd of Dec on her Bday party (she invited me alongside her uni friends) where we cuddled and kissed (not make out) for a bit. 

However, she had an ACL surgery on the 15th Dec, and basically she's been recovering since, on crutches. Since surgery, our texting has been minimal, basically once per 2 days. She barely instigates text (whereas before surgery she often did), so I instigate every time just asking how shes holding up and her responses have been short so I always quickly end it to give her space to recover. 

Since her Bday, her texting has been as sparse can you can get. I basically messaged her on the 25th saying merry xmas, we conversed a bit before I asked if she'd wanna call. She left me on read for 23 hours and finally replied late at night apologising saying she spent the day sleeping off her hangover. She asked if I still wanted to call, and I said yep lets call in an hour. She then left me on read again for 23 hours before saying it was too late shes been sleeping early. I said no worries, are you free to call ealirer tomorrow, she then replied can't cuz shes gonna be going to the clinic for the whole day for her ACL recovery. So I didn't ask again, we conversed minimal before I asked if she was down to meet sometime after the New Years when shes more recovered, she replied yea sure but doesn't know when that will be the case. I said ""of course there no rush, I'm thinking going to (an area close to her house since she can't walk far) to get food"". To which I have been left on read and it's be 15 hours and counting... 

(before surgery, she was the one who asked me out for every time we met and said she really has a good feeling about me and hope I do too, she also mentioned that it would suck cuz she wouldn't be able to see me for a month after surgery)

QUESTION: I get that since the 23rd Dec it's basically been xmas holidays + she's recovering from ACL, but is she losing interest? I guess now back off and see if she comes to me, if not I'll have to move on...? There no positive spin on this...?

So, just came out of 5 year relationship - an amicable breakup that was for the best. Life goals were different and energy was almost permanently hostile/toxic towards the end. We are now both happier

I met her at a festival. I met my previous girlfriends and hookups at festivals. If it wasn't there, it was at house parties, clubs etc. I'm not one to toot my own horn but in all aspects, I consider myself to have been very successful to the point that I knew and currently still know that if I go out to a party, I have a pretty high chance of meeting an attractive girl I can get along with and hook up with, resulting in the usual post-party texting and then either dating from there or we sort of let it fizzle out and the saga continues. 

Following my breakup, there was a month of introspection, a month of reconnecting with family and friends and then I started going out. All the while I was hitting the gym and am somehow at the best I have ever been. Now, it's December, it's new years, all my friends want me to go to the big parties and part of me wants to ONLY because I want to meet girls and have fun. I did this for a month after the breakup and I met 3 girls, one of which was a brief 3 week sexual repeated relationship until I eventually told her its too soon for me I'm not ready for what she wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I can only imagine meeting girls out, because I'm probably more fun our drinking and doing drugs.. but the reason I broke up with my ex was because she parties too much and likes drugs too much! So I know deep down I want to mellow out, save money, and grow into a more mature lifestyle. I can't force myself to download Tinder because I tell arrogantly tell myself I don't need dating apps because I never have, but then I tell myself I need to go party to meet people (fake people).

&amp;#x200B;

Was anyone like this? It feels like a TRANSITION that I wasn't expecting. It's hard because my city is full of festivals and attractive people. Can anyone confirm that dating starts out rough and awkward, but then leads to a more rewarding experience? Should I just have a few drinks before each date? Am I then fake again and creating false persona? Should I avoid massive new years parties and just chill with some friends or do people in the dating scene see these massive parties as actually a good way to meet people aside from their usual dating?

She is from Ukraine and moved to the states 6 years ago so her English is not so great but is still understandable. She’s a fun loving person we go do fun things, show affection for each other and talk all the time. Although it feels like I’m doing most of the heavy lifting in this relationship.

Over the holiday break she invited me on vacation with her family and this is when I started noticing that something was off. Obviously I can’t show her the type of romance I normally would when we are alone with her parents being around but it seems like I’m more into her than she is into me.

I started realizing that whenever I try and flirt with her, tell her she looks nice, tell her nice things about herself, give her hugs, kisses, that I’m always the one initializing the affection and I hardly get anything in return. This also goes for texting and phone calls. Whenever I give her a double entendre for something sexually suggestive she hits me with a “come on”. 

I’ve expressed to her over the past couple days about how I feel and she tells me that she is bad at expressing her feelings through words (understandably since she is from another country) and would rather show me her love. Although throughout the past week with being unable to do that with her parents around, I have been left feeling super deprived. 

I really want this relationship to work because she is so nice and has a lot going for her and I know she likes me and appreciates me since she writes me love notes from time to time and shows a lot of love when no one is around but is it too much to ask for a little bit more from her end?

What should I do, am I being too needy? Should I try and work with her through this? I would really love her to express her feelings to me verbally but I’ve gotten a lot of push back from her about this.

While in college, my first serious gf broke up with me.  I was sad, because I felt blindsided, but I wanted to respect her wishes.  So after she said she wanted to breakup, I neatly placed all of her belongings into a box and I brought them to her the next time she and I met up to chat at a coffee shop or something.  I thought that she'd appreciate that I didn't make her fight for her things, but I got the opposite reaction.  She said, 'why did you bring me my stuff?'  And I responded with, 'You broke up with me...why wouldn't I give your things back?'  Again, I was sad, but I wanted to be civil.  We didn't say much after that and we went about our separate ways.  Later on, she told me, 'we could have saved our relationship had I seen your eyes when we were breaking up.'  (I was wearing sunglasses at the time she sprung the news on me, and I never took them off.)

More recently, I had a first date that I thought went pretty well.  Afterward, I called her to see if she'd like to see me again and she exclaimed, 'oh wow, I thought you didn't like me at all.'  And I asked her why she would think that, and she responded with, 'well, most guys are usually all over me.  I don't know, you like, respected my space.'  That was something I was trying to be mindful of at the time.  And I thought keeping my space, because I'm just some dude from an online dating site, would have been appreciated, but it gave off the opposite impression.

My last serious gf broke up with me after her teaching contract at a major university ended, and her academic career was going to likely take her out of state.  It did, and she moved several states away in the middle of the the US.  After the initial breakup, I told the news to a female friend and her immediate response was, 'Well, did you fight for her?'  And that just floored me.  I didn't get it.  What was there to fight for?  Her job ended.  She was leaving the state.  My friend goes on to say, 'Well, did you ask her to stay? Or offer to move your career for her?'  These are things that I guess never crossed my mind.  And that same gf, now several states away, has told me that she often thinks of asking me to visit her.

Fast forward to the present, and I'm now realizing that I've heard similar advice for a lot of my adult life:  'I didn't realize how you felt about me', 'You didn't fight hard enough for me', and 'We could have saved it'.

Clearly, I'm missing something.  But what?  I often think about my mother's words, 'ALWAYS respect a woman's word.  If she says she's done, she's done.'  So I've tried to always follow that.  But it appears to have backfired on me several times.  The last thing I'd ever want is to push something, and I end up ruining a personal relationship, or worse, making a woman afraid of me.  I have friendly relationships with almost all of my exes, and that's something that I think is cool.  I still get the unprovoked texts for my birthday and holidays.  Even the occasional picture text of, 'this made me think of you.'  But like I said, I'm in my mid 30s, and I'd like to find something lifelong if possible.  

I'll take any and all insight or reasonable advice that people can offer.

Been trying to date via apps for about a year and a half. Gone on dates with most men I found attractive and interesting enough vis text (5 at this point, probably declined another 5) but haven’t developed any interest in them after generally 2-5 dates. Most of the time I just didn’t feel anything towards them and there wasn’t any chemistry.

Recently I’ve been seeing a guy but I don’t want to anymore for the following reasons:
1.
- lives nearly 2 hours from me in a big city that I have no interest in living in or visiting. 
- isn’t outdoorsy/doesn’t engage in outdoor activities really ever and has expressed some distaste for some of the outdoor activities that are incredibly important to me. The outdoors are my #1.
- talks a bit too much about himself, sometimes feels like I’m being talked at. Kind of feels tiring after talking.
- seems like a very very different kind of person than I am and we don’t have a ton in common.

Do you think I’m too picky? I am a bit tired and lonely and feeling the singleness and so I wonder sometimes if the reason it hasn’t worked out with any guys is that I’m being too picky.

I'm sure some of you have seen my posts about my breakup and the advice I've given out but now I need some form of uplifting sentiment from you all. And frankly, I just want to vent because my ex is driving me crazy.

We broke up due to my lying, I never cheated on her but I became toxic during the end. I lost money with stocks and I ran into financial issues and got kicked out of law school in April. I tried covering it up with lies, and loans to the best I could -- I basically did everything to ensure that I could keep the relationship going and to make her happy which I realize now was very selfish in the end. By September I kept the lie going by pretending to be in law school. Compulsive lies, to her friends, family everyone that was involved. By October she forced me to come clean and dumped me. I was ruined, heartbroken and almost committed suicide. I felt like I had lost everything, luckily my friends were able to pull me back up out of my sadness and then I started therapy sessions. I then tried to do everything to win her back, I owned up to the lies, I messaged everyone apologizing, I endured the humility. To make up for everything, I sold all my valuable belongings, I gave her all the cash. I painted the apartment we lived in together in while she was away, got her gifts, listened to her stress about her job. I paid her a portion of the rent and her hydro bill while I crashed on my buddy's sofa and I agreed to take over the lease of our old apartment so she could get her last month's rent back because she moved into a condo her father bought her. But yet none of this was good enough. 

During this time I got some awesome advice from online articles about grieving from my therapist and my best friends. I was soo distraught and soo intent on getting her back that I realized maybe I self-sabotaged the relationship on purpose, and that I seriously need to work on myself and sort through my childhood PTSD. That's when I realized it's over, and **I moved forward**. I stopped being so present with her, because all she would do was text me all the time. I was done with everything. So I kept my distance and would respond out of the moment and not as much. I hung out with my friends all the time, and got busy. I took my mind off the whole problem to begin with. Women started chatting me up (I almost felt like I was cheating on her). After about two weeks of not being fully present, I think she finally realized I moved on and it **ENRAGED HER**. Tons of angry text messages, how I'm a terrible person and that I fucked her over and so on. Each time she messages me now it's just a whole lotta hate, threats even. I know I fucked up, but I've tried soo hard to make amends, it's like none of this registers with her.

We're both 20, so emotionally a little further than basic teenagers and I don't get it why she did that. The whole thing kinda hurt me because she was really special and gave me attention and interest for almost a year. It's also not about the fact that she dumped me after the first meeting (i know that's completely normal and just happens) but I need help to understand things that happened afterwards.

The story:

We met on Tinder / Lovoo and started flirting. It worked perfectly and she often took the first steps; She asked me out for WhatsApp and kept in touch with pickup lines if there was a bit of silence. She also always wrote / sent me voice memos when her friends were around and I thought that was a good sign. After 3 months I asked her out on a date and after she hesitated, she said yes.

Our date back then rly sucked, we were outside, it was cold and both of us shy. A week later she turned me down, at first she said that she isn't interested in a relationship. But after I asked again, they said we didn't have the same sense of humor.

Everything was clear and it was fine to me. She wanted to be nice and came up with something not to hurt me. I Got it. I was disappointed of course , but I accepted it. (Btw her friends contacted me and they told me that I was too boring and not exciting enough at the first meeting. - it's fine too)

Now comes the strange part where I have questions and need your help:D

1.) After half a year she contacted me again, apologize for everything and said that she would like to be in contact again. She still didn't want a relationship, but she would be interested in a friendship and ""if there is more, then it's fine too"" - We wrote again, but i also made it clear to her that I am not interested in a friendship and then the contact died down again . Does someone has an explanation why she wanted contact again?

2.) Weeks later again, I got an very sweet message from her. She asks me out on a second date, says she can't get me out of her head and that I'm the most interesting and attractive guy she has ever met.   My question again, why did she do that?

Spoiler: There never was second date, we wrote again for half a year, she kept postponing the meeting and two weeks ago she ditched me ones and for all. Then one of her friends contacted me and said she had lost interest a few weeks after the message with the second date, but she did not tell me and just continued to write to me. But why , I don't get it?

Where did i go wrong? 

Would you have allowed contact the second time? Was I too naive or should I have seen it coming?

She was completely my type and when she said she was interested in more I was lost and believed  her😅  

I wasn't the guy who showered her with compliments and attention btw. Zero. I swear.

Oh and pls don't hit me with ""there are plenty of fish in the sea"" and ""You'll find something better"" I've already heard that from lot of friends :D I just want to know if I was just unlucky and whether someone has experienced something similar.

Christmas Eve he thanked me for helping and then, proceeded to ask why was I single &amp; that I’m a good-looking guy, and that with me having a decent job and being good-looking he didn’t understand why I was single living the lifestyle I do and that I have the qualities people look for. Which was then followed by him saying he thinks about me a lot, and that he looks forward to me messaging him. And that he gets sad if he doesn’t see a message from me. 

He also said that if I said that word and asked him to come see me, he would (Christmas Eve ). Then Christmas Day, asked me what was I doing and could he come see me.

I (19M) met a girl (16F) one evening a while back and we got along really well and yaddi yadda you've heard it before. During the evening she was definitely the one pulling more weight in opening up and steering the mood into the more romantic direction (touching my hand, legs), owing to the fact that I'm generally more the reserved, shy type. Anyways we ended up kissing (she initiated) and because she was staying in a cheap motel with her friend I went home and didn't take it any further than first base.

So over the next two weeks I offer to go to her city, which is like 100 km away (which is a lot for someone who doesn't have a car), but she dodges - says she isn't home, has to do schoolwork - until I eventually ask her whether she even wants to meet me again or if she just felt impulsive on that evening. She said she would but wasn't ""emotionally ready"" for it at the time. I felt like I didn't know her well enough to ask her what the underlying emotional stress was that she was going through, and I accepted her offer of her texting me once she was open for dating again.

So I wait for 2 months, during which I often times contemplated texting her but always decided against doing so as I thought she might be going through a tough situation during which she wouldn't be interested in dating. And I thought should would - as she said - let me know once she was open to meet with me again. At this point I did realize the hypocrisy of her definitely being the more proactive party on that evening and her now not wanting to deal with me.

Yesterday I couldn't stop myself from texting her and asked her whether she would want to meet me any time soon. She then says she met another guy the week before and wouldn't feel comfortable meeting another guy now that she was dating someone else.

I was kinda pissed of to state the obvious. I feel like her and I were in the same situation that she is in now with her new interest before she met him, but she was somehow comfortable with dating the new guy?? Now that I confronted her about it she says she doesn't ""owe me anything"". Don't get me wrong, she doesn't, but she's still a hypocrite, right?

Anyways, even though I don't think shes in a fixed relationship now I feel like I'm in the friend zone after telling her that I would still meet her to get to know her better in a platonic way (she responded positively to that). 

I am aware of the fact that reading this makes it sound like she's an asshole and I'd be better of without her, but I really like her so far and frankly I'm too desperate to have any alternatives. After meeting her I couldn't belive how such a positive thing would happen to me - well now I can't believe how negative a turn this took.

I also want to add that I kinda blame myself for not texting her for such a long time. Who knows what would have happened if I had texted her before she met that new guy. Did I fuck this up? Did she think I wasn't interested anymore while I was just trying to be respectful?

Do I still have a chance with her? What should I do now? Just let me know what you think about this.

Im just not a fan of it. I dont like to take many pictures and i dont think my life is interesting enough to share with the world. I just think its addictive and im better off without it.(and i am). I just think that if i had it id be able to connect more with the people im talking to.

For example im currently texting a coworker(19f) of mine(yes i know dating a coworker isnt a great idea) and we have pretty good chemistry when we see each other at work, lots of flirting and we both purposely skip out on work to come see each other during the day just to spend time together. But when it comes to texting i see that we mostly talk about work. I feel that if i had social media wed be able to talk bout more things and share alot more other than just work life.

Now i pretty interested in her and its fairly new, i only just got her number at the end of November.

My coworkers seemed confused as he was kind of looking at me. But then he said he wanted to buy two cups of ice which we were all like. “You can just grab them”.

I have been friends with my college friend, A, for 3 years. I'm not gonna lie I've always found him attractive but he is kind of out of my league looks wise. I'm thin but below average attractive facially, never had male attention in my life and when I go out with female friends I'm a ghost. My life has been full of urequited crushes for years and thats how its going to be for the rest of my life, I don't think I will ever settle down due to looks requirements most guys have for their GF/wife.

I also believe he is out of my league because he probably has a lot of experience with women in his life yadayada.

Beginning of this year, with distance education and everything being closed down, I started talking to him more. We would chat on Snapchat, he would help me with school assignments, we would play LoL and other games and talk on Discord etc. It was funny. We would also have talks about politics and other stuff that were deeper. Suddenly this summer he asks me out on lunch. I can't go but come up with another time and date, and another activity. We go out to play minigolf, I meet his friends, a couple of weeks later we go out and play pool and have drinks etc. None of this is labeled dates. Before we meet up for pool he sends me a Snapchat selfie with lots of heart emojis. I have a bad feeling of it and don't respond or mention it.

Come september, he starts working at a bar/resturant for students and asks me to come there at his shift. I went there and talked to him for a while, it felt like he wanted to show off his bartender knowledge or something. The next day later that night at around 11-12 PM he texts me asking me to come there again but I'm already in bed so I can't.

The following months we are still writing to each other regularly, but the texts are being more suggestive and more flirty in tone. I go on with it, because this is the first time a hot dude is giving me any attention. However, one thing happens in school that makes me freak out about his intentions. He sits next to his friend and I walk past them and can hear his friend whisper my name in a low tone, but he probably didn't realize I heard it. This is when I'm thinking holy shit they are discussing me as a sexual conquest behind my back and laughing at me, because why else would his friend tease me in front of him?

However I also notice he is starting to play games as I disengage and go cold on him and hang out with other male friends. He asks curiously who I'm with when he sees my Snapchat stories of me hanging out with other guys. He later sends a pic of him and some other girl in the bar (probably his coworker), when otherwise he NEVER mentions other women in front me, never ever. Not even if I ask him. He starts flirting by calling me sweetie but backtracks when I ask if he is joking. Once I told him he is on my best friend list on Snapchat and he responded by sending a pic of him doing a heart with his hands and writing under ""best friends ❤️❤️❤️"" like its funny and I'm a moron. 

He also mentioned he was at a bar event he knows I like saying he lost in a music quiz and I was like so you went without inviting me? :( And he was like hehe did you want to? And I was like yeah and he replied true, ill give you my exam notes as an apology.
So he knows I like him and is teasing me like this? Not funny


He acts cold and hot but ALWAYS reaches out through Snapchat if I don't write anything to him for 1-2 days. Like yesterday he sent a pic of his cat asking me what I thought of it, after I had not sent anything for days. Stuff like that.

I'm getting cold feet and want out from this. I don't know what to do I'm freaking out, since I've flirted with him before he is probably thinking of me as an easy hook up. How do I backtrack without coming off as an idiot? I just want to be loved and treated good, not seen as a sexual conquest.

There appears to be a strong undercurrent of frustration, resentment, accusations, and broad generalizations on both sides from both men and women. The content that tends to be emphasized by social media algorithms (and which gets the most interaction) is usually examples of toxic behavior, which can alter people's perceptions of what a healthy relationship looks like. Most of all, though, it just seems like recently men and women don't really understand each other, perhaps less so now than they ever did. That, and/or more and more people just don't seem to be ready for a relationship or know how to be in one. Since I've struggled with difficulty finding a relationship and many of these issues myself, I'm interested in trying to figure out what's causing this and what we as a society can do to fix it.

Obviously, I understand that the pandemic has been a huge contributor to social frustrations, but we also live in a time of changing social expectations for men and women and challenging boundaries. Certainly also a factor is the ubiquity of mental health struggles like anxiety and depression, especially among people under 30. Maybe it's just that we all need to work on ourselves more. While the factors influencing these issues could very well be one of these, I can't help but think there's more to it.

So I have a tentative first date on the calendar for this upcoming Sunday. We were planning on walking outside and grabbing coffee. COVID cases are exploding by me + I just learned the high temp on Sunday will only be 10F. So walking outside could be miserable.

We are both vaxed, but I’m immunocompromised from a heart transplant so I need to be more careful.

If the weather doesn’t improve, I was thinking about another idea. We could both meet at a nice grocery store, grab Starbucks inside, shop for brownie ingredients, then take separate cars back to my or her place to make the brownies. That’s the best I can think of during these times. Otherwise we’ll have to reschedule/just FaceTime.

(As in, I'm definitely seeking a relationship leading to pregnancy and marriage, but I would like to still get laid for fun in the meantime while waiting to find a future husband)  If I sound frustrated or aggravated right now, and at him, it's because I am.  I mean, he didn't check off any of my checkboxes of what I'm looking for in a man or what a man should do for me if he's to become my BF or even just a FWB, yet he scolded me weeks back just for the hypothetical idea of me just considering talking to other guys, even though we didn't have a relationship defined and even though when I asked him about our dating status, he either dodged my questions or gave vague cheesy answers.  So...what was his purpose of coming over once a week or two to hang out at my place for a few hours each time?  Guys, your feedback is valued especially.  Why would a 39-year-old single guy (never married, no kids) take the time to drive 30mins away just to hang out with a girl in her living room and sip some wine and chit chat, but not have sex, not take her out hardly anywhere, not discuss having a relationship, and not seem to be willing to meet any of her friends?

&amp;#x200B;

Also: I wrote on here in other posts about how closer to the beginning of this month, I texted him I needed to talk to him on the phone, that it was important, and then I very nervously tried to broach a sex talk with him, in which I tried to tell him that I really needed sex in general and could our next meetup consist of sex, not just chit chat and kissing.  Instead of understanding, he acted confused and then hours later in the day texted me that he sees I was talking to him about my fear of sex and how I'm scared this might lead to sex.  Um no no no!  Definitely NOT what I was trying to say AT ALL!  One of my friends, and my roommate's BF too, both recently suggested that ""he couldn't have been that dumb"", that he knew I wanted sex but was making excuses because for whatever reason he wasn't planning to have sex with me.  What do you think?  Do you think he was lying, or are us females really that hard to interpret at times?  Also, I know he has no religious reasons against sex or anything like that, because he told me he is not religious (attended a Catholic church as a kid, but hasn't attended in his adult years) and more importantly, he had ""great sex"" in the ""things I like"" section of his OLD profile.  Why would he put ""great sex"" if he didn't plan to ever have sex?  Is it that he just wasn't that into ME?

&amp;#x200B;

As far as the friend meeting part: In all fairness, he DID meet 2 of my friends, my roommate and her BF, briefly, when they passed through the living room once on their way to the kitchen before going back to their bedroom, where they usually spend most of their time.  My female roommate and him said hi to each other, and roommate's BF was quiet/chill.  Not too long after my unsuccessful and painfully awkward sex talk with him (which backfired), he did suggest I come over his house for the weekend and to even bring along my friend and her toddler son who I like to babysit and talk a whole lot about to people.  I felt a little awkward about it, not sure why, but in hindsight it seems like a HUGE leap from what we had, plus he told me this rather last minute after I'd already mentioned things I was doing, and he never brought it up ever again after that.  Do you think he invited me because he really did want to meet important people in my life and take things to another level with me, or do you think his invite was just a test?  I ask because I have paranoia from many times I've been stood up by guys in recent years.  But then a few weeks after that when we were planning to meet at my house Christmas night after the family holiday stuff was done, he purposely waited until the exact minute I texted him that everyone left (my roommates, friends, and the 1 toddler I babysit) before coming over, even though I invited him a few hours earlier to come then and partake in the fun sugar cookie baking they were doing at my apartment.  To me, that doesn't say he wanted to meet people in my life.  So which is it?

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I don't even care really about this guy at all, and I'm already planning to just move on and not hang out with him again, now that I feel he's wasted my time and prolonged my involuntary sex drought.  I agree with the others who commented on my other posts about this situation that the guy sounded minimal effort and not that interested.  I'm not even hurt by that, because to be honest he wasn't really my type anyway if I could be choosy.  I'm more insulted by principel that he'd waste my time.  I just want to know what his motive and purpose was, because it's confusing me that he would spend time like that just wasting my time or having no purpose or real interest in me.  So...why do guys do this?  Why do you think HE did this?

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: I was very casually seeing a guy from an OLD website for approx 2mos who never did much with me, sexually, date-wise, or dating status-wise.  Most of it consisted of weekly or bi-weekly hanging out in my living room sipping wine, chit chat, and kissing at most.  He didn't have sex with me, even when I told him I had sex needs, more and more blatantly at the very end, and didn't seem empathetic about my lack of sex.  He also didn't seem concerned when I had a work crisis, just gave some cheery cheesy response.  He evaded meeting any of my friends for the most part.  He gave vague cheesy nonanswers when I asked him what we were dating-wise, like ""I want you and me to be happy :)"".  Yet even though he avoided defining what we were or even discussing very generalized dating goals he has or what he's looking for, he chided me for simply mentioning a hypothetical (not yet acted-on) possibility of me talking to other guys in the meantime if he's not sure and/or not interested in defining what we are dating-wise.  At this point I'm done and just ready to move on with my dating life, but I am curious, why would he waste my time like this?  I mean, what was in it for him to see me for a few months if he wasn't interested or didn't seem to want sex or a relationship with me?  And why would he try to limit me from dating around or even talking to other guys if he wasn't going to put a label on our dating situation?",True,True,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1141874,public,spoiler,What was his [39M] purpose of hanging out?

\-she would say things like ""my boss would recommend me for literally any job I wanted."" ""Everyone likes me.

It took me about 3 years to take care of my health, change my lifestyle, get therapy and get into what I can proudly say is the best shape of my life. I’m 5’6 and 127ibs at the moment and I have just finished recovering from a relatively minor skin removal surgery. Sorry for the long intro but basically my question is as the title states. Does it actually bother guys (18-25 my age group) that I used to be overweight ? Would it turn guys away from dating? It may sound weird but I have never dated in this body before. I pretty much took myself out of the dating scene while I was taking care of myself. At the moment I’m seeing a few people but I don’t think any of them realised as Ive never shown them photos or anything like that.

I'm kinda smitten on this man but for the obvious distance reason I've been trying not to fall for him. * I have a habit of falling fast and hard * 

Last night I sent an in bed selfie saying g'night handsome. He quickly replies with a kiss face selfie saying goodnight beautiful. This message hits me hard for some reason and I have to put my phone down. I think to myself, yeah let it go, let it happen ... Fall for this man!  I smile, then cry. 

WTF is with the tears? This is so unlike me, I'm not usually this emotional.

Okay bare with me whilst you read this.

Theres this girls profile, who ive messaged but she isnt active anymore on the dating site unfortunately.

Man, shes so pretty snd her bio seems like we would get along. Obviously im thinking ahead.

But i wanted to ask if there was absolutely anyway to find her somehow using a profile?

No this isnt weird and creepy (well it might be), but there use to be times with old fashioned romantic guys years back, used to do everything to find the girl they saw once for example.

It's a weird one but worth asking!

I’ve been broken up with and after a few dates, I’ve been ghosted or they always hit me with, “you’re going to make someone really happy one day” or “I just haven’t found the one yet…”. I’ve also dealt with some men who have tried to get into my pants by buying me expensive dinners or piling up compliments and trauma stories so I can feel bad for them. Maybe it’s the men I go towards but it has completely turned me off to dating and has me expecting the worse. Now I am not saying all men are bad, because there are great men out there, I just havent found the one for me. 

Now, I’ve been talking to my friend for about 8 years. He was really my first hookup and there have been moments where we have grown apart, but then he reaches out throughout the years. He is originally from my state but lives in a different one. Pre pandemic, we met up after not seeing each other in five years. We got dinner and drinks and he was a complete gentleman. The moment he saw me, he picked me up and kissed me. I was taken back because I wasn’t expecting it to be a date, but I reciprocated back and loved it. We went on another date where we went for a walk and danced and kissed. He didn’t expect anything after those dates. It felt right and then the pandemic happened and he went back to his state. He would invite me to see him many times and when he went back to my state, he would invite me all the time. But due to the pandemic, I said no because I was nervous. He was understanding but after me saying no a million times, we went our separate ways and he got a girlfriend. Don’t blame him. They broke up a couple of months ago and he reached out to me again. We talk almost everyday or sometimes a few times a week. He invited me to see him again and I’m fully vaccinated and feel comfortable going (May wait another month due to the new variant). But now I’m afraid what if it doesn’t work out? What if he is like the other guys I went for? In the past, he’s admitted to liking me and even invited me thanksgiving last year and meet his friends and family. What if it is all a ploy to get me to sleep with him? I don’t want to waste the money and time on someone who doesn’t see potentional  in me. I’ve been meaning to ask him what his intentions are, but I’ve been trying to find the right time.
