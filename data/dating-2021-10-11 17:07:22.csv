She has been planned all date. I came from a 4 hours distance to her city. We were talking like 2 weeks and all clues were great, but I was nervous. After all, why wouldn't I? It would be my third serious relationship since my 18th birthday and as you guess I am fairly unexperienced. She took me to the lunch where she reserved for us and we talked a lot about ourselves. It was natural, nothing was forced. After that, she taught me backgammon and we had a fun time. She was like a little excited girl and I absolutely liked it.   
For the afternoon, she guided me to historical parts of her city. I fucking love history and I couldn't believe how thoughtful of her because she know how much I love history. At the streets of old city, we were holding hands. It happened suddenly, without thinking.   
And finally, she took us to the dinner reservation. It was a pleasant dinner and we had a conversation about the day, our lives, our majors etc. I am an aeronautical engineering student and she is medical school student (We are not from US).   
At the end of the day, I  dropped her off at the bus station and we hugged before leaving. In her eyes, there was a expression, a priceless one.  She put her hand to my chest, exactly to where my heart's supposed place. At this moment, I fell in love with her.  
While I was on my way back to my town, she told me she had an unforgettable day and she likes me a lot.  I am the happiest now and can't think straight. This sub helped me very much. Thank you people for everything. Hope always exists, you taught me this well. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I was talking to this girl for a month and we were vibing over text. Finally got a date lined up and it's honesty going good. She's laughing, we're making conversation, no bad vibes. We were supposed to go to an arcade for Part 2 of the night and headed out. When we got there separately she abruptly texted me that she didn't realize the time and had to get home. I had already got in and paid for the tickets so that was a small bummer but worse her text tone was pretty cold and I later saw she unmatched me/hasn't texted back when I asked if she made it home safely. 

Initially I was over here wondering myself if I gave off any red flags or wondered what she didn't like and if so I wish she would have told me the reason she ended it this way. But the more I think about it.. I dodged a bullet. I mean it took her a month to free up some time, she pushed back our date's time by 30 mins and then was an additional 20 minutes late. She doesn't respect my time or me enough to let me know what was wrong or why she doesn't wish to continue talking. 

I'm still bummed of course because of the time investment and because we were getting on pretty well but I think I'll be taking a break from dating to smooth out my rough edges for future endeavors.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q67gyw/ditched_and_ghosted/

Lately, I've been on a few dates, but everyone seems to expect more and bring it to sex. I don't mind having sex now, but at the same time I really don't want to have sex with anyone, I'd rather save it for a relationship or someone I really like.

I met this woman on eHarmony. I feel sorrow because today she saw too many red flags. Now, based on me saying that alone, I wanna be very clear, I am not talking about things that are negative attributes about me. However it is the current predicament I am currently in.

About 3 nights ago, somebody tried breaking into my families house and nothing was stolen. It was while we were asleep. Seeing as I am alive, the assassins were pretty shitty. Now I talked about this with the woman I was interested in and I believe she thought I sought trouble. Nothing like this has ever happened to our family in our lives. So this is something worth talking about.

I am making a solid career change. Meaning I am going out of my comfort zone trying to accomplish something hard to get. I wanna be a welder. I haven’t welded in about 3 years professionally. So that was something I brought up as well.

I have PTSD, so my humor is a bit darker than most. I tend to cope with my issues through humor because if I don’t, it’s gonna be a messy alcohol fueled rant about why the internet should be wiped.

17,q68y3r,1633995668,Is he hiding something?,"Hi everyone,

I want to preface this by saying I have nothing against bisexuality. This post does not imply that I do not support bisexual folks. This post is about me trying to understand if my boyfriend is hiding a secret from me regarding his sexuality. Here goes:

I have been dating a 36 year old man for 3 months now. A few weeks into our relationship, my boyfriend started making comments and sharing info that made me question his sexuality and his relationship with his male best friend who lives an hour and half away by car, and whom he sees on a regular basis (every couple weeks or so). I would love your opinion about whether this does seem to indicate a romantic interest in his best friend/something going on under the surface:

1. They have sleepovers at each other's houses every couple of weeks, for 2 - 3 days at a time. There is no-one else present except for the two of them. 2) My boyfriend says things like ""we shared a beer"", ""I pay for him all the time and don't really keep track of whether he's paying for me"". 3) They text each other everyday, and from what I've seen sometimes the texts are detailed descriptions of what they are doing that day etc. 4) They chat on the phone regularly. 5) My boyfriend said that they always hang out alone and that they don't include their partners in their plans usually. 6) They go to the movies alone. 7) They go to concerts alone. 8) They go on camping trips alone. 9) They are planning a trip across the country alone to his bestfriend's city where his best friend is going to show him where he grew up. He mentioned this trip to me and very unenthusiastically asked if I wanted to come and that he was telling me about the trip because he felt he had to since we are dating but quickly followed that up by saying his best friend's girlfriend had declined the invite, thereby discouraging me from going along with them. 10) They carved pumpkins together last fall?!? 11) I once asked how long he'd known his best friend and he responded by saying ""I've been with Bob for -"" and then quickly corrected himself and said ""I've been friends with him since high school, but we weren't in touch the entire time"". 12) Once when we were coming up with nicknames for each other we settled on bear and bun-bun. And he out of nowhere said ""Bob's a bun-bun too"". 13) Once when describing his relationship with Bob where Bob likes to do the planning he said ""the way you're my babygirl, I'm his babygirl"" in this playful joking way. 14) When asked about why he never got to the level of asking any of his exes to marry him he said ""I dont know if I can get there with a woman"" - no idea what this means or if there's another way to interpret it than the obvious. 15) The first time he went over for a 2 day sleepover at Bob's shortly after we'd begun dating he took hours and hours to text me back and thought that was acceptable until I brought it up. 16) When I asked him pointblank if there was something going on with him and Bob he said ""you have no evidence"" which was a startling response. When asked if he was bisexual he said ""is there something about me that looks that way?"" but still denies anything going on with Bob. He admits they have an intense friendship but denies that there is anything more than that, most recently saying ""its not like we are in love or anything"" in reference to Bob.

She seems pretty apologetic each time. But the flaking is always like super last minute and it’s starting to annoy me. 

Afterward, we keep texting/sending voice notes pretty consistently with a bit of sexting mixed in. But I can’t help but wonder if she’s just avoiding letting me down and doesn’t actually want to see me?

22,q69jl8,1633997583,"Men, why can’t you be friends with women?","Before you come for me, if this post doesn’t resonate with you, then I’m obviously not talking about you, because we are speaking in terms of “many” not “all”. Anyways I just moved to CO in June and have been going on dates and what not, and not every person you go on a date with means you’ll connect romantically, sexually, or even platonically. I have been on many dates where I wasn’t sexually attracted to the person or romantically interested, but we still hit it off as friends and I would definitely befriend many of the men I went on dates with, but for them that does not seem to be the case. I just wonder do men not want to be friends with women they met off a dating app? I have had plenty of male friends, but I met them in real life and not on dating app, so does that mean in their mind meeting someone off a dating app it’s either all or nothing? Are they worried you’re secretly interested in them and will use a friendship as a means to get into a relationship with them? Are guys just not able to see women as people and only something to be fucking or dating? Every guy I’ve gone on a date with the exception of one, after the first date did not want to continue being friends, after I made it clear I’m not interested sexually or romantically OR we even hooked up, but they don’t want anything serious. None of these things bother me, but I don’t get why men are so quick to be like “bye” if you don’t want to fuck or date them, but you definitely connected on a friend level. Does it seem like just too much work to remain friends because you believe something is expected of you? I don’t consider being friends with someone a “chore” and why wouldn’t you want to make a new friend? Almost every dating profile out there says people are open to connecting with like-minded people, meeting new people, making new relationships/friendships except no one seems to follow through. Maybe it’s just because I am new here and want to make friends, but that isn’t the reason I am on dating apps, I can’t seem to figure it out! To be perfectly honest I think it would be best to meet someone as a friend, and then go from there, I feel like it takes the pressure off of both parties unless you are exclusively looking for sex or a relationship, but even then you can’t possibly know if you would date, sleep with, or even befriend someone you haven’t met in person. If you go in truly open to whatever may happen, the man doesn’t have to feel pressured to pay for the food or drinks, or try to force something romantic to happen. If you’re actually open to “anything” doesn’t friendship fall under that? I cannot seem to figure it out. I’ve gotten the typical post first date text that states they aren’t emotionally ready to date, and my response is okay cool, let’s just be friends and hangout because we have a lot of the same interests and a good time together. (I am an honest person, if I couldn’t just be friends with someone without wanting to date them or have sex with them, I wouldn’t ask to try to be friends). Sorry for the super long post, but I really would like some input/advice from a man’s perspective.

TLDR: Meet plenty of men on dating apps that I don’t connect with romantically or sexually, but connect with platonically on friendship level, but they don’t want to be friends, regardless of me saying I am down to be friends.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q69jl8/men_why_cant_you_be_friends_with_women/

All I look forward to is the next date or text. And when things inevitably don’t work out, I become a wreck. A girl recently ended it with me after 4 dates, and now all I can think about is every little thing I could’ve done better to make it work with her. I haven’t done any work in over a week (for my mentally strenuous job) and I’m worried what my manager/coworkers are thinking.

Fortunately (I guess?) dating prospects are rare for me, as a short average-looking male using dating apps. So when an opportunity actually arises I cling to the hope that it will turn into something meaningful. I’ve never been in a real relationship, and I’m jealous of people I who just became a couple with the first person they dated.

Part of me thinks it’s better I give up hope of finding someone so I at least remain emotionally stable. And yes, I’ve heard the advice along the lines of “don’t chase, just work on yourself”. I did that for years and had no romantic life to speak of, lol. I’m fit and comfortable with my body, and I’ve progressed in my career and have a lot saved/invested. I have (mostly male) friends and hobbies that I do enjoy when I’m not a wreck.

52,q6ccnt,1634006957,I've had the worst luck when it comes to girls,"As the title states I've had the worst luck when it comes to girls. Went to an all boys high school so going out with girls wasn't really all that simple. Was never the partying or drinking type and always hung around with guys so I was never really in the situation to meet and ask out girls in high school. 

Fast forward to college and one thing I was really looking forward to was going to schools with girls again. I was ready to start dating. Anyways, in college is where my bad luck comes in. Even friends of mine have told me they can't believe how bad my luck is and that the girls that I've dealt with haven't exactly been nice (to put it nicely).

My freshman year I asked out this one girl who agreed to go out on a date with me. We were messaging to plan the actual date and she ghosted me. This was really frustrating at the time especially since I was pretty excited to be going on my first date. Anyways, I tried to follow up with her once thinking maybe she just didn't see the message but still nothing. 

In my sophomore year I asked out this one girl. She's been the only one who actually handled the situation well. I asked her out, she thanked me but told me that she had a boyfriend. Ok that was pretty straight forward. I find out a year later from one of my friends that she didn't have a boyfriend but was actually trying to hookup with him at the time. He wasn't interested in her and that was that. I personally don't have a problem with her lying to me because she was straightforward letting me know that she wasn't interested.

In my junior year I met this girl I really liked. We spent hours talking to each other and I asked her out a few days later. She told me she really just doesn't have the time to date right now but wanted to keep talking. So we kept talking. After about a month of talking to her I was planning on asking her out again over spring break since I figured she'd have the time to actually go out. But before that happens she tells me she has a boyfriend... I was completely taken off guard by this. We've been talking for over a month with each other and even my friends thought that our conversations were leading to something. I recall my friends girlfriend later on telling me that she's shocked that we didn't go out. Anyways I talked to the girl asking her what the story was as I didn't believe that she had a boyfriend. I figured if she actually did she would've told me when I first asked her out. She tells me that she really does have a boyfriend but really wants to be friends with me. I assured her it's ok if she wants to stop talking if things are too awkward and she kept insisting that she really wants to be friends. Long story short we keep talking for a few more months and eventually she just stopped talking to me and I find out that she never had a boyfriend. 

These aren't the only girls I was talking to throughout my time at college but these are the only three I actually asked out. My issue with my experience with girls is that majority of them have led me on instead of just saying no. Like I don't even care if you lie to me and say you have a boyfriend but to do that after a month of talking is just so screwed up to me. 

So now, this past summer, I started using online dating and even that's not going well. I'm just struggling to get matches and I really don't know why I'm having such a hard time. Even my friends are surprised. I'm 6'5 and have been told that I'm above average looking but yet I'm really struggling to get a single date.

Fast forward until now, I just moved to the city that he lives in and him and his ex just broke up. He hit me up and we went on a date that went super well, he even grabbed my hand. We hung out once more this week and I ended up sleeping with him after a night out with our friends. We hooked up like 5 times and the sex was insanely good, he made it very clear that he really enjoyed it too. But all the positions we did were from the back? I mentioned it to him later and he said it’s just what he likes and I told him it was weird, like he didn’t wanna look at me or something and he said it’s not like that. Everything after that has been fine… He texted me right after he left and the next day on my birthday. I’m going to kind of back off though cause to be honest, it really does seem like he really likes me but maybe is scared to fall for me or get into something too quickly? That’s the vibe I’m getting… He does seem really interested but there have been a few things that are a little hot/coldish in our communication.

Sorry for the bad writing, I am just venting rn because I feel stuck. 

About 3 years ago I met a girl at the summer camp job I was working. I was 18, she was 17 and I was off to college (as well as it’s football program). I won’t go too much into her looks- so sorry if you came to get-off haha jk. Ight. So we hit it off and we were flirting and talking a lot and had a physical connection and I guess you could say the budding of something more. 

Close to the end of camp. I unadded her on snap. The exact reasons why are cloudy to me but I think I was trying to set up a date ti meet her mom but her schedule was iffy then. I unadded her while talking to my [then] close friend. We were just jerking around and laughing about it. 

Who’d of known I could’ve had her then and the next years of pain wouldn’t of happened most likely…

I went off to college and had a wild first half.  Even tho she was on my mind, I was finally out of that small town and had options. In the first semester and a half I had the possibility of sleeping with around 25 girls that I had met throughout campus , parties + tinder (Shit I remember those tinder days LMAO). However due to ED problems which got worse that year (not medical ed) , I either cut dates short, or just crossed some lines while staying in the ball-park. 

Okay so I find her number on my computer around January, text her, we call, and It was the happiest I’d been that year. I can remember that hour or so as write this. The LED lights in my room that lit up the windows view of the city and the slow beats playing on the speaker. 

Well. I lied, this is gunna take a lot more sentences than I thought… If you want to know more I’d be happy to tali with u guys but the timeline of me and this girl knowing each other, going back and fourth for years, the emotional rollarcoaster, tears so much that now I can’t lose more if I wanted- was as I said 2019 to just maybe months ago. And now I have a girlfriend who is so similar to me and a fantastic beautiful girl. But idk if I even realize that. She has dreams of me but my sleeping mind is racing over someone else. I feel obsessed. Fortunately, I have been doing better but I get periods of a dropping feeling like when tragedy hits you. I instantly want to check her ig and see what’s up with her. I deleted all my socials bc of this. I also had to watch her date another guy (both were seniors, I was out of hs) We never dated (pathetic)  but she gave me great joy while also rotting me.

The older I’m getting more I’m realising the same gender roles I’m mentally assigning (and dismissing people for) aren’t even true for myself. I’d say I’m both feminine and masculine. It doesn’t make sense to assign a specific role/position blindly against a gender.

Why can’t I let go of the idea that a guy has to pay for finances 100%? I work (do pretty well) and we’d both benefit if we shared our wealth. I feel like I’m disrespecting myself if I let this go. Of course I do occasionally chip in but even then I naturally gravitate towards it but I attempt to talk myself out of it.

65,q6cv8m,1634008716,Dating a guy (M/31) with depression - should I hold on or let go?,"I apologize for such a long post but there is just so much going on with my head. 

I (F/24) have been dating this guy (M/31) that I met on Tinder for two months now. We connected emotionally since the very beginning and I feel like I am slowly growing a bond with him. I am well-aware that he has been struggling with depression for awhile because he told me so, that is partly because he hasn't seen his family back in the states for 2 years now due to covid and he is upset...he also just broke up with his ex few months ago. He told me that his struggle with depression has nothing to do with his ex or anything, but told me to be patient for him to cope with it...and I have been very patient, giving him the time and space that he needed. 

We have been on nine dates in total, and only slept together on our fifth date. We barely meet that often, probably once or twice per week and usually we just get quick dinner and it was only until recently I would stay over at his place after a movie night. He was very respectful of me since day one and made sure that I am comfortable with us being intimate.

I thought everything was going fine until last night when he told me that he wants to take things slow between us (by trying to be FRIENDS first), and I didn't understand because I thought we have been progressing extremely slow given the number of times we have actually been on dates, I didn't even talk about exclusivity yet. He also told me he wants to put sex on hold with me because he felt pressurized not knowing if I enjoyed it – which I told him I did. He just kept insisting that we have to take things slow and I am not sure how to process this. 

He said he felt stressed because sometimes whenever he doesn't text me, he felt that I was mad at him, which I was never once mad at him. Though, I have told him my mind would wander off and think he is seeing someone else when he goes away more than 6 hours and not reply. He also said he felt stressed whenever I plan on going cute dates with him, because with depression, he said he just wants to do nothing and stay at bed all day on the weekend....I understood and didn't make a fuss when he kindly rejected our date to farmers market last week. In short, he just kept saying he is stressed out because I have expectations that he can't met - which I have never set any expectations for him at all. I was genuinely okay with just having a dinner and watch a movie with him, but he just kept saying that he couldn't make me happy.  I couldn't understand either because I have never expressed that I was unhappy with him. 

When I try to cut him off, he would tell me that he is going to be sad and hurt because he still wants to hold me close and take things slow with me, and wants us to keep in touch still so it allows a healthy relationship to eventually develop while he tries to resolve his own mental issue. It is mentally tormenting for me because I don't want to treat his depression as a joke, but I also am wondering if he is using it as an excuse to keep me by his side while he still wants to see other girls. I did clarify with him and he promised that he isn't trying to see anyone else on Tinder. 

It sucks because I have been patient with him by giving the space and time needed, with no expectations at all. We are already progressing slow and now he wants us to even progress slower....it is so out of the blue so I don't know what wants from me? I want to let this go, but at the same  time, the bond that I have developed for him kinda make me want to just let him string me along until he is okay. I don't know if anyone has gone through this but any advice would help.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6cv8m/dating_a_guy_m31_with_depression_should_i_hold_on/

I am 23 and I have never had a girlfriend. I have gone on dates, had sex, kissed, held hands, everything up to being able to ask a girl to be in a relationship with me. This isn’t to say there haven’t been times in my life that I’ve talked to a girl and felt interested. There have been girls that I felt very strongly about and wanted to be my girlfriend, but obviously things never worked out with them. 

At this point I wonder if I’ll be 30 and still have this problem. I see my friends of both genders getting into and out of relationships all the time, and yet I can’t even get a girlfriend. Even friends that I’ve talked about this with are in relationships now, and they’ve gone through similar challenges. The girls that I do go on dates with I usually meet through dating apps since I have a hard time approaching girls in person. I don’t know if I can pin it on any one thing, but if I had to list my reasons it’s my own lack of self-confidence, insecurities and mental self-sabotage.

I remember when I was about 16 that a then-friend told me that I just “wasn’t a relationship person”, maybe there was truth to that because I never had a girlfriend in high school and went to prom alone. I wonder if it’s something in my family since my brother has never had one either (from what I can tell- we don’t usually talk about that stuff). I even remember my dad asking a college tour guide if their school offered any clubs or classes to teach dating skills (in front of me). The most recent time that I felt like I had something going with a girl was back in November 2020, and when I told my family about it their first reaction was to yell at me for going on dates with someone during COVID. Things didn’t work out with her for other reasons, but that was incredibly disheartening since I rarely talk to my family about my romantic life (not that I’ve ever really had much to talk about). 

My job also doesn’t really do me any favors. I’m in the military, and I’m very passionate about what I do. In college I was so focused on academics and ROTC that I missed a few opportunities with people that I could have pursued. Even when I date a girl I mentally self-sabotage and always think that there’s no way this could ever work out since I’ll be moving within a few years. 

It’s like there’s always something else going on in my life that prevents me from having a normal romantic life. Whether it’s my job’s workload, my finances, or something else, I just never seem to have the time. 

I don’t know if anyone here can offer me any advice, I suppose it just feels good to type this out and share it with someone since I would be scared to admit all these things to any of my friends in person. I just know that I really want to have a partner in my life, and I’ve felt this way for years and years now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6e0dh/i_m23_am_feeling_hopeless/
85,q6e1h7,1634012760,Dating app tips,"These are the ones that worked best for me:

1) being average in terms of looks is fine. Get nice pictures. Be sure to include pictures of you being social, and your pets.

2) be considerate and respectful. Do not pressure anyone to do anything. Going with the mindset of just talking to people (maybe kissing) did wonders for me, because I'm never disappointed lol. Sometimes it's nice to just have a chat with a stranger and listen to them venting. It's okay to practice social skills, and even if you end up just being friends, having women as friends is a huge green flag. 

2.1) nothing is hotter than being responsible about sex and practicing consent. Nothing kills libido like pressuring the other person, making them feel unsafe or outright grossed out. 

3) it doesn't really matter if things do not work well between you.

4) do not swipe only on models. The cute, average looking girl you swiped left on is actually awesome. 

5) nothing melts a girl heart like cookies or petit gateau. Seriously, learn to cook. After you enter a relationship, give her friends and family food and they love you (they matter A LOT). 

5.1) again, a petit gateau you cooked on your pictures will do wonders lol

6) you don't want many matches, you want to match with the right person. So don't be afraid to put your political opinion/things you like on your bio. 

7) be humble. Ego is your worst enemy. Don't just talk, listen to what she is saying. 

8) when on a date, pay attention to the things she likes/important details and keep them on a notepad.

9) head over to r/sex and learn to do oral and (if you like women), fingering.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6e1h7/dating_app_tips/

I try to be super accommodating and a very relaxed person in relationships. I don’t like to tell people what to do or how to spend their time. 

So basically my bf (we recently became exclusive, maybe about a month ago. But we’ve been talking for about four months now) had a foot injury due to a sports game. I thought that he would take it easy, I offered him my support/whatnot. We are in a long distance relationship so there’s not too much I can do immediately.

Anyway, he decided that he would play another game tonight. Now my real thought was ‘you’re an idiot’, but of course I didn’t say that. I basically said ‘do what you want, I’m not gonna stop you.’ Like I was trying to communicate that I didn’t agree with that decision, but still left it up to him. 

So he went to the game and played.

After the game was over, i texted him like “oh maybe you should go put ice on your foot now” and stuff. And he was REALLY passive aggressive. Like “oh, okay MOM.’ or ‘thanks MOTHER’

And I’m just like ‘did I do something wrong??’ Like, is it wrong to be concerned about other people, especially those who you’re dating?

Third date today was great as well. We had a nice dinner at this restaurant and then we went to another beach again and we made out for at least 2 +hours non stop. 

My only concern is that I think I was moving to fast with her on the third date as I tried doing more things than making out like reaching for her chest, butt and private area and I made sure to ask for her consent every times to make sure she was still ok with everything and she gave me consent  but then eventually she asked me what I want from us and I asked the same and we agreed to be in a relationship which is what I wanted the whole time but I’m gonna take it a bit slower with her from now on because even tho she said it was ok I feel like maybe it wasn’t and I don’t want her to get the wrong idea about me or think I’m moving her to fast or think all I want it sex.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6e5o5/second_and_third_date_went_amazing/

Otoh, I barely get likes from 20-something dudes. Is there a reason for this? I get a handful of 28/29 year olds, and barely any 23-27 year old dudes, which tbh is sort of odd to me?

Anyways, any insight into what may be going on here?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6eh57/im_a_woman_in_my_mid_20s_and_i_barely_get_likes/

I don't want to date him anymore, he scares me so much I've tired to give him the benefit of the doubt but he won't stop hurting me. 


I am afraid if I break up with him he will hurt me or even kill me. I don't like this man. I don't want to date him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6ejst/he_hurt_me/

I like many things, especially anime, movies, art, reading, although I haven't done much since my laptop broke, if you like these, I will marry me. But seriously, if I sound like fun. :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6eozn/meet_to_like_it/
99,q6eq3m,1634015293,Mixed signals.. Need help,"Hey everyone.. There is this girl whom I’m acquainted with. Recently, she has been showing signs (I assume) that she is interested in me.

For starters, she always stares at me whenever I’m nearby, Another time it seemed like she went out of her way to walk right beside me with her head down smiling. My friend even said he thought he heard her whisper my name to her friend before they walked past. 

Lastly, she added me back on a social media app..

Am I looking into this too much? What should I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6eq3m/mixed_signals_need_help/
