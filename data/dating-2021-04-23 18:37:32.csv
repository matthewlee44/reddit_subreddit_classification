2,mx8fa4,1619222490,Do I hit her up again in the future?,"Matched with this girl on a dating app and we really connected and talked a lot. We had similar goals and interests. Sadly we do not live in the same city. She came to my city with her friends and it was during a busy day for me (classes, work, among other things) but I still squeezed in a small hang out with her. I only had about an hour and a half with her give or take. However it was not a date sadly it was just me tagging along with her and her friends (Probably mistake #1). We all grabbed dinner together. I paid for the bill because I wanted to be a gentleman and to keep my principles that a guy should pay for the first date, even though this was not a date I wanted to still impress her in some fashion. Honestly talking and hearing what this girl said made me just like her so much more. She was just the type you want to bring back home, she had strong goals, she was on a grind that I found so attractive. Fast forward she leaves to go back home and talking is regular, she says things like come to where I live and we can make it an actual date. Hearing this eased my stress because even though the day was not how I would of liked it, at least it seemed like she saw something more and was willing to keep it going. Fast forward a few days after, she hits me up saying ""I am sorry but I want to focus on myself, this semester has been a lot of work."" Basically she cuts it off with me. I do believe that is the case because she has a major and two minors and has an internship among other priorities. She says ""Maybe when life is a little less hectic we can start talking again."" To be honest, I am still kind of just latching on to this little message in hopes it is the case. As someone who struggles in the dating world this one kind of hurt.

Would it be wrong to hit her up in the near future and see where things can go or is it just over and I should not even bother?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mx8fa4/do_i_hit_her_up_again_in_the_future/

13,mx9zlj,1619228109,Why would a guy chase after you for 2 years.,"I am a 29F and I am seeing a 36M. Why would a guy chase after you for 2 years while you are in another relationship? Make a point to flirt even though I wouldn't flirt back. It's not my style to be nefarious in that way. When I'm in a relationship with someone I give them my full attention and drop everyone else.

We went to a concert together with a group of friends and i had a crush on him instantly but I was seeing another person at the time. 

Over the 2 years this guy sent me riddles, invites to concerts, horror clips, cute furniture pictures. We share quite a few likes and interests. Outdoor activities are very similar. On paper, this is pretty much a great start.. We are both into horror and the goth scene. Have the same style in decor, we are both extremely hard working individuals. I gave him a chance and he doesn't show interest after a week of hanging out. Wtf is that even? I am constantly told I am an intimidating female. I understand that about myself and I'm not afraid of it.

This guy is either egotistical and to into himself meaning his own wants and needs for strange, he enjoys the single life and is not looking for a commitment, or has no idea what to do with me out of fear. It's hard to find the line between someone playing games and actually just purely busy.

Unfortunately, I'm into romance and effort. I am divorced, my ex-husband was a sheriff and like most sheriffs he was aggressive and abusive. I am just done with bullshit games.. When I am attracted to someone I give them my my full benefit of the doubt, my time and effort. If I'm not receiving that back I lose interest quickly and build my walls back up.

Me personally if I think I‚Äôm getting ghosted I‚Äôll send a follow up question text like ‚Äúis everything ok?‚Äù, and then sometimes I‚Äôll send one last text after that if the first one goes unanswered kind of as a last shot for closure.

19,mxamiq,1619230496,Just wanna share some thoughts and concerns of mine,"I just want to talk about my situation and hear some feedback, please tell me if this is the wrong sub to post this to. So to start off I am currently a 20 y/o guy who's never had a relationship. Before you ask I'm not fat and I do take showers. Also I've had my fair share of female friends throughout my years so I don't think I'm coming off as a creep cause who would wanna be friends with someone who's creepy. So I don't have a problem talking or making friends with girls it's just when trying to take it further something gets lost in translation. Now that's out of the way I can get on with the situation I'm in. I got accepted to a new university that I will be attending next fall in a different city I'm in now. I will be living in the dorms and attending class in person. Compared to my current situation where I'm taking online classes in my community college and living with my parents I will have a lot more opportunities to not only meet potential partners but people in general. I also plan to join some clubs. I love drama so I will be doing that. I also play basketball a lot so that's another opportunity. Point is I plan to put myself out there as much as possible and try to get myself out of my comfort zone. A question I have is what/how can I increase my chances of finding someone?

I will now go over my personality traits. To start off I am a very introverted and shy person by nature. I am very similar to Hinata if anyone reading this has seen Naruto. The reason is because I had very bad speech issues growing up. While I can talk fine now, I didn't start speaking full words until I was 4 and had a very bad stutter until I reached middle school. I slowly learned how to communicate with people but it was a very hard process. Also I don't have any siblings and other than my parents I don't have any family in my city. So I never had family around my age to help me break out of my shell. As a result this molded me into the introvert I am today. However since I am introverted I am a very good listener according to my friends. I can recall minor details from conversations that happened weeks ago. So no matter what is going on I will always lend an ear and empathize. Also I am an active person and I do some kind of work out most days. So I will always keep up my appearance psychically wise. Also I like to think I'm a positive person and I always try to see the best in people. I'm not claiming to be a saint and I certainly am capable of losing my temper here and there. I try to go throughout my life treating everyone with the kindness that they deserve.

My main weakness however is my lack of confidence and low self esteem. I've always been a timid person and sometimes have a hard time standing up for myself. Because of all the relationship failure I've had in the past I can beat myself up over it. It just makes me feel like I'm not good enough since no girl has deemed me worthy. I feel very left out it's human nature to feel shitty about being left out. How I describe it to people is if a kid forgets his homework and has to sit in the classroom while looking out the window and seeing all his friends playing on the playground having fun. Also because I have failed over and over I don't have a lot of confidence. Think about it this way if you were playing basketball and you airballed a bunch of 3 pointers would you feel confident in your jumpshot? Hell no. I've heard from a lot of people girls like confidence more than anything but I don't really understand why low confidence is such a huge issue. Nobody is perfect and everyone has their own demons and flaws they are living with. I have plenty of good things I can bring to the table so why does this one little character flaw cancel out all of my good traits? When it comes to the advice part I would love to hear what kind of thoughts you guys have about me and what I can do to improve myself.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxamiq/just_wanna_share_some_thoughts_and_concerns_of/

And I‚Äôm over fifty. I tried the dating apps and it didn‚Äôt turn out well for me. I‚Äôm not a doctor or a medical expert. 
But I believe he was a Narcissist that rocked my world. 
Not in a good way. 
It took a year to recover. And then I started to look on the apps again but with hesitation because of the fear of it happening again. 
The thing is I know what love feels like. The excitement, compassion, sex everything about it.
And I miss it. And I also realize that I need human touch. It makes you feel alive. It make you feel human.
A partners love its different from your families love.
Anyway let me get to my point. After dating a few times with no success.
There was guy who really liked me and we have stayed friends and talk every once in a while. He never stopped trying.
He‚Äôs a nice guy just not my type. And I can‚Äôt see us together as a couple. 
But I thought since I can‚Äôt get a date why not be friends with benefits. So many people do it I think!
So I called him and ask if he was interested!
And he said hell yes. And I went to his house and it began. Sex was great! 
And I thought I had it made.
Having sex ,human contact no commitment. I thought I hit the jackpot and so does he I‚Äôm sure.
And now I‚Äôm a few months in we‚Äôve seen each a handful of times.
But I don‚Äôt think I made for this. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm having feelings for him. I‚Äôm starting to question me.

This is not who you are. And it hurts.

I was shocked, lol! No one has ever said that to me. I sat there, flabbergasted, and chuckled. I told her no one has said that before. I got quiet with my inner voice screaming at me to say something back to show my interest. Then, after a few moments, she proceeded to take pictures and move me along.

With this being a drs office, I couldn't decide if it would be appropriate for me to ask her out on the job. I go back in a few weeks. I plan on bringing this up and asking her then. I mean, it comes across as a huge hint to me, lol!

I‚Äôve actually had a similar problem in my relationships- where men I‚Äôve dated find it difficult to open up, even after a year or two of being together. Most of the time I try my best to give them the space they need and encourage them to be vulnerable when they need to be, but at times it was so hard to get them to communicate with me. I‚Äôve never seen a boyfriend of mine cry, which I‚Äôve found strange, though perhaps it could also be because they never had anything happen that was serious enough to cry about (I doubt this is the case, though).

I didn‚Äôt quite know how to phrase the title of the post, but I‚Äôm curious to see if perhaps there are ways to get through and have a boyfriend feel supported/safe enough to open up about his feelings when he needs to.

She said she‚Äôd never met another guy like me, that i was the first person she‚Äôd been in love with in 3 years, that she wanted to come back out to see me for a week over Memorial Day weekend.

Before she left she mentioned that her first week back would be crazy with moving her stuff from her parents to her new place in another city, family/work stuff, visiting her best friend, etc and that she probably would be pretty unavailable during that time.

30,mxbvwc,1619235413,How many of you (men) would consider seriously dating a woman with chronic health challenges?,"Hi men of Reddit, here‚Äôs my situation:
I developed chronic health issues in my early 20s after a bad reaction to a vaccine (there‚Äôs now a class action suit because so many women either died or have lifelong health problems from it... my cousin almost died from it too) and despite doing literally *everything* in my power (diets, fasting, naturopaths, Accupuncture, supplements, meditation, energetic healing, conventional western medicine... etc) I STILL have debilitating health issues. 

I have chronic pain, migraines, POTS (I get dizzy and almost faint a lot), arthritis, nerve pain, intermittent paralysis in my hands, and chronic fatigue. I guess I‚Äôm lucky to be alive since my limbs were paralyzed for 2-3 weeks when I was 22 and I couldn‚Äôt walk. I had to relearn how to walk again. But no matter how much effort and money I pour into being ridiculously conscious and putting tons of effort my health, it is *still* far from normal, and I *still* cannot work more than part-time because of this.

This has caused me immense grief and devastation, since I used to be super athletic, healthy, smart, and was the hardest working person I know. Always scoring the top 1% of everything. I feel like a shadow of my former self, with all these health issues.

When I was healthy dating was no problem. I had several normal and fulfilling relationships that ended peacefully because we just had different goals in life. Since being chronically ill, though, dating is an absolute nightmare. I went on numerous first dates from OkCupid, all of them starting well and ending awkwardly in rejection when I went into more extensive details about my health issues (I never hid it from anyone, but when I went into more detail it scared them off). Attracting men isn‚Äôt my problem, but finding a man who is ok with commuting to a chronically ill woman is. 

My last relationship ended after I discovered I was being cheated on the entire time. 
I‚Äôm not satisfied with my current relationship, because my partner doesn‚Äôt make me feel good romantically, sexually, or emotionally. Because of this, I am considering leaving it but I feel so broken and unworthy, so considering my health issues.

personally, i think we have to? like i told myself i wouldn't be open to dating people in this state because it would be unfair to them. i don't think i can give them the companionship they may be looking for. so even if I have the slightest of feelings for someone i wouldn't entertain it and I'd just choose to be their friend. but that's just me i wanna hear other opinions haha.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxcdcx/do_you_feel_you_have_to_fix_yourself_before/

36,mxcm40,1619238515,Going on a third date next week. I'm more nervous than I usually am.,"I've \[20s/M\] been on two great dates with a girl \[20s/F\] I love spending time with. Toward the end of last year, I left a long-term relationship, and I'm now in a spot where I feel comfortable dating again. Anyways, on our second date, we cooked dinner, and spend the evening talking. We talked for so long that she invited me to stay the night.

Before going to sleep, we kissed, and it was easily one of the best first kisses I've ever had. Still, we went to bed, and I had a very, very hard time going to sleep. I found myself cringing at things I'd said or done that night‚Äîwhich is relevant to this post. By the time I got back to my house that following morning, we'd already made plans for a third date.

Over the next several days, she'd text me several sweet things, mostly things about the night we were together. I'm not used to someone being so kind and direct, and it's made an otherwise bad week feel worthwhile. But I'm remarkably nervous about the third date. She's expressed justifiable worry given that I left a long-term relationship at the end of 2020, and I'm now paranoid thinking of numerous things that would cause an otherwise pleasant experience to fade out.

I'm not entirely sure what to expect for the third date. Part of my regret on the second date was waiting so long to enact any sort of physicality‚Äîand that's the cause of some past experiences in relationships that have hurt me. She was clearly wanting it, I just was too fearful to make the first move. 

I need to put far less pressure on myself considering I know she likes me in some capacity, but how can I stop living in my head for this upcoming date? It's a silly question, but I'm beyond aggravated at my thought process over the past week.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxcm40/going_on_a_third_date_next_week_im_more_nervous/

I had a totally different perspective. If I decide I want to start dating you. I‚Äôve already allowed you into my life as a part, and I‚Äôm going to enjoy you as a part of my life. Much more involvement from my side.

Moved on from that, doing better than ever but since I started dating again it‚Äôs been so bad lol. Red flags everywhere, I give everyone a decent shot and see the good in them as long as I can but ultimately end up breaking things off.

I have a few more responsibilities than the average 19y.o, so I tend to find most guys my age just too young. Problem is, since I was young I've really liked boys and I always want to have a guy in my life. I'm realizing now though that I probably won't find someone for a few years, which is fine but how do I enjoy my life without dating? and how do I get to the point where I'm perfectly happy without a romantic interest?

Advice?,"Had been talking to this guy for a few months prior to the meeting. He said he is open to a relationship but not with anyone (same). I ended up thinking that he was a bit too forward in the kindest way and I had gotten out of a relationship a month or so beforehand. We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again. A few days before our second date, he asked what I was up to one evening and offered movie night in pjs.

Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similiar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. Date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver. We have been in contact via social media a bit since.

I'm just unsure whether he should be the one that expresses what he wants in person or do I mention that this is what I'm after. He works till the evenings throughout the week and weekend so it seems that I can only see him after work hours.

47,mxdcaq,1619241755,I checked my [19F] bfs [26] phone and found things I wasn‚Äôt too happy with,"

Hi, I‚Äôve been with my current bf for about 6 months now. Ever since we got together I‚Äôve had trouble trusting him because of an incident that happened at a party. For some backstory, he threw a thanksgiving party and all of his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù came along. We had just got together on November 11, 2020 that‚Äôs when we made it official and the party was November 23. So, during the party everyone was really fucked up including myself and him. We were both on coke, molly, and alcohol. 

I‚Äôve never done those drugs before until I met him. It was a pretty fun night but I blacked out for the rest of the night. I went into one of the rooms, it was a party bnb we were at and I started throwing up like crazy and I passed out. Fast forward this girl I met that‚Äôs a friend of his comes into the room pacing back and fourth, grabs my face and tells me ‚ÄúI deserve better than him‚Äù I was still fucked up so I wasn‚Äôt making any sense of it. So the next morning after the girl texts me saying that my bf was hitting on her the entire night and that he tried kissing her but she refused and yelled at him to stop. 

I asked him what went on and he denied that happening saying that she wanted him and she got mad at him for leading her on and not telling her that he has a gf. I also found out that she took him to the bathroom with her and closed the door for a few seconds, then came running out. While that was happening I was in the room, Right next to him and her friends closed my door, trying to hear what was going on between them two. he didn‚Äôt even try to tell anyone there that I‚Äôm his girlfriend and show me off. So I let it slide and believed his word. Fast forward to now I checked his old phone and found his messages with her and he told her ‚Äúhow hot she is‚Äù after checking her Instagram while being with me, this was on November 12, the day after me and him got together. 

He also lied to me about hooking up with his girl friends and said he would never do such a thing but actually did when I saw one of his texts in the past talking about a threesome he had with his two girl friends at the time. I also saw another text he sent to one of this girl friends in the past, that said ‚Äúcome to the party, my friend is making medicated treats for everyone‚Äù I‚Äôm the friend he‚Äôs talking about even though I was his girlfriend. I confronted him &amp; He said he never wanted to tell me any of this cause he knew I would be hurt and he told me‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take you or our relationship that seriously in the beginning‚Äù am I wrong for being stuck on the past. Whenever I bring it up cause I‚Äôm not over it he gets very angry with me and starts yelling at me and telling me he wants to punch a wall.

I know I‚Äôm wrong for checking his phone but I wanted to know what really went on cause either side could of been lying. I will never know cause he denies that incident happening. I don‚Äôt know if I should break up with him or not or maybe I‚Äôm

Physically escalated a bit, and got cock blocked in a way while closing her number. Thoughts on how to defend against cock blockers?","Told my friends I‚Äôll catch up with them later. Hit on her so well, and physically escalated too. On top of that made friends with her friend as well I found out both are nurses and told them I‚Äôm in training to be a firefighter. Gave light touches, one compliment, found common interest, and instead of a palm read or similar physically escalation techniques. Talked briefly about what is the worst vital sign to take I said breathing rate, and pulse rate at same time and took her hand to demonstrate it. Almost like palm read.
Had them laughing the whole time. Great time

Then as I was closing her with number a douche younger kid asked if I wanted a shot of whatever I said sure, and then proceeded to wrap his arms around both girl necks like in a hugging way. 

Obviously a cock block move, and then I wasn‚Äôt fazed, and like 20-30 seconds to process it. I gently did an arm touch she turned around told her I‚Äôve got to go, and it was nice meeting her. 

Then told her in Portuguese she‚Äôs beautiful in her ear. Ask her if she knew what the means she said no, and I told her it meant you‚Äôre beautiful. 

She laughed I said goodbye. 

Texted her when I made it back to my friends place in Philly so she won‚Äôt forget who it is 
Texted her 20-35 minutes later saying ‚ÄúHey it‚Äôs Anthony, it was nice meeting you tonight.‚Äù
So far no response back.
What are your thoughts on the situation, and how do you use male cock blockers to your advantage?

66,mxelgi,1619247521,I'm (26F) unsure whether he's (35M) looking for something casual despite him saying he's open to a relationship. Advice?,"Had been talking to this guy for a few months prior to the meeting. He said he is open to a relationship but not with anyone (same). I ended up thinking that he was a bit too forward in the kindest way and I had gotten out of a relationship a month or so beforehand. We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again. A few days before our second date, he asked what I was up to one evening and offered movie night in pjs.

Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similiar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. Date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver. We have been in contact via social media a bit since.

I'm just unsure whether he should be the one that expresses what he wants in person or do I mention that this is what I'm after. He works till the evenings throughout the week and weekend so it seems that I can only see him after work hours.

68,mxenwk,1619247813,"Dick size is a socially created concept, women don't have any natural inclination to have a preference in it","Things we can agree on: Western society is obsessed with dick size, they seem to associate bad traits with small dicks, and good traits with big dicks. It's fundamentally among the most important parts of ""being a man"". No one is going to take a small endowed man serious, no matter how tall he is or how attractive or how rich. 

It hasn't always been this way though, the Greeks when they were in charge thought the bigger men were ""barbaric"" and small-endowed were more ""pure at heart"". So this is a recent thing with the Anglos deciding bigger=better.

So the reality is, it's BS. Under no other time in human history have women selected mates based on dick size until now. But here we are and we act like it's always meant to be this way. It's not. It's just not natural.

On a personal anecdote: I am an Asian dude so we all know about the stereotypes. I've managed to date several western K-pop fans ( [https://imgur.com/rhWAh3o](https://imgur.com/rhWAh3o) ) and none of them care about dick size. I'm not big but I'm not small either. But the point here is I'm just asking, why don't they care? There's nothing in the blood of K-Pop fans that should influence their dick size preferences. Yet, they just don't care.

The answer: K-Pop fans are not as easily influenced by Western media (the fact that they like an Eastern music genre should tell you this) that perpetuates the idea that dick size matters more than anything else and women should use it to select men. 

Dick size preferences are learned, not innate.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxenwk/dick_size_is_a_socially_created_concept_women/

He texts me at least twice every day and asks to see me almost every day. And he constantly tells me how much he likes me. 

The thing is he doesn‚Äôt respect my boundaries. One time he called and said he wanted to see me, and that he almost came to my apartment to surprise me. I told him ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt do that. Always make a plan with me before you come over.‚Äù He said, ‚Äúchallenge accepted.‚Äù And he only conceded when I told him I would not take his call if he showed unannounced. 

Then there‚Äôs sex. He doesn‚Äôt like to use condoms but it‚Äôs nonnegotiable for me. The first two times we had sex I had to tell him multiple times before he would put in a condom. 

Yesterday he asked to see me. I went for a walk with him. I talked to him about these two things. I told him that his actions made me feel like he didn‚Äôt respect me. He said that it was not his intention, and that he wouldn‚Äôt cross a line on purpose. It felt too easy so I told him ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you really get it‚Äù. But I decided to trust him. 

Later last night we started to have sex. And he again tried to penetrate without a condom. I stopped him, asked him why he didn‚Äôt respect me. Then I got up, sit on the couch and started watching TV by myself. He tried to apologize, but as I refused to further engage with him he left after a while. 

Today he texted me, asking me how I was and apologized again. I replied ‚ÄúI think we should cool it for a while.‚Äù He said ok. 

I know I‚Äôm in the right. I can‚Äôt let other people push my boundaries like that, especially when it concerns my health. But I still can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm overreacting.

&amp;#x200B;

just a little vent on my side about how things went wrong with a girl, TL;DR at the bottom.

So after I (M23) met a girl (F24) at an outdoor activity and having a great date, I noticed how she kinda avoided meeting up again by always having other plans. But whenever I got kinda sad or angry about that she would be really sorry and call me. While texting or calling (most times the phone call lasted a few hours) we got along pretty well and everything was fine.

So I kinda went for it and asked what the problem was, and she said that she has a problem with the distance between us (one has to drive about a good hour to meet the other one) and that failed for her in the past. And that she doesn't want that if things go the way she thinks its gonna head (so seemed like she expected it to become an relationship).

I was kinda devestated to be honest, since we got along so well and that something like that would even be a problem if everything else was fine. So I met up with her to discuss things and this time she said that she doesn't want something with that distance and that she also has the feeling things wouldn't go too well for us in the long term. Thing is she also couldn't explain why she feels that way, said she liked me and that it has nothing to do with me but she just has the feeling that with the distance and everything things will not turn out the way we want. 

What is also strange is that she said last time when I stated that I'm not a guy for fwb (since I think I will develop feelings) she kinda understood what I wanted and that she doesn't think things will work out that way. But when I was on the date with her she herself stated that she tried that in the past and developed feelings and that she wouldn't want to do it again.

So what the hell does she even want? She doesn't want a fwb again, but saying that you are looking for something serious in the long term (although I even said you dont have to start out that strong, just meeting up and seeing how things go for a while is fine) is appearantly too much? I'm at a loss here...

&amp;#x200B;

So thanks to anyone for reading, feel free to drop your opinion on the matter. It felt good to let it out.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Girl kinda avoided meetup after first date but kept contact, stated the distance to drive is too much between us for long term and said she doesnt want fwb again. Then at next meetup says that she has a feeling things wouldn't work out in the long term with the distance and me seeking something serious.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxhi3h/guess_its_over_before_it_even_really_started_and/
