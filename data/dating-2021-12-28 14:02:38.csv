0,rqocdy,1640721901,I'm not sure how to proceed.. | Money,"So I met this very nice girl I've been talking for about 2-3 months, Since Lockdown I couldn't meet her just yet even though it's all planned. We call a lot, video through phone etc. 

So to the matter at hand, Yesterday we were playing a game together and she sent me a snap about the concert she was going to in 2022. Which is super cool... But then I looked at how many concert she's going to. Literally on 3 days right after each other she was going to Shawn Mendes which was not the only thing. Also about 2-3 times to Justin Bieber, But she wasn't sure if she was going the third time. I asked out of curiosity how much that costed. 

It costed her over 2000 euro's and told me she emptied her savings account for it... My mind was blown. To empty an account for such a stupid thing was just mindblowning. However I could get past it and it was fine, She was now saving and wasn't thinking about spending more.

Now today, A friend of mine is doing a charity event for kids with cancer.. I support this friend quite a lot since he's doing so much with his community and everything. So I proceed to donate a 100 euro's, Which is a lot of money. I took it from the cut that I put aside every month and was like ''What's 100 euro's less for one month'' My friend was happy, I was happy and I felt just great. I was not doing it for the praise I wanted to tip my friend anomyous. My friend knew it was me since I literally said it to him but other than that nobody knew.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her and she responded with: Now that's a STUPID way to spend your money. Atleast I spend it on myself and have fun with it.... Which just kinda threw me off... Now she's angry and told me that I wasn't allowed to judge her spending... 

And I just don't know how to respond... What do I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rqocdy/im_not_sure_how_to_proceed_money/

But If I wasn’t trying to meet people it’s not really something that I would do. Unfortunately, my hobbies are the gym, coding, and woodworking(not currently doing), so I don’t really meet any girls. So when I go out that’s really the only reason(95% of the time, did just go celebrate the end of the semester!). I don’t just stand in a corner moping, I actually made some loose friends with some of the bartenders. But I guess I just want to know how people feel about it, and maybe any suggestions.

Also, just in case it comes up, I’m trying to find another hobby/group. I’m kinda down for whatever, the things listed above were just what I do for me.

I'm average (maybe slightly above average) looking guy, who doesn't care much about partys, but I finally decided to get outside of my comfort zone.

I was drunk and danced with random girls at the party. One girl started to kiss me with tongue and it lasted damn long. Then we danced some more and then she disappeared. I guess I wasn't the best kisser, because I haven't actually kissed anyone before and I was drunk. But I feel proud of myself, because I finally kissed a girl. 
I always thought that the first kiss should be normal one, but mine was with deep tongue action. She was also a smoker, so it was kinda disapointing, because it tasted like smoke...

This was my 2nd time in night club and I could say that I've made progress. 1st time was 4 months ago and then I just danced with 2 girls and nothing special happened. Looks like I'm gaining knowledge and confidence with these experiences.

Doing this has completely changed my dating life. I know go into dates fully understanding of a future where this person will want you completely out of their lives for good, and will see you as an annoyance at best

I’ve started seeing someone who is not nearly as attractive or has as many hobbies/ambitions/athleticism as anyone I’ve dated before, but I know that I would have zero problem walking away forever if they do, because I can easily find someone who doesn’t have much going on.

It’s made me much more relaxed. To regard everyone as completely temporary, and only dating people who I know are not so special that I couldn’t find someone to replace them easily, means I have had zero incidents that I used to get in the past: absolute agony for over a year where I can’t function properly and jeopardize my work and my friendships, while pining after the one who got away.

I highly recommend doing this, especially if you are a man because I have noticed that it’s usually men who struggle getting over people all women usually move on very quickly. In fact I’ve noticed women usually can easily get a second chance with their ex-boyfriend‘s though that is purely anecdotal so don’t quote me on that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rqpz7y/before_you_get_carried_away_its_important_to/

32,rqqwau,1640728814,Is my crush playing with me?,"First time in this situation, please be kind to me. I have no previous relationship or dating experience and a very low self esteem that most guys take advantage of.

I have been friends with my college friend, A, for 3 years. I'm not gonna lie I've always found him attractive but he is kind of out of my league looks wise. I'm thin, go to the gym, but below average attractive facially, never had male attention in my life and when I go out with female friends I'm a ghost. My life has been full of urequited crushes for years and thats how its going to be for the rest of my life, I don't think I will ever settle down due to looks requirements most guys have for their GF/wife.

I also believe he is out of my league because he probably has a lot of experience with women in his life yadayada.

Beginning of this year, with distance education and everything being closed down, I started talking to him more. We would chat on Snapchat, he would help me with school assignments, we would play LoL and other games and talk on Discord etc. It was funny. We would also have talks about politics and other stuff that were deeper. Suddenly this summer he asks me out on lunch. I can't go but come up with another time and date, and another activity. We go out to play minigolf, I meet his friends, a couple of weeks later we go out and play pool and have drinks etc. None of this is labeled dates. Before we meet up for pool he sends me a Snapchat selfie with lots of heart emojis. I have a bad feeling of it and don't respond or mention it.

Come september, he starts working at a bar/resturant for students and asks me to come there at his shift. I went there and talked to him for a while, it felt like he wanted to show off his bartender knowledge or something. The next day later that night at around 11-12 PM he texts me asking me to come there again but I'm already in bed so I can't.

The following months we are still writing to each other regularly, but the texts are being more suggestive and more flirty in tone. I go on with it, because this is the first time a hot dude is giving me any attention. However, one thing happens in school that makes me freak out about his intentions. He sits next to his friend and I walk past them and can hear his friend whisper my name in a low tone, but he probably didn't realize I heard it. This is when I'm thinking holy shit they are discussing me as a sexual conquest behind my back and laughing at me, because why else would his friend tease me in front of him?

However I also notice he is starting to play games as I disengage and go cold on him and hang out with other male friends. He asks curiously who I'm with when he sees my Snapchat stories of me hanging out with other guys. He later sends a pic of him and some other girl in the bar (probably his coworker), when otherwise he NEVER mentions other women in front me, never ever. Not even if I ask him. He starts flirting by calling me sweetie but backtracks when I ask if he is joking. Once I told him he is on my best friend list on Snapchat and he responded by sending a pic of him doing a heart with his hands and writing under ""best friends ❤️❤️❤️"" like its funny and I'm a moron. 

He also mentioned he was at a bar event he knows I like saying he lost in a music quiz and I was like so you went without inviting me? :( And he was like hehe did you want to? And I was like yeah and he replied true, ill give you my exam notes as an apology.
So he knows I like him and is teasing me like this? Not funny


He acts cold and hot but ALWAYS reaches out through Snapchat if I don't write anything to him for 1-2 days. Like yesterday he sent a pic of his cat asking me what I thought of it, after I had not sent anything for days. Stuff like that.

I'm getting cold feet and want out from this. I don't know what to do I'm freaking out, since I've flirted with him before he is probably thinking of me as an easy hook up. How do I backtrack without coming off as an idiot? I just want to be loved and treated good, not seen as a sexual conquest.

Tldr: how do I backtrack from a friend I had a crush on but is now giving me cold feet with his behavior?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rqqwau/is_my_crush_playing_with_me/

I met this one guy who stays in a bigger city about an hour away. He’s 30, very good looking tall guy who ( from social media) seems to be career oriented .He seemed cool  so we hung out at my place…Our initial meet up was just wine and talking. He got so so intense so quick. He would look deep into my eyes and start kissing me out of nowhere, grab me and put me in his lap, wouldn’t stop touching me. This was all ok because I was attracted to him but honestly it was a lot. Like I think we kissed for 2 hours straight…. not much conversation but lots of flirting and touching and foreplay. We didn’t have sex but he made it clear in our prior conversation that he was looking for an exclusive partner in that way. 
After our first meet up he immediately planned the next one but got really inconsistent with communication. Well the whole time he would respond like every two days or something then go Mia. Our first conversation was great, he asked about my childhood and personal things but after that He  would really only want to sext and flirt . 
He also didn’t talk on the phone much, when I would call it would go to his work voice mail ( I guess he used his work phone as his personal?). 
I never knew where he stayed, when I came he offered to get us a hotel because his place was “under construction “? 
He told me that if he was going to be taking me on dates ( which he hasn’t done yet) and having sex with me I couldn’t talk to other guys even if we weren’t in a relationship… he kinda spazzed out on this convo and said if I talked to other guys then to leave him alone ( this was about 1 mo into us talking).
He also said he needed me to get on birth control because he had no interest in using condoms( which I did, dumb I know).
And finally we’ve been talking for about 3 months and we only met up once , he cancelled on me last minute when he was passing by my place TWICE, has never took me on a date and never made any direct effort to drive the 1.5 hours to see me…
We have only been talking for like 3 months but it moved fast initially and the arguments we have been in lately made things kind of slow down in terms of relationship advancements so I’m not 100% blaming him for not taking me on a date yet….
I know he works a lot and I understand that but 
Because of his inconsistency with communication, we’ve argued a lot and I’ve been called crazy multiple times but I feel like I’m being gaslighted. He says he’s mine, he wants us to work and is so interested in me but when I  try to get him to communicate at least once a day he’ll say I need to chill bc we aren’t even together yet…
This is all kind of sketchy to me.
I feel like bc of the inconsistency he may be seriously preoccupied with another woman or even a wife and may just have been using the dating app to get sex… are all of these red flags?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rqr84u/red_flags_from_sketchy_guy_ive_been_seeing_on/
39,rqrd89,1640730064,Need advice on how to trust people again after being two timed,"First proper Reddit post to bear with me. 

I’m (26F) pretty new to dating after a LTR broke down earlier in the year, it was a very unexpected break up for me. 

Back in September I met someone on Tinder (25M) who I just clicked with. All that typical kind of stuff, non-stop messaging, going on dates, enjoying getting to know each other thing that felt amazing. I thought I was doing it all right, being open about my past (was cheated on by a previous partner), how I was feeling at all stages and where my head was at, I was also standing my own ground and saying what I felt comfortable with for the first time really in a relationship. This guy seemed to take it all in his stride, pushed for us to get serious, really had me trusting him and thinking we were going somewhere. He seemed to have his life pretty together and this is important to me (I’m a homeowner, career focused and looking for someone in a similar place). He even paid for us to go away for a night together. He was proper boyfriend material. 

Anyways, I found out about 2 weeks ago he was two-timing, and there was possibly a third woman as well. I was shocked and disappointed but I’m better off without that. But now, I’m totally at a loss of how to ever be vulnerable with a man again, like how do you ever trust people again after that? Especially after it took me a lot of courage to be open and honest with this guy after my last two serious relationships ended in me being very hurt. 

Guess I’m scared I’m gonna end up that woman who never finds anyone because they’re shut off and cold. I totally understand that now, but I want to find someone eventually to share my life with. How did you all deal with trust issues and come out the better for bad experiences?

We talked for almost 2 hours and then mentioned needing to go to bed because he had an early start the next day. He said with Christmas coming up and being busy with work that he probably wouldn’t see me until next week (so this week). I didn’t hear from him until that Thursday and he texted to see if my cold sores were looking better and if I was feeling better as I was nervous and self conscious about them. They were much better and he responded saying that was great and that he hoped to see me again at my best and wished me a merry Christmas. I said of course you will, merry Christmas!

47,rqs3pi,1640732082,Meta: I think there’s a fundamental error inherent in many posts on this sub: thinking that there are set rules in dating.,"I see it a lot in this sub that boils down to: my SO or love interest is doing X, Y or Z. The question is then either: is that okay, or how should I interpret what they did or said?

First off, abuse of any kind is never okay, and anyone who abuses someone that they’re supposed to love isn’t worthy of that relationship. If this sub can help someone with a kind and loving reality check that gets them out of a bad or dangerous situation, that’s wonderful. 

If your partner is doing something that you don’t like, the simple answer is almost always that you must communicate with them and decide together whether they stop doing that, or you learn to tolerate it in the name of love (which has been shown to happen in many successful and happy relationships), or you amicably split up. 

Same goes for communications issues. What if my love interest doesn’t text me back in three days or three weeks? Well, you have to ask them. Make the implicit explicit. If your relationship (or you) can’t handle something like “hey, I kind of feel like you’re not that interested in talking to me or spending time together when I don’t hear from you for days” then you’re probably not in a good place for a relationship. 

I feel like many come to this sub looking for validation that they or their SO is or isn’t following a set of rules. There are essentially no rules. It’d be nice if we all conformed to protocols that were well understood and documented. We’d know when to ask that cute girl out at the store. We’d know when the cute guy really wanted our number or whatever. The content and timing of a text or a kiss wouldn’t be mysterious. That certainty doesn’t exist. We have, at best, some imperfect notions from our own culture and family. Those are almost always misaligned with others’ backgrounds.

The answer to this is bravery, patience, love, communication, respect, and healthy boundaries.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rqs3pi/meta_i_think_theres_a_fundamental_error_inherent/

50,rqsr0e,1640733751,Does she like me even though she has a boyfriend? Pls help🤍,"Hello all. I’m a 21 y/o guy who goes to a university for nursing school. Through this program I have met many cool people that I can call my friends! I have a study group now that consists of 3 other girls. This is just because this program consists of 90% woman. I will give the three girls names: Emily, Arabella, and Kaitlyn. To give a background, I am good friends with all of these girls. We’re all close now as we have been going through the hardships of nursing school together, so we see each other and study together almost everyday. We all are friends so we also hangout outside of school too. We go to the lake together, stay at the lake house on the weekend sometimes, and go out and hangout together. Moving forward, Emily has a boyfriend of 5 years. Kaitlyn has a husband. Im good friends with her husband as I was a groomsman in his wedding. Arabella has a boyfriend of one year. I like Arabella. She’s super sweet, she’s gorgeous, smart, and fun to be around. The problem is that she’s got a  boyfriend and I want to respect that. Well I know the two other girls boyfriends’ and I see them often. However, Ive only seen Arabella’s boyfriend around a few times which is weird because that means they don’t see each other that much. He also goes to the same college as us and plays golf and spends a lot of his time hunting and hanging w his friends (which is good). When Arabella talks about him it’s never bad or anything so I don’t reckon they have serious relationship troubles. The problem is that she can be flirty with me. And to be honest I agg it on because I like her. Now she’s not flirty to the point where it’s cheating or anything. She could just think of us as really good friends. BUT we went on a road trip together for a week. It was all three of the girls. kaitlyn and Emily brought their men but arabella didn’t bring hers. He was supposedly busy and also i was thinking he doesn’t really know us so he may feel a bit awkward to come too. Well anyways, we all had a good time. It was cold outside and it was snowing so I got a hot chocolate from a nearby shop. She didn’t get any but I said that could could have as much as she wants of mine. So we shared the hot cocoa. Nothing serious. It was just two friends sharing some hot chocolate when it’s cold outside. The car ride back is what confused me. We all took the van back. Arabella and I sat in the very back together. It wasn’t intentional or anything to sit together. it wasn’t the most comfortable in the back but we actually got some time to talk to each other alone (sort of). I mean there was five other people in the car but i feel like we don’t get the chance often to just talk amongst ourselves because we’re always together as a group. So we connected a little bit. Anyways, we’re in the very back of a van that has three rows. We’re talking every once in a while. We may joke with each other some. Idk why we did this but we showed each other who we Snapchat and explained who they are and why we snap them lol. We later watched the titanic on her laptop and shared her AirPods. Thennn when we got tired and tried to find a comfy spot to sleep. It was hard because we were in the back of the van. But we improvised lol. We would take turns where i would sit by the window sitting straight up like how you’d normally sit in a car. She then laid her head on my lap with a pillow with her legs reaching out to the other half of the seat that no one was on. Then we’d switch off where I was the one laying down (with my head on her lap). Also, while we were watching titanic I had a pillow and i was trying to find a good spot to put it for my own comfort and she said I could lay it on her upper arm. So then I rested my head on her while watching titanic for a bit. We also Snapchat. Usually everyday or every other day. Sometimes they’re boring conversations or just streaks. Sometimes they’re not. For example, she likes the marvel movies. I haven’t watched a lot of them so I said that we should watch Dr strange together. I told her to come over and watch it. She said that when she gets back in town that she will. The problem is that she has a boyfriend so I don’t know that I’d actually let her come over tbh. She’s a good girl. She’s never had sex or anything either so it’s not like she wants to come over to just do that. She wants to wait for marriage. It just confuses me because usually a really pretty girl like this would reject you if she has a boyfriend with no problem. However she is not. Truthfully, her boyfriend is a lot less attractive then her. He still seems like a nice guy though so it’s not like that matters. Also, he’s not around that much. I’m wondering if she likes me or if it’s more that I’m a fun cute guy to her that she can sort of platonically flirt with while her boyfriend is away to fill some sort of need for her. The truth is that I don’t want to break them up so she could be with me because what if she ended up doing the same thing with me?? Best case scenario is that she simply didn’t want to be with him anymore and later on Arabella and I got closer and then one day dated. I just don’t understand how she feels truthfully. It seems like she’s interested but she may just like the attention. Also she could possibly just be a flirty girl. Idk. I’m here for all of the advice. What do you think?🤍 also, please know that my intention isn’t to hurt anyone which is why I am asking for advice.

He’s been pretty good at replying, just taking about him day or plans and well as mine.

I normally get a big sad when people don’t reply very fast, and I feel a bit discouraged. Because I try to reply as soon as I see the message (I definitely an going to work on this insecurity) 

We had our first date yesterday, and I think it went pretty well, we were both tired thought, I just got back from a trip and he’s been busy with family and friends. When we left he said he wanted to grab dinner sometime soon and we hugged.

Afterwards I messaged home saying I had a good time and told him when I was able to meet for dinner. He said he had a nice time as well and that any of the dates I mentioned would work. I told him to just let me know what works best for him.

It’s been a few hours and we haven’t message since. To me this feels like he d didn’t have a good time, 

would he say he wanted to get dinner and hug me if it didn’t go well?

How can I feel more secure when I don’t get a text back for a few hours?

Any advise on dating a non texter?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rqtjly/dating_an_person_who_doesnt_like_texting/

64,rquelw,1640738239,A guy I've been dating is forceful with this kisses,"I've been on a couple of dates with this guy. On our first date we did kiss at the end of the date, I had had a few glasses of wine and it had been forever since I'd had a kiss so I let myself indulge. This kiss was at the end of the date and he did approach me quite purposefully to get it but as I say, I was quite willing.

On our second date, we met in the cinema, I was late. On arrival, whilst the film was on, I gave him a kiss on the cheek, he kind of grabbed my head and forced me to give him a kiss on the lips. I was really perplexed because we aren't a couple and to me that is something you would do in a couple, he then proceeded to take my hand and give me several kisses on my hand. 

At some point during the date again, he tried to pull me and kiss me again which I resisted and he said ""ah at the end?"" And I didn't really respond. Then at the end, I went to kiss him on the cheek and he forcefully pulled my lips again. I pushed him away and he said ""don't you want to kiss me?"" And I said I don't like to rush things. 

Honestly he is lovely, engaging, he is attentive and follows up. He plans dates and he is consistent but this detail keeps nagging me. How forceful he is to get me to kiss him. He essentially stole two kisses from me. 

Am I overreacting here? Is he just trying to make a move and thinks this is the way to do it or should I be wary?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rquelw/a_guy_ive_been_dating_is_forceful_with_this_kisses/

The problem was I didn’t see that coming because he seemed really genuine and never pushed me for sex or anything. And this other dude, he’d only reply fast when our convo is sex-related and he’d just want to stay at a motel all the time after having gone out on 5 dates. 

I was planning to sleep with this new guy right away because I want to and also partly because I don’t wanna get too invested in case he’d change his mind after having sex.

96,rqxrez,1640747971,Help,"Okay I don’t really know how to fully explain this the best. But I’m in a relationship. In that relationship I overthink a lot and constantly have running thoughts. One of my thoughts is this:

So me and my girlfriend sometimes hang out with other people and such. I have a lot of friends and with those friends I always compare myself to them in a sense. One of my buddies is good looking I’d say and that, in my head makes me nervous and insecure in a sense to bring my girlfriend around him ig. Because I compare myself to him and think I’m lesser. Therefore I am kinda resent and keep my girlfriend away while I hang out with those people. 

I hope that makes sense. I’m just kind looking for advice to stop thinking that. And wondering if it’s just me that does that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rqxrez/help/
97,rqxrjx,1640747984,I hate trying to make a good impression and I think you do too.,"I've come to this conclusion after realizing that each of my many failed dates was due to utter exhaustion after exchanging career experiences in a restaurant, but the few successful ones happened thanks to holding burping contests, discussions about our favorite insects, and how we'd defend ourselves if Nazis would suddenly come back from the dead as zombies. The first time I fell in love was with a girl who, on the second date, retreated to the bathroom and came back with huge tissues stuffed in each nostril due to her hay fever. The whole realness of her got me crushing on her mad and I couldn't figure out exactly why.

Yet.

Flirting just kinda feels like lying and so does ""leaving a good first impression"" when I know my current behavior isn't the one I'm always going to have around them. Jamming two snot ridden tissues in a nose is far from a ""good impression"", but that's what I loved so much about it. I wasn't seeing her *impression*. I was seeing *her* and that's why it was just so pretty damn attractive. Same when her mouth was hanging open when she was too focused on a videogame.

When I thought about it, I found it extremely hard to believe that I am unique in this. I honestly believe that most people by now prefer ""what's your favorite type of garbage bag"" over ""can I get you a drink"" as an opening sentence. I honestly think I speak for most when I say climbing a random tree is more fun than drinking to world peace. I had a girlfriend and sometimes we'd tickle each other's armpits by blinking with our eyelashes over it. Sometimes in public. It was awesome. But I think even couples married for 40+ years were standing there looking at each other and secretly thinking to themselves ""omg I totally want to do that to you now"". But they won't because of the taboo on weirdness.

And I even bet that whoever reads this post and whatever letters you got in your chromosomes, you now actively long to tickle a SO's armpits with your eyelashes.

Don't get me wrong, we can also be really damn boring. Imagine the absence of pressure if we end our first date(s) doing whatever we'd do if were together for 10 years, just doing our everyday stuff. *Do* we actually find that boring or did we just condition ourselves to believe that we *should?* I mean, why is it boring? Isn't it a prime opportunity to test your compatibility to the best possible extend: seeing how you're both capable of amusing *yourselves and* still find a way to appreciate the presence of the other for simply being there. Nothing *ever* needs to be boring. You can go watch an ant colony outside and not be bored if you learn to have an eye for it. And it all can be shared if so preferred.

Of course I still believe it still helps to be physically hot. However, after having our newfound thirst for liberty literally revolutionizing the developed world, isn't showing freedom by daring to be openly odd or and/or boring now more a sign of confidence (and therefore also natural attractiveness) than to still play the rules of the game and etiquette?

Based on all this and my own personal experiences, I think we'd all prefer to quit the mating dance and be ourselves in the *actual* sense of the term. Like.. don't pop your pimples before you go on a date. Save it for a contest where you both try to hit objects with its contents.

99,rqxs0f,1640748020,confidence,"my self esteem is a constant battle. i’m currently in a relationship where we have been together for 2 years, but haven’t been intimate in about a year and a half. we are more like best friends and it’d feel awkward at this point to be physical.

this was not by my doing, but because of my partner. i’ve tried figuring it out and researching what the cause may be (from sexuality to hormone imbalance to just not being attracted) and it’s weighed heavy on my self esteem.

they’ve tried recently to initiate some sort of “long kisses” or “upper body touch” but without the romance it feels foreign to me(also cause it’s been soooo long)

does anyone have advice for upping my confidence to the point where i may be willing to accept the efforts of my partner?

we’ve been battling this ever since the intimacy stopped. my love language is physical touch, so i’ve brought it up since the beginning.. but now i feel a lot of resentment due to trying for so long and it being treated as “not so important”. i’ve felt unheard and unloved for so long it seems like there’s a wall up that won’t allow me to accept the efforts of my partner so late in the game.

also i feel as though they are only trying because they know i’ve seriously decided i am gone. and i have, i’ve tried for so long with zero effort on their part.. and if i don’t feel fulfilled at this point.. then i feel i’m right to leave. 

BUT if they are really trying i feel bad for having walls up and not allowing them that chance that may save our relationship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rqxs0f/confidence/
