I feel comfortable around him, we make each other laugh a lot, have a lot of common interests to talk about, i find him attractive (like not in a he‚Äôs so hot i want to jump on him kinda way but he‚Äôs cute and I would find him hot at the right moment).

The issue is all we did in the 2 dates were hugging at the start and the end. He feels more like a friend than a flirt at this point. There are a few flirty messages every now and then though. 

Idk when the 3rd date is gonna be but again we‚Äôre texting everyday and I feel like I have to clarify that I‚Äôm looking for something serious, to be his priority etc. He might leave the country for grad school in like 6 months.

They both lived together, but one of them was moving to a different city for six months, and they were looking for someone to take her room in the meantime.

We had a really cool, fun and a tiny bit flirtatious conversation  through Zoom for about an hour, and they said they would send me a message regarding if I would have the room or not. I already expected not to get the room (because I felt the situation would be a little bit weird if I just moved in with one of them for a couple of months after we flirted a little bit on a zoom call), but once I got their answers I asked them for their Insta contacts, saying I had found a flatshare myself but would love keeping in touch, because we had a great time on zoom. And it actually worked. Both of them said they had a great time and sent me their insta contacts.  


So, the question is: what's next? As I said, one of the girls will be away for a couple of months, and I've never met them personally. What would be some good follow ups? Should I keep flirting with both of them, or focus on the girl who is staying in town? Should I try asking her out right away?

I was a late bloomer and never did the whole dating thing in high school or college so I feel like I missed out on a lot. Fast forward to around age 26, that‚Äôs when I really started to turn my life around and try to date. Finally lost my virginity at age 27 to a hookup but then shortly thereafter found myself in my first real relationship. 

Unfortunately this one only lasted a few months for obvious reasons (inexperience and neediness being the main ones), but the ironic part was that my first ever girlfriend was everything I imagined the woman I‚Äôd marry one day would be. 

She was a beautiful 5‚Äô3 blonde with green eyes. We had so much in common, understood how each other felt, she dressed the way I liked, sounded the way I imagined, and the sexual chemistry was great too. For the first time in my life I actually felt happy and complete with her. When we broke up I was devastated to say the least, which in hindsight feels silly and naive to say that after only knowing her a few months; but I guess it was just the newness of everything and finally getting to know what it feels like to be with someone. 

That relationship was 4 years ago now and I‚Äôve been single ever since. 

Today I had a realization that my first girlfriend spoiled me. What I mean that is for the last 4 years it feels like I‚Äôve been trying to find her again, this perfect woman who was exactly like my ex. How do you find a relationship with someone new when you believe you started from the tippy top; so my mindset was I‚Äôm just going down from here. 

I want to start being more open-minded and get outside my ‚Äòtype‚Äô to meet someone awesome.  I mean I‚Äôve been on a few dates here and there with equally as attractive women but it just never goes anywhere. 

Can anyone relate to what I‚Äôm saying here or have any advice?

I first started on dating apps back in 2012/2013 when tinder was new and I was in college. At first it was fun, you see girls from campus or in one of your classes and it‚Äôs a great barometer to see if they are truly checking you out like you are checking them out. You match with a girl and see her at a party during the following weekend and it gives you a boost of courage to break the ice. It was an amazing tool at the time.

In the summers going back home I‚Äôd meet other girls my age, never with a dull moment. Although nothing more than short lived flings, it just felt natural. It was just a part of growing up.

After graduating college and stepping into the professional world I was now an eligible bachelor with money in my pocket. Soon enough, things got out of control. In the most unappealing way possible, I say I was a player. Muscular frame, unique look, smart, funny, an all around good time. I was going on a date almost everyday of the week. With multiple apps running (hinge, tinder, bumble, &amp; whatever else was out there), and at least 500 matches (at one point I had 3k matches on tinder) I was in an abundance of women. In fact, I went on 5 dates in a day once, which seemed like a huge accomplishment. It was common for me to have back to back dates. Being a ‚Äúgentleman‚Äù and ‚Äúcharming‚Äù, of course I paid the bill every time. My credit card bills were at times more than my take home pay. At the time I felt like I was on top of the world.

Over time, I started to lose the thrill. The drinking, combined with the eating out, combined with the lack of sleep, combined with the more time on dates and less in the gym took a toll on me. The energy and confidence was not like it used to be. It felt like Groundhog Day, nothing more than a sales pitch with every date seeming the same as the last. I gained weight, started losing hair, and was a shell of what I once was. Not to mention, as big as my city is it is a generally small place when you‚Äôre dating so many women. I‚Äôm being posted in private Facebook groups, I‚Äôm being called out for dating girls and their friends, I‚Äôm being recognized when I go out‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs messy. I realized I had to change my plans.

With COVID lockdown, dating became less common but it felt like everyone was in the same boat so I didn‚Äôt mind. As things began to loosen up I had a genius idea, I‚Äôd stop being a player and settle down. I‚Äôm officially looking for my life long partner. Of course, I‚Äôm using dating apps to find her. Then I meet this one girl. She‚Äôs so pretty, kind hearted, drives a nice car, nice apartment, great job‚Ä¶ this is the sort of stability I can appreciate in someone and grow to love. Or so I thought.

I was all in. Planning activities, flowers on her bad days, dinner dates, anything I could do to progress things I did it. A little over a month in and I figure it‚Äôs time to have ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù. She tells me her exes still contact her but she considers them just friends. Calls them losers and she will cut them off for me. Exactly what I wanted to hear to make me more comfortable with her. And then words come out if my mouth I‚Äôve never said, I say ‚Äúwill you be my girlfriend?‚Äù. She hesitates, and with a smile says yes and we passionately kiss.

Fast forward to the following Friday, and we are officially a new couple. We are cooking together which was something I‚Äôve never done with a woman before. It felt like the precursor to a fruitful life with my partner, I was head over heels. As we look at the recipe on her phone, a name I recognize as one of her exes pops up in the form of notification saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it? Just those two little hearts? Lol‚Äù. My heart dropped into my stomach. Immediately my smile transformed into a frown. I was devastated at what I just saw. I go to sit down as the room starts to feel like it‚Äôs spinning. She asks me what‚Äôs wrong where I simply say ‚ÄúI feel sick, maybe I should go home‚Äù. It was so early on in this relationship that I can turn around and go back to my old ways. As I gather my things she stands in front of her door, making it impossible to leave without force. She apologizes, tells me she‚Äôs in the process of cutting things off with him and just needs to do it on her terms. In retrospect, it didn‚Äôt sound much like someone who she‚Äôs been broken up with for months but it was my hope in making something work that made me want to believe what I was being told. I forgave her, but I decided to leave telling her I‚Äôll have to think about what happened. This was May, and it was the beginning of the end.

Soon after it sparked the feeling of resentment. I wasn‚Äôt as nice anymore, I felt betrayed. I had to protect myself. She became more and more distant. We still talked, but it wasn‚Äôt what it was anymore. Fast forward to the week before my birthday in June. I wanted things to work and figured everyone needs a second chance and was willing to work things out. I told her my birthday multiple times, so figured she would know. I asked if we could go out to dinner on that day to which she said yes, but keep in mind she has been distant. My birthday comes and it‚Äôs clear through text that she has no clue. I had reservations set for when she got out of work at 7, but it was 5 and I hadn‚Äôt heard back from her since 11am. I give her a call because my texts were ignored and low and behold she answers.

You can hear the lack of excitement in her voice. She tells me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting fired for drinking on the job, I can‚Äôt make dinner. I‚Äôm a loser and you shouldn‚Äôt want anything to do with me. I hope the best‚Äù. Wow, I was crushed. Not only did I lose my girlfriend but I had the worst birthday ever. I cancelled the reservation and walked for 4 hours that summer night. Wondering what just happened to my life. The air felt different, I couldn‚Äôt eat. In fact, I went on a 78 hour fast.

Weeks later she reached out to me. She apologized and asked if I wanted to come see her. Being in the depressed state of mind I was in, I said yes. We rekindled things and while there was excitement and joy missing, it felt better than the previous misery I was suffering from. She came clean that she‚Äôs a recovering alcoholic, which was news to me. Having the desire to want to be good to a woman for once in my life, I wanted to stick by her through her hard times. I promised her we would get through this together. Not that I had an issue, but in support of her I turned sober.

A few weeks later, I am on Facebook and decide to check out her ex boyfriend‚Äôs profile. It was clear he had addiction issues, but for drugs harder than alcohol - makes sense the connection of why they dated. And then I saw it. A few days leading up to my birthday was a picture of them two. Once again my heart sank. I sent her the screenshot to which she told me it was an old picture and he is obsessed with her. Looking back, as much as I knew she was gaslighting me I wanted her words to be true. I wanted my ‚Äúrelationship‚Äùto work. This was July.

July in general was a tough month for the ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù. She was more focused on AA meetings and sleeping to ever see me. I felt her drifting away. I suspected she was with other men, which gave me constant anxiety. In one of the rare occasions of seeing her that month I made a decision that I never thought I would. As I looked at her sleeping, I decided to go through her phone. First thing, in July she decided to see her ex. She used drugs that were her exes drug of choice, and ODed. She died and came back to life. Then I saw videos of her and her ex, which totally killed me inside. Even worse, the time stamp was just days after my birthday. The birthday she didn‚Äôt see me on and made it the worst birthday ever in my life. I confront her about it. I couldn‚Äôt hold it in and gave her a piece of my mind. She told me it was old, although I know how time stamps work. Also, I lost a sibling to overdose, so i was very disappointed to know I might‚Äôve lost her. She begged me for forgiveness, which at that time I couldn‚Äôt do.

I started to distance myself more and more. Eventually towards the end of July, being stupid and once again hoping that I could make something work, I forgave her. I took her to the fair. At the fair I see her texting and my name is saved as a woman‚Äôs name. Total buzzkill. I kept silent and didn‚Äôt speak my mind this time.

I went back to distancing myself. I spent a weekend celebrating my friends bachelor party with him and friends. She told me she had a friend visiting her and she was even more distant than I was for the weekend. We talked after that weekend and things started to feel a little normal again. Then the following Thursday I get a call from her. She is an hour away from where we live and she totaled her car. Turns out she was bringing her exes things to his mom‚Äôs house. Why? Because while I was at a bachelor weekend with friends she was with him. He found out about me and beat her, and he was in jail.

Stupid me, I got in my car went to get her. From this moment on, we were ‚Äútogether‚Äù but it was the worst relationship ever. I was constantly on edge and just hoping for the day when I can put this behind me. But that day never came. It was constant bad behavior from her. Other exes popping up in her texts, disappearing for nights, just everything that would make me lose trust for them.

Fast forward to the end of August, my friends wedding is happening. I‚Äôm packing my car to go to the designation. She knows the wedding is happening and I was headed out soon but with recent events we haven‚Äôt discussed whether she was coming anymore. She shows up with her bag, it looked as if she realized an hour prior and made a break for packing and getting ready. She got in my car and refused to leave. Stupid me, I decided to not make a scene and bring her. 

She ruined my friend‚Äôs wedding. I was in the wedding and she sat at the head table in an outfit you could tell was randomly put together. It gets worst, during the wedding speeches she is falling asleep. It‚Äôs daylight out. I had to miss my friends most exciting moment to bring her back to the hotel. After dropping her off I went back to the wedding but everyone knew what happened. I was embarrassed. 

The following week we were still together, but we got in a petty argument and I went to my house. 30 minutes after I arrive I smell smoke. My house is on fire. Great now I‚Äôm homeless. She‚Äôs not answering her phone and impulsively I drive to her place. Door locked, lights off, and her cars not there. I blow out my tire on a curb. I was so distracted I hit a curb. As I wait for triple A I‚Äôm sitting on the pavement on a summer night contemplating where I went wrong in life. This had to be a bad dream.

She tells me she went to one of her parent‚Äôs house, only she knows if that was the truth or not. I figured that since her ex hit her and now is in jail all the threats are gone. Or maybe not.

The next few months were ok. All the bad things aside I made a valid effort to forget and forgive. Her being unemployed it was on me to pay for everything of hers. It wasn‚Äôt ideal but still, I had someone which I felt was better than going back to the player lifestyle.

Now a little background with her family. When I first met her mother she was fine. Over time the mother became cold to me, and I had no idea why. Turns out this girl lied to her mom about our relationship and I was seen as more of a random guy than anything. So when my house did burn down and I was looking for her, I called her mom. The coldness of her mother was extreme, especially considering I was in a time of crisis. I asked if she might be at her step moms house, but her mother was not willing to help.

I bring this up because I didn‚Äôt really want to deal with her family anymore because I just didn‚Äôt feel welcome. Thanksgiving came and she begged me to come to her family‚Äôs for dinner. I didn‚Äôt have any family around to see, so I was alone for thanksgiving. I declined joining and got Chinese food that night. 

A few weeks later, I came back to see her after running errands. He phone lights up, and I see a text from another ex (not the abusive one), sending texts about seeing her soon. I flip out. I call him a tell him to stop doing it. He‚Äôs drunk and saying anything he can to disrespect me. At this point I leave her place but through text the conversation continues with her ex. That‚Äôs when he tells me ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why she invited me to thanksgiving and not you‚Äù. He sends me screenshots of proof. Wow, once again my heart sank. I was in denial. I called her sister and she declined my call. After a few minutes she calls me back and says he wasn‚Äôt at their house. But I have the proof. Pictures of him at dinner with them.

I never saw my ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù again. From that night until early January she begged me to see her. I had her blocked so she would email me. She would beg for forgiveness and tell me how bad she messed up and I‚Äôm the one for her. How we can be great together. And one day in January I decide to respond. I unblock her number and tell her we can meet. I wanted some sort of closure. She‚Äôs responsive and says she is near my place (I never gave her my new address of where I moved to but knew the area I live in). The she stops responding. Hours later I decide to give her a call. Forwarded to voice message. I call twice more.

2 hours later she calls. Except it‚Äôs a man on the phone. It the abusive ex, he got out of jail. He says ‚ÄúSTOP F****** CALLING MY GIRL‚Äù and hangs up. After she texts me telling me I‚Äôm harassing her for calling 3 times. Well played. It must‚Äôve been a sign from above for that being the day I decided to fold and respond to her.

Now get this. The next week she‚Äôs blocked again so she emails me. She tells me it was her ‚Äúcoach‚Äù, and wasn‚Äôt even her ex. I know one mutual friend on Facebook of the abusive ex. I ask the mutual friend to screenshot his profile, and it shows they are back in a relationship. I couldn‚Äôt see the profile because I was miraculously blocked. I sent the screenshots to her sister along with the email and told the sister to pass on the message, never contact me again.

After 2 months I decided to try dating apps again. I meet a girl and I fully explain my situation with my ex. She tells me she‚Äôs in the same boat. We went on 2 dates and me being so traumatized from my recent past I am determined to make things work. But suddenly, this new girl disappears. I keep pushing for a response, not willing to let the spark die. Then finally this new girl responds, and tells me her ex reached out and she‚Äôs going to try again with him.

Now at this point, I‚Äôve decided to quit dating. I have deleted all dating apps and it feels like weight lifted off my shoulders. I sit here writing this sober by choice, in the gym everyday and looking to find my greater purpose in life. People always say you need to be happy with yourself before you can be happy with someone else and I finally get it. Maybe the bad experiences are karma from player days, maybe it‚Äôs just a part of growing up. To anyone who made it to this point, thank you for reading my story.

One of the Italian guys had invited me and it was really last minute, presumably cos I live local to the bar.The bar itself was relatively quiet and all 4 of us were sat at the bar. 

An hour or so later, a Brazilian guy from our college came to the bar with a guy and he said hello to me but his friend didn't. they stood at the other end of the bar drinking. 

I dont know what happened but it was like at one point I turned around and the 2 Italian guys and his girlfriend had disappeared outside. The Brazilian guy too was no where to be seen. It was just me seated at the bar now myself and this other guy standing at the bar. 

he kept looking over at me and at one point moved closer and asked me ***'Are you going to stay here all night?'***  I was really quite freaked out by that and just ignored him and did not make any eye contact. 

After a minute or so he moved slightly away from me and my heart was pounding. The Italian guy that had invited me had returned and so had the Brazilian guy. 

The Brazilian guy hugged me goodbye as he left (really forcibly, like scruffing up my hair) and the guy with him said nothing. 

I dont know whether this was someone that was coming on to me or threatening me? I am really weirded out by it and the reason that I cant just let it go is because he is at my college too I have seen him around. I do not know if they all wanted me to leave the bar and go home, as it was most bizarre the way he asked me if I was going to stay there all night and maybe that is why they all disappeared?

We used to have arguments and fights that escalated to yelling and screaming every single time (I'm not the one who initiates it). Which I found really confusing because I've never gotten upset to the point I felt like yelling or screaming back at any of my previous girlfriends.
* **Jealousy and overall high maintenance.**  
Argues with me because she thinks I look at other girls; has gotten upset because I was looking at the dancers in a concert, as well as once going onstage (I'm a DJ) and arguing with me because ""I was flirting with a girl"" (later that night, the girl and her bf hired me for an event).
* **Stubborn and selfish.**  
I got a ticket because she refused to wear a helmet on a motorcycle we rented; got mad at me when I got upset with her because it was mega expensive, she did not offer to pay me back.  
Treats like everything I do/pay for her is no less than my obligation, while whatever she does for me gets thrown in my face the first opportunity she gets.
* **Seems more attracted to what I provide then to who I am.**  
I feel like she's more into this for the stuff I can provide, since I make more than her and pay for trips, dates, etc.
* **Says that she won't change who she is for me, but expects me to do so for her.**  
This is fine, I don't think she needs to turn into someone she doesn't want to be for us to be together. However, the opposite is not true, since she has tried on multiple occasions to alienate me from my friends, family and even from work/people who hire me, using the times I get frustrated or upset at them as ways to separate us even further.
* **Accessed my phone without permission.**  
This is a big deal for me and I've caught her doing it twice, but it has surely happened more. I have nothing to hide, so she'll check my Instagram and get upset whenever I liked other girls pictures, even if they're my friends. I get pissed at this because it's as if she's trying to find a reason to fight.
* **Gaslights me.**  
Whenever I bring up some of her behavior or some of the fights we've had, she downplays them and accuses me of trying to make her look bad as if I'm making the fights worse then they were. She often plays on my memory and says some events didn't happen the way they did or even at all. She also has gone ballistic a lot of times over petty stuff and says it's just me trying to implicate her.
* **I don't feel like getting intimate anymore.**  
The ""hormones"" are there, but whenever we get intimate, it's her starting it. She has also forced sex with me once when I was drunk and was explicitly denying it because I was feeling sick after getting hammered.
* **I feel more anxious.**  
I'm always anxious about going out, about my work and even about bringing her along for family and friends events. I get anxious from looking at the crowd from stage since I can never know if she is gonna go nuts in the middle of my set because she thinks I'm eyeballing someone too much. I only feel this if she's around when I'm playing, if she's not, I'm light as a feather, so to speak lol.
* **Victimizes herself a lot and make me feel responsible for her behavior.**  
Cries when I refuse to do whatever she asks me or every time I start to ""win"" when we argue. Says that since she makes less than I do, I must help her getting around and doing stuff. Whenever I don't concur she compares me with her dad, who she has a terrible relationship with. She blames her bad actions on money, her upbringing, her relationship with parents, or a mix of them all. I've postponed breaking up several times due to me always falling for it and ending up feeling bad for her. As if I owe her something because I provided her with so much and now can't just take it away since, in my country, is unlikely for her to find with anyone else or even afford herself.

Recently, she has started to change her behavior and hasn't done a lot of the stuff I've written down here. However, since we didn't have any discussions about her actions for it to change so drastically out of nowhere. Her recent behavior feels very forced, even to my friends and family, which makes me think she's trying convince she's changed because she noticed I've become more cold and distant; but she‚Äôll turn back to her older self once she's ""out of the woods""

Are these traces of an abusive relationship? Is her new behavior a good or bad sign, considering the situation? How do I get out of this relationship when I feel unable to do so? Is it normal to feel like this?

So I met this guy from school around 3 years ago. But we were not close friends just acquaintances. We started dating since three months ago but unfortunately I got ghosted these days after the last date with him. Back at the early stage of dating him, I asked him not to ghost me if dating doesn‚Äôt work between us, I hope we can still be friends if that happens. Cuz ghosting really hurts. He answered me ok at that time. I mean we had some unhappiness in the last date and I already understood he lost interest in me after knowing me better. But I am still feeling so upset now. Because he ended it with ghosting instead of a closure message to show respect to me. I know people from online dating usually ghost people if they only met few times. I know him for few years and have been dating him for three months. Just so sad to lose a friend all of a sudden.

We were fast friends and we got in trouble all the time for talking in class. In 9th grade he asked me out, we dated a little but we were both awkward and new to the whole thing and even back then I had commitment issues. He was my first kiss. He was my first love. But we eneded up breaking up and staying friends. We've had horrible arguments and we've hurt eachother many times (emotionally), but we've never stopped talking and we've never stopped being great friends. We say I love you to eachother platonically all the time (we always have). He's told me he still has feelings for me a couple times before, but I wasn't ready and I didn't know what I felt. 

Since highschool (24F and 23M now) I‚Äôve dated around a lot, mostly because its hard to live on your own in this day and age and I'm codependent. (I'm in therapy and working on it). He on the other hand has only had 2 other girlfriends, one in high-school and the one he has now.¬† They've been together for almost 3 years now. Shortly after they got together a friend and I were talking and I guess I went on a tangent about him or something because she looked at me and told me ""you know you love him right? And not as a friend like you love me, you're IN LOVE with him. Do you realize that?"" I was shocked speechless and I thought about it almost obsessively (I had thought of him pretty platonically before, like a brother almost, but we did used to continueto flirt with eachother and there have definitelybeen many moments I thought I felt more) until he became all I think about. I compare everyone to him and they always fall short. No one has the foundation and the history I have with him, there's no one else I'd trust as much as I trust him. 

I could go on and on about the things I adore about him and the things that annoy the absolute piss out of me but at the end of the day, even though we argue a lot, and we've both done and said some hurtful things to eachother over the years, there's no one else I could imagine being so angry with and still wanting around no matter what. 

As I said, he has a girlfriend now and they are almost 3 years strong. He seems fairly happy and he has said he loves her. I would never come between them or do anything to try to come between him and happiness. He deserves everything the world has to offer him and more. But I feel so lost and broken knowing that everything I've ever wanted was right there the entire time and I was too scared/not ready to face it.

I was just about to delete bumble when I matched this gorgeous girl (I‚Äôll call her L for anonymity sake). After we matched we got to talking instantly and I even secured a first date! We were supposed to go out to eat and go bowling but we never got to bowling bc we just had such a good convo during dinner that we lost track of time and she had to go somewhere. Well we keep texting and keep going out and eventually I ask her to be my girlfriend! She tells me before that she was married ( 22 F) but got divorced because it was abusive and was in another 9 month relationship that ended poorly and then she met me and she said yes! I was elated but then the next day she practically gives me radio silence after I send a good morning text. I thought she was just busy or tired but I knew something was up when she posted to her story on Snapchat and I swiped up saying ‚Äúmy one and onlyüòç‚Äù only to be left on read.

You‚Äôre a great guy, but I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready for a relationship. Especially this early.

I really enjoyed the time we spent together and for allowing me to get to know you as well! I wish the best in everything that you! Thanks L.‚Äù Then a couple days later I see she posts a pic of another dude at her place! I was devastated I don‚Äôt know if that was a friend or some guy who replaced me or what but I was an emotional wreck. A couple days after that I was advised to text her how I really felt and I basically told her that I was so happy when I was with her and I‚Äôm willing to take things as slow as she needs and I was once again left on read.

We went to high school together and he and I had a few mutual friends and ran in the same circles, but never actually hung out or had a full conversation. He played football and I was cheerleading captain. Fast forward to ten years later, he liked one of my pictures and we got to talking about once a day for two weeks before moving over to texting everyday. 

I never initiated a meet up because I am really self-conscious of the fact that I gained about 50 pounds since HS. The pictures on my profile are recent, but they definitely hide my weight. To my surprise, he asked me out on a date and I was horrified because that meant he would see in person how much I weighed. We went out for dinner and drinks and had a good time, the date lasting about three hours. I was so sure that he would pull back and stop talking to me after meeting me in person, but he texted me the next day and continued to text every day. 

Then, I started to get nervous again because he continued to talk to me but never initiated a second date. It drove me crazy for a week and I overthought everything. Finally on Friday, he asked me out to dinner that night and then we went to go hang out with his friends afterward where I think we had a good time again. 

He‚Äôs admitted to being socially anxious and I‚Äôm very comfortable in social situations and make friends very easily. He makes me laugh and we have great conversations lasting hours. He also lives an hour and a half away so he‚Äôs made the trip to town two Friday nights in a row. We haven‚Äôt kissed yet, but I attribute that to his shyness.

This guy from my gym came up to me outside one day and was like ‚Äúwow, you‚Äôre really beautiful‚Äù and I said thanks but then he asked for my name and I said I had to go. I genuinely didn‚Äôt know what he was looking for and wasn‚Äôt prepared for an approach like that. Anyway he kept staring and smiling at me after that and I guess I didn‚Äôt give him indication I‚Äôm interested back but he still looked at me a lot.

I see him with the guys at the gym a lot and he seems openly comfortable talking to them like they‚Äôre bros and other times he‚Äôs always on a phone call or working on something. He seems extremely extroverted. I‚Äôm quite introverted in the other hand. 
Recently again he came up and said I have nice hair but walked away as I said thank you. And now he‚Äôs kind of avoiding me.

The first year I knew him we talked for a while. We were both in the same art class and we worked together on projects so he had gotten my number and messaged me. He was so kind and funny, great at  conversation, just an overall really interesting person. 

I didn‚Äôt know at the time, but he deals with depression and anxiety. After talking to him every day all day,  receiving cute messages and good morning texts for 3 months, he stopped answering me for almost a week. It was so random and out of the blue that it scared me he was playing games. Due to trauma from my past relationship, I put up my wall and shut him out after he tried to message me back with this beautifully encouraging message about the new semester. He had faith I would go far and do well in the new semester at school, just vry supportive. I think all I had responded with was, ‚ÄúThanks sm I rly appreciate it!!‚Äù. He asked me to share my schedule with him so we could discuss our classes and I never answered. 

Part of me honestly hates myself for doing that. If I had just swallowed my pride and answered him, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be in this position right now. I found out later that he dealt with depression and had a hard time bringing himself to do some things like talking to people when he‚Äôs in that state. I felt like a complete idiot and a terrible person for ghosting him, and I still do.

A couple months went by and I ended up messaging him on an Instagram question he posted on his story. He was so happy to hear from me and I was so happy to hear from him. Just talking to him again made me feel so good and at peace. We ended up talking again for another couple months, but this time it was a little different. He didn‚Äôt really send good morning texts anymore and I felt like part of him was hurt by what I had done. I had apologized because I felt so bad, and even though he told me it was OK I knew it wasn‚Äôt and that it definitely had hurt him. I had been dealing with my own troubles when I did that and it just wasn‚Äôt a good time for either of us. 

We had made plans to go thrift shopping together because he had never been and he knew how much I loved it. There was one opening in his town that was only a couple over from mine so we agreed to do it. I was so excited and was just waiting on him to tell me when they opened. A week or two went by and we hadn‚Äôt spoken about it, then he brought it up mentioning they had opened. We made a plan to go but never decided on a day, which then ended up falling through and never happening. We kept talking, but I knew he knew. 

I had texted him one day after he hadn‚Äôt responded for two days just checking up on him. He responded with something along The lines of that he ,‚Äùwas going through some things and that his life had just changed suddenly‚Äù, so I understood to be gentle. I tried to give him comfort, asked him if he wanted to talk about it, and told him that I was there for him if he needs me and that that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here for- He never answered. It hurt so bad and that was the last time we had texted each other. 

Months go by and we don‚Äôt speak, he just views my social media stuff. He‚Äôs always very active on my account and he‚Äôs always the first one to view anything I post. I‚Äôm not saying this means everything, but I know that there‚Äôs an algorithm to Instagram so I know he must be clicking on my account for it to be shown first all the time. That, combined with the fact that he will swipe up on things I post sometimes and message me over DM about what I post makes me feel like he might think about me still if he‚Äôs trying to communicate in his shy way. 

I honestly think about him every day and I feel so drawn to him, such a pull. There‚Äôve been guys in between the periods I‚Äôve had with him where he‚Äôs not on my mind as much and I‚Äôm talking to someone else. Though strangely enough I feel like it always comes back to him. We have so many similarities and differences in a good way. I feel like I can talk to him for hours and I really want to, I‚Äôm just comfortable with him. I‚Äôll think back to the class we had together in my first year and wish I could time travel back and do things differently. It kills me to question what could‚Äôve been, especially since he can be on my mind so strongly. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I think about messaging him every day wanting to talk again, but I always get discouraged and think that if he wanted to talk he would. I know he‚Äôs a shy guy and that he‚Äôs not the most confident, but it‚Äôs hard for me to not let myself overthink why he hasn‚Äôt done it. I think about it every day, messaging him and asking him how he‚Äôs been. I just want to make sure he‚Äôs OK. I want to hear about what he‚Äôs doing, what makes him happy, sad. I wanna be with him so bad tbh and it‚Äôs just getting worse every day. He‚Äôs starting to be on my mind constantly and I‚Äôm really developing feelings that are hard to ignore. I always think back on the first time I ghosted him and I wish I could do it all over. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore and I feel like I‚Äôm crazy. Please I need to know if I should message him, I‚Äôm so confused and scared from my past relationships. I have such a strong gut feeling that he‚Äôs into me still and I want to more than anything to release these feelings and see if he feels the same.

She texted me to thank me for something and we immediately kind of planned a date. It was effortless and I feel that there is a potential connection.   


Something that I have taken into consideration is the age gap. In most situations I would never date a 18-21 year old especially if she were in college, but this girl has her shit together and is independent. She doesn't have the FOMO, gotta sleep around and party kind of thing and its a huge turn on for me in terms of her character/personality.   


I also think about how I might be judged. We look about the same age, but I wonder if my coworkers/friends will think im predatory.  


I feel society has two different perspectives on this. A you are fine its a normal thing for men to like younger women, and women to like older men. OR B you must have something wrong with you because women your own age dont talk to you. I'm not opposed to speaking to women my age, its just I rarely get responses from them as they probably think im younger and they are looking for someone their age or older.  


I look at least 5 year younger then my age and most women assume that I am younger. I also am not ready to have children anytime soon and lots of women my age are looking to have a child within the next few years, so those types tend to pass on me. 

Me and her are sort of in same place in life. I didn't move out until I was 25 and she is just really smart and proactive and already has a career. I also am aware that she is young and maybe one day she will want to experience other things and I dont want to hold her back. Perhaps I am insecure because I have not had many serious relationships but I really am not trying to deceive anyone. She seems like totally my type and its been forever since I have been on a date.   


I didn't date much in my early 20s because I looked 15 and was pretty shy. I feel like I am finally looking old enough where women are actually paying me attention and taking me seriously.

How can I figure out ahead of time what a person wants and what they are like so I can know exactly how to communicate? An analogy would be like going to a saleperson and telling them what you are looking for rather than just making them guess.

I like to keep my communication clear, open and efficient. I don't like playing guessing games. I don't like my time being wasted.

I'm also having an issue of my so complaining that I'm longing for another woman in one of my recent posts. You can visit my profile, read the post and see that I am CLEARLY NOT talking about a past woman, I am writing about a fantasy for a FUTURE PARTNER.
