So I’m back into the dating scene after years of being out. I’ve quite honestly never been on a coffee date before until today. I’ve been on many drinks and dinner dates but today I agreed to meet somebody for coffee, I figured why not?! 

So right off the bat it was a little awkward ordering coffee together. I’m a pretty charismatic person so I tried to find ways to make conversation, my date seemed nervous and quiet definitely closed off. We talked for about an hour and a half though, there were some big moments of lull and silence in the convo. I decided to be the one to close out the date to keep it from dragging into the night. My date sat with arms crossed and it was hard to get him to make conversation… are coffee dates normally kind of uncomfortable? Is there supposed to be flirting? I felt like I couldn’t flirt at a coffee shop, like it didn’t feel sexy and I felt awkward with people around studying. Are coffee dates considered a real date?

the first time it happened i asked him about it and said that as long as he tells me that i won’t be mad because i have to tell close friends i need to be alone all the time too (i also act out similarly to him). he was pretty good with that until recently. he started a small argument with me and kept pushing it and it made me cry. he doesn’t know that he made me cry, but the whole situation made me feel kind of gross. on one hand i feel like i should give him a chance because i would give any friend this chance, but on the other i’m worried that he was showing his possibly abusive side and that i need to get out.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164132,public,self,How much work should you put into dating someone before moving on?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tj31s1/how_much_work_should_you_put_into_dating_someone/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

(22M) here. I’ve met this guy (20M) on september 2021. We’ve been talking for 2 months and decided to meet up, and went on two dates. At first he showed a lot of interest and adter the second date he showed not at all. I decided to end things to not be pending of him because at the end I always made the first move. I tried to get back with him because I truly felt in love with him, but he told me he had moved on.
A month later I started talking with the person im currently dating (19 M) and we really have a great connection and cares about me(even though I still stalk on IG the previous guy I dated while being with the one im currently dating). The guy im dating atm are not in a relationship, and he lied to me about him sleeping with someone else, which we previously asked eachother if we were talking/seeing other people. That really made my confidence towards him dissapear, and now I doubt a lot of stuff and he doesn’t really make changes for me not to be worried about him getting attention from other guys who could possibly hook up with him (Example: wanting to be friends with someone who met on tinder or commenting on “gay friends” posts). We settled up boundaries already but I got back the feeling of me not trusting him.
So, there’s 2 things. 
1) Im still deeply in love with the first guy I dated and I really want to get over him but I cant. 2) I love this person too, but im still stalking on IG almost everyday the previous guy I dated, and the fact that the guy im currently dating lied to me really did made me loose interest on him, even though I pushed through it.

I'm a 31 and I just found out I'm not totally asexual as I though.
In my whole life I had sex with 3 guys, but I never felt sexual attraction or any kind of sexual pleasure before.
I just enjoy the intimacy of those moments and I like to give pleasure, but I was used to feel absolutely nothing (maybe just pain) during sex. 

The thing is I'm now seeing a guy(28M) I really like. He gets turned on by giving pleasure, so I thought I wouldn't be able to be with him because I never get pleasure during sex. But the other day he was giving me oral and for the first time in my life I had an orgasm. It was amazing and I never expected something like that happening.

I still feel nothing during penetration, but now I know I can feel sexual pleasure.
With this new knowledge I wanna keep exploring this side of me and see if I can fully enjoy sex as everyone does.

Things have been going great, for the first week we were sending eachother very long messages asking questions about one another and going into detail about ourselves. It was really nice to talk to someone who is as interested in you as you are them. We would text eachother once a day because the messages were so long and required a lot of thought. I would text in the morning, she would text at night. I eventually asked her if she would want to get lunch and she said that she would be up for that.

Last week there was a period where she didn't message me for 3 days but eventually got back to me saying that she was super busy from classes and she was still willing to get lunch next week. I asked for her snapchat and we added eachother. I asked her yesterday I'd she would want to get lunch on Monday and she told me her schedule and that she was free around 2:30 and that besides time constraints she would love to get food sometime. I texted her back telling her that 2:30 works for me and asked if I should meet her there or if we could walk there together. 

It has been 24 hours and I have yet to hear back, kind of confused whether or not we are gonna do something tomorrow. She sounds like she really wants to do it but she is just bad at checking my messages. I was thinking that if I saw her in the hallway tomorrow which I sometimes do I would ask her if she still wanted to get lunch that day, or I could try calling her or texting her at 2:30, and if that doesn't work just suggest another time later in the week.

Hi there M(17). I have known this girl for about 5-6 years but have got to know her better over the last year as we are now on the same work-shifts and are in many classes together. She is 17 also. Over the last few months we have become more social with each other and have noticed that we have a lot of things in common and get along really well and can have fun together. But over the last couple of weeks there have been things that she has been doing differently which makes me believe that maybe she may want to be more than friends. Out of all the guys at work and in our classes I would be the main one she talks to or at least feels comfortable talking too.

This is what I have noticed.

1. She asked me if I was going to homecoming and if so if I was going with anyone.
2. When around me at work she becomes way more social than what she normally is with other workpeople.
3. She makes a effort to try to continue the conversation after she gets interrupted by something. This was evident today as she was wanting me to talk about everything that was in my head to be honest
4. At work she makes a effort in being near me and chatting to me while walking with me around the store helping out and trying to make it last as long as possible.
5. I catch her glancing and looking at me from either across the store and the class.
6. Whenever I walk past her and her friends they go from talking to becoming really quiet as if they are talking about me
7. One of her friends has asked me if I have a girlfriend
8. She waits behind for me at the end of work and and will sit near me at break in the staff room.
9. She walks with me on the way home but then has to leave as my direction home is the complete opposite way to her house.

I just became aware of a realization. I haven’t been in a relationship since I was 17 and both of my sisters are in relationships of over 3+ years.

I’ve noticed a feeling of pressure you could say for being single. Pressure is exaggerated but I realized that being in a relationship is just checking one of those boxes or societal success off. 

Not only do I have work on myself to do that I wouldn’t want to drag a women into but I feel at 22 I am still so young and have so much life to experience, things to do, hobbies and interests to explore and feel like being in a relationship would get in the way of that. Has anyone else had this perspective and unexpectedly met someone that changed their mind?

So basically, my girlfriend of 3 months (I know, not super long) abruptly broke up with me today in person. It ended up being very quick because I was completely caught off guard and didn’t have much to say. The main reason she cited is the usual I need-to-work-on-myself but also that she did not want to drag me through her messy, complicated family situation.

For some context, her mom seems to be very clingy. She lives with her parents still, I live on my own. I thought it was a bit of a red flag that she had never slept over at my place; long story short, her mom has a curfew for her still, and texts her when she’s panicky. She revealed to me today that her older brother is a drug addict and that is likely why her mom has become this way. Things really seemed to get bad on Friday/Saturday morning — I imagine there was a big family argument (she didn’t tell me the details; she cited that she feels she wasn’t sharing enough stuff with me).

Anyways, I told her that while I respect her decision, I was willing to go through that with her because I truly cared about her. Leading up to the past few days or so, I thought everything had been going great. We both have said we love each other, everything seemed really smooth and I have nothing negative to say. The only thing is that she didn’t really have time for me, in large part because her mom would demand her home. 

I know that I need to move on. I know there’s no easy way to get over a breakup. But it just hasn’t sit right with me considering how quickly this all went done. She said she loved me as recently as last week. What’s the best way to approach things moving forward? I think/know rekindling would have to come from her, not me.

I wasn't sure where the best place to put my thoughts was going to be, but I settled on r/dating only because I would like some discourse/feedback on my thoughts and feelings. 

I am a 32 year old stand up comic and I have been single for about 3 years. In that time, I have had a pretty wonderful personal renaissance where I have been focusing on my health and happiness and also my craft. I spent most of my life from age 14 onwards in some sort of intimate relationship with a woman, including a 9 year stint and a few 1-2 year stints. But it wasn't until I hit about 30 where I really started to take a step back and wonder why I am even in relationships if I never find happiness or fulfillment there. I started to do stand up more and more, and now my life is pretty awesome and seems to be getting better. It feels like because of my artistic output, I have found balance in other areas of life: fitness/health, better and stronger relationships with family and friends, stricter about my standards and boundaries, not settling or letting people walk all over me. 

However, the dating portion of my life has been non-existent for the most part. I went through some pretty rough stuff back in about 2019 where I not only cheated on my ex of almost 2 years, but I also ended up getting involved with a woman who for lack of a better term was a completely manipulative and cold hearted predator. I ended up in therapy because of what I had experienced, and honestly that was the final straw that pushed me away from trying to foster interpersonal relationships for the sake of having somebody to cuddle with, have sex with, go on dates with and closer to my art.

As I began to pour more of myself into my craft, dating and women became low on the priority list. Not only that, but the floodgates for opportunity to date really start to open when you are working on yourself and staying in your own lane. I've had to pass up numerous opportunities because I was too focused, or wasn't attracted, or just was not interested for whatever reason. But man does it feel nice to be wanted! 

All of that finally culminated in a short lived fling with a woman who I saw for about a month recently. At the outset, things were going super well. We had a very romantic first date, a great second date. Connection was there and we were bonding. Through the days and nights I found myself interested in getting to know her, dancing around the house with her, sharing my jokes with her, and making myself completely vulnerable. I liked her! And I was going to make her my girlfriend! Not only that, but her and I confided in each other about our personal mental health issues and we made it abundantly clear to each other that being a little nuts wasn't going to scare the other away. 

About 4 weeks in, she had a change of heart. All of a sudden, my jokes and the way I act was unbecoming and I was making her uncomfortable. She attempted to gaslight me into thinking she had set boundaries where I said I would turn off the humor (these convos never happened). She also used our misunderstanding and disagreement to then ridicule me for my choice of lifestyle and made me feel horrible about the fact that I am a stand up comic. From my perspective, all of this was too much to handle. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and allowed her to explain her side of things when she was calmed down, and I told her I wasn't going to be judgmental but that maybe we aren't compatible. She took this as a personal attack and then we never spoke again. Also sent me $40 on Venmo with a note attached ""This should make us even, so yo can never say it was for the financial perks. Bye."" I had spent more than $200 on her in the month we spent together.  

I have been struggling to really interpret how I feel about all of this. Its such a weird mix of sadness and relief, thankful that I could see we aren't incompatible long term if a core part of who I am is bothersome. This girl was artistic and musical, cute as hell, great in bed, and sweet. But the girl I saw towards the end was a completely different animal. THE OLD ME WOULD HAVE STRUGGLED TO WALK AWAY. THE OLD ME WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO LET THIS PERSON RUN ROUGHSHOD ON MY MENTAL WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR DOWN DAYS. THE OLD ME WOULD HAVE LET HER WALK ALL OVER ME. 

The person I am now would never allow anybody to do that. While I made myself vulnerable and she used that against me, I am thankful that through my life's experiences I have developed standards and boundaries that if broken, are just simply not okay. I told her I didn't mind that she was a little ""crazy"" as long as she didn't mind my being a little ""crazy"". Her version of crazy though was flying off the handle and creating a bunch of things in her mind and then blaming me for it, and attacking the very fabric of my existence. My version of crazy is ""I'm really sad today, maybe I should end it all."" I just absolutely refuse to let anybody in the way of my dreams, and this is a fundamental part of who I am. Not only that, but after things ended I had struggled to make sense of how somebody you can make yourself vulnerable to can just...use that against you. Why struggle to make sense of it? THIS IS ALL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. 

But I am not bitter. If anything, readily identifying incompatibility and having standards will take you much further and result in more happiness for yourself. Not only that, but its okay to acknowledge red flags when you see them. Also you're human: you likely presented some red flags to them as well. Nobody is perfect. 

I think what I am learning is something I like to call the 25-75 rule. You can give away 75% of yourself to others, but always keep 25% of your heart for yourself. If somebody hurts you, you can use your 25% to build your heart back to 100% in preparation of giving some of it away, again.

 Besides, I'm not too sure how transferable your heart and soul is on Venmo.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164146,public,self,"Some thoughts on being single, vulnerability, and standards.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tj55q4/some_thoughts_on_being_single_vulnerability_and/,no_ads,0.0,,49223cde-abc9-11e9-b518-0ee41f1cd37e,dark,,

I’ve been stuck at this hump for a while now and it’s really discouraging. A lot of my friends have been in multiple relationships during this time span, like it’s the easiest thing ever. So it’s kind of hard for them to relate to my experiences. 

I try my best to be confident and I value  my strengths. But after a while, it makes me wonder if I’m really just missing that “x-factor” or hook that makes me someone women want to date. After all, if I really were attractive, wouldn’t I not be having these problems?

I hope your having a good day. 

I don’t know how to start this but please bare with me ?! 

F27- I had this huge crush on this very good looking guy in my gym F28.. and I always though he found me attractive as well.. he made few moves to talk to me but I always was busy in my own routine that I didn’t think anything of it at the time.. 

Long story short, he moved somewhere else but after 8 months we found each other on Instagram and we started taking.

From the beginning, he was very flirtatious with me and he asked me to meet up with him. 

We meet up- it was a good meetup(I don’t know if it’s a date) but it was enjoyable.. here is the tricky part- he is very touchy and I’m not keen on physical intimacy so soon.. but I thought I liked him so I guess I’m ok with it ?! 

Also, he kissed me in public and he wanted to practically take my clothes off .. but I said no and he stopped being all pushy.. again I know this is wrong but I keep saying in my head that I really like him..


Now we had another date the other night, and we were walking in the park and again he held my hand kept touch my neck ( he did that several times) and kissed me .. without asking me ! 

My question is while dating, Do men ask you if they initiate physical touch ?! I’ve never been on a date before so all of this is new to me.

He keeps saying that he wants me to visit him in his apartment next week.. and I’m afraid he expecting for us to have sexual relation.. which I’m not even remotely ready to do it at this time.


He’s very handsome, dare I say the most beautiful man I ever seen.. he’s sweet and messages and calls me all the time but I think he’s way to fast and I’m not ready for all this ..

The third date was especially bad. It wasn't as bad on the second date which is maybe why that date was my favorite.

I have the belief that chemistry is always two-sided, its like the interaction with someone. I dated someone for around 5 months, and always had loads of chemistry that I felt on multiple levels. Never doubted about that.

However, a few weeks ago, I asked him what he thought of us dating, and how he felt about it, he said he got uncomfortable and said it was alright and didn't know what to say. He has never had a relationship before so I assumed he was just not comfortable talking about it as he had mentioned before. We continued our date, which was super nice, and had a cute goodbye with according to me loads of chemistry..

About 1,5 weeks later we had another date, just a fun day, we even extended our date cuz it was so much fun, and again I felt the same chemistry that I had felt for that 4,5 months.

His texting became a little less past 2 months or so, slowly, and I even made a topic about that. But he kept doing effort and I felt chemistry and fun on all our dates.

We had a fun date planned yesterday, but then out of the blue (for me), he said he wanted to chat about something as he didn't feel the spark anymore since two weeks , ever since \`I had asked him about what he thought of our dating. He really went over it in his head and came to the conclusion our spark wasn't there, whilst it was there a few weeks ago still. He said he wanted to tell me the previous date, but said the date was so fun that he didnt say it, and just kept it in the back of his head and start ruminating about it again after? I really did not see this coming at all.

How can a spark dissappear so quickly, or maybe it had already for him? And can chemistry be one-sided?? Or did he just freak out after I asked him, due to his fear of commitment.. I am not sure.

I can get dates now and again but it feels like I’m settling for people I have no connection with out of pure desperation.

So I’ve turned to the old fashioned way of doing things in person. Being British it feels so wrong, everyone is so reserved and quiet over here but I really enjoy commenting on things or cracking jokes to strangers. There’s been zero negativity towards it so far, it’s just boosting my self confidence. If I’m at a bar or pub it’s really easy to talk to the person behind the bar or someone else waiting in line and it’s a good place to start. Recently It’s been good talking to people in the supermarket and at the gym. For example in the shops the other day I was taking 12 cans of gin and tonic and I joked to the attractive older lady next to me “hope you wasn’t planning on having any low calorie gin and tonic tonight” and it turned into a 3/5minute conversation with plenty of laughs. I didn’t want to ask for her number because she most likely wasn’t single at her age but she definitely appreciated the interaction. 

I know some people might find it weird or creepy to do this kind of thing but it just fills you with hope that you can meet a partner literally anywhere you go if you have the confidence and social skills. I will make conversation with men too it’s not like I’m pestering women everywhere I go, it’s good to treat everyone the same. I’ve always been a real low confidence guy so it’s really helping me. The next time I get solid eye contact from a girl in public I’m going to take my shot because I’m tired of OLD and I’m tired of being lonely. I’ve wasted too many years and romantic opportunities being a shy guy with low self esteem.

The story is actually very long and complicated, but I’m going to keep it short. 

Two years ago there was that girl (20F) who randomly invited me (21M) and my best friend (21M) to her house. After having a great “party”, my best friend hooked up with her best friend (also 20F) and I hooked up with her. The night we spent together was very intense. At the end we were just laying in bed for hours, cuddling, kissing, talking about our lives etc. It felt like we were already a couple… it was so intense for me that I almost couldn’t believe it. Before we left them the next morning, we kissed goodbye and told each other that we would meet again soon.

Two weeks later, we actually got to meet and I told her that our experience together was simply too intense to be ignored or not talked about. She was surprised and simply blamed it on the alcohol and said that she only liked me as a friend (wtf).

Almost 6 months a later, we both turned out to having moved to the same city for college. We once again started dating (all the dates were very long, like 6-10 hours simply sitting in a cafe and talking about pretty much everything) and like had one or two dates per month. Almost two years have gone by after our first hookup and we’ve established that flirty and intense connection so that I really come to think that she now actually has interest in me. We’ve talked through so many fundamental things that we expect in a relationship etc and I gotta say we are so alike… its crazy.  

I have got to say that I’m very careful when it comes to opening up about my feelings because I simply want to protect my self… but I have that  feeling that she is the right one and that we would make the perfect couple.

The problem with her is that our relationship has started “from back to front” if you know what I mean. All of my friends except my female best friend tell me that I’m just getting friend zoned and that I’m simping haha.

So having said all that and with the fear of getting rejected once again, could you just tell me how I could open up to her?

The last day we spend all day together and it’s worth say that she’s kinda reserved and we haven’t really talk too much.

It was a beautiful moment we were talking until 5am then she asked me permission to sleep with me and we spend that night together.

I’ve had my eye on a coworker who I knew was coming, but to preface, I’ve never made any advances, nor has she, prior to this night. I’ve always felt she has given me looks at work but we work different shifts, and of course, she is very beautiful (and single, as am I), so I’m sure I might’ve given off a flirtatious vibe or two. 

So the night starts off at a bar, one drink in, we’re all having a great time and conversation just happy to all be off of work at the same time, then we head to the club. When we get there, everyone is about 3-4 drinks in, and I was standing at the bar getting a drink and asked if I could get her anything. I order for her and turn around, back against the bar, when she starts giving me a “look.” I tell her she looks really nice tonight, and that’s when she goes in for a kiss. 

I immediately back away, and said “whoa” and tried to laugh it off. I’m assuming she might have had a bit too much to drink, but she proceeds to tell me how she’s completely aware, and we proceed to make out/kiss. Of course, it caught everyone by surprise, but we all just went with it, including myself.

Fast forward to now, I’ve been in contact with her and texted her the day after saying I’m sorry if any boundaries we crossed, but she shrugged it off. We’ve seen each other at work, not awkward or anything, more of something we don’t speak of, which is my dilemma at this point.

I have been in contact with her almost every day since then, trying to get to know more about her, but she is very difficult to get to know and sometimes it feels slightly forced to talk to her. It’s like she is not giving me much to work with. We also don’t have much in common than I thought we would have. But, her personality and sense of humor is amazing. I’m just not sure if she is ready or capable of having a serious conversation?

I am interested in her. I asked her out on a date recently which she said yes to, but we’re trying to coordinate our schedules for this upcoming week. How would you all proceed? We are coworkers at the end of the day, I just don’t know whether to keep texting, just go for the date, keep getting to know her, or back away?

I wasn’t so sure the first time if he was into me but he asked for a second date we ended up making out for hours and have a 3rd date lined up this weekend. I am def planning on telling him about my daughter now but I was looking for some opinions about this. Did I fuck this up? I think I should put it in my profile after all this happened.

We have our sixth date this week. We’ve been seeing each other about once a week (on the weekends usually) because he works out of town most days. I’ve been staying over at his house the past few weekends, and we have slept together. He’s very nice to me and talks about things he wants to do in the future and things we should go to and we have a great time when we’re together. 

I don’t always hear from him throughout the week but I know he travels a lot and is quite busy. He came over earlier today and helped me hang up picture frames on my wall and that meant a lot to me. He also made me coffee the next morning the first time I spent the night at his house and let me stay most of the day after. We’ve watched and finished a show together. I had been dating another guy up until a couple weeks ago, but I broke things off with him when I felt stronger feelings for this guy. 

I really want to ask if he is seeing other people and what he thinks about just seeing each other. To be honest, we haven’t really talked about the future or about what we want in a relationship or what our intentions were with being on dating apps. I know that this is an important question but I was trying to take things easy and slow because I didn’t want to rush in to anything. But it would provide me a lot of comfort knowing that I’m only other person he seen, especially if we’re sleeping together regularly. How can I bring this up without scaring him? If he says he’s still dating other people I don’t know if I necessarily will end things with him, although it would make me feel a bit differently.

We’ve moved in together 2 months ago in a flat. She is the more reserved and shy type of girl, and has always been ever since I met her early last year.
She’s insecure about herself and her past relationships haven’t been great, she’s been mentally hurt and used in the past and has been cheated on many times.

Yesterday, I noticed that she went on my phone when I went in the shower.
I added a girl on Snapchat as a random add through friend of a friend, we had a few messages going, my GF sent me a snap when she was laying next to me, she urged me to open it, I delayed and said I will later, I got in the shower and came to open it after, then I saw the chat with that girl disappeared. I thought she blocked me which was strange, but then I checked my blocked list, and saw she was the ONLY one there! So meaning my GF went on my phone and blocked her.

Then I thought back to the past week and past month, I realised on my Instagram 2-3 girls that I follow and 2 I sort of know, disappeared. I investigated, and saw that they were BLOCKED from my account! I’ve had these girls for a long time and known them before her. I don’t speak to them at all so it’s random for her to just suddenly select these 3.

One of the girls I usually like her photos - just social media so it doesn’t mean anything. She also replied to one of my stories a few months ago which was just a food photo. That message was still in my messages - I saw that the message for this has been deleted also.

Another girl she’s a long time sort of friend which I hardly speak to, but she was blocked also.

Then another girl who I also like some of her photos, was blocked also?

I was left confused at why she picked these 3 to block..

I know she has insecurity issues, she doesn’t like when I look at other girls in public. She feels insecure and thinks she’s not good enough if she sees me liking or looking at other girls’ pictures on my phone. She’s always needing assurance from me from time to time.

She knows my password for my phone as she’s seen me type it before. I thought it was okay for us to know each other’s passwords as I believe there should be trust in a relationship.

I’ve never been through her phone as I trusted her. But now I found out she’s been through mine recently.. I would say at least 4 times in the past 1-2 months. I’ve now changed my password and haven’t said anything yet.

Should I confront her about this and tell her that I’m angry and that she invaded my privacy and had no right to just block someone without me knowing?
