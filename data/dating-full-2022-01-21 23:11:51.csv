Take chances, show them how you really feel about them. Because trust me, the last thing you want in life is to regret not being able to do something (that they love) for your special someone, or even your family (of course it’s different when it comes to relatives who showed no mercy nor respect, you can forgive them, but you shouldn’t feel forced to forget all about it).

Every single day might be someone else’s last. To be frank, I lost someone who’s very dear to me, but I’m proud that I can say that we have no regrets because there was never a single day that passed that we did not show how much our love for each other was. But don’t worry guys! I’ve already accepted what has happened 🤍 I believe God has sent me that guy to make me who I am now, so I’ll be able to love whole heartedly, to become stronger and be a much better person than I was yesterday. In fact, I never thought this day would come — rekindling a relationship from my past — and he was worth the wait 🥰

Turn their bad days to good days, by making them laugh, or maybe by making them forget about it even for a little while, it’ll make a difference you know? Maybe your “i love you’s” mean the world to them even if you think that those are just expressive words. Hear them out, stories of their day, what makes them happy and enthusiastic. Don’t let it fade away. Or comfort them when everything seems to be falling apart. Those simple acts might be what they needed to feel, and you just saved them!

I know things could be tough at times.. but you are always bigger than any of these circumstances. And if you want to make the relationship last, search for ways to keep his/her genuine love for you. Trust me, you don’t want to lose someone who’s willing to take risks for you!

Online dating made me miserable. Just check my post history for proof... It really bringed me down.

Now I try to improve myself. I started a diet, planing on doing exercises, but I have no idea, where to meet women offline. 

I don't drink, and generally feel bad about bars, and my interests (motorsport, history, science) makes it hard to find any social gathering of similiar minded people. I'm a Phd student, so I ""meet"" tons of girls with similiar age (20-24), but I find it awkward to just ask out random girls. I think most of them would find it intruding.

I basically don't have any social circle. I can talk to people alright, but I can't connect with anyone deeply. Nobody seems to share my interests, or ideas about life. I haven't experienced a really good talk for a long time. So meeting through friends is also not an option. ( I know lots of you will think that, I should have true friends first, before a girlfriend. Maybe you are right, but in this post I would like to ask for help about dating.)

It seems like online dating reamained the only possibility, but that is clearly a dead end with my current looks. (2 years on several sites, with several pictures, and detailed bio, achieving 1 match, and lots of rejection, ghosting, and zero effort conversations)

However, if you are not interested, I do not want to keep putting you in uncomfortable situations. If you're not interested, I would be disappointed, but I want you to be happy above all. I think you're a great person and have a lot of amazing personality traits that would mesh well with mine. Too many girls my age are focused on drinking, partying, and don't look forward or take life seriously. One of the things that initially attracted me to you was that you were mature, have a great head on your shoulders, and are future-oriented."" 

After I said that, she thanked me for being forward and said that all other relationships that she's had in the past were with people that she knew very well. She said that she didn't know me that well, and she wasn't sure yet. She said that she only gets into relationships with people that she can see long-term. She said that she needed to think things over and that she would let me know in a few days. She seemed grateful that we had the conversation and thanked me again. Then she said that she really enjoys spending time with me. 

Afterward, I walked her to her apartment and I hugged her again--a bit firmer this time, and she put her head on my shoulder. Then, before she went in, she thanked me for the nice things I said about her and said that she would text me in a few days.

I've not dated for about a year and a half now, and after getting my life together, I feel ready to date again. I don't really have a big social group and I live on my own, so meeting people naturally has been really difficult. So I thought online dating would be the answer.

Any advice or reassurance would be much appreciated!

Cheers.

&amp;#x200B;

About two years I met a man that I thought was kind and understanding. We were never in an official relationship but we were dating. After 3 months he had to move away but we kept in contact. He would often fake a future to keep me on the hook and would call me up a lot when he was drunk to say that he missed me, etc. I am a very shy, and lonely person so even though this is nothing special, to me it felt like someone cared about me. I was excited every time he would text or call. I told him on two separate occasions my feelings for him, so there was no uncertainty how I felt about him. For some stupid reason I thought if I just did x we could make it work. If I just worked harder to save maybe I could visit him, if I just worked out harder I'd look prettier and he'd want me (I actually lost 60 pounds since he left), if I just was always complacent and didn't speak my mind he would see me as easy going and want me. I helped him with his grad school work, whenever he was on covid quarantine and bored I kept in constant communication and checked in on him to make sure his mental health was okay. A week ago he called me drunk telling me how much he missed me. Two days later he told me that he had good news and there was a girl who liked him. Today on his social media he posted a picture of himself and the new girl (she looks very beautiful. Much more beautiful than me and thinner as well. She looks like a sweet person)saying that he wasn't looking for love, and didn't want anything but then he met this girl and now he wants everything. I feel stupid for being heartbroken. We were never in a real relationship and I was an idiot that entire time. I had contracted an std from him as well (herpes, so I know I'm disgusting and won't be able to find anyone else) and I feel really dejected.

We talked for 3 hours until the restaurant closed, I’m confident it went well. He sent a text telling me how great the night was and that I seem like a genuine person and he likes that about me. I responded I had a great time to, I think he has a great personality / interesting to talk to and I hope to hang out again sometime soon. This is what confuses me: after I sent that text he loved my message, like on the iPhone when you hold down the message you can react to it lol, I was confused why he didn’t send another message setting up a second date? Or just to say something? I haven’t been on many first dates, but what comes next? Should I wait for him to get back to me? Should I wait awhile then reach out?

Happiness is a choice, something that both people in a relationship need to choose every day. As much as a lot of people don't like hearing, you do have to be happy outside of a relationship. And that doesn't mean a relationship won't make you even happier and add to your life, but you need to develop the ability to filter through your life and pick out the good parts and let the others go. Maybe you had plans to go to lunch with your friend and they got sick and couldn't go. Instead of getting upset because your day is ruined, think of the positives: now you have a whole day to do whatever you want! Maybe your SO didn't get you that gift you really wanted for your birthday. Don't get mad and throw a fit/start questioning your entire relationship and whether your partner is putting in enough effort... Look at other things. Did you guys get to spend the entire day doing things you love together? Was he happy with his gift? Did your SO at least try? How you choose to interpret a situation is all a choice. And that affects your mood and in turn affects your relationship. If you choose to be happy, overall you will be and your relationships will be.

I've noticed that there are people that self sabotage and complain about everything. Both people in and out of relationships. They snap, get mad and argue small, insignificant things that their partner does instead of taking a step back and considering whether or not it partner did it on purpose to hurt you... They take their partner for granted, don't say thanks/you're welcome and expect everything be perfect all the time. And then instead of trying to talk it through with their partner, they come here and ask people that don't really know what exactly happened for advice. And then act. Sometimes without even talking it out with their SO 

People need to build their SO up and go out of their way for each other and it can't be one sided. Doesn't even have to be big things. Take the trash out for them, leave them a note saying you love them, buy them their favorite snack on your grocery trip, tell them they are sexy, text them that you miss them, etc.

Listening to people in songs say things like “when you know, you know”. 

The thing is I thought I found my one at least a few times, and obviously I’m single now. 

The more girls I date and talk to, the more I realize how difficult it would be to find the perfect girl, and then that girl to like me back. The odds are so incredibly low. I actually did the math for myself once and concluded that the the right girl for me would be like 1/60,000 people lol. 

The last two girls I dated briefly were the nicest girls to me ever, and honestly during that time, I thought I could have been moderately happy married to either of them. When I see my friends in their long term relationships, they actually seem like they were meant for each other lol. For me, I don’t know if I’m just a generic guy lol, but I have like average to good chemistry with a lot of girls. I can convince myself to fall in love lol.

I’m talking to a new girl who I feel I have great chemistry now with, but there’s a voice in my head going telling me I fell in love with every other girl the same way, and don’t worry if things don’t work, you’ll fall in love again. 

I don’t know if things are supposed to feel different when I meet my “one”. Also in my early 20s I used to fall madly in love with girls. Now I still feel love, but it’s been sort of dulled down a bit because of past let downs.

My best guess was he probably just wanted to hookup. Anyway, he reached out asking for a date and seemed kinda sweet but then went into great detail about how he wanted to kiss me and how important a first kiss is. Despite all this, I told myself maybe he’s just excited. 

So tonight, he made a big sale and told me how excited he was and couldn’t sleep. Here’s how it went down:

Him: Would you be willing to come over and watch a movie with me? We don’t have to hookup or anything but I just want something to do and am in a really good mood

Me: Sorry that makes me kinda uncomfortable since we haven’t met yet but I’m really happy for you! I’m probably gonna be up a little late so we can text if you want.

Him: (sends video of his tv then pans over to his face and rolls his eyes) the caption is: Cmon what do you think I’ll do

Me: I’m really not feeling that. I’m sorry

Him: Did I just blow it?

Me: idk but that’s is kinda giving me bad vibes

Him: All I did was ask you to come over for a movie. All you had to do was say no. It’s not that a big of a deal. My goodness.

Me: I did say no and you kept pressuring me to come over. How does you saying “cmon what do you think I’ll do” then rolling your eyes not give major rapey vibes?

Him: what the f*ck? How dare you put my name and the word rape in the same sentence. There’s no f*cking way I am like that. It’s not a big f*cking deal all you had to do was say no. I thought you’d rather hang out instead of wait another day. You can consider Sunday off 

I blocked him shortly after this

I feel really shaken up inside because him gaslighting me on how I didn’t say “no” when I politely did several times reminds me a lot of my toxic ex and triggers me a lot because he would convince me I was the problem. Also, if you look at my posting history dating has been ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL for me and I’m numb to getting flaked on or ghosted but I was actually looking forward to this date and feel really upset that this is who this guy actually was.

I say we connected fairly well he was very sweet and genuine with me and gave me lots of compliments I could tell that he was really into me. He then asked me if I wanted to go to a cat cafe with him and I said sure so we went together and he put out his hand for me to hold and I did hold it. At the cat cafe we were sitting on the couch and he put his arm around me and we snuggled a little bit but I felt uncomfortable as I barely knew him and there were other people around. I do like him I just felt he was being overly forward as he was touching my leg and tried to touch my stomach. Then as we were leaving he asked if I could take my mask off and I knew that he wanted to kiss me. I said no as I didn't want to and after it was super awkward he just walked away and that was it...

My girl friend arranged a group date with her, her bf, his flatmate (26M) and myself.

During the ""date"", I thought that I clicked pretty well with this guy. We all had a few to drink, admittedly, but the sexual tension was definitely there, despite only making out that night.

We arranged for another date, and he was late by about 15 minutes, which isn't a big deal. But I had to text time to let him know that I was waiting for him at our arranged meeting place and right on time too (which I'm not usually, but I like to be consistent when it comes to meeting with new people).

That date went well. We went back to his place and ended up having sex. As cliché as it might sound, I really am not that type of girl. But, it did happen and what happened, happened I guess. The chemistry felt present, and I asked him if he'd like for us to see each other again, to which he said ""It's all on you, but it's a yes on my end"". 

I thought well awesome, now I know that he wants to continue seeing me. However, I was the one who asked him if he'd be free tomorrow, which I asked 2 weeks in advance and have kept my day free for him.

Last week, I asked him what our plans are for tomorrow/what he'd like to do since I've saved the whole day to see him. I'll be traveling 2 hours to see him tomorrow. He said that he wasn't sure, but he'd ""whip up a plan"", then get back to me and let me know. 

Thing is, he hasn't said anything about a time, place, or what the ""plan"" is. I'm not the type to play games, I'm pretty transparent and straightforward but, I can't help but feel weird about messaging him with a follow up, since the ball is definitely in his court right now.

It actually looked pretty convincing, and he used photoshop to touch on it further. Appearance wise, female me was probably a 6/10, decent but not stunning. I then installed Hinge, put a bunch of generic information in ""my"" profile like how I was an early 20s university student in California, doing some generic degree. Thus, the experiment began. I just wanted to see what the female experience was like.

Within the first 10 minutes, the profile got like 30 likes, I had to limit the dating pool to only Asian men (since we are Asian). Here are some of the things that stood out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The profile felt really popular and it was hard to reply to all messages. It was like every 20 seconds, there was another like. And I had likes from all sorts of people, from teens to doctors in their 30s. I could relate to women having trouble with filtering the matches, as it's only possible to talk to like 2-3 men at a time, while the rest inevitably get left behind. If I was a woman, I'd have a lot of trouble forming deeper connections in this system. And keep in mind that female me was just...slightly above average, yet I had some IVY educated very good looking males pursuing me, it felt surreal.
2. The quality of males on Hinge at least, is actually pretty good? I don't understand how some women are on about creepy/bathroom selfie males. Out of so matches I got, almost all had pretty good pictures, were highly educated, had relatively interesting profiles and many began with intuitive openers I could have never come up with. Apart from one guy who began with an innuendo, the rest were very respectful and honestly seemed like great guys. They evidently put a lot of effort in the quality of their messages, and were definitely more interesting compared to the women on Hinge. I recall when I swiped as a straight male on Hinge, conversation with women was like pulling teeth, and it felt like I was just there to entertain them. And their pictures/profiles in general had far less effort to the males I saw. Though now that I've gotten the female experience, I guess I could definitely relate as to why women don't even the effort; they just don't have to.
3. Most males on Hinge were above average compared to the street. If you are a 5/10 in real life, then you are probably a 4/10 on dating apps, because the pool is simply better looking. I would imagine that it would be very difficult for an unattractive male to get dates on dating apps. Even if you are an above average male, why should any women choose you on there, if she has a lot of other guys competing for her that are better looking and richer than you?

I feel like after this experiment, if I was make an actual dating that creates relationships, I would probably have a matchmaker system where you had consultants within the app. You would provide them with information about yourself and what you look for in a partner, and they would play matchmaker, linking you with people that are actually compatiable, and maybe you could only get like 3 ""options"" a month. Because right now, dating apps simply don't result in relationships.

Quick backstory;
I have always managed to date/ find hook up’s ect, however none of the relationships were “long lasting” per se, and found it relatively easy to find regular hook-ups/casual ONS (Definitely not bragging or anything as it’s a lonely life) since I was in my late teens up until a year ago and found started not having much luck with either. However I made the conscious effort a few months ago to delete my dating apps and all that and to stop pursuing, and also to work on myself a lot more considering for the last 7-8 years I have struggled yet also managed being a habitual stimulant substance abuser. This also involves focusing more on turning my occupation into a career ect. I have been clean from heavy every day substance abuse for almost 2 years now and about 8-9 months currently clean from very casual once a month/ every two months if that use.(There was around a 6 month gap in between before I began casual use again). As a result now I’m experiencing a weird thing where I’m having multiple females come out of absolutely no where and pursuing me for dates, hook ups ect which feels very odd and alien considering we are living in COVID times and I don’t leave the house all that often except for work and grocery shopping lol. 

Now I have noticed this happen to me before when I was a little bit younger, but not to this scale, maybe it just feels more intense cos I’m older now? Once again I must clarify that this is definitely not bragging of any sort, I was just wondering what the significance is behind all of this? 
Have I hit a point in my life where I’m truly happy within myself and its something to do with the laws of attraction OR is this the universe testing me in an obscure way to see if I’ve really changed within myself to see if I’m gonna seriously fuck it up?
I consider myself a spiritual person of sorts and tend to be pretty good at following my gut/intuition but I’m just finding this point of my life very confusing considering dating in your late 20s feels very foreign to navigate.

Anyway the point of this post is has anyone else experienced this or anything similar and have any wisdom whether that be positive or negative to bestow upon me?
