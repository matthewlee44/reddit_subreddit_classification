0,mh73sz,1617200323,I am trying to meet a woman internationally... part 3.,"I have appreciated so many suggestions, insights, and thoughts in my previous two posts. In this third and final installment, I‚Äôd like to say that the criticism gave me pause and inspired me to reconsider such an endeavor. And those that supported the idea brought up great points too, which I am further considering.

A key thing I noticed in the discussion was the point that a ‚Äúcertain type of guy‚Äù dates internationally. Maybe he is middle aged, a bit quirky, maybe not especially handsome, and certainly unlucky in the US at meeting women.

So the fundamental question this: Should this guy merely accept his lonely fate in the US or should he try to go where he is celebrated, not merely tolerated? Should he go where he might be selected rather than rejected? 

So if dating domestically had not worked for someone for years. Why be insane and do the same thing over and over expecting different results? Why not branch out, try something new. Explore new opportunities for oneself and give new opportunities to someone else potentially?

Thoughts?

Thanks!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mh73sz/i_am_trying_to_meet_a_woman_internationally_part_3/
1,mh9l4h,1617207373,Question for the women,"So I‚Äôm having a terrible week so thought a fluff topic might be fun. 

CAVEAT ON THIS POST IS ITS NIT THAT SERIOUS LOL


I was talking with a coworker and mentioned how I loathe being called cute. For some reason, I suspect it‚Äôs my looks diminishing as I‚Äôve gotten older, I‚Äôve been getting called that more often instead of another way of saying I‚Äôm attractive.

It really irritates me and I know I should probably just shut up but if you pay attention to me at all in here you know it‚Äôs not in my nature. Instead I try to make a joke about it to indicate I hate being called cute...something along the lines of ‚Äúoh yes...like a fluffy bunny.‚Äù Admittedly I could probably think of something better to say.

I‚Äôm incredibly short, four foot ten, and often due to my size and until I hit forty, very youthful appearance have a history of people not taking me seriously. It‚Äôs actually why I‚Äôve developed into such an outspoken person. To me being called cute calls up those feelings along with my own bias against the word as to me it equates to saying I look ‚Äúfine‚Äù

So how do other women of this age group feel about being called cute? Do you like it or not? If you do why do you or if you don‚Äôt why not?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mh9l4h/question_for_the_women/

Let me start with the fact that I am a socially anxious introvert who has figured out how I can get around my own nerves to manage interactions with others, date, and engage in a lot of public speaking. With that said, I'm trying to alter my career (I'm currently a professor of interpersonal relationships) to help people like me succeed. 

I'm NOT trying to sell you anything, just floating some ideas and questions. (But, I have free session options if you want to talk for free - just message me for my site info) 

Feel free to respond to one or all of these questions. Also, feel free to rip apart my ideas, but please just let me know your reasoning. 

1) My goal is to help socially anxious introverts develop better interpersonal skills so they can meet quality romantic prospects. 

Does that sound good? My friend said it ""lacked humanity,"" but I'm not sure that's true. Would this statement turn you off?

&amp;#x200B;

2) What do you struggle with most as a socially anxious individual?

3) How would your life be different if social anxiety was less of a problem for you?

4) Again NOT ASKING FOR YOUR MONEY, but if you had/have disposable income, what would you pay for someone to help you manage your anxiety successfully?

Got back out there a few months ago and I've learned more in 2 months than in years. It's eye opening and disappointing to be honest. So I went on a date with a guy last week. We messed around in my car kissing and second base? Mostly all of his texts to me are sexual or he always gets to that. Not very inquisitive. Surprisingly we talked on the phone last night for 45 minutes. I told him it's my birthday today and he's never texted me happy birthday yet

Now I don't think I want to see him again

4,mhda94,1617217733,I as a man can without fear admit I am lonely,"I am lonely.  The loneliness is more than simply being alone.  You can easily feel alone in a crowd, with friends,  etc.  Being lonely isn't a crime or being broken, desperate,  or anything negative about you as a person.  

We are humans, a very social species.  We depend on each other.  We are biologically built on being social.   When we feel alone or are alone we feel anxiety, pain, fear.   Our bodies go into over drive.   Blood pressure goes up, adrenaline,  and cortisol go up.  Most people go through this from time to time.  Prolonged loneliness leads to health problems and often death especially for older people.   Not to mention sucide and addictions.

I have been single almost 4 years after a 20 yr marriage.  Aside from the conversations on dating apps and the dozen or so coffee dates and two women I met 3 or so times, I've been alone.  At times it is almost unbearable.  Days go by feeling alone and hopeless followed by weeks of trying to live and not think about it or feel bad.  

In the next few weeks summer activities (work and home projects) will largely keep me too busy physically and mentally to think on these things.  So I feel decent until October when summer activities go away.  

Some out there suggest hobbies or other activities to fill the time and replace the thoughts.  Problem with that is if you stop trying, stop thinking, stop looking, time will pass until you wake up 20 yrs down the road at retirement without anyone to share that time with.  

So if you are lonely whether male, female,  cisgender or LGBTQ know that you are not the only person out there who understands and feels lonely and at times hopeless.......",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mhda94/i_as_a_man_can_without_fear_admit_i_am_lonely/
5,mheqcz,1617221865,When Covid ruins it big time,"I live a ten hours drive away from my Munchkin, who lives with the mother.  We are no drama.  My visits are typically for two weekends at a time.  I stay for the week between those two weekends and I try to optimize that week, during which Munchkin is in school.  There are good ski resorts within day-trip range.

This is one of those optimization week.  We had a blast skiing last weekend for the first few hours of the morning until the sky had diarrhea.  We have plans for the long Easter weekend and chances are that the sky will hold off just enough to keep the slopes viable.  Everything according to plan.  And then this:

Monday morning the school's principal is informed of two dozen confirmed Covid cases among students.  Good reaction: shut down school immediately.  No lunch break, kids remain in their class-bubble until transportation home is arranged.  Parents who can (me included) rush to pick up kids instead of letting them bus home.  More information follows in the evening.  List of affected class-bubbles and sports programs.  None of them is Munchkin's.  Plan for the rest of the week: Tuesday and Wednesday remote teaching.  Thursday PD day.  Yay, more fun with Munchkin.  I book tickets for another skiing day on that PD day.

Tuesday evening: the school is in the 5PM news.  Public health, conspicuously late and absent so far, decided to mass-test the whole school for Covid.  Parents were informed after the media.  Munchkin's grandmother knew before the email was in my inbox. Changed plan: Wednesday Covid-testing, Thursday remote teaching.  PD day cancelled.  Very gracious ski resort: refunded quickly, even if not legally required.

Logical consequence of testing: must self-isolate until results are known.

Wednesday I drive Munchkin in for testing.  No provision for parents/family testing.  So now waiting for Munchkin's result.  Being so close and so isolated from Munchkin hurts.  Waiting for the test results is daunting.  Can't focus on anything but checking email and phone and test portal way too often.  The thought that test results may not arrive before the weekend, and therefore ruin further plans, is daunting.  I know there is a non-zero probability that Munchkin got Covid at school, and I understand and accept that this would totally change our plans.  But I can't help being nervous waiting on test results.

Thanks in advance for your understanding and apology for my excessive presence here while waiting.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mheqcz/when_covid_ruins_it_big_time/

He has two teenage boys, I have two preschooler age boys. In the very beginning we agreed not to introduce our kids for a while... although lately his custody situation changed and unless I can start visiting him at his place while his teenagers are home, we will basically never see each other. 

Soooo,he invited me over to visit his house on Friday when his two teenage boys will be home. (But we both agreed it would not be wise to introduce my preschool children to anyone yet cause they could get too attached.)

8,mhfr6c,1617224773,Alcohol or Caffeine. What else is there for a first date?,"43F here. I love beer and like to drink socially. A perfect first date for me is to get a drink and sit facing each other to talk. Drinking (in moderation) is bonding and puts me in a good mood, mainly because alcohol is closely associated with relaxing and having fun (happy hour, vacation, celebrating milestones, etc). 

However, I really want to get better at dating without alcohol. I continue to meet men that do not drink. At first (earlier stages of online dating) I swiped left on non drinkers because I thought it meant they were a recovered alcoholic (which makes me worry that they have addictive tendencies and that scares me) or just really uptight. But I don‚Äôt think this any more. A lot of people are just not drinking for health reasons, or other equally valid reasons. As long as they are ok with me drinking socially then it shouldn‚Äôt matter. As I age I can see myself drinking less and less. At this point I mainly drink socially and never in excess.

Trouble is, I really can‚Äôt think of a better first date than a drink. The second option is coffee, but I actually am very sensitive to coffee and tea (even decaf). Most of them give me horrible headaches and keep me up at night, and some cause allergic reactions (now I‚Äôm the high maintenance one!). Herbal teas are ok, but most just aren‚Äôt very good. And definitely don‚Äôt provide the same kind of mood as alcohol and/or good food.

What are some date suggestions other than alcohol and caffeine? I also don‚Äôt want a sugary drink. A meal is ok I guess, but I prefer the short ‚Äúsip-n-see.‚Äù I also love hiking and strolling in the park, but would so much rather sit and face someone and talk to them. Know what I mean? 

There used be a coffee house in town that was also a gig spot and they served coffee, tea, and alcohol! But they closed down during the pandemic. In my town we only have coffee shops that close at 3, breweries that only serve beer, and sit-down restaurants.

10,mhmque,1617248199,How does this work anymore?,"    So this might be long and if so I‚Äôm sorry in advance.

  I am a 45 year old man. I have four kids from two different marriages. (Starting out bad already). My 2nd wife and I were divorced in 2011 and I‚Äôve been single since. I‚Äôve had a few flings here and there but nothing that was actually a relationship. As most men know child support is a kick in the nuts on your own. So it‚Äôs been a struggle but I‚Äôve managed.
     After our divorce I watched my ex have so many men in and out of her life that the kids were confused and often scared. Some yelled a lot and some were violent. She is a good mom that just seemingly wants something she can‚Äôt find. I basically for the last eight years have opted to not dare. I didn‚Äôt want to confuse them or make them question when they were with me. 
     So that has also meant I haven‚Äôt been intimate with anyone in that 8 years. I have finally gotten to the point where I‚Äôm happy with my life. Happy with almost everything in it. Except a few. I‚Äôll explain below.

     First off I have been gaining weight due to a thyroid issue that I have been getting under control. I am not happy with this aspect but I also know I can‚Äôt fix it over night. So that is the first issue.

      Secondly I have no idea how people date these days. I mean we have online dating that bases things off of your picture. You put some info there and then hope people see past the bigger you in the picture but most don‚Äôt. And admittedly I have a preference that I do the same shit. It‚Äôs frustrating and more like a grocery store than dating. So I‚Äôm lost. Today it seems if you look in someone‚Äôs direction you‚Äôre ogling them or whatever or your thirsty. I mean what in the hell am I supposed to do? This new normal sucks ass.

      Third, My sex drive is that of my teenage years. I can‚Äôt even explain just how bad it is. Women are beautiful and I enjoy looking and on Reddit it‚Äôs not hard to find many pictures of whatever interests you. I just can‚Äôt stop enjoying the beauty. Now in my opinion this isn‚Äôt healthy it just makes it worse. So then I limit the looking and wanting. Now that I‚Äôve stopped doing that I find myself more attentive to sexy women in real life. I don‚Äôt stare or anything dumb but I notice EVERYTHING. It is making me nuts. The worst part is a most all of my friends are married. And their wives are mostly attractive. So then I find myself going to a place I shouldn‚Äôt in my mind. Now I may fantasize or wonder but I would never cross the line. Never. 

      Basically I would say I‚Äôm lost on where to go. So many people are like go out or so this online dating site. I have my youngest son at home so that makes it difficult to go out during the week. The grocery store was another one. I‚Äôm like not thinking that‚Äôs a good idea either. 

       One thing that has been bad for me is porn. Yes I watch it and I have had to slow that down too. I have found that when you watch enough of it you start to become self conscious about penis size. Now I‚Äôm an average guy but all of the things out there really take a toll on perception and how some people feel about themselves. I‚Äôm a pretty confident guy and don‚Äôt really have too many hang ups about myself. I have created the size one myself apparently. Some are size queens some say it doesn‚Äôt matter and I honestly don‚Äôt really care but reading posts on here and how people act it‚Äôs not very comforting. 

         In a nutshell I‚Äôm looking for direction. Yes I know where the gym is. I am looking for some suggestions or thoughts maybe even some insight. Not looking for negative stuff here.

15,mhvlrh,1617284648,I‚Äôm back with some observations!,"I‚Äôve noticed that men in their 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs fall into one of several categories:

-Want a woman to move in instantly for a serious relationship. Also, everything is on their terms, no willingness to compromise (Can‚Äôt tell you how many men I have talked to who told me I would have to quit mountain biking for them...knowing that mountain biking is such a passion to me that I have a vanity plate on my car showing my love for the sport).
-Revolving door of women that they meet on social media, pretending they want a relationship to have booty calls.
-Flat angry about everything in life, particularly the ex-wife or ex-long term girlfriend who left them (newsflash, happy women don‚Äôt leave).

Sometimes it is a mixture of the above.

From what I hear from my guy friends, it‚Äôs very similar for the guys. One guy told me that women in their 50‚Äôs only want sex and not a relationship. Other guys complain about the false advertising in women‚Äôs photos (filters, body edits, etc.)

And for the record, I am not dating and much happier avoiding dating and doing what I want 100% of the time, but that has not stopped men (anywhere from good friends to complete strangers) from pursuing me. I don‚Äôt understand why guys are pursuing when it‚Äôs clearly not wanted. I have been pretty clear that I am happy the way things are and mot interested in the drama and time suck a relationship can bring.

He has an ex-girlfriend that he was with for ten years that he is still close to. They broke up five years ago because they were at different places in life. He says she is his family, her adult kids are his family, and refers to her four grandchildren as being his grandchildren also. Families come in all sorts of flavors and compositions and although I don‚Äôt love any of this, I do my best to be accepting. His ex is 14 years older than him (hence the grandchildren) and has not dated anyone since they split up. I have not met her and I know my boyfriend is hesitant for us to meet. I think because his ‚Äúworlds will collide‚Äù and it may change his relationship dynamic with his ex. She has expressed interest in meeting me.

I do not think there is anything romantic going on between them. What bothers me is that I feel that, in many ways, they are still each other‚Äôs go-to person. She is his emergency contact. She‚Äôs the beneficiary of his life insurance. When she needed help putting up a fence last summer he was there every single weekend, busting his ass in the blazing August and September heat to do it. She needs a ride to the airport on Saturday morning at 4am and asked him to take her. This means he and I can‚Äôt spend the night together on Friday but I doubt that was a consideration for him.

21,mi3bct,1617306269,"Feeling insecure when seeing someone who is guarded, with past trauma where they need time to warm up","I know this might be a little long, but I just wanted to explain the situation.

I've been seeing someone for the last few months who I've gotten to really like.  She's really relaxed and chill.  I feel like she has been a good friend.  We've both told each other we like each other and enjoy our conversations.

She has a couple issues affecting her health, one of which is trouble sleeping at night, which sometimes makes her very tired during the day to the point where she also gets bad headaches sometimes.  She has said she has had to take time off work to go rest.  She has had to cancel plans to meet with me a few times, which she has felt bad about, but she still gets together with me to hang out.  I've been patient, and several times she has said she feels like I'm a great friend for that and she really appreciates it and wishes she had met me a long time ago.

There have been a couple times when I've texted her to see if she'd want to get together, and she wouldn't respond until very late or the next day, and she'd say she was sleeping (due to her sleep condition).  She'll occasionally say sorry she missed my text and she would have enjoyed/loved to hang out.

We've tended to see each other about once a week, often on the weekend but occasionally once during the week.  And as mentioned, sometimes she hasn't always been available to meet up.

I've felt like I've gotten mixed signals from her as for whether she really likes me or not.  And recently, it has seemed like she has been a little more withdrawn.  I was starting to feel like she might not be very interested in me, and thus have been feeling a bit down.

Recently I had mentioned I'd be up for hanging out during the week after work if she wants.  She said she often feels tired and enjoys just relaxing after work.

We met for dinner recently and she told me she really does like me a lot and that I'm the nicest guy she has met, and she just needs time.  She said she knew she had been distant the past weekend when we hung out, and she said due to the way some of her family has treated her growing up, she doesn't know how to take compliments and affection.  She said she just needs time, and she said she's working through this with a therapist.  I told her I've been falling for her, and she said she has been falling for me too.  I felt relieved when she said that and felt better about where our potential relationship might go.  With what she says she's dealing with, I felt like she really does like me.

Then, in the middle of the week, I texted in the evening asking how her day went.  She said work was slow so she decided to go meet up with a friend who lives in another city about a 3-4 hour drive away.  She spent the night and texted me this morning and said she was almost back in town and was going to in to work.  I was surprised, as this seemed very spontaneous for something during the middle of the work week, particularly since she has sleep issues and she has said she's usually tired after work and wants to relax.

After she mentioned that, I started to wonder about it since it seemed unusual.  My feeling upbeat from our earlier conversation went back to feeling a bit down, and I wondered who might she be willing to drive that far to see and spend the night during the work week?  I know it really could just be a friend, but honestly it has been hard sometimes having feelings for her when things are going very slowly.

TL;DR: I've been patient with her, and we seem to really like each other, but as stated, she said she needs time.  She is guarded and seems to need time to open up due to past trauma.

I'm asking the ladies. 

I know most men would simply reply to a question like that, and say ""I'm fine, thanks for asking.""  

Not sure why every woman has a problem with this simple, polite, introductory question, or why they're profiles say not to ask that, or they won't reply.  ""Ask me something about my profile"" they say. I would love to talk about your kids or travel plans, or your interests. Just not sure why saying ""hello, how are you?"" first is a problem. 

Isn't that how we talk in real life? 
I don't just walk up to women and start talking randomly about their interests. I would say hello first, to see if they are polite, and decent to talk to, then I would ask about their interests AFTER the initial greeting. 

I just don't know why women who are half way through life, and are still single, are dismissing totally polite, normal dudes who simply say hello to get the wheels of conversation turning.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mi3jml/what_is_so_wrong_with_saying_hi_how_are_you_on/

Then I would say I was in a succession of relationships, as one died, another cropped up. Today I'm going on a date with a woman I hardly know. New experience. I've been on dates in a relationship, but it's been a long time since I've been on a date seeing if I want to get into a relationship with a relative stranger. New experience.

Unfortunately, I read here about everyone's quirks and triggers to dismiss someone, and their frustrations and disappointments at not finding anyone. 

Here's a quote from a play of Shakespeare:

&amp;#x200B;

*To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;*

*Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth*

*With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:*

*If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;*

*If lost, why then a grievous labour won;*

*However, but a folly bought with wit,*

*Or else a wit by folly vanquished.*

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I already won, going somewhere new, meeting someone new. Even if she blows my balls off with a shotgun when she first sets eyes on me, I feel like I'm ahead of the game. We'll see if she can interest me. I've had a lot of fun watching what my mind does in anticipation of this first date. I'm wise enough to know what I want, and how to get it, so I'm going to be myself and see where that goes and enjoy the adventure. I'm already ahead.

I hate the fact that people, especially in the world of OLD, think if they don‚Äôt get a text back quick enough or with enough words that the other person isn't interested and just a plain loser with no communication skills. 

This is damaging! 

And it‚Äôs simply not true!

In the old days before cell phones, potential love interests or even actual couples who weren‚Äôt living together or married weren‚Äôt tied to each other with an electronic leash. 

They had the freedom to breathe and explore life as an individual so that when they did communicate with the other person they had stories to tell. They were able to continue to grow individually, live life without the pressure of having to reply to texts in a timely manner or with enough sentences. And that‚Äôs perhaps just one of the reasons that relationships worked better before cell phones.

I hate when I hear someone blabbering off ‚ÄúIt takes ten seconds to send a text, it‚Äôs rude to not text!‚Äù 

But does it REALLY take 10 seconds? 

If it does you‚Äôre not really communicating with the other person are you? Your satiating your need for attention, quelling your worry and discomfort that they don‚Äôt like you by hearing that ding with a ‚ÄúHey how are you?‚Äù one-liner. If a text-only takes ten seconds you aren‚Äôt getting to know that person on any level that would lead to a fulfilling conversation... much less a relationship. You‚Äôre laying your comfort at the feet of someone else, instead of living your life, seeking your happiness inside, and THEN communicating with that person in hours-long genuine and intimate conversation, not ten-second one-liners. 

Texting IS time-consuming. 

Maybe the person you‚Äôre waiting on a text from has a job that requires a lot of them and when they get home they just want to mellow out and veg out in front of the screen and not have to think. Maybe they spend lots of time being present outdoors. Maybe they spend lots of time being present with loved ones (children, aging parents, lifelong friends, pets). Maybe they get buried in a book or daydreams. Maybe constant texting goes against their values and they‚Äôre more old-fashioned. Maybe one-sided texting isn‚Äôt anything to do with the person not texting but the person texting and their inability to self soothe. 

Examining my own texting habits and they‚Äôre pretty poor compared to most people and never does it have ill intent. I think it‚Äôs important for people to recognize that texting should never be a major form of communication nor should it be the be-all and end-all of what you form your decision making on whether or not to move forward with a developing or existing relationship. Texting means NOTHING, especially if you haven't met.

On both Tinder and Hinge I've had the situation where you match with someone, send a message and just never even get a response probably four or five times each, which is annoying, but it is what it is.  What has been really frustrating is the matches that have resulted in days long text conversations that then inexplicably ended in ghosting.  I've had a few where a conversation started with some banter going back and forth ""Hey, how is your day going, what do you do, are you from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ originally, what do you like to do for fun, etc..?"" where the conversation seemed to flow easily and was not one sided.  A couple of those just literally stopped mid-stream.  After texting for about 30 minutes I asked one woman what she liked to do for fun besides (I referenced one of the things listed in her profile) and the conversation ended there-never heard from her again.  Another went on over the course of a couple of about a week-we talked about our favorite local restaurants, how our days/jobs were, etc...so finally this past Tuesday I asked her if we could meet for drinks at a local place we both liked.  She said sure and we set a date of this coming Saturday (tomorrow, at this point).  Wednesday morning I sent her a good morning message and heard nothing all day.  Nothing on Thursday, and then nothing today.  Sent a message around noon today, ""Hey just seeing if we're still on for drinks Saturday night?""  As of this writing, nothing...

I get it, women have their pick of whoever they want on these apps and there are plenty of other guys who are younger, better looking, in better shape, with more impressive careers than me.  My assumption is that these individuals found someone better to devote their time and resources to and that's fine-they didn't fall off of the face of the earth.

63,mjcham,1617469251,Asked out then no communications until day before the date,"I had a few days off and decided to give OLD another go. On Thursday I matched with a guy.  He's not a big talker, asked me nothing about myself and told me nothing about himself. There's very little on his profile so no clues there.

He cut straight to the chase and asked me out. I decided to take a chance and we agreed to meet Sunday. I didn't hear anything from him since, no chit chat, nada. Saturday night he messages to ask how am I placed for breakfast, but I don't find the message until around midnight. 

I've kinda lost interest because of the radio silence. It feels awkward because I have no idea who he is or what we're going to talk about. 

I interpret the silence as a lack of enthusiasm or interest. But I guess it's fair to say that went both ways and I could have messaged him and asked questions to try and navigate around the lack of info on his profile. 

Am I unfair (possibly being lazy) for wanting to cancel?

My new SO is much smaller than me. A strong wind could blow him away.  Hugging him at first was like hugging an ironing board. 

Every morning he texts me and says good morning beautiful, and asks how I slept.

I can't wrap my brain around beautiful. Im older, I have the body of a mom who had 3 big babies by csection, my arms have wings and wave by themselves, my thighs touch.  Im short and I still feel chunky.

My therapist knows this is a hangup for me and says I should accept the compliments, but its so foreign to me.

Plus....he showed me pictures of his brothers ex. Fucking smoking hot teeny bikini model gorgeous.  That just adds to my lack of confidence....bringing a thick woman to meet his family...ugh. No pressure there. üôÑ

76,mjkojg,1617494840,It Was Supposed to be About Love...Right?,"In 2014 I was happily married with two kids.  On September 15th, I came home to find my wife and kids (one a stepchild) gone.  There were refried beans left on the stove, the kids' bunk bed gone, a Dear John letter on the counter.  I couldn't find them for three months.  While I was on the other side of the country on business, she had consummated an affair with her ex-boyfriend.  A week later, she admitted it to me and told me she wanted a divorce.  We were one year and seven months into our marriage.  We had a civil ceremony so I threw her the wedding she never had for our first anniversary.  While she was renewing her vows and wearing the (frankly, stunning) dress I had found, she was already carrying on with her new guy.  The attitude was basically, ""Don't hate the playa, hate the game.""  I wasn't playing a game.

Coming back into the dating world, I found there were all sorts of pills I could take.  Red ones, blue ones, purple ones...even black ones!  As a result of all this pill taking, people started seeing ghosts.  They were the omnipresent ghosts of the past, ghosts of the future (!!) and, apparently, dating had become murderous because there were a \*lot\* of ghosts of first dates.  It was like a demented dating version of A Christmas Carol.  Take enough pills, I suppose and one starts experiencing things.

I discovered that to be successful in dating, I had to make sure I got a professional photographer, learn how to smile, figure out how to be charming and charismatic with the first words I said to a complete stranger, write a detailed bio (but not too detailed).  People didn't want to be chatted up in grocery stores.  Again, I had to have ""game"".

I \*do\* hate the game.  The ""game"" has cost me a list of people in my life.  The ""game"" has cost my son a lot.  I accept that I'm just waking up to reality.  Perhaps, I didn't want to see it as it seems so...""ugly"" is the word that comes to mind.  It all seems to center around cheap sex and materialism.  Ignorance might have been bliss.  Bliss is what I was aiming for, not ignorance.  It's the ignorance that seems to continue intruding.  I find it tragic. 

I've got my pros and cons, like anyone.  I know myself well and I continue to work on improving life for my son and myself.   I think I'd check the boxes for someone.  But, as an older solo dad, it all became too overwhelming because there's one thing that seems to be missing from the debate and ""strategies"", the rhetoric and the ""-isms"":  Love.

Choose love, people.  Choose to not reduce other people.  Choose to send the text instead of ""ghosting"".  Choose to see the courage behind the awkwardness.  Just...choose love.

77,mjlde1,1617497261,On Giving People a True Chance,"I was on Bumble until very recently. My frustration was many matches, few responses to my ""first move"" messages. As background, I definitely consider myself a catch. I've not been in a relationship for almost two years, had plenty of hook-ups with guy friends but nothing ""real."" I decided on Bumble as I heard good things. I just got wrapped up in advancing my career - which I did, and I'm thrilled/proud - and setting up a solid ""me"" foundation.  One of those two years was pandemic ""on my own"" stuff we all had to deal with. A Covid-related job furlough notwithstanding, I came out of it with an even better job (a dream job, really) and I'm in better shape than before the pandemic, somehow.

But I found one regular theme - people not giving anyone a chance. It seems to me (and gents, and those who identify as men, please let me know what's up here) that dudes are really jaded. I'd trade messages and it would go to the negative (like, ""If you even respond,"" ""This app is horrible but glad to connect,"" etc.) really quickly - OR - we'd hit it off, and move to iMessage. Meeting up was definitely on the table. And then, boom, one night of a discussion ends with him deciding I'm ""\_\_\_\_\_\_"" and blocking me completely. The biggest bummer of the recent, and maybe I dodged a bullet (likely, but still) was, to me, a friendly-vibe heated discussion about the role of the vocalist vs. singer in rock or metal. He shot me down, said I was too aggressive, ""you're too hot for rock,"" and ""you're a one album fan,"" (which is laughably inaccurate) then blocked me. He's never met me.

In my experience it seems men have been quick to assign an untrue narrative, then use THAT to end the interaction. What happened to giving people a chance?

Dudes, what's with this? I do have comfortable self-esteem and confidence (I have a GREAT career, I'm secure, and very emotionally aware but definitely not perfect, and fit, and I truly, truly listen to and know obscure genres of metal among many other genres) and can, with ease, argue my point in discussions. I always try to give someone at least ONE meet-up so I can get to know them. Why is this consideration so rare coming from men? Or is it just me? 

Would love some insight. Insult to injury was he's six years older than me, as I started dating older men (I'm 40, so ideally 41-49) because dudes under 40 were way insecure (my experience only, not a generalization.)

I deleted Bumble because of this, just not sure if I was part of the problem. Open to thoughts.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mjlde1/on_giving_people_a_true_chance/

We have a lot in common and the passionate kisses are incredible.  I am a single dad with 50% custody and she knows this.  She also recently quit her job and does not have another one lined up, but it's good that she quit because it was a toxic work environment.  

Anyhow, this weekend is my custody weekend with my child, so I texted her in the morning and asked her if she wanted to drop by my place to see me and celebrate her finishing her work after my son goes to bed at 9:00 last night. She said yes.  I was looking forward to seeing her all day.  We texted in the afternoon and everything seemed fantastic and then radio silence.  At 7:30, I told her I'd have my little one in bed by 9:00 and no response until 9:00, when she texts me and says she is too exhausted to drive safely.  

She then called me and told me that she went out and got too stoned with her friend and was not in a position to drive so she just needed to get some sleep and wake up early the next day.

I am a pot smoker too, and I enjoy smoking with her, so that's not an issue.

However, do you guys think it's a sign that she's irresponsible?  I feel as if I had plans with her and the tables were turned, that she would not be cool with me standing her up because I got too stoned with a friend and couldn't drive to her.  If she really wanted to see me, she could have taken an uber.

Putting myself in her shoes, if I were tired, I would take a nap instead of hanging out and smoking with a friend because I would want to save my energy for her.  It dismays me that she chose to cancel on me at the last minute and she definitely could have given me a heads up in advance.  

Everything about her seems amazing and we have so much in common.  I really like her a lot and want to spend as much time as possible with her and grow this relationship, but I am now feeling that it may be too one sided and I am leaning towards pulling back and away as a response to this last minute change of plans.

I took years off of dating, because I had 3 experiences IN A ROW with men on dating sites who ended up being either still married, engaged, or just plain cheaters.  All of whom claimed to want committed relationships.  At the time I was physically in very good shape.

So for a while, I let myself go, gained weight and too time off from dating.  When I decided to get back in the game, I still had extra weight on me.  Met two guys who were both living in their glory days - Also overweight but wouldn‚Äôt admit it, solid 5‚Äôs who turned out to be obsessed with women online who were absolute 10‚Äôs.  Gave up dating again for a while just disgusted.

Lost weight again and got in great shape.  Was constantly being hit on, cat called and men trying to randomly pick me up.  Not even flattering, because it feels disgusting when a man just wants you for your body.  Met a couple guys online and all they wanted to do was get in my pants.  So there goes the cycle and I gain weight again.

Now I want someone in my life, but feel awful about myself when I‚Äôm overweight.  I‚Äôd like to lose it, but apparently not enough to do something about it.  A little while ago, I heard neighbors behind me talking about ‚Äòtrying to get laid‚Äô and saying I was gross after I stood up from where I was sitting.  What a wonderful reminder about why it just seems like I can‚Äôt stand men.

I don‚Äôt mind being single and alone, but would love to meet a great guy.  All these past experiences make me just cringe thinking about trying.

Would love to hear similar experiences or advice.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mk4296/love_men_but_disgusted_by_dating_apps_and_men_in/

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù. I work out regularly. I‚Äôm attracted to someone who is 6‚Äô2‚Äù. All my life, I‚Äôm used to hearing jokes about my height. It doesn‚Äôt bother me not anymore. My ex boyfriends range from 5‚Äô3‚Äù to 5‚Äô10‚Äù.  With this new guy, we just talk about stuff. Not much. Anyway I was just wondering if tall guys are ever put off by short girls?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mk9klz/short_girls/

97,mk9nqo,1617586228,Dating Dress Code. How do you dress? How do you expect your date to dress?,"**Cloth has always been function-first for me.**  I was a T-shirt and jeans student, with one suit/tie in the closet for the job interviews.  Entering the corporate world, I got used to tailor-made suits and appreciated the functionality of button-suspenders.  I had an enormous collection of ties that I finally lightened during lockdown.  (Functional) business-casual attire would eventually trickle down to leisure/private life, along with the T-shirts and other swag from conference travel.  I did and do invest on performance clothing: comfort while being active outdoor is important to me.  **I never spent money on making myself look good for myself or my SO, except on wedding day**.  I stopped wearing fragrances more than twenty years ago, using scent-free shaving products.  I stopped going to the hair dresser when I was working near a beach and taking a dive almost daily after hours.  My ex would trim my hair every weekend.  Now I run the lawn-mower on my head and face once or twice a week.  I never wore jewelry and stopped wearing wristwatches (except diving computers) when flip-phones were able to remind me of time.  **Last month, I bought myself an outfit for the purpose of dating for the first time.**  I did not splurge.  I was never comfortable shopping for cloth.  I went to Costco.  A decent pair of Calvin Klein pants and a dress shirt to go with it.

**What do you do to dress yourself for a date?  And what do you expect from your date?**

* do you care for clothing / jewelry / phone / brands?
* what is your opinion on perfumes? do you wear them?
* watches / jewelry?
* how important are current brands and fashion for you, as opposed to brands and fashion from your earlier years?

**Where does good hygiene end and vanity start?**

* brushing/flossing teeth vs. whitening?
* hygiene products vs. perfumes?
* nails?
* facials/cosmetics?

99,mkafqk,1617588898,This probably was not fair of me but ..,"I (46F) chatting w 44m for a short period of time.  I guess for some stupid reason I sort of entrapped him. 
Because I am a moron today 

So I am attractive but my close friend is absolutely gorgeous. So, this guy and I have exchanged some pictures and my friend  is in one.  I commented on how beautiful she is.  I guess what I was hoping he would say ..... yes , I know !!!! That right there is the problem - I wanted him to say a particular thing ( bad on my part!!!!!). I wanted him to say yes she is very pretty but so are you . Which he basically said.   Then he said,  ‚Äúhow can she be single ‚Äú??  

Ya , that sorta lit the fuse. 

I said, ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know, but she is single and I can give you her number - maybe you guys will hit it off!‚Äù  I played like it was no big deal at all. He said ‚Äú you would just pass me on to her ‚Äú ?  I said, ‚Äú well if you guys both are into each other , what can I say ?  Ha ha ha ‚Äú   He says, ‚Äú oh, does she live in the same town as you ?‚Äù    

Anyway - I know this is super immature!!!!  I know this is stupid!!!! I know I sorta set him up!!!! It wasn‚Äôt going to go anywhere anyway!!!!  I was just in a feeling crappy about myself mood today and I just wanted him to make me feel better by saying , ‚Äú she is  beautiful, but I am interested in you‚Äù. Anyway, besides telling me how immature and stupid I am today ,(ALREADY AGREE ) anyone have thoughts on whether  what I was hoping for was totally reasonable to expect or wacky ?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mkafqk/this_probably_was_not_fair_of_me_but/
