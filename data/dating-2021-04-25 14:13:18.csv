0,myfafc,1619378122,Do any other ladies on dating apps have this problem?,"29F here I have a hard time meeting people who don't scream red flags. It's either ""I used to do heroine"" ""I used to be in prison""  ""I live in an RV behind my parents house without electricity"" and don't get me started on the amount of pedophiles I've met on dating apps. Why is it like this? I thought I met a good guy the other day we hit it off he tells me he owns his own business has his own place this and that then proceeds to tell me he has another personality named c and they ""argue sometimes"" and how he used to do heroine. I'm glad I video chatted with him to find all this out but what the fuck? I've been on and off dating apps for seven years now and these are the type of people I constantly meet and I don't know why. I'm pretty cute, have my own place, own my car, have a degree, a good paying job...like my life is together and yet these are the people that match with me. I've taken different approaches to my profile....different photos....I've tried everything and I guess creeps will be creeps but I'm really just getting to the point where I want to give up. I don't want to seem like a judgemental person like I do understand we all have baggage but it's not like these are just small things I can look over especially with the guy with MPD I was stalked by someone who had multiple personalities before for 10 years and I can't do it again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myfafc/do_any_other_ladies_on_dating_apps_have_this/
1,myfb1y,1619378173,There are immature women too,"I know this should be obvious but it took my third long term relationship ending for me to realize this. I’m a very understanding and patient guy. I like to laugh and have fun and share that with others. I ask a lot of questions as I’m naturally curious. I stand up for the people I care about and Im aware of my emotions and very much take responsibility for whatever hurts me.

I want, more than anything, for people (and hence my partner) to feel free to be themselves and feel safe enough to be honest. I never blamed others for my hang ups and confusions. All of these things were very much appreciated and admired in the relationships I’ve been in and I value these relationships for the growth and great times I’ve had with them.

However I’ve come to a realization that my easygoing attitude also made me too willing to negotiate with destructive mindsets that other people had and in the end, compromising and working with those mindsets seemed to be the problem that ended these relationships.

Here are some of the not-so-obvious beliefs I’ve come to realize is corrosive to trying to build intimacy with a woman, as a man. They likely apply vice versa and to LGBTQ+ gang as well. I hope that other guys can avoid stumbling into the trap of believing somethings wrong with them (or are weak/unworthy) for not being able to make the impossible work out.

1. The perceived sense that love or manliness (I can’t tell which) is “the act of sacrificing your happiness for another.” Basically, she only feels loved in Win-Lose situations and only gives love in Win-Lose situations. She believes if you don’t suffer you don’t love her and if you create a win win situation she doubts if you care. She will also point out (to prove her love) that she’s suffered by doing x y z that you thought she did out of genuine love and kindness which also sucks to hear as you’d rather she just didn’t do it.

2. The perceived sense that other people outside of her have a better sense of what is valuable or good for her. She tries to prove your a catch to her friends, she tells you about what her friend’s bf is doing, is easily influenced out of things she previously really wanted or is doing some kind of compare and contrast with you. She’s in a “race for the best life to her friends”, not for her happiness. She will believe you are making her lose her race to no where.

3. The perceived sense that she knows what you think and feel. She’s not gonna ask questions about where you’re coming from and will be reacting from perceptions of you that you can’t possibly keep up with. She either gonna be jumping to action to protect herself from you, jumping into action to punish you, letting distrust and resentment fester, or grow more emotionally distant. Regardless, it’s gonna hurt to even try to change her mind or prove to her otherwise, the longer it goes on.

4. The perceived sense that her happiness and safety are your responsibility. This isn’t to say it’s not in your interest or that you don’t want to add to these things at any opportunity you can. taking initiative on behalf of your partner feels good and is appreciated. However, if she’s dependent on/waiting for you to make her happy when she isn’t happy or feel safe when she doesn’t feel safe, she’s gonna believe it’s you messing up every time she feels like less than her best rather than do what she did before she met you to self-soothe. She will stop taking initiative for her own needs and stop asking for support gracefully (meaning with the acceptance and openness to a no).

5. The perceived sense that your emotions and feelings “say something” about her worthiness, value, or self-esteem. If you feel like you can’t actually express how you feel about things or that your words are being “watched” for how they apply to her, it’s likely because she takes how you feel about things very personally. You’re not the arbiter of worthiness. It’s nice if she wants to please you but if she’s feels totally destroyed by failing to make you happy, it’s a problem. You can’t dislike or disapprove of anything she does because she can’t handle it. It subtly undercuts your boundaries because she takes all your boundaries to mean something is wrong with her when it’s just a need you have personally.


But to boil all of those down, if she is not responsible for her own happiness and emotional peace of mind in her life, then she’s gonna blame you for the lack of it and leave you for a reason that has nothing to do with you while thinking it is. And if you’re like me, you will believe you were messing up or missing something and try to do it “right” when there was never a “right” way.

Im sure there’s more but these are ones I’ve experienced.

I’ve accepted that no one can *”make”* anyone else happy. Other people only do things that add to a happiness and appreciation that’s already there. I don’t want to be responsible for other people’s well-being. I don’t want my feelings and desires to be a means to an end to prove she is worthy or to make her feel validated. It’s toxic and really leaves you with no options to help even if you wanted to. I know because despite being very attuned to their emotional needs, their inability to ask for help, meant me being perfect with emotions that weren’t my own and it left me lost and confused about what I needed and what my boundaries were. It’s like being a referee and a goalie for a soccer game.

Unfortunately, it’s the women that need love and reassurance the most that push it away with their beliefs but if you try to give it to them you will only hurt yourself. You have to cut your losses and just leave those girls alone. If she doesn’t love her life in the present moment then she really has no way to love you, authentically.

Look for the girls who feels comfortable in her skin, understand what her needs are, and doesn’t idealize you as some happiness, worthiness, or entertainment ATM. She has to be okay and accepting of outright asking for reassurance or a listening ear or insight if that’s what she needs even if it’s scary and vulnerable.

If you have thoughts or something to add, I’d love to hear them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myfb1y/there_are_immature_women_too/
2,myfcq4,1619378304,What are your thoughts on this complete 180 from a Bumble date?," 

I'll try to keep this short and only highlight the main points (Ok, that didn't end up happening). I've accepted that moving on and focusing on myself is the only option here, but I'm wondering if anyone in this community might have some insight into what happened. Or if I dodged a bullet.

**TLDR: Had a few great dates with this woman from Bumble. She reached out to me whenever her schedule would open up. We saw each other 3 times in 8 days, and there seemed to be a lot of chemistry. After hooking up, she told me how much she liked me, and even invited me back inside the morning after. She shared a lot of personal things, and expressed that a guy hasn't made her feel this way in a long time. The next day, I woke up to a text from her that said she's really enjoyed our time together, but she is sorting through some things on her end and wanted to feel it out. She said she didn't see it going any further romantically, which is almost a complete 180 from what she told me two nights before. I'm moving on, it's been 3 weeks, but I still can't get her out of my head. None of it makes sense to me.**

I (30M) matched with a woman on Bumble (26F) a couple of months ago. After a few days of fun conversation, we agreed to meet up. It took a few more weeks for our schedules to come together, but we grabbed some drinks one Sunday afternoon. The date went well. There seemed to be a lot of chemistry, natural conversation, and a lot of laughs. I could tell she was a bit nervous, and she mentioned a couple of times how comfortable she felt. I paid for the drinks, because the waiter brought one check. She said that we could have split them if I wanted to. To which I replied, ""What about this? If you're interested in going on a second date with me, you can get our first round. Then we'll be even and won't have to bother the waiter."" She smiled and said that she'd like that.

Our second date ended up taking place at a park in the city. She asked if I liked hot toddies, and she (with the help of her roommate) fixed those up for us to take to the park. When I got to her place, there was some confusion about which house was hers (it was an whole duplex/carriage house/alleyway ordeal). She came around the front of the house to get me - because apparently I was standing on the wrong porch. She laughed and apologized, because her ""front door"" was in the alley. She expressed that she was happy and thought I was a gentleman for getting out of the car and coming up to the door (even if it was the wrong one). Apparently that's not common? Anyway, we had a great time at the park. We talked about a lot of random things - whatever came up - and what was going on in our lives. After the sun set, it started to get cold. So I drove her back to her place. We ended up chatting and hanging out for a little while. Her roommate and a friend came back and she felt a bit flustered/embarrassed that she chilling in my car. I didn't think anything of it. I thought that maybe she was embarrassed about going on a Bumble date. At that point she somewhat jokingly asked if I wanted to meet her roommate and everyone. I said, ""Yeah, I don't mind."" But that thought seemed to go away. We ended up hanging out for a little while longer and made out for a while more. I didn't push to go inside her house, because I thought that if she were comfortable with that, she would bring it up.

It is worth mentioning that our second date was originally scheduled the week after our first date on Sunday. Her Wednesday evening opened up, and she immediately reached out to me. So, our second date took place a few days after the first date. We continued talking daily, and things still seemed to be going well with her. On her way home on Easter, she gave me a call just to talk on her long drive home. But it was late at night and I was already in bed. So she left a voicemail. That following day, she asked me if I'd like to see her (we had a date planned for Tuesday). I was free, so I took her up on that offer.

The third date was sort of casual. We were originally going to ride bikes and go to a few spots around the city. I had a few things with work that pushed things back a bit. It was going to be too dark to ride bikes, so we agreed to meet at her place and go to one of her favorite bars nearby. It was a good time. The conversation and chemistry much like the first two dates. When we got back to her place, she didn't hesitate when asking if I wanted to come in. She mentioned that her roommate is pretty much like her sister, so introducing me to her would be a big deal. I was all for it. Her roommate was cool. We had a good time hanging out, watching the last bit of the NCAA championship. Earlier that evening, we took care of putting the roommate's new puppy down for a nap in her crate, and talked about how that went. Once the roommate went off to bed, she immediately climbed on top of me and started making out. At this point, it was getting pretty late. At one point, she sat up and stared at her door --- to backtrack, when I first walked into her place that evening, she jokingly pointed at her room and said ""you don't get to see that yet."" --- Then she mentioned that it might be more comfortable in her room. I said, ""Yeah, why don't we take this in there?"" But she was still contemplating. It took her a few minutes to decide. She had me wait outside, because her room was messy and she had to shove a bunch of things into her closet (lol). When she came back out, she grabbed me by the hand, led me into her room, and told me that she would be right back. She came back in several minutes later and climbed back on top. Essentially, here's the high level of what happened from there:

* We had sex a few times throughout the night. The first time started off great, but there were some complications. It had been over a year since I had been with someone, with the pandemic and all, and I really liked this girl. So there might have been a bit of performance anxiety. I could tell that she took it personally. So I went down on her until she came. That seemed to clear things up.
* During the second time, things were going well. All of a sudden she said that she needed me to pull out. I stopped altogether, thinking I had hurt her. No, she just said that, while she insinuated earlier that she was on birth control, she actually wasn't.
* The third time we were going at it, I don't know what came over her, but she started crying. She said she had a flashback and shared a very painful experience with me. So, that pretty much killed the mood. I stood up to get a glass of water, and she asked me if I would stay a while. She must have thought that I was about to leave after that.
* We cuddled for a bit and started talking. She mentioned that she had never had anyone go down on her before. She mentioned that, usually, she lets ""lets guys take what they want and then leave."" I wasn't entirely sure how often this happened. She talked about going on one other Bumble date a while back, but said the guy was boring. She obviously hadn't planned for this either, because she wasn't exactly groomed. I didn't mind. It was just obvious that she didn't expect it. But she did ask if I expected to hookup that night. I didn't assume that it was happening, but I was prepared. She also talked about how nervous she is before she sees me. She says that no one has made her feel the way that I've made her feel in a long time. She says that the moment she sees me, all of those nerves go away and she feels comfortable around me.
* Finally, everything clicked the fourth time. The sex was great. We both finished. At one point, she yelled, ""I need you, X!"" I didn't think much of it. We all yell things during sex.

The next morning, we walked to go get coffee. We walked around the block, still talking about random things. Everything seemed just as great as it had been for the past two weeks. When we got to her place, she asked if I wanted to come in. I told her that I wanted to, but I had to get home to finish something for work before noon. We kissed each other goodbye, and that was the last time that I saw her.

We texted a bit throughout the day. I sat down that night and planned our next date. I wanted it to be special. The next morning, I woke up to this text:

""Hey X, I slept on this and want to stay honest with you. I've really enjoyed getting to know you. I like how easy you are to talk to and how comfortable I feel around you, but I just don't see this going any further romantically. Thank you for a fun few dates, and good luck with the job stuff! I know you'll land something amazing soon."" (for context, I lost my job during the pandemic. I'm currently a freelancer/sub-contractor) I told her that I was surprised and a bit confused. She said ""I know and I'm sorry.""

She had left her gloves in my car, so I dropped them off at the end of the week. I attached a note that included a few things that I wanted to say. The next day, she responded to all of it. She reiterated that I didn't do anything wrong, and that she needs to figure some things out on her end.

So, I've accepted that there's nothing that I can do here. I still struggle to get over this almost-relationship, though. I don't understand what happened. She still follows me on Instagram (not sure why). I think that it's difficult because I felt a connection that I haven't felt in a while, and thought that this was going somewhere. It's almost as the real pain is coming from not having a chance at this relationship; as opposed to having a relationship that just didn't work. I just thought I'd post my story in here to see if anyone might have another perspective or gone through something similar.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myfcq4/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_complete_180_from/

4,myfi71,1619378721,Instagram ends up being a big dealbreaker in my disadvantage,"Hey guys
27, male

So after almost 10 years of Tinder, for some reason always after that a girl sees my Instagram things change. 

The girl looses interest, stop talking, and all that kind of behavior. 

Im a 6-7/10 beauty guy, im not a creep, i have many pictures with my dog, trips, books. 
I have fixed stories of music, movies, my dog, me watching sports, me hanging around the dinner places in town. 

I do not smile at pictures because i look weird if i smile, and i have about only two pictures with my male friend from when we go out. I have pictures in night clubs in fact. 

I dont know if the lack of smile is that much of a dealbreaker to give me more than 300 failures, or the lack of friends, but im tired of the failure on getting a girlfriend. 

Im tired of spending my birthday and holidays alone (obviously even before COVID), of being let alone because my friends have new better friends, because they get a girlfriend to spend time with. 

Tired of spending one hour working on the best possible selfie and get three fcking likes always. 

Tired of friday nights and weekends without a single soul to talk to, or a person to have one freaking hug and watch a movie together. 

I have been ghosted two times after months of talks with different girls at different times, one got tired of me and blocked me and the other from my college stopped answering after 6 months and still posts stuff and moves on without even unfollowing me. She even sees my stories. But wont answer me in no way. We had plans together in fact. She probably met some cool guy in her job. 


God, i had a dream tonight where some random pretty girl in my class was into me and we flirdted. The feeling of touching her arm in the dream was the best moment i had in months (months ago was similar dreams giving me these warm good feeling too). 

Anyway, i dont know whats the thing with my instagram but im here to read your opinion.

6,myfovi,1619379235,Attitude Seems to Work Against Tardiness in Girl's Responses,"Obviously it would be better if the technique I am going to describe did not need to be employed anyways.  I just use it as a last ditch effort to keep the convo alive before I write them off or unmatch them.  

The scenario I am describing is whenever you make the last statement or ask a question that never gets answered.  Naysayers may say hey maybe your question or statement isn't enticing or interesting to the girl so she decided to ignore it.  Ok fair, objective is to allow the conversation to continue so maybe my technique helps in doing that and I speak from experience.

I would say something along the lines of:

**""Oh I guess your not that into this kind of thing""**

**""I suppose what I said doesn't really entice you""**

**""oh well, I thought you'd be intrigued""**

Interestingly I have gotten back responses like:

**""haha sorry! I've been on vacation!""** or **""I don't hang out on the apps very much""**

then they try to re-engage.

Again when I am putting out these statements, I am under the intention that this will be my last message to them if they don't respond.  I'd give them 1-2 days and if hear nothing, unmatch them immediately.  Also its key to know how long is too long not to get a response.  If a day or two goes by I am not going to use the line above.  For me its been a timeframe close to a week.  I have never gotten any negative responses from it either, its been more along the lines of the girls being apologetic.

9,myg5ec,1619380535,"In the post-#MeToo era, women really need to be the ones making the first move in straight relationships","I just want women to see things from a man's perspective here. As a man, I've been put in a situation where I feel that I always need to be extremely cautious about initiating anything with a woman I am interested in and who I feel may be interested in me. And yet, literally every woman I've been with (either for dates or hookups) has expected me to initiate any kind of physical contact, even cuddles and handholding.

The best example of this is a friend of mine who I met on Tinder but she insisted from the start that she was just looking for friends. We had friendly conversations for months but eventually she started calling me cute and stuff like that. One Saturday, we met up at her school and then went for drinks, and when we got back to her dorm she told me ""fuck man just make a move"" and seemed pretty frustrated. Like how the f am I supposed to make sense of that mixed messaging when you tell me you're not interested in dating me but then proceed to flirt with me? And then when I told my ex about this situation, she said that I definitely have a problem with not initiating enough, and that was just another example of it.

So my message to women is this: your frustration with creepy and pervy men is justified as there are way too many of them in this world, and I sympathize with all of you who have experienced sexual harassment and assault. But the way in which you still expect men to initiate everything helps feed this dynamic of men being sexually aggressive.

As a man, making a move on a woman you are interested in is a massive risk. We risk losing our friendships, being accused of harassment or assault, and feeling incredibly shitty about our actions. As a woman, making a move on a guy you are interested in only risks embarrassment at most. This is because of the unfortunate power dynamic between men and women in our society. I know that if a female friend of mine I'm not interested in makes a move on me, all that would happen is I would do is say I'm not interested. I wouldn't feel threatened, and would keep being her friend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myg5ec/in_the_postmetoo_era_women_really_need_to_be_the/

12,mygcds,1619381074,Moving forward from highschool to collage with my (F17) partner (M17) of two years!,"I don't exactly know the reason for my post, but I just wanted to share. Maybe a gratitude? 

I am (F17) a junior (11th grade) in highschool and the time is coming to where I have to decide what I am going to do. I have thought a lot on this all and I believe as of now I want to become a therapist. I would get a bachelor's degree in psychology or social work, and then will continue to get my master's in a specialized field of theapry. I am planning on getting my associates at a community college near me, and then transfer to a public collage after to finish my bachelor's. Then, I will either, continue at the school, or look for one that offers a better masters program in the specialized field I am looking for. I am considering Relationship Conculing or Mental Illness feilds for OCD, ADD, etc.... 


I am currently in a relationship with my partner (M17) of 2 years and I want to continue our relationship through out collage. Our plans for life, as of now, are that we will find an apartment together right out of highschool and we will stay there for two to four years depending on if I switch to a different collage bachelor's program or not. He doesn't want to go to collage, but instead start his own smithing business. He will work in the meantime, making most of our income for rent, food, bills, etc ... He will also be saving for his dream business and materials during this time and working on his craft. If he chooses to go to collage, no big deal, we can figure something out. I work regularly as well. 

Towards the end of my bachelor's degree my partner is planning on moving out to another state. This state has more materials for smithing, space, and availability. This state is also beautiful and our dream to live in for a while, as we love the outdoors. This state also provides a perfect collage matching my needs for a masters degree. My partner will be in this state without me for about 6 months to a year. We plan to visit hopefully once or twice a month and to be at least engaged by then. The reason we are doing this alone is because we both want to experience what it feels like to be truly independent at least once in our lives. When we discussed this idea of being long distance for that long I started to cry. I honestly also hate the idea of being away from him like that and for that long. I think I will enjoy the independence for a week or two, but then I'll miss him more then anything. I think the independence I really think I want more then anything is to just be away from my parents. 

Him and I have gone through highs and lows, and we do have our differences by similarities. I love this man immensely and he's literally been the greatest joy and occisnal pain (in the good ways 😂). He's taught me not only about love but myself, and I have become more of the person I am because of him. Yes, I think independence is important, but I sometimes just can't get that man out of my head. We refused to date each other at first because we both thought we where to werid, but now we are two pees in a pod. He's been the greatest gift I could ask for. I regret the way I treated him at first though, we both do, because we had childhood truama that showed and we took time to heal it. 

Not sure what this post means. I'm worried because we are just highschool, as everyone says. I'm worried because we're young. I don't know what this all means, but I hope someone enjoys it or shares their similar stories.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mygcds/moving_forward_from_highschool_to_collage_with_my/

This past week, Ive become really frustrated by online dating because it seems like just about every girl treat the men they match/talk with poorly. Mostly in the sense of ghosting/leading people on/using men for validation, and I see this sentiment echoed alot. 

Ive met alot of girls in the last 8 months since I became single. Ive met some wonderful girls but no one that has clicked deeply for me. I never treat anyone poorly. I communicate clearly, I never lie about my intentions, try to genuinely get to know people, and most of all, of the girls that I have broken off with, I ALWAYS make a point to tell them why Im ending it, usually by phone call (and never something shallow like ""Im just not attracted to you"")

However, of the times its ended not by me, it has literally ALWAYS either been one of the 3:
- Good conversation followed by an abrupt stoppage (most likely the girl was just using me as validation and stopped talking when she found another)
- Being led on / lied to (ie- ""Im down for XYZ, Ill let you know!"") 
- Just straight up ghosted after a date or two

Ive always loved and respected women stemming from a strong relationship with my mom and sister. But it seems like certain women on dating apps treat men like literal objects and do not care in the slightest about how they hurt people. For some reason its always the girls I feel I have the best connection with that ghost or lead me on the hardest. Part of me thinks that because women on average get so many more matches than guys, they stop valuing us as people.

So in an attempt to quell my emotional boo-boos, Id love to hear some shitty experience women have gone through at the hands of shitty men. PLEASE dont include stories of sexual assault/harrassment, those arent men, they are cowards.

She was around 6 years older than me. I thought I was asking around a fair amount of questions and doing a good job of giving her space to speak. She definitely shared more than I did and talked way more than me, as I’m generally a quiet person. We were talking about sweet potatoes for some reason and she started talking about why she doesn’t like them, so I threw in the reason I did like them and she got visibly annoyed and like her ego was hit. Was trying to playfully debate or just have an interesting conversation, compared to the usual interview style back and forth. This happened again later on in the conversation and she passive aggressively threw in “I’m talking about myself” when I tried adding to the conversation. Now I can’t stop and feel like I redirect conversations back to myself or give this air of self-absorption or if it was just her. Lol This has never happened to me so now I can’t help wondering if it’s me or her. Also, when I went to go pay for the drinks and meal there was no offer to pay and she was on her phone visibly distracted. When I brought up I was going to pay.

So, last night, my best friend of years [25F, platonic] called me up asking me to hang out. She put her friend [21MtF] on the phone, who straight up said I was cute and asked me out on a date. I told her my availability and the three of us hung out at her place. There was another couple [M][F] but they left soon.

She was extremely interested. I was too. I brought alcohol and all three of us got drunk. We played some music and she and I did some dirty dancing and some making out. She was flirting with me hard, and joked about being my girlfriend and such. I probably could have taken things farther but I didn't want to make things awkward for my friend. Plus, the implications of having sex with a drunk person...

Towards the end of the night, though, she straight up gave me the silent treatment (we were still drunk). She was cool talking to my friend but not me. Even my friend was confused by what was going on. After I left, my friend said that I said ""something to make her [girl of interest] angry but she doesn't remember what"".

This morning, apparently, my friend texted me. Said girl apparently feels ""heartbroken"" and as though I wasn't interested, even though I was.

20,myh1uh,1619383111,It's a Trap!! (Long read),"  Evening all, been a member here for a while but this is my first post.

  So I (30M) have never had a girlfriend for a number of reasons, mainly bullying / abuse in school and lack of opportunity since lol. So I thought I'd give tinder a go over lockdown, after all I had bugger all to do and nothing to lose.

So swiping left and right for a couple of months and surprise surprise no matches. FML, who said this crap was easy? Anyway eventually get a match with what I personally considered to be a stunning Asian woman.

As we're coming to the end of lockdown we strike up conversation hobbies, likes / dislikes the normal stuff as you feel out a new person to see what they're like. This continued for a few weeks, the conversations starting to develop and get deeper etc.

Fast forward a bit and she begins telling she invests in the stick market and crypto currency, ok fair enough. Then she starts telling me I should invest, so I research the app she mentioned and it's legit etc and seems okay so I checked it out a bit as I'd been considering this long before coming across her profile.

So then we get to today. And she messages me saying she'll teach me how to use the app. Fair enough it's not the simplistically designed bit of kit so I say yes. So as we're going through this whole process she starts mentioning you'll have to put X amount in to make it worth it. I'd previously mentioned I'd lost my job because of covid and was on jobseekers so the most I was willing to do was £30 to begin and see how it goes. So we go through the whole process and she then sends me a link to another crypto wallet which seemed weird as the previous app has one built in.
   It's at this point I started getting a bit weirded out and suspicious. So I say I'll have a look at my finances and get back to her later. So I decided to look up tinder investment scams and sure enough up it pops. I didn't even know this was a thing? So basically what they do is either pay an Asian girl to be a front woman or just steal pictures from Asian social media sites and set up accounts and play the field trying to see who they can get. Little more digging and come across a description of what they generally do and it was a perfect match for what happened to me. They move the conversation to WhatsApp or Facebook. Usually they 'own' a salon or similar and have a rich uncle or father. They express an interest in investing and say they'll teach you how and then guide you into transfering the investment over to them. Apparently it's quite common but little known due to the embarrassment factor because men don't want to admit they were played. 

Well folks I was played, well and truly.

Fortunately I got suspicious before anything left my control but bugger me what a way to find out about this. 

I'm sharing this to raise awareness about this and to also ask  are there others out there who've had this happen to them, how do you get past it? Any suggestions for alternative dating platforms, etc. Any constructive advice welcome.

I agreed and immediately asked for his Venmo right on top, he said it’s fine I was like no, I need to pay you for the medicine you dropped off. So I Venmo him the medicine money, and if he dropped off any food or breakfast for me, i immediately sent the Venmo to him without him asking me. 

Later on I told him I am looking for something casual , that’s when he wanted to go the hotel. The first two hotel times ( he reserved he initiated) he never asked me to split anything. And we continuously to see each other and we would go on dates even without sex. But the thing is I do want to move things further with him but doesn’t know how to initiate it because I had always put my focus on work and had always been busy with work. So we met up only once or twice a week.

Now he all of a sudden texted me and asking me to split the Wingstop check, and the hotel. I am ok with that except...I was confused why he didn’t asked me to do half and half before hand? I had my card with me the whole time, why didn’t he say something when we were at the Wingstop? Why didn’t he say something about the hotel reservation? ( which btw he strongly initiated, I even said we should cancel it because he could just come over. He refused and said he really wants to go to the hotel indoor pool and let me give him swimming lessons etc)

After our first date, I wasn’t sure I wanted to see him again. He is a very rich and successful business man, but was pretty arrogant the very first time I saw him, being a bit rude to the waiter and spending extravagant amounts of money which turned me off at first. But after that date, he continued to ask me out until I finally said yes. Once I got to know him better, I saw the person he is underneath the front he puts up to everybody else. He is sensitive and emotional, he even cried in front of me one night revealing a lot about his past and losses he has been through he tells no one about. He revealed that his past trauma has led to his struggles with alcohol and cocaine use, and smoking cigarettes. While at first something like this would have pushed me away, I wanted to continue to support him and be there for him and pursue a relationship because I like the person he was inside. He can be quite rude and arrogant sometimes, expecting money to fix the smallest inconveniences. While it irritated me, I also was jealous he had such power and control over every aspect of his life. I feel as if he did have a bit of a power complex, not feeling like he should be expected to do things that other guys would do in a relationship, like pick a woman up for a date or walk her to her car at the end of the night. Whenever I asked him to do something like this, he would laugh or complain. But I was still drawn to him. I liked our deep conversations and that he revealed a side of himself to me that I don’t think anybody else typically sees. He is surrounded by people just like himself most of the time (rich and successful partiers). We continued to go on dates for the next two months after that but just this past week he ghosted me out of nowhere.

I texted him once I got home and he replied, but then once I replied to him he never responded again. It’s been five days now. I’m very confused and hurt.

I moved on swiftly as it’s not the first time that’s happened so I thought another one of these. 

Later met this new guy 27(m) Call him J. We got on so well too I’ve known him for a month now. Long story short I went on 3 dates, he has to suddenly have heart surgery soon got the news before 3rd date, we said we want to carry on dating regardless. He had to move back home with his mum 5 hours away where he will recover and I said I’m fine with still dating and making it work. 

We still spoke and after two weeks of not seeing him I went to where he lives where he told his mum he’s met a girl and she kindly let me stay over for two nights. She was so lovely and welcoming, met his stepdad, and they were both so lovely and it couldn’t have gone any better. We both said how crazy it is I’ve just driven 5 hours for someone I don’t know and done all that but I guess it felt right and we were both comfortable and it was so nice to see eachother again. 

I won’t see him now till after surgery maybe a months time? And I’m in final year uni so can focus on that too! Then see him again,  we both say things like when I next come back etc. So indicates he still wants to continue. 

As I was leaving his, I see a message from B, he ‘accidently’ sent me an insta post and then proceeded to say miss u. I said you don’t but hope you’re well. He asked how I was and I just said good etc. He said something flirtatious and I said I’m seeing someone new now.  And he respected that but just told me how he freaked out and thought he messed up something good with me. 

I think just the inner nice person in me feels bad for B even though I shouldn’t. I was nice and said hey look like you’re great we had good times and things but yeah I don’t wanna disrespect J and go on a date. 

We wished eachother the best but I started to cry as I texted it, I guess it brought back memories and I feel bad for crying I guess? But maybe that’s normal. I think what I have with J is something good, he’s also more emotional mature, he didn’t freak out when I asked serious questions and I think I would be silly to mess it up

This isn’t to say personality doesn’t matter. It does matter a lot, but looks outweigh that by a ton.

From ages 16 to 21 I got no action because of how ugly and overweight I was. I was a KHHV and I even dipped my toe in inc*l ideology. Not even other ugly fat girls wanted me. I had on multiple occasions girls that were 200+ tell me they only liked skinny guys and guys that were in shape. 

Eventually I decided I was done being fat and hit the gym 2 times a day for 3 years. Now I’m 23 and I’m hot. Girls instantly started noticing me. Even girls that had rejected me in the past wanted me. I was the same person, same personality, I still love staying in and playing video games and junk food, but I keep my figure. Now these girls that rejected me want me.

Now I know people are going to say, “of course appearance matters it’s the ticket to entry, but personality is much more important for keeping people from hating you”.

Now let me tell you a something. I ran a-fucking-muck when I got attractive. I was still in college and I joined a frat and began some serious scumbag behavior. I would tell girls I wanted to be in a relationship get them to come over for sex and all but ghost them. I kept a rotation of girls I called for booty calls. I would literally throw girls out minutes after sex. Guess what? Hardly any cared. They all knew I was a douche but they didn’t care enough to stop seeing me.

I was playing them and they did not give a single fuck because I was hot. They were willing to put up with shitty behavior and an awful person just because I was hot. Many of them tried to convince me to be exclusive with them. I would laugh in their faces and they still kept fucking me.

I know the most common answer would be that I'm ""only 18 and have plenty of time"" but in all honesty I don't think that's true, I can't and have pretty much never had any female attention, I also see my social skills declining more by the day after many attempts at improving it through self help books like How to Win Friends and Influence People but it only lasted so long, I felt like I was just being too textbook and attempting to be socially perfect. All my mates manage to do it with ease and never try and give me a helping hand or suggest me to anyone which has me thinking do I come off a certain way to them.

I'm getting more and more bitter, angry and envious, I fucking hate it but feel like I cant do anything about it. I'm developing a shit attitude/perspective towards women which is pathetic of me. The more I think about it the more it eats me inside and reinforces the perspective, I can't help but think I need to become a certain way or develop a certain attitude to change this. Also seems baffling to me how a few tweaks in attitude would change this grand problem I seem to think I have. (After some research of how I'm feeling it seems I could be drastically ruminating)

I'm 6'3 pretty well built look after myself and have a decent paying job and fully independent (I always assumed these would be the foundation for women wanting to get to know you as it show being a competent and solo man but now it seems I was being foolish, I mean, why would it be? It's the bare minimum). I regularly exercise at the gym or just go for runs on my off days, I've read books like no more Mr Nice Guy and they've helped me have a better understanding. But I don't feel like I'm a nice guy either. I just struggle with serious amounts of toxic shame and guilt for god knows fucking what. All though my job pays me alright the hours are a pain (12 hour security night shifts alone 6pm-6am Friday to Monday). I feel isolated and distant from everyone and my rumination and negative thinking is worse because I'm constantly by myself.

I also can't shake the perspective of what's the point of any of it, it's seems to be a very costly pleasure that I don't think I could cope. I know it's due to being to sensitive but it seems nothing helps. But seems to be all I want/think about its affecting other areas of my life and I'm becoming careless of them because I'm lacking with women. Just getting a grip and taking action seems to be the final conclusion I come to (No shit right?)

Guys I dated show huge interest initially, but they would bail when it comes to the decision time. And I am those type of person who takes time to open up &amp; wouldn't have sex early on (1-3 dates) but wouldn't necessarily tell someone up front about it b/c I feel like that's a turnoff. Some of the guys I dated said I am a high maintaince (although I am not, tbh..) and one guy I dated said he gets easily intimated by my background and look. 

It really feel sucks to be treated like an ice cream forever and I do want to find someone for long term. I am venting but also wanted to get some advice on it. Anyone who felt like this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myif1d/guys_always_find_me_as_icing_on_the_cake/

I got a fairly strong vibe that she is still into me, and she said she wants to meet up and 'take it slow to see what happens' but 'needs a little time' because she's heading back to work and needs to get organized for that. Said she'd let me know but that was 8/9 days back and nothing. Not checked in since then because I'd rather just see people in person.

46,myja9r,1619389678,21 and 20 year old relationship advice. Kinda confusing but I wanna stay together she’s thinking about breaking up,"


I need some advice. So my girlfriend and I have been talking for 8 months I would say now. We get along well and act the same. Like it’s always a nice to see her either if we are relaxing or going out. It’s just nice. So one day my girlfriend go out of New Years with our fiends. She has a friend named Payton and Payton is a narcissist bad. But I never thought she would turn on me. So Payton wanted to invite this girl Emma over to hang with us. I don’t like Emma because Emma tried to get my gf to break up with me and trying to say I cheated. So I just never wanted to be by Emma for her trying to ruin a good relationship. So I told Payton respectfully that I didn’t wanna see Emma and I didn’t want her to come. She of course freaks on me and we start arguing in the car. But I’m not going to lie I was pretty chill until she started to yell at me. So I just wanted to go home but I was also getting mad that my gf wasn’t backing me up or telling her friend to chill out. But she hates conflict so she gets nervous. So finally I’m just giving my gf a earful about not backing me up. Then she like saying what was I suppose to do it’s your argument but I was thinking in my head like “it’s your friend who started it” but so anyways I black out and I’m just saying mean stuff to my gf that night. She wanted to take me home but then I realized I was drunk and just angry and needed to chill out. So I did. I felt guilty the next day for being mean to her. So I told her sorry and I would never do that again in my life and I didn’t for the last 3 months and I still was cool with Payton and my gf hanging out. Just as long as I didn’t go because  I know Payton and i will argue. So Payton had her bday my gf doesn’t really wanna go but she does anyways because it’s her friend. So she tells me she’ll pick me up at 10:30 but she stayed longer because Payton kept hitting her low points and calling my gf out for not wanting to stay later in front of the whole party. She knows my gf hates conflict and wasn’t going to stand up for herself. So it gets worse and Payton takes my gf phone. I’m just at home waiting to see if she’s gonna get me or if I should wait. So Payton eventually takes my gf phone again and text me saying if you wanna see tori again you better come by or you won’t see her until 3. So I’m like wtf so I’m really angry but I told my gf when I made that promise I wouldn’t get angry so I chilled out and drove over there. Walked in and i was so proud of myself I didn’t get mad at anyone. I just seen my gf and she was sad and Payton narcissistic self acted like nothing happened. So my gf is like I wanna go and I told her let’s just wait and she’ll maybe give it back. We are there until 12:30 now with no phone. Gf talks to her other friend and I guess Payton told people she gave back her phone but didn’t. So my gf other friend mask gets it back and we go. Payton of course makes a big sense and then calls my gf on the phone after. She was calling me trash and mean mean names and my gf didn’t even say anything to back me up she just listened. I was hurt but I know she just had to work on that part of being protective. But it sat in my mind for a while and I started to feel like I didn’t like my gf because of her not getting my back. So I started to think she was unattractive and stuff. I felt distant and I’m open so I told her everything about how I was feeling to her. Hoping she would understand but I told her I just have to work on the way I’m feeling and find my love again. But I didn’t wanna break up because there’s really no point I’m just feeling off. But I think it rub off on her because now she’s feeling how I was. Just negative thoughts about not being in it. Almost the same thing I was thinking when I was going through it. But now I found my love for her and she’s losing that love for me. She’s really just focusing on that night when I was being rude to her. She said it just sits in her brain. And she’ll over think it. But to me I don’t get it back Payton took her phone and was making her looking bad in front of people. But she won’t hold a grudge on that? She says it’s because I mean more to her so what I say matters. But idk I feel lost now like I gained my love for her but now she’s at the point we’re I was at. I try to give her tips and stuff and she says she does them. But like idk why she can’t find that love in me and now I won’t even snap like that again. Like shoot ive proven it to her already that I’m better so idk. I really feel like my anxiety that I had towards her rub off on her and now she’s just focusing on that one thing and doing it to me.

A bit after i started having doubts, we began to have heated arguments weekly about simple things that we did, such as forgetting to turn a light off or taking a wrong turn while driving. After one argument, she didn't talk to me for a few days. I was frustrated, confused, and stressed. I made an impulsive decision and ended up talking to an ex over text. At first, I just wanted to talk to someone to take my mind off of it, but the conversation soon turned explicit, and I said some things that I am not proud of. two days later, My girlfriend came to my house with flowers and food, and she brought me as well as herself to tears telling me how much she loved me and that she wanted to work on our relationship, and quit getting worked up over petty things. I immediately decided that i would not text my ex again. For three months, we had been great. No arguments, and i began to truly love her, and saw a side of her that made me feel like she was the right person for me at that moment. Yesterday, I gave her my phone in the car to let her queue up songs on Spotify. this time, she opened my messages, and found the correspondence with my ex. She obviously confronted me, and I explained the situation, but there was nothing I could say to make her feel better. I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, I know that I should have been truthful with her and told her what i had done, and I should have had enough of a backbone to to tell her that I was falling out of love with her 8 months in. I feel like a degenerate. I guess we live and learn.

if anyone could provide resources/strategies to deal with guilt, ways to reconcile with her, or any source that might help someone in my position, I would appreciate it.

Still, does anyone else find that you “fit” better with certain people, and that the cuddling is easier with some people? Anyone know why this is, if this is a thing?

I remember dating someone I thought was terrible and not very nice. He was very athletic and super tall (8pack and everything), so I thought it would be uncomfortable, but he was so good at cuddling. It felt amazing.

Then I dated someone I had an emotional connection with- same height as the last one, slightly softer build- and it was unbearably uncomfortable. Like we kept shifting but our bodies could not fit together for the life of us. It was actually so bothersome for us that we didn’t bother.

Now I just got out of something where he was an amazing cuddler, he just fits against my body. I could fall asleep holding him or in his arms. It just felt right. I kind of always thought cuddling would just be good no matter what, but I’ve been finding that it seems to differ wildly without any rhyme or reason.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myjw36/cuddling_question/

55,myjzx1,1619391898,need some help and advice on a horrible situation *TW SA*,"Ok. I've been dating my bf a year, I'm 21 and so is he. 

Before dating me, he was dating a girl who would send him pictures of a gun and tell him how she was cheating on him (not nice at all). He broke up with her and moved back him with his siblings and his mother, in agreeance to help out with his family as his mum is too mentally ill to work, drive etc. 

Long story short, one night, him and his brother's girlfriend sent flirty messages and then ended up sleeping together. He says alcohol and weed was involved and they were both over the age of 18 (the age of consent is 16 here).

They both tried to hide this, until his brother found out and when he did, his mother kicked him out of the house and his family essentially disowned him. This happened a couple of months ago whereas the actual incident was 2y ago. When he got kicked out, he told me at the time what happened and said if I wanted to dump him, he would understand. I didn't dump him, as the situation did not involve me, but is something to be aware of.

Skip to now. Last week, his mother decided to message MY PARENTS about my boyfriend, telling them he is a dangerous individual, has hit her and his 15 year old brother - which has NOT come up on police records after requesting a check, alongside the fact he had a DBS check for his job. She sat and told my parents about the fact he 's\*xually assaulted' his brother's girlfriend, before this turning into r\*pe a few days later according to his brother. His mother proceeded to call my parents and tell them he is manipulative. His brother proceeded to tell my parents my boyfriend has a substance abuse problem; my boyfriend had told me when he was younger had used dr\*gs but did not anymore and has not for a while (other than weed which I don't care about).

My parents reacted emotionally to this and were surprised when I said I knew of the alleged incident but I had been told it was a drunken mistake, which I think it was but obviously I now question that. They responded by locking my car keys in the safe, telling me I should dump him immediately. 

They told me they think I am being manipulated and that I am not reacting like I would do. They do not respect my decisions, despite me talking to them and asking them to please let me come to my own decisions as I am an adult. They proceed to tell me how they can't sleep, eat, feel sick with worry - I live in their house and I'm not going to run away, which I made clear to them, I am safe as long as I am home with them.

I told them that I need to find out the truth to this story and wait and see if the story goes to the police/courts to find out the truth. 

Not once have I ever felt threatened by my boyfriend; he has been nothing but loving and supportive to me, telling me to put my degree and my future first and to do what's right for me, that he will always be there to support me. I am very, very aware at when I am being manipulated and I will always question things that don't add up. I do not understand why he would sit there and say he will prove text messages were sent by requesting the log from the service provider, and that he will stand up in court to defend himself if he has too. 

I do not understand why his mother would wait almost 2 months to tell me that her son is allegedly such a dangerous man to be around, nor why she would invite me to stay despite these past assaults on her and his brother being 2-3y ago. I do not understand why she would not message me, but my parents instead. I have spoken to her before so it wasn't like I was unknown to her.

I do believe people can change and I do not believe he is capable of r\*pe. I do believe that if someone is very dangerous, you would surely not kick them out, but call the police on them instead in light of discovering what they have done, especially when it is serious. 

I can't help but feel I am being treated like a child here. Not only by his mother talking to my parents and not me, but by my parents going on and on at me to 'dump this man' and asking me why I choose to have feelings for someone with 'such a past'. I told them I am going to be sensible about this and talk to who I need to, to find out the 'truth', but I see no reason to suddenly leave my boyfriend for what could just be an exaggeration of the truth.

69,myl7vr,1619395905,Feel like by the time I’m sure i know what I want Ive found a way to mess things up,"So, right now i’m in college and i’ve mostly been sticking to casual stuff like hookups and friends with benefits. Though, I tend to be really cautious with showing too much interest because I’m not sure how much i’m willing to get into with someone. I don’t want to lead someone on if i’m not sure I want a relationship or to be consistent fwbs, but usually by the time I actually know for certain what I want the lack of showing interest ruins things. 

To make it more difficult, directly asking what someone wants can make things weird often so I have to try and figure out what they’re looking for while I’m not even sure yet what I want myself sometimes. Maybe i’m putting too much pressure on making a move right away if I do something, but that seems to be what’s expected from my experience.

Anyway, I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice or if i should just not hold back showing interest for fear of giving the wrong idea and leading someone on. Also, i’ve lately been feeling like i might be open to a relationship if it’s the right person, but the only girl I would’ve actually gone that way with doesn’t really respond since i didn’t show enough effort.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myl7vr/feel_like_by_the_time_im_sure_i_know_what_i_want/

Both since our breakup we were sexually not active and both miss it, she said she is looking for friends with benefits and so am in. Almost every weekend she goes to the local shack with her girlfriends where are also boys where she just enjoys her time and drink alcohol.

Since her breakup about 7 months ago she has only kissed 2 boys, 1 recent after breakup and 1 like 2 weeks ago. The most recent one was her elemtary school crush. After kissing she saw him more times but nothing happend from both sides.

Yesterday i met with her we did beauty facial mask in her bedroom, we went to the city to shop, ate at the water with sunset. We met from 14:00 till 22:00. She asks me how it is going with the ladies and i ask her the same ofcourse. She keeps saying hard times because no contact with boys. I know couple boys who are trying her but she doesn't like them and is looking for FWB (so am i:P)

If you made it this far here is the question:

Indeed i do enjoy being with her and she does to i guess, both since we broke up with our relation we miss sexual contact but are not interested in having a relation. I know she has a pretty dirty mind and she knows i have that to. I'm not ready for a relation but i do desire sexual contact. She never asked me nor did i to her, are we both afraid for each other reaction?

2. Does it ever bother you when no one asks questions about you? Like you'll ask and want to take in information about them, but then its not reciprocated. I'm at a loss here, on one end I feel like its pretty stupid for me to be bothered that no one I have talked to has actively asked questions.

75,mym9f0,1619399475,"Hot, cold, and rude, all in 24 hours","I (40f) decided to come out of my dating hiatus. I began talking to a guy ( 50m) who has messaged me from this local singles FB I am on. We hit it off really well, he told me how much he enjoyed talking to me, how I “get him” and how smart, funny, I am, and blah blah blah. I was his first date in a year and half.

FF to the date Friday night. We meet after work at a brewery and had 2 beers. We hit it off great, we’re attracted to eachother and at the end of the date he said he wanted to see me again. He continued to text that night to say what a great time he had and to flirt a bit. We had said we would likely get together on Tuesday. He was all excited and sweet. 

He’s quiet the day after. I text him last night and ask how his day was and he was awfully brief. I made a joke since he said his day was just “ok” and I said maybe our Tuesday date would be better than OK. Then long silence. And then he types back “IDK” 

At this point, I’m all WTF?I replied  back a “?” Change of heart?” 

His reply to me is “ I would appreciate you didn’t spin this to make them all about you. I had a tough day. Period.”

And that was the end of that. I said “hope tomorrow is better, goodnight”

And he hasn’t been heard from since. And this is why I am apprehensive about dating. People going from hot to cold to hurtful in hours

People have bad days. But that isn’t the way you handle it. By being rude. I had no clue he had a bad day. I mean, come on, we had one date and this is going to how you are going to talk to me and then ghost me? Isn’t it supposed to be light and fun at date 1? 

I mean, he did me a favor, because if he is going to be rude and snap at me now, I couldn’t imagine down the line when his day is bad. 

Just one normal dude. One decent experience is what I would like to keep me in the game. But there haven’t been any positives in the last 2 years. I am just so discouraged and gun shy now.

76,mym9z2,1619399528,The need for power and control to have the upper hand in dating is incredbly draining.,"I know that some people don't take dating serious which is fine, I just don't understand the power struggle. It doesn't confuse me but it's just weird like, basically


Met a guy VIA tinder. Talked for 2 weeks before the first date, as well as asking what his intent was. I'm pretty straightforward when it comes to dating. I wouldn't want someone to waste my time so I do my best to give people that same respect. Things were normal I guess you could say. 


We slept together a few weeks ago. My apologies for not adding the dates. We met on tinder early March. I understand what casual sex is. No exclusivity. As long as my boundaries are respected (condoms no cameras being respectful towards one another) I'm fine by it. I'm having trouble understanding the logic behind the instant coldness. Now, once again ok fine with casual sex, but if you start to act weird and distant I'll take it for what it is and go on about my day. It's the push and pull that upsets me. The last time we slept together he asked if I needed a ride to the airport the next morning, I was going away for the week to visit my family, I told him thank you but I had it covered. We talk everyday. During my vaca he texted me once saying ""I hope you're enjoying your trip"" I told him thanks and asked how he was doing. He didn't answer. 


I get home Sunday, Tuesday he texted me asking how the trip was and I told him it was good thanks for asking, he didn't respond. The next day he asked what time would I be home because he had a gift for me. I told him the time and he said 


""Ok, I'm not staying, I'm busy this week""



Rubbed me the wrong way because, he is the one who called and asked, he reached out just to be dismissive and act ask if I was inviting him over. I didn't like the way he said it. I was gonna say forget it but I responded saying ""okay, that's fine, I didn't ask you to stay over, you asked me a question""


Then he said ""I'm just saying, I know you like when I stay for a while but that won't happen this week""


Lol. I told him it's alright and not to drop it off. Then I blocked his number. This is to vent but if I'm misreading the situation please let me know. Casual sex is fine and all but I got a gut feeling that he was just saying that so it would seem like I was desperate to see him. I've been in bad relationships before so I'm really guarded, but that rubbed me in all the wrong it ways. I know that everyone sees dating differently, even if it's casual I'll still be respectful no matter what. I wouldn't say that to a person because it would come off as if I'm insinuating that they are clingy especially when I asked when they would be home. For some reason dating feels like a game where people need the upper hand and control. I'm not gonna say I'm over it cause I'm making this post but it has gotten much easier to walk away from guys that give off red flags. I have never done anything rude or disrespectful to him, he is the one who asked me out, he is the one who persued me. So why act like that? It draws me away from you not towards. And if it's just casual, why are you making it known that you can't stay by when noone asked you too?


It's so dumb and idc if dating isn't that serious. I don't treat people like objects or options or give them a series of tests to see how they react. I'm 28, I'm an adult, if I feel a way or don't feel a way or loose interest I'll just say that.

It's my first time posting. 

I have been hanging out with a former co-worker I have known since last September 2020 to December 2020. 

I broke up with my ex-gf of 4 years in October because she cheated on me.

I thought she was cute and reached out to her via Instagram this March. 

We went on a few walks and thought she also liked me based on these observations:

1. she always makes time for me (eager to hang out and spend longer time)
2. she shares details about her family 
3. she always asks questions about me and continues the conversation if we go silent (so do I)
4. she thinks highly of me (don't know why)
5. she asked who my type is (not sure if this is a sign?)

She went back to Japan to see her family and she comes back in July. We decided to hang out again, but I don't want to wait. 

I was thinking about waiting to ask her on an actual date when she comes back, but would it be okay to ask her via DM?

                           OR

Does she even like me (maybe I am confusing it with overt friendliness)?

I went on three dates with a guy within a week. All went great, he seemed very obviously interested, he initiated all three. All were low-key day time coffee/walking dogs kind of dates. He ended the third one with a kiss and was talking like it was a given that we would be seeing each other again in the near future. I thought it was my turn to initiate so I suggested catching up on one of our next days off work. He said he was busy but suggested maybe another day. That day came and went - nothing. I asked if he was still free and he said he’d been called into work that day, but hadn’t contacted me to tell me until I messaged him to ask. His messages had become less frequent... 

It seems clear to me that he’s not interested and slow faded. But the thing is, I blatantly asked him in a message if he was keen to catch up again, and he replied ‘I’m keen!’ He said he had a lot on with work, I said I understood and to just let me know when he was free. Another few days of silence... decided to give it one last shot. It came to another day he had suggested he may be free to catch up. I messaged and said I had a few hours free in the afternoon if he wanted to catch up. He said he was busy, but also replied with multiple chatty engaging questions and seemed to be initiating an ongoing conversation. And then he sent another message specifically asking what my work schedule was for the rest of the week. That was four days ago and I’ve heard nothing more from him. I wrote back a chatty response, answered his various questions, told him my schedule and when I was free, and he didn’t reply and I haven’t heard from him since. 

I think it’s clear he’s not interested. It’s just frustrating and disappointing. I’m a pretty clear communicator, and I like direct answers. I asked him if he was keen and he said ‘I’m keen!’ and asked my work schedule. Why ask that then immediately ghost?

It has been more than 3 months now. 

Now, here is the problem. It is a long read so please bear with it. 

I am seldom sexually attracted to men, one of the reasons why I never had a serious relationship. I had some flings before but never serious. 

Before he and I started with the FWB set-up, I told him that I might catch feelings for him. He laughed at it, saying a girl like me wouldn't fall in love with a guy like him. Also, we would have disconnect since he is busy most of the days, and there would be disconnect, but let us see where it goes. 

So for the past months, everything was going well. We talk almost everyday, meet when we are both free, and usually sext or cam when not. I can say that we are more on a sexual relationship. However, we also like share about our lives, although I can feel that he is somewhat closed off. But that was fine since we are happy as is and I can feel that he cares about me more than a FWB. 

The last month though, I feel my feelings for him changing. I am catching feelings, more than I should. I began to demand more of his time and I get jealous, especially with his previous girls. I become insecure especially since he is more experienced than me in both relationships and sex. 

I told him about how I felt and he has been graciously and maturely assuring me about my insecurities and we somewhat became exclusive. He also makes more time for me. This made me like me even more, and I feel my feelings get deeper and deeper. 

Few days ago, I told him that I want to be more to him. He told me that he likes me, but he is still closed off because of his fiancee who died 4 years ago. He still has the baggage from what happened, since he blamed himself and has guilt because of her death. He told me about this early on and I really felt that he still has hang up about what happened. He said that when he met me, he was never looking for anything serious, but he is open to it sometime. 

I really like him and I am willing to wait for him to be ready again. But I don't know how. I am scared. I know this is a gamble, but I am not sure if I can deal with the risks. As I said, this would be my first serious relationship. I want him to open up for me but I do not know how. 

How do you make a guy open up to you? Should I interpret what he said as being open to having that relationship with me? What are my possible options in this scenario? 

Thank you for the help everyone.

85,mymx82,1619401827,Guy (35M) I’m (28f) Dating Has Second Thoughts On Exclusivity.,"
I started dating this guy in November, we became exclusive at the start of March. We started out as casual, but realized we’d be a good match for a relationship. Recently he’s come to me with concerns about our current sex life and has voiced that he’s thinking about going back to casual.

Few issues happening right now:

1. I’ve had some pretty intense spotting from my new birth control that cock blocks us. Getting it removed this week to hopefully stop the weird bleeding. 

2. His roommate for some weird reason wants to hang with us every time I’m over and doesn’t give us a ton of privacy. (He lives in a loft style apartment with no real rooms, but the roommate has his own space that’s out of the way.) 

3. He’s voiced that he likes having multiple partners, and that he’s a very sexual person. (I am as well, the birth control is just hindering that.) He describes this as an innate need that he has. He’s also wanted to explore having a third party join us. (This actually sounds fun to me because I’m bisexual.) 

So anyway, I think that once this birth control is out of me, and we get more alone time, our sex life will improve. We’d also be able to move forward in making a threesome happen. 

I’m concerned that there’s a deeper issue here and he actually just wants to be able to sleep around again. We’ve been exclusive for a little over a month and he’s already saying he’s “impatient” and “frustrated” because his needs aren’t being met right now.

90,myngns,1619403711,How should I cancel a date gracefully?,"I’m [25, F] back on the online dating scene (unfortunately) and I started talking to a girl about 5 days ago. I have a massive fear of commitment because of an abusive relationship and a very tender situationship that just ended. I made that pretty clear in my profile, and also told the girl multiple times that I wasn’t ready to be in a relationship and needed to move very painfully slowly until I felt ready. She acknowledged that and said she didn’t want to make me feel uncomfortable. She seemed super sweet and pleasant and we scheduled a date for a week later (this Tuesday).

We’ve continued to talk the last few days, sharing mundane facts like favorite color and favorite music and whatnot. On Friday (day 3 of us chatting), things started to seem juuuuust a little off. She was feeling a little bit down and chatted for about ten minutes we ended our conversation with me saying that I hope her day got better and she sent something to the effect of “it already has”). And later went on to tell me about which Taylor Swift song she wanted to sing, and that she didn’t want it to be one of her sad songs because she’s so happy now.

Saturday, we had known that my favorite color is purple, hers is pink, so to be kind of flirty i sent a purple and a pink heart and she the. said that those were “our colors” and put a purple and pink heart in my contact name.

It seems like it’s something that’s moving too fast for me, despite the fact that I told her what I wanted multiple times. So at this point, I’m not really wanting to go on the date, especially because I feel like that would kind of be leading her on because this has caused me to lose interest in her, unfortunately. But I don’t know how to tell her that, especially because i had said previously that I was excited for the date.

Should I go on the date anyway because it was scheduled? If I do, should I tell her in person right after or text it to her later? Should I cancel it and tell her that I’m not really interested?

She seems like a really sweet person, just not right for me, so I want to do whatever will cause the least hurt feelings.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myngns/how_should_i_cancel_a_date_gracefully/

92,mynn0z,1619404325,Best way to ask someone out,"I recently met someone at the rock climbing gym I go to. Since we've become acquainted we've talked quite a bit (more than just passing conversation) and I want to ask her to do something outside the climbing gym. She's expressed a lot about wanting to do more fitness related things and I was thinking about asking her to go on a hike (we have some trails/mountains nearby). 

I really don't know her well, and so I feel like I should use this as a chance to become better acquainted but it could obviously be seen as a date (I do think she's cute). Does it really matter the way I ask her to go on a hike? Such as:

If you're free, would you like to go on a hike this weekend?

I'm planning on hiking this weekend, would you like to come with?

Have you been to \_\_\_ Mt.? We should go this weekend!

95,mynxgm,1619405337,why do people have to be so trash,"I tried dming this girl and she said I looked like the main character from flushed away. The other girls I dm don’t respond or only answer with one word so it’s just dead one sided conversations. They don’t go anywhere, some post pictures of themselves at parties and stuff with other guys and say they don’t want anything serious. 

Girls 18-22 just seem so selfish and full of themselves. They think they’re better than everyone, can treat ppl however and deserve the best guy. They treat men badly. 

Women my age treat guys bad then ppl wonder why the last 2 girls I slept w were high school girls and why the current girl I’m talking to is in high school. 

They actually text back and have decent conversation, they don’t hangout with other guys as much and they don’t sleep around as much, they are actually willing to date. they actually treat interested guys as people and not as some replaceable thing only meant to entertain them, as girls my age seem to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mynxgm/why_do_people_have_to_be_so_trash/

97,myo76m,1619406314,It feels like love isn’t real / doesn’t exist,"Here me out, I’m not trying to be negative Nancy.. I posted this bc this is how it logically and scientifically is really starting to seem / feel in life. 

They say don’t settle for someone who doesn’t evoke passion and compassion from within. 

Then they say that anyone who gives you butterflies and makes your palms sweat isnt the one. The one will make u feel peace. So you can have passion but no peace... or you can have peace but no passion? 

Then there’s so so so many people in miserable and codependent relationships and they stay in them bc it’s safe. Whether it be a toxic relationship or just a plain old boring one where there’s no spark at all. 

Then I see so many others who are single and can’t connect with people romantically anymore (I’m one of those ppl) or those many unfortunate situations where everyone seems to be in unrequited love, lust, or limerence. 

And everyone just wants to find someone that’s compatible for them physically, emotionally, and intellectually... but it’s like an impossible feat. 

And the marriages are based off of again... safety and not stepping out of your comfort zone. Those who stay bc of houses and finances and in reality don’t even care to be in each others presence if they can help it. 

It feels like love isn’t even a real thing anymore. It feels like those truly successful stories of two people having passion and peace and respect are so rare. 

Anyone have any successful stories? And not embellished or boasting posts that are fake. But anyone here find real, true, passionate, reciprocal, lasting, healthy, fun, vulnerable, peaceful romantic love ?

Discouraged",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myo76m/it_feels_like_love_isnt_real_doesnt_exist/

99,myo7bp,1619406328,Stood up for being 8 minutes late to a first date. Did I get what I deserve or dodge a bullet?,"I had reserved a time for entrance into a botanical garden (they're not as strict on admission time) at noon. To get reservations, I had to wait for a certain date online, and waited a week for it to access.  I made the suggestion and my date wanted to spend the whole afternoon there.  I had planned on arriving there a few minutes early.  On the day of, my date unexpectedly wanted me to pick her up half an hour beforehand at a park.  Sure I told her.

But I was late to my date's pickup time at a park.  6 minutes past the meetup time, she app messaged me if I'm not coming we could go next weekend and a minute later she texted me if I'm on my way she could wait.  Because I was driving and looking for parking, I did not message her back right away.  I also was unfamiliar with the park.  1 minute after telling me she could wait, I parked and messaged her I was there, making me late by 8 minutes.

After waiting 6 minutes, no response. I messaged her again. Still no response. Over the period of 22 minutes I sent four more messages akin to where are you?  Eventually she said she got my message and said she left for the bank when I didn't message her at the meetup time and she'd be back in 20 minutes.  I messaged her I was about to leave but will wait.  Also to actually phone text me so I know she is real (I'd given her my number but she never gave me hers)  She responded with a cynical message that phone numbers could be faked and she'll be there in 5 minutes.  I responded that this is a rocky start but I'll wait.  Being the fool I am I waited considerably longer and kept messaging.  She never showed up nor responded to further messages.  Did I get what I deserve or dodge a bullet?

At the time, I didn't think showing up that late was rude, so I wasn't thinking of apologizing but thought about telling her about my unfamiliarity with the park's parking once inside the car.  Before realizing her intent to bail, I wasn't happy with her late messaging but I had also thought that it would be best not to discuss grievances and would've been best to move onto enjoying the rest of the time. There were some yellow flags about her that I neglected, not reciprocating phone numbers, her once a week messaging pace.  She had even told me I could leave her early at the botanical garden since she enjoyed nature and preferred to be non-talkative in the moment. (And here I thought the purpose was to spend quality time with someone.) 

I've read generally people say anything longer than 15 minutes without excuses is a dealbreaker.  I did not know the social norms beforehand.  I'm a little more casual about punctuality, especially on weekends for a personal activity time.  I have no timing rules, just estimations from google maps and going with that.  Neither is it normal for me to text while driving.  I'd probably have to pull over and disengage my phone nav to do that.  My reaction to people who set hard and no tolerant rules for casual activities with the same punctuality as going to work is a turn off for me.  I do think being unreasonably late isn't nice but it sounds like I'd be more tolerant and wait much longer for someone than the norm.
