1,s0ddbp,1641796520,To follow up or not?,"So to pre-face, I've been talking to this girl for a few weeks now and we've had two great dates. From the time we started talking she said straight away that her reply game was terrible - so she'd take from an hour to a few hours to reply to texts, but each one would be long and in-depth. I thought, cool, that's just her style

Anyhow, around New Year she went away on a family holiday and we haven't really spoken since. Before she left I said we should get dinner when she's back and we can talk about her trip, to which she responded ""Sounds goooood!""

She's still away and has been posting on her stories about her trip, but hasn't been messaging me at all (bit over a week), which is fine because we've only known each other for a short amount of time so I suspect I'll hear from her when she's back. She didn't really say exactly what date she's back though, just that she'd be away for a week or so

My question is should I send her a message just to check in and see when she's back and set a date, or just wait for her to get back herself and message me?

So far we've clicked really well, have a lot in common and had great chemistry on our dates, so just seeing if I should play it cool - or if it's fine to do a check in?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0ddbp/to_follow_up_or_not/

4,s0divj,1641797077,A guy liked me and I indirectly rejected him and I feel terrible,"I met John on vacation. We hung out over the course of several days, and I started to like him. One night, he introduced me to some people our age. One of them was Jim. Jim was very heavily flirting with me. I ended up blacking out drunk that night, so I don't remember much of anything. The only reason I know is because one of our other friends recorded everything. When I left, Jim told everyone that he thought I was cute and wanted to hook up with me. John got upset and told him that he liked me.

The next day, everyone told me what John said. I was really excited, so I pulled John to the side and asked if he liked me. Turns out, he actually had a girlfriend the entire time, and he denied ever saying that he liked me. A girlfriend he never mentioned. Jim and everyone else didn't even know he had a girlfriend. They were shocked. Later on that day, I was embarrassed about asking John, and that they knew I was so forward with John. I was being very quiet. I was hanging out with Jim and them and he asked me why I'm so quiet. I told him, and then he asked me what I liked to do.

After the vacation ended, I requested John on instagram. I figured that we could at least be social media friends. After all, we live in different countries. And, if he truly didn't like me, nor say anything about me, there really wouldn't be an issue, and my question would just be a misunderstanding. After two weeks, he rejected the request. I got upset and I blocked him. The next day, Jim messaged me asking me if I was alright. He didn't mention John, but his question was a bit out of the blue.

I feel bad, because knowing that he was flirting with me the night I met him, and then put all my eggs in one basket for John, I indirectly made Jim second choice. It's just because I already knew and had a crush on John by the time I hung out with Jim. Now, I feel like my chances are ruined with him.

Tl;dr: Jim was flirting with me, but another guy that I liked named John got upset by that. I asked John if he liked me, only he had a gf the whole time. When I got mad at John and blocked him when he rejected my Instagram request, Jim messaged me asking if I was okay",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0divj/a_guy_liked_me_and_i_indirectly_rejected_him_and/

For some backstory we were together almost a year, my kids loved him, we did everything together and we're very intimately in each other's lives.
Our breakup was kind of traumatic, there was deceit of some kind on both ends, so we split up. He doesn't want to get back together, and wants to have relationships and intimate connections with many people in a non-monogamous sort of way. When we are together we were using ENM as well, but it didn't go so well.
So here we are still talking still loving each other, and still pretending in person like we're a couple, but he makes it very clear that he doesn't want to be my boyfriend again.
I don't know what to do, because I love this person and don't want to walk away, but I also feel like I don't want to give the girlfriend experience to someone who doesn't want to be partnered with me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0dwjj/broken_up_but_still_seeing_eachother/

8,s0e760,1641799465,First time brought a girl to home (still living with my parents tho),"it is going to be long sorry about that in advance, anyway i met this girl 3 times already, lets call her Amy who came to Hong Kong for teaching french and english in university, we matched on bumble the day before new year eve and we met at the same day.

 first time: it was kinda wild becasue i was celebrating my moms birthday with my other family memebers and she said she would like to come along, although she came late she missed the birthday party, but we still managed to meet up, we chatted for 2 hours somewhere near the pier, then she went to meet her friend, i had few chances that i can kiss her but i did not do anything because i was nervous as hell

&amp;#x200B;

second time: she went to party with her girl friend, and we both went to the same place LKF( well known place for clubbing in Hong Kong) i met her after the party, we went for kebad, but i still didnt do anything.

anyway fast forward to 

third time( i showed her some games i play on switch) and she seems interested and ask me can she come over to my place and we both agree to meet up friday night after i finish work. on my way to where i live we were taking a bus, she told me she was sleepy and during the traffic jam she was laying on my shoulder (first hint i guess but i thought it was becasue she is a touchy person she touched my head quite a lot of time). when we got home after had takeaway, we went to my bedroom to play games she jump straight to my bed without hesitation, we played mhr on switch for an hour and she fell in sleep for an hour, then i just man up and asked her does she wanna cuddle and sleep together and she said she doesnt mind (maybe second hint), then we cuddled and slept for a bit and she took of her shirt only the bra left told me that she felt way too warm, then i told her i couldnt sleep becasue imagine as a straight man a girl who sleep next to you only wearing a bra, can you sleep well, for me no!!!. and i tried to escalate things up like asked her for a kiss but she said it in a cheeky way and then i kiss her neck and ear and she seems enjoying so much, then i asked her to take off her bra and she said ok and i sucked ber nipples and slowly moving my hand down there, she keep moaning, as i fingering her we were doing all those things around 4am till 5am saturday morning , we didnt have full sex intercourse but i did enjoy those foreplays, as she awake  i did fingering her once again and this time she actually achieve orgasm. (third hint) i saw the contact list on her phone my name has a heart emoji next to it and we were holding hand while on our way to where she lives.

overall  it was amazing but i still want some advices  do you think she likes me and want me as a potential long term partner or not. becasue i told her i am still living with my parents and the place where i live is not that spacious, but she doesnt seem like bothering about it at all. thankyou for all the poeple who managed to read the whole post in advance",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0e760/first_time_brought_a_girl_to_home_still_living/
9,s0e8u6,1641799651,How do I know if I like the sex with him given that he‚Äôs my first partner?,"

So I had my first sexual encounter with one Tinder guy and we‚Äôve met a few times, but I‚Äôm still not sure if I like the sex or not. Our arrangement is quite clearly for the sake of sex and intimacy, he definitely sleeps around and isn‚Äôt looking for a relationship.

Like it‚Äôs fine at some points, but tbh I can‚Äôt enjoy it fully as there are some things that mismatch. 

He‚Äôs not very honest or open about how often (or does he even) gets tested and I know that he sleeps around.

I also feel like the sexual energy/chemistry between us is lacking for some reason. He‚Äôs very hot, but he just doesn‚Äôt get me aroused that well and I feel like foreplay is often for him - we just make out, I try to sit on his lap and grind on him and such, but he doesn‚Äôt grind back or tease me back in any ways, just basically kisses me or my neck. 

During sex he doesn‚Äôt talk at all or dirty talk, which I find boring. For instance, when I was teasing him by sitting naked on his lap while he still had pants on and thus teased him, the only thing that came out of his mouth was ‚ÄúWill I get a blowjob now?‚Äù 

Like idk but it feels way too transactional/boring for me. I did get wet but he didn‚Äôt make me horny, if I had to word it out.

Afterwards we talked about kinks and I wanted to see if he‚Äôs into something rougher (because the sex is very vanilla, no dirty talk, no any roughness, he just penetrates basically and changes positions every now and then, and that‚Äôs it). I‚Äôd like to try choking, degrading or praising me or something like that, so I mentioned handcuffs to him and joked about us roleplaying. He laughed it off but later said seriously that he‚Äôs ‚Äúabsolutely never doing handcuffs or role plays‚Äù

What‚Äôre everyone‚Äôs thoughts on this? I‚Äôm bit lost what I should consider good or bad sex.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0e8u6/how_do_i_know_if_i_like_the_sex_with_him_given/

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôm not a bad guy, but all of my nice guy tendencies are completely gone, I have a totally different mindset with dating and boy, this escalated quickly.

She‚Äôs Black and Puerto Rican, and she‚Äôs about 5‚Äô9 to 5‚Äô10. She said she doesn‚Äôt date short guys but she thought I was cute. We hit it off, had sex. Not to brag but despite my lack of height I am very well blessed in other areas physically, and I‚Äôm great in bed and know how to make women reach orgasm, did that to her, and man, she instantly became way more interested.

She cooks for me, she wears sexy lingerie for me, etc, and one thing that stands out to me is that I‚Äôm barely around, barely communicate, and don‚Äôt put in much effort, not to mention stoic.

This past weekend we were all at the club, and while they are drinking and turning up, I was chilling, not doing much just watching them. She sat down bedside me and said she had something to tell me, I asked what, and she said she‚Äôs falling in love with me, that there‚Äôs something about me that‚Äôs making her feel that way and she hates it because she‚Äôs used to having her way with men. She said she thought she would get a few sex session out of me and send me on my way but her plan backfired. Meanwhile in my head I‚Äôm like falling in love with me? I barely do anything if anything at all!

They are perfectly allowed to have their own beliefs and boundaries. And you are too. 

It's not okay for people to shame someone for their sexual past. But they are completely free to not date someone for their sexual past. These feelings are valid and it's upto them to choose whether to look past it or reject the person.

**Pros:**

\- Somewhat smart and have a high paying job in Software/Tech.

\- Parents are wealthy from a large real estate portfolio, so I've never had to worry about money but I don't really like to flaunt it nor do I want someone to know I have wealthy parents unless its a serious relationship. 

\- Pretty fit from going to gym, I cancel and rejoin often but it's still kept me fit over the years. Also not too ugly, pretty average looking and well groomed / well dressed.

**Cons:** 

\- No active social life. Literally only have 3 friends since High School and 2 of them are in serious relationships and 1 moved to a different city. They barely have an active social life as well, they just spend time with their SO, go to work and then play video games whenever they can. Also ive had to work from home since COVID. 

\- Always the shortest dude wherever I go.  I'm 1.65cm (5'5) in height. Personally I would be happy with a shorter girl, but it does severely limit my dating options.. 

\- No experience with a girlfriend. Virgin &amp; Never kissed a girl. I went to an All boys Private High school, then studied CompSci in Uni which is like 95% male enrolment and then have since worked in Tech Firms where all my colleagues have been male. Basically never seen any women in my teen &amp; adult life.

I think the biggest problem is meeting woman, but with my situation it's almost impossible. I have profiles on online dating and do get matches every now and then but the best I will get is a 'Hey' ands that's about as far it gets. I have no clue what to do. Feels like nobody knows I exists.

I had brought up seperate issues that continued to bother me throughout our relationship but he would never know how to communicate, would just be video gaming, drinking, high, sometimes more than one at a time.
We were living together in his home town.
I realised I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore, told him I was done and packed my things and left. I simply ghosted him for weeks. I received constant messages from him saying he would stop drinking, etc. he even sent messages to my family members. 
I was so cold and didn‚Äôt even give him the time of day even though he was a big part of my life. We just weren‚Äôt going in the same direction, we couldn‚Äôt communicate and drugs + alcohol took over our relationship.
I had never touched weed prior to meeting him but through our relationship I became severely addicted to it, morning and night. I‚Äôve now been clean for almost 1.5 years. 

We did start talking about 3 months after we broke up and caught up here and there. We started sleeping together and then I found out he was sleeping with another girl, in the same unwashed bed sheets in-between the times I was going to his FAMILY house. Anyway they have been together since, he contacted me again last year around July to catch up for a coffee but I said no and ever since then I‚Äôve never seen him again.

27,s0gl67,1641808948,Is it bad that I'm 24 and never have had a girlfriend?," So for some background on my situation, during HS and university, I was working two jobs and some other things to support my mother and sister, my mother during my high school years was very unwell, and she eventually passed away. Then during university, my priority was studying and taking care of my 14 y.o. sister, I did the same two jobs and worked a lot of hours to support her, during this time I never dated at all simply because I was far too busy since I was my sister's only breadwinner. My father was a drunken loser who only came by to collect the support checks from us, and he said If I didn't give them to him he would kill me so I didn't really have any other options.

Anyways, now I'm 24, and I just finished my nursing degree, and I've gotten a graduate role, since I did nursing/midwifery I registered as both, and I'm doing a dual grad year thing where I can work in both fields. Anyways, my sister recently turned 17, and she said she wanted to join the army, I asked her if that was really what she wanted, and she's told me I've looked after her long enough, and she wants to make her own way in the world. I had to sign her permission form since she's under 18, and I saw her head out to her recruit training, I realize now I'm pretty free to do whatever I want because I only have to feed myself now.

I've been on a few dates, and most girls ghost when they find out about my lack of dating experience, I dread the past dating history question. I feel like I've missed the boat and that It's too late for me, I don't think I'm a boring person, I've recently discovered that I'm into karate, boxing, history, and dancing. I have other hobbies I'm discovering for the first time, but I won't list them here because It would take me ages, I'm also in pretty good shape especially recently so I don't think my looks are bad, I just look like a typical white dude but with a six-pack.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0gl67/is_it_bad_that_im_24_and_never_have_had_a/

When someone is interested in knowing you, their actions speak louder than words. They make effort to talk to you or keep the conversation going.

When you are on your path, stop making effort towards the other person if they don‚Äôt show the attention you think you deserve. If they care, they‚Äôll initiate the conversation. If they don‚Äôt it‚Äôs not end of the world. Stop investing your energy in them. 

If they can‚Äôt communicate their feelings clearly, it doesn‚Äôt make them a bad person. It just makes them different than you expected them to be. Being different is being human. You wish them well in your heart and move on.

He says he doesn't mind me sleeping with other people but is afraid of losing me?,"I met this guy on Tinder and we have been texting each other everyday for 5 months now. He is 6 hours away from me but we have been seeing each other monthly. 

He texts me good morning first thing every morning and we text throughout the day. When he doesn't get a respond in our convo sometimes he would double/ triple text me (but not forceful). He is also a man of his word - he never said something and not do it, even it is something very small.

I would say we are progressing everyday / every time we see each other and he has been consistent. We have had sex, spent the Christmas and NYE away, holding hands, intense eye contact etc. He has done many other things that have showed me he cares and is putting in the effort. We have also said 'I like you' to each other (very sincerely). He is always excited to make our future travel plans (like a few months away).

We had our talk the other night when he came see me and he said he ''wants to take things slow and get to know me more'' as we only met a few times. He said he ''doesn't want to get hurt as relationship can be very painful''. He basically said relationship should happen naturally and we are 'FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS' right now (and can be exclusive with this) but he also doesn't mind if I have sex with other people. When asked if he sees himself potentially dating me, he said he can't say anything as he wants to be 100% sure if he is going to say that. The other day however he was crying to me as he said the thought of losing me in his life is very painful.

What does this sound like to you? My friend who knows the whole story saw our conversation thinks he is 'really into' me and just taking his time to let things develop. I can also see us progressing gradually.

The other me on the other hand thinks he is ACTUALLY just seeing me as a FRIEND the fact he said we are FWB and could not even answer if he sees himself potentially dating me. I am just really confused as we are doing things what couples do and he has been putting a lot of effort in this 'relationship'. Could he really just be taking his time to let things develop? Or is this a dead end?

I know he texts many other girls and I am in general not happy in the situation. I want to just let things go. I am very insecure and I am not even sure if I am self-sabotaging by overthinking.

46,s0iy6d,1641817675,Do I just let them go?,"So let me just preface that I'm writing this feeling very fresh emotionally. I haven't spoken to anyone else because its just hard to explain the situation and for others to understand. I started posting on reddit a few months ago and I made a friend in the same community. It wasn't anything more in my head but just someone to talk to about a topic I couldn't with my irl friends. Moreover, they could answer my questions and I had received some bad news so it felt like an escape.

Except it changed. Slowly a couple conversations every week became every day and then all through out the day. Then it moved to instagram and then face timing. Now believe me when I say that this messaging wasn't just back and forth I'm talking voice messages and texts over 100 times in an hour - and it was balanced. At no point did things feel unnatural or out of balance. I don't wanna bore with details but eventually we confessed feelings and then it became more. after 2.5 months of this consistently we had begun watching shows and calling for 6+ hours. I know it sounds so teenage first love but I promise it was just a very natural conversation. We have so much in common and just were happy. Except we live on completely opposite sides of the planet.

We talked about meeting but with corona its more likely 6 months to a year away. Now three weeks ago we did but didn't say 'i love you' because we haven't met. We aren't a couple. Yet we were? This week a lot happened. Communication had issues and my mental health for other reasons began overthinking. Meanwhile he had his personal life become a lot and didn't tell me because I was already emotional. The last two days were intense but not in the screaming 'omg you don't get it' type way just more I want to help you but I can't even hug you. We had an emotional conversation and it basically boiled down to us finally saying 'I love you' but then him saying 'I don't think I can do this'.

Maybe its because it's so new but usually in a break up I get it. Logically I understand this pain because when you love someone and cant even touch them it hurts. Yet, I just don't feel like this is right? I just can't believe out of all the dumb luck how this person just came to be in my life and now I'm supposed to move on.

51,s0jvvk,1641820852,Men...this is the main reason you aren't getting laid,"Men. This is the number one reason why you aren't getting laid...

**You aren't social enough**.

That's it.

That's what it all boils down to in the end.

If I asked you how many new women you meet on a regular basis every week, you might give me a single-digit answer (if any women at all).

And if over the next 30 days you:

* Got **dafuq** off of Reddit/YouTube etc
* Stopped playing video games
* Got out of the house every day and spoke to new people
* Said yes to every social invitation you received

Your results with women would improve.

You would get more socially confident/charismatic through sheer practice alone.

You would increase the ""new women number"" tenfold (&amp; you would get women hitting on YOU).

Your whole lifestyle would shift and you would be getting laid regularly as a bi-product.

But if most people were honest with themselves, they would admit that this life shift is **scary as fuck.**

It's easier to peddle some excuse, be a victim and sit in your room saying...

*""Women just want the tallest dudes.""*

*""Women don't like me because I'm not white""*

*""Money &amp; looks are all that matters.""*

*""Dating sucks these days (and that's why I'm single despite not leaving my house in weeks)""*

All of this is bullshit serves the sole intention of avoiding the emotional pain involved in the journey of becoming a genuinely attractive man.

And until you get the hell out there and meet new people (not just women) - you will avoid the journey and stay hopelessly stuck exactly where you are.

Remember this, **women are moved by men who move the world**.

That's a man who is capable of influencing the world around him.

And you can't become a man like that that while you're stuck in your room.

So I challenge you to get out of the house this week for a whole day.

If you did that every week, things would start to shift.

Good luck brothers.

Hope this helps.

She asked me what I was looking for in a relationship shortly after we planned, and mentioned we should be friends first. Should I keep messaging her on the app in the meantime?

Please help!

When we first started around 3 months back, there were phone calls. Texts every now and then. Just asking each other how was our day. But as weeks come by, those aren‚Äôt so common anymore.

And now‚Ä¶ 3 months later. We do what couples do. Sweet towards one another when together. We hold hands which was once a big ‚Äúno‚Äù in our book. But now we do. We spoon too. He does things that are a big hassle to him normally just for my sake. So in a way, there‚Äôs like some progress happening. We now do stuff that wasn‚Äôt part of the deal of us just being a casual hook up. 

But we don‚Äôt text each other all day everyday, he replies fast when we do text. But the conversation will eventually end at some point. There‚Äôs no sweet or intimate or loving messages too. 

I am Kinda in a state of limbo right now. Because I don‚Äôt know what label to put this exactly or what to make of it. I just basically go with the flow right now. I enjoy his company a lot. He‚Äôs fun to hang out with even as a friend. We share a lot of interests. 

Would I like to see more of him or take this to the next level? Yeah I think I see myself doing that. But I don‚Äôt know where exactly he‚Äôs at.  

As a woman, should I take the lead in this? There are times I wanna text him or start a conversation. But I tell myself don‚Äôt, because I feel that I always end up on ‚Äúread‚Äù or ‚Äúseenzoned‚Äù.

He was a shy and not too handsome man, he was never even trying to start a chat with a girl and now he is a master of dating. When I heard this I was very interested in how he did it? When my friend was continued I realize that he was developing his skills, step by step, first of all, he was starting to meet women in every situation, but very often he was meeting women at private parties, he was talking to almost every girl but in a specific way, he wasn't complimenting them, but he was just funny and confident, sometimes he was even a little bit malignant, and that is why he looks attractive for women, he was just confident and speaks emotionally to women. Unfortunately, sometimes men are thinking logically and they don't know why women don't want to meet them. I will tell you because in your conversation there is no emotion, women don't like a man who is just logical. I hope you are enjoying that brief worth story.

64,s0mdtw,1641827987,The Honest Truth about Heartbreak and being Lead on.," 

Heartbreak doesn‚Äôt discriminate. It doesn‚Äôt ask if you dated and for how long. Heartbreak doesn‚Äôt care for labels. It doesn‚Äôt feel any less real just because they weren‚Äôt your boyfriend or girlfriend. Sometimes it hurts, even more, getting over someone you were never with solely because there‚Äôs that what if factor that plays into it.

When relationships have labels you‚Äôre either together or you‚Äôre not. You‚Äôre either single or with them. But when you‚Äôre emotionally invested in someone who won‚Äôt commit to you or give you what you need you constantly seek validation through lines that are blurry and rewritten time and time again.

You hold onto hope that one day it will be something.

But then you get hit with a cold reality that this thing you are so emotionally invested in has come to a dead end.

The hard part about endings is when there wasn‚Äôt a beginning to compare it to. Suddenly you were just emotionally invested in this person with no going back.

Then it‚Äôs over and you‚Äôre just expected to be okay.

You‚Äôre left having to mourn a relationship that wasn‚Äôt actually one but you loved them like it was real. Feelings are real and you don‚Äôt need a label to justify that.

Don‚Äôt let someone make you feel guilty for this heartbreak. Sometimes we love people we didn‚Äôt date deeper than anyone we did.

It‚Äôs not a breakup but it feels like one. You aren‚Äôt sleeping at night. You find yourself crying at three am. You wake up tired looking at your phone remembering when they used to be that text or notification you woke up to. Now your phone it a little more silent. You miss them but you also miss the possibility and belief that this could have been something. The pain is a little deeper but you can‚Äôt express these things publicly.

You can‚Äôt break down becauseif you do people will try and justify this reaction and say something like, ‚Äúwell you didn‚Äôt even date?‚Äù

You don‚Äôt have to date people to fall in love with them. And you don‚Äôt have to date people to get hurt by them. When your heart is invested in someone the pain feels exactly the same.

But the hardest part is trying to move on when they don‚Äôt realize you are hurting. When they don‚Äôt even realize how much of an emotional toll you took on them.

So you answer their texts. You try and be strong. You pretend that you accept the circumstances and you guys can be friendly and cordial.

But it‚Äôs destroying you every time they reach out because seeing them is this reminder of what you‚Äôll never be. And you‚Äôre losing sleep over someone who is probably sleeping with someone else.

I know how much it hurts. I know what it‚Äôs like to replay everything in the past wondering what signs you read wrong. I know what it‚Äôs like to spend time with someone that you might not even have had a physical relationship with but emotionally it couldn‚Äôt have just been you that felt it.

And I know what it‚Äôs like to not be able to clearly articulate this pain that consumes you. You got your heart broken by someone who should be easy to get over. But when you love someone and you really wanted to be something more the pain you feel is something that will take time to get over. And that‚Äôs okay. But what isn‚Äôt okay is you trying to be strong by keeping them in your life.

Maybe they notice as you pull away. Maybe they realize you aren‚Äôt talking as much. Maybe they call you out on it wondering if something is wrong.

And part of you wants to scream yes. I‚Äôm hurt. I feel completely broken. You destroyed me. But you stay silent because something about mourning an ending when there wasn‚Äôt actually a beginning makes you look like a fool. But it‚Äôs not all on you. This person led you to believe something was there. Had they been completely honest from the start you wouldn‚Äôt have fallen so fast but they didn‚Äôt. Instead, they knew how you felt maybe they added fuel to the fire. Maybe there was a physical relationship there without a label. Maybe they told you everything you wanted to hear to keep you around because your presence boosted their ego.

Regardless of how it applies to you and your situation, someone let you fall for them when they had no intention of catching you. So don‚Äôt feel guilty for these pain you feel you have to repress just because there wasn‚Äôt some label attached to it.

Cry as hard as you need to. Feel things as deeply as you do. Pull away without an explanation because you don‚Äôt deserve this pain and they don‚Äôt deserve you.

But be sure that when you do heal and your tears dry you never allow them to make you feel this way again.

Because just as you deserved a relationship in all this, you also deserve time to heal even if they weren‚Äôt yours completely.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0mdtw/the_honest_truth_about_heartbreak_and_being_lead/

I spent sleepless nights crying about him and I even contemplated suicide. That happened in 2020 and I am just now coming to grips with it. And I wasn‚Äôt even in a relationship with this guy.

69,s0ng9o,1641830811,I (28m) will keep seeing this girl (22f) even though almost nothing happened so far,"Dear all, 

Let me introduce my  background first. I've been pretty successful with girls since I'm 20 yo, had a lot of adventures, and also a relationship (about 3 years). Let say that being good looking and having good intellectual qualities helped, but I also really pushed myself to go towards girls whenever the occasion arrised (bar, club, street, beach, etc) for the past 8 years.   


About 5 months ago, I hit on a girl in the street and directly picked up a girl as she was walking, in a pretty smooth fashion. I could tell she was pleased about the approach, and gave me her number. We then met for a drink a week later, she told me her age and I thought that we might be at different phases of our lives. I still gave it a chance and met her a second time at my place (as it was raining) and noticed that she was particularly smart, sweet, elegant, sharing the same interests than me, had the same vision of life, and on top of that, damn hot. I understood that she was not really into casual dating (only had one or two serious relationships before), but I kissed her and we spent the evening in each other arms, learning a bit more about the other.   


The next day, I was quite excited about this evening, and much more than after ONS with girls I had met in the past months. But three days later, as I was asking her out again, she told me that she preferred to be friends with me, as she was not feeling ready for anything beyond, and asked if I was okay with that. I was quite surprised but told her that there was no problem and I would like to keep meeting her anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then we both went to holidays, I forgot her a bit as I met some girls in the meantime, we were texting a few times, but I could tell she still wanted to see me. So back in September, we kept going for walks, having some drinks, watching movies, or playing music together once in a while. I sometimes tried again to kiss her, but she was leaning back each time, telling me that she preferred to be friends, that she wanted to be on her own atm etc. However, me and some other friends could tell she was interested by the way she was behaving around me. I thus met her once before Christmas, and it was definitely a date, with restaurant and then at my place. I told her everything about how I was feeling about her, I went all out. And still, even though staying close to me, being triggered, she kept boundaries and repelled the offer. I decided to move on and stopped texting her for a while. But then, since the new year, she turns out to be initiative, wants to meet me more often, and I can tell we're not really friends anymore. Last night, she stayed until late, after having spent the night with me, talking about us, staring at each other, cuddling, etc.   


And here I am, now, thinking about her madly, dreaming of kissing her or sleeping with her, even though I could meet other girls easily that definitely want these things with me. This girl is gold to me and I want to stick to her, I know that this is going somewhere, and even though it takes so much time, that nothing is happening yet, every second I spend with her is amazing. I don't know if she's testing my patience, of she's playing a game, or being over cautious, but in any case, it's working. I'm definitely into her now, as we start to know each other more.

What do you guys think, should I just keep seeing her, and keep building the connection, without making any further move, and let her come to me? Or do you think it's not worth it after so much time, and that it might never happen?

We sat beside each other and ended up chatting since it was a pretty long commute. Surprisingly we had a lot of things in common and had a great time talking for over an hour.

As we were leaving the station, I asked for her number and told her we should go ice skating at some point. (she mentioned she always wanted to get better in our conversation). She said ""sounds good!"" and gave her number to me. 

When I got home we chatted for a little bit over text, and she said she would be down to go sometime next week because her friend has her skates, and won't get it back til then. 

We left the conversation at that on Monday, since I didn't really want to build a relationship over texting, and we already had kind of a date set up like 7-10 days out. 

I didn't text her until Friday, when I was out with some friends and decided to shoot her a text asking if she was free to grab a drink. All I said was ""hey you free to grab a drink tonight?""

Unfortunately, she read the text a little more than a day after, and still hasn't messaged me back yet. 

Am I overthinking to think that she's already lost interest in me, because I asked her to hang out too early? I'm a big overthinker, and for some reason I already feel like I've been rejected (or going to get ghosted). These insecurities come from previous experiences, and I already think of the the worst case scenario. 

Thoughts that are going through my mind are ""she only gave you her number because she was being nice"" and ""she doesn't find you attractive enough"". These thoughts are lingering in my mind while I'm waiting for the unknown.

Basically he was just to busy to be dating me because i was too needy.

I texted him on new years and said ‚Äúi hope everything is going well and i‚Äôm wishing you the best‚Äù and he replied ‚Äúsame for you (nickname he gave me), happy new year, un abrazo (a hug) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù and i just liked the message. Then I asked him how he was doing and he said ‚Äúquite busy but okay, you?‚Äù Is he just responding to me out of pity or because he cares? What should i say?

My intentions are that I do want him back (i‚Äôm not going to put my life on hold for him) but i know he‚Äôs not capable right now. But I still want to have him in my life, since i do love him and wonder how he‚Äôs doing all the time. I do think that i‚Äôm less needy and spent our time apart getting busier and focusing on my own life, but i still care for him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0ozsa/is_he_only_responding_to_me_out_of_pity_what_do_i/

86,s0pq5x,1641836560,"Friend confessed about feelings, I rejected him, would bringing up fwb be fine after that?","We met back in august and we've only met a handful of times (at our shared friends house, involving drinking). We've had some phone calls and texting here and there, nothing consistent tho

Last Friday he sent me a text confessing his feelings for me, which threw me off a bit because it was unexpected. Shortly after we were having a phone call discussing the situation

In a nutshell the call consisted of him telling how nervous he was sending the first text, what our views about dating is and what would be the realistic approach in our case. Also mentions about if we are even compatible, and our current life situations

*He lives in one city, i kinda live in the another. I travel weekly 2h by train (one way) to go to a dorm but i still have to travel back to spend weekends at home*

He straight up asked if i like him, and i said no, i haven't thought about him in that way. We're going to have face-to-face discussion about our situation and talk things through (even more). I haven't been in a situation where i have to reject someone, so i'm worried about the slightest possibility of him thinking i'm leading him on in the future, which brings me to my next problem

Even though i haven't thought about dating him or even going on dates with him, the idea of fwb has crossed my mind a few times (starting before his confession)

Normally i would never bring this up to him, but because we are going to have a honest conversation (around this Thursday or Friday) and just share our thoughts and feelings about each other, I've been on the fence about it

On one hand i would feel relieved to tell him about it, but would it be cruel for him?

We both are fairly inexperienced on dating and things regarding it, but I've had a few experiences with crush/almost-dating situations in the past (in the emotional aspect tho). And by what i understood, he has not had that

Regardless he would want to take things slow (same with me) and build a good foundation, which i appreciate. I still think we are too different and don't really have much in common to date in the future

*We are only friends because of our mutual friend, who always like to invite new people over, in this case the new person was me. I continue to hang out with the group every now and then, because the hangouts are so far from each one (i'd say around a few weeks). If i would go to the same school, i would not be the type of person to hang out with them daily*

Both of us are still in our late teens, him being a year younger than me

\-

Basically the things that i mostly keep thinking are, how am i going to tell him that i'm not open to a relationship, how to prepare for our talk and is this even an okay approach? Overall any outsider comments would be appreciated, I'd love to hear other peoples thoughts about this

91,s0q9e3,1641837886,Navigating Dating with Mental Illness,"Fellow flesh bags, I‚Äôm curious of your thoughts on dating with depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues.

I‚Äôm a male in my late twenties who is, at risk of sounding pompous, somewhat successful for my age. Successful on paper, at least. Unfortunately, I have a dark family history that comes with clinical depression and generalized anxiety. This often negatively impacts my self-esteem and causes me to question whether I am emotionally fit for dating. I also know that everyone is fighting their own battle and I‚Äôm more than likely not the first person to be wondering about this. One obviously must avoid falling into co-dependency, though.

93,s0qjb0,1641838589,I always fall in love with the wrong guys -_-,"Long story short - it is the wrong guy, again.

I‚Äôm f19, consider myself as quite attractive (I have my own style), I‚Äôm quite ‚Äúmature‚Äù for my age, have a large friend group and social life and still, I‚Äôm confident and still, it doesn‚Äôt seem to work out with guys.

I mean I don‚Äôt really have a problem with that, sometimes It‚Äôs just a bit hard to see Friends of mine in happy relationships..

That‚Äôs it. 

If I think back, I always had crushes, but kinda on the wrong guys. 

At 16, I had I huuuuge crush on my teacher, Back then I really thought I‚Äôd love him. Now, 4 years later, I know it wasn‚Äôt that deep/real. (Although, after our graduation last year he confessed that he if I was 10 years older and he 10 younger, it probably would‚Äôve fit)

Then, I was ‚Äúin love‚Äù with a classmate my age, he never felt the same - I was totally heartbroken. Whatever. 

Then, last summer, I spent 2 months abroad and met another guy. It was amazing, the first time someone liked me back. Well, it turned out he just wanted something casual, since he just broke up with his gf. Well, so just a hook up then, fine (Long distance wouldn‚Äôt have worked so it was fine.)

Now, it‚Äôs a co worker.. I don‚Äôt know where this one will lead, but he seems to like me, but I have to strong feeling that he wants to hook up too... Idk, maybe I‚Äôd like it though.

Oh, did I mention a good friend of mine who has a gf and still wants to have some fun with me?! 

That‚Äôs my ‚Äúlove life‚Äù haha, appreciate your thoughts :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0qjb0/i_always_fall_in_love_with_the_wrong_guys/

Again,"Writing this post because I really just need to vent I already know I should have left this situation by now and know that I‚Äôm self inflicting pain and can‚Äôt blame anyone but myself but today I feel like I finally got the wake up call I needed. So my fwb of about 6 months recently we decided to stop having sex with eachother well really he decided because my feelings were getting strong and he has made it clear he does not want a relationship with me or anytime soon but I enjoy his company to a extent so I decided okay we can try the whole friend thing so I can still spend time with him and I‚Äôll just find sex somewhere else. (Which he told me I should do as well) anyways so he got into a situation last week where he basisally has no place to stay he never asked to stay w me or anything like that but he just has been ending up staying with me almost every night for like a week now. One night he went to his sisters. Every night we sleep in the bed together and binge watch a show. He will get dinner for himself n ill get dinner for myself and we will just watch tv and sleep. I tried to have sex maybe the first 3 nights and he was like no because neither of us had protection plus he said him not having a job or crib rn killed his sex drive so I‚Äôm like okay I get it and so I just gave up bc I‚Äôm like I‚Äôm not going to beg for it. So anyways I came to terms with just enjoying each others company on a friend level because u know I don‚Äôt have any other friends or fwb right now. Anyways my car was hit by a drunk driver over the weekend and today was my first day. I hate asking ppl for shit and I never ask him for anything. I haven‚Äôt been working so all last week we would kind of sleep in together then go about our day separately then he pops back up like 6 or 7 at night n just stays over. But this morning I asked him could he pick me up at 12 from my new job it‚Äôs the first day and my car wouldn‚Äôt be ready until like tonight. So I get up n get in the shower and start getting ready. I‚Äôm being quiet so I don‚Äôt wake him up. As I‚Äôm in the bathroom he yells okay I‚Äôm leaving. I‚Äôm like ok before u go can u pick me up at 12 he‚Äôs like oh no I have to work. Even tho last night before we went to bed he said he didn‚Äôt work. Now he‚Äôs working 950-430 out of nowhere. So it‚Äôs like damn no sex. No ride to work. But I give u a place to stay and ask for nothing in return at this point your a bad friend and I‚Äôm an idiot if I allow him back over here. I‚Äôm hurt but glad I‚Äôm finally waking up. This was the final push I needed to seee he cares nothing about me.
