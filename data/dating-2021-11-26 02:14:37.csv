2,r2iulf,1637916408,An Origami parrot - Is that a weird joke ?,"So I am working within a big lab/team (within a university) and there is a girl sitting one row away from my desk. 

We don't even know each other but might just potentially know each other's names based on team/group email etc.

I guess she might be single or seems to be... but anyway I think we literally know nothing about each other that's the point. 

So she had a parrot stuffed toy sitting on her desk and out of nothing, maybe just to show off my skills or who knows, one day I made a paper folded parrot similar to her stuffed toy and put it beside the ""real"" one, without leaving anything indicative of me, of course...

I think it was more like a joke for me at that time...

Later on when she found out she was just quite suprised and probably confused and might keep wondering why her toy gave birth to a little one...

And that's the end of my story...

But today I read about someone saying like they anonymously put a fruit on their fellow's desk in the same office everyday, and others critized them as being creepy or weird...

And I am a bit concerned that whether in a similar way, my joke was weird or inappropriate...

For the longest time I just wanted something casual and to have fun, but was recently diagnosed with a minor gastrointestinal disease and drinking alcohol causes a TON of pain so I had to quit.  It's been a blessing! I've ended a decade long negative friendship, been generous with my time, and I feel blessed.  My whole outlook on life has changed and I feel pure bliss and a lot less stress.

I want a long term monogamous relationship...maybe marriage one day which is crazy to even have in writing.  I want to take risks in life and go after what will make me happy.  I just feel so warm and fuzzy now.

I dont have to worry myself any longer trying to impress women or anything like that.  I can be myself and the right person will like that.

I know sexual activity or lack of bears no importance on a person's worth as a human.  Whether they've had 200 partners or 0.  You're still worthy of finding love.  

I just wrestle with one thought...how much would I regret not dating around a ton.  I know some very kind, generous, compassionate women...very beautiful as well.

I've dealt a fair share of chicks that are so into you. They will jump Mount Everest, beat up Connor McGregor and basically putting in insane amount of effort to spend time with the guy but even when the guy is genuinely good and didn't act any different in a negative way, you quickly pull back on them and become very distant in a matter of days? 

You get annoyed with their presence and maybe even ghost or block the guy when they sense the sudden shift in pattern from you? What is it do you exactly want from guys? They give you back the attention and affection you want and you move 10 steps back? You want the space and you're a completely different person now? Or do you have another option lined up already?

Help me understand the thought process behind this. I know I've had my fair share of chicks that have been through with really awful and abusive guys but ended up making it more miserable for the rest of us, especially when we come back to get some answers after noticing a weird shift in pattern.

11,r2jo5a,1637919833,"Did She Cheat? Should I be concerned? Long post, but man does this have me stressed..","My girlfriend and I are long distance. We have been dating for a year and a half. We‚Äôre super close, talk/text everyday, and FaceTime every night. We love each other a lot and always have been healthy and strong.

Here‚Äôs the Story:
On Halloween, she went out with her usual small group of girl friends. Everything was great up until around 10pm. We had been texting/snapping casually all night, and I knew she was leaving a bar to go to a party cause she told me. About 15 mins of being at the party, she stops responding. I send a message, she reads it like 20 mins later, and I don‚Äôt hear from her again. I know, from find my friends, that she only was there for like an hour tops, and then went back to her apartment with her friends. 

The next morning, she texts me first and is like ‚Äúhey why didn‚Äôt you ever message me back?‚Äù 

I was confused, was like what? Told her I did and sent a screenshot. She insisted she never got my message (even though I knew it delivered, AND saw it was read like 20 minutes after I sent it) I let it go, but was kinda still thinking why it seemed like she was lying about it. Also, we ALWAYS text? Like for the last year and a half. So why not then? Why nothing from her? In the Uber? At home? Laying in bed? Nothing. She‚Äôs been to so many parties and everything‚Äôs been good. But this one why so different?

What really made me make this post, is that the next day after the party, something happened about 3 - 4 hours after we first started talking. I‚Äôm on Instagram, and I just casually click her profile. I notice, that the 1 and ONLY picture of us, is deleted. I was freaked out. I called her, and she acted like ‚Äúwait wtf I didn‚Äôt do that.. I seriously don‚Äôt know how that happened..‚Äù

I was pissed. I hung up. She started out really nice and trying to comfort and assure me. Then, she started getting mad I was ‚Äúaccusing‚Äù her. Then it was ‚Äúthen just break up with me if you don‚Äôt trust me..‚Äù 

We talked about that for maybe 2 total days. Her answer never changed. I never got any more proof, never heard anything else. We love each other so much, but ever since then,  the last few weeks have been weird. I keep doubting everything, especially her feelings for me. 

I don‚Äôt want to sound needy. We talk a lot, but it‚Äôs just cause we both kinda like it that way. I feel like I kinda know something happened, and really just posting this for affirmation. But then again, I do feel like maybeeee I am wrong.  She has never given me a reason to think anything like this, and has continued to say nice things and joke/talk about marriage. Heck, she just bought me a ticket to come on vacation with her and her entire family!

I‚Äôm going on vacation with her family tomorrow. How am I supposed to act? All I can think of is this. She hasn‚Äôt been acting a lot different, but I‚Äôve been perceiving everything a lot different. The whole relationship has just turned into me being worried anxious about what‚Äôs really going on over there, both in her life and in her head/heart for me. 

I appreciate you sticking this one out to the end. It‚Äôs been about 3 weeks of stressing about this, so any advice or thoughts or more appreciated than you know",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2jo5a/did_she_cheat_should_i_be_concerned_long_post_but/
12,r2jq3u,1637920078,Are decent black men undesirable today?,"A little background info about me:

\- I‚Äôm 32 years old

\- I‚Äôm African American

\- I‚Äôve never been married

\- I‚Äôve never been in a relationship

\- I‚Äôm a college graduate

\- I work a decent job in IT here in Atlanta, GA

\- I‚Äôm an average gamer and anime guy; slowly pushing away from this though to pursue other interests

\- I‚Äôm average in shape (working on this; I plan on getting a personal trainer next year to up my game)

\- I‚Äôm a decent guy from what my friends and family have told me

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I‚Äôm told to be a fairly decent quiet nice guy from what my friends and family have told me. Still, most girls my age or younger don‚Äôt really see me like that. They tend to go for jerks and people who are almost 90-180 of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôve been trying to find out what is wrong with me in general and why I can‚Äôt seem to land a decent girl I like who meets what I want. I don‚Äôt want to date just to date anyone because I don‚Äôt want something real and not a cheap thrill. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question to all redditors here who have read this far is the following above: Is it even worth it to be a decent black male if you are looking for a relationship? Do I just need to be like everyone else if I want someone attractive that I like? I‚Äôm just sick of not being able to get a relationship after I worked so hard and tried to be a good person. I‚Äôm literally about to say f this world and just begin hating relationships outside of family and friends and be alone for the rest of my life! 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are not very helpful since they are old school, and my friends are just saying give it time but how long does a guy have to wait?! I would have thought by now I would have been married to a fairly decent and attractive girl with a family of my own but instead of I‚Äôm still sitting the bachelor life. Sigh.

13,r2jv5z,1637920707,I don't manage to get fwb on the regular -- only serious women,"Hi,

I'm a 31 year old male and I have what some of you may call a luxurious problem -- I seem to mostly attract women who are more interested in a serious relationship than just fwb. This goes for women I meet IRL and on Tinder. I broke up with my gf almost 3 years ago after a 5 year long relationship and have been on a journey to be fully comfortable with myself before heading in to something new, and here's the issue:

I haven't gotten laid in like.. 3 months or something and I *really* need that physical touch on a regular basis. And before that, I wasn't sleeping around very much. Sure, I might give off more of a ""boyfriend material"" kind of aura than ""fuckboy"" given my looks and manner, but that doesn't mean I don't like casual sex. I want to point out that I have been with several women over the years, before and after my relationship, so I'm no stranger to intimacy.

I get that women my age wants to get it serious faster than men, generally speaking, and I respect that. That's why I don't have sex just to neglect them afterwards anymore, have done it and didn't feel good about it. But being honest about only wanting sex and cuddles is kind of looked down upon, which is why I feel that I have to lie about what I'm looking for to get it. Which I don't want. I think my Tinder career would be over if I wrote that request in my bio, for example. 

However, younger women who, generally speaking, are more interested in this kind of arrangement are much more difficult to catch. I thought that my improved and seasoned self would attract them way more than it does..

That being said, if the woman I would consider girlfriend material showed up -- I wouldn't turn her down. But i'm not actively looking for her. I'm from a European country, but I guess the rules are the same.

I'd like your input on this. Thanks!

14,r2jxx6,1637921019,It sometimes feels like no girl will ever feel the same way that I do for them.,"I'm a 23 year old guy if that gives any added context. 

It's not even that I think I'm ugly, uninteresting, or have low self esteem or anything like that. If I step back and look at myself objectively, I'm a very attractive and interesting guy. I'm in shape, a great conversationalist with a unique personality, good social skills/social awareness, and have a pretty decent job. 

Even knowing all of that, when I try and put it into practice it just never works out. Either I feel like a complete creep when trying to flirt with women, or even if they do like me we just go through the ""talking"" phase for about 2 weeks and then one or both of us ends up losing interest. It never amounts to anything substantial. 

And yeah I know that I don't need someone, I know that it's not necessary for me to be happy, but it would be nice to have someone I could be intimate with. Someone who enjoys my more relaxed and mellow personality. Someone who doesn't expect to be super confident and extroverted all the time (although I will admit some of that pressure is self imposed) 

I'm a naturally very introverted person, I really dislike talking to people if I don't know them, so this makes talking/flirting with women even more difficult than it already naturally is because I always put myself in their shoes. I don't enjoy when someone I don't know tries to come up and talk to me, so I can only imagine it feels the same, if not worse, for them. 

This has been more of a rant, I just really needed to get this off my chest. I always feel guilty after venting over first world problems like this. Like there's a hobo dying of a staff infection somewhere rn and here I am complaining that it's hard to get girls to like you. I have a problem with that, I always judge myself for feeling certain things. Like I don't deserve to feel bad about certain things because I have it better than most. 

But yeah does anyone know what's wrong or what I could do to fix this lol. Also I'm drunk.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2jxx6/it_sometimes_feels_like_no_girl_will_ever_feel/

Just asking for another perspective on this situation.
I‚Äôm F32, successful career, own house and happy where I am in my life. I was in a longterm relationship for 11 years and I left him in April this year. It was my decision and I‚Äôm completely over him. 
In June, I created my first ever online dating profile, never have used one before and instantly clicked with M28, it was going really well, exchanged numbers, he asked me out and I froze and did even acknowledge that message. Shitty, Behaviour I know but I have never dated in my adult life, I was with the same person from age of 19. Somehow we continued chatting and one night he came over and we hooked up. We been in this weird hook up phase now for 5 months! Initially I enjoyed casual sex, I even told him its just a booty calls and not to catch feelings. I limited communication, didn‚Äôt text him etc, however now we are at the stage where if I don‚Äôt reach out, he will. We update and support each other in life events etc but there‚Äôs so much ambiguity! I did tell him over a month ago, that I want proper dates but his response was I thought I am just your booty call. 
In the last 4 months, I have dated others too but there‚Äôs noone I feel like I click or I am attracted to apart from this guy. I feel conflicted that this situationship goes against my values and what I want in longterm but at the same time I enjoy it?

20,r2kggt,1637923251,Does this girl [F21] seem like she wants to date? I‚Äôm [M21] unbelievably confused‚Ä¶,"
Background: Really confused with this girl [F21] I‚Äôve [M21] been hanging out with recently. She seems very affectionate in person but hasn‚Äôt made much effort through text and so am not sure if this is casual or she might like me. Opinions.

So I first met her through one of my best-friends on a night out - she happens to be one of his best-friends aswell. My friend kept asking me If I would move to this girl but I said no since I didn‚Äôt want things to be awkward if it only ended up being a ONS. Eventually I get a bit drunk and tell him maybe I would get with her and the next thing I know this girls coming up to me and dancing with me in a club. We start making out and afterwards she takes me back to her house. When at hers, we make out, do foreplay and begin to have sex but end up stopping because of her own reasons which I found out the next time I saw her. It was all a little sudden and had me wondering if I had done something wrong since she got out of bed said she was going to the toilet and didn‚Äôt come back. I felt bad for leaving without saying anything but it seemed the right decision given I had waited incase she wanted to talk. I hadn‚Äôt got any of her socials or a number so neither of us talked/messaged till we saw each other again about 6 weeks later.

When I next saw her was at a party and she immediately came up to me and apologised about the previous time. She said she felt bad and that I was a really nice guy with how I handled it. After this party, she asks if I want to go back to hers and crash since it‚Äôs still pretty early in the morning and it was pouring outside. After my last experience with her, I didn‚Äôt want to do anything with her so kept it friendly and we talked for a couple hours - even though there were a few times she clearly tried to get close with me. When we were going to sleep she said I could take the bed and her the couch, to which I refused and said I would take the couch. About 30 mins after trying to sleep she comes in and asks if i want to go for a smoke so we end up doing that. I then try go to sleep again and about 30 mins later she comes in again and says she can‚Äôt sleep, could we talk. We end up making out and then go back to her room and have sex. The next morning I stay round at hers for quite a few hours after waking up with us making out and cuddling in bed. We didn‚Äôt even talk that much and when I would try leave she would say I didn‚Äôt have to. When I eventually did leave, I completely forgot to get her socials/number so thought I messed this one again. 

About an hour later when I got home, I see that she had found my snapchat and so I added her back but didn‚Äôt actually message her till a few days later - purely because I didn‚Äôt know what to say and didn‚Äôt want to come off to eager. When I did message her, she told me she was wondering if I was going to message her back and after this we exchanged a few messages but nothing interesting - I‚Äôm a pretty dry texter (how are you, what are you up to, any plans this week). I also tend not to reply to messages that quickly since I‚Äôm always overthinking what to reply or say - so now we‚Äôre both in this loop of replying every 5/6 hours. 

The next time I saw this girl was at another party, we both knew each other would be there and it actually seemed quite awkward when I first saw her for some reason - I didn‚Äôt know if she was happy or not to see me there. Anyways things ease up a bit and we get to talking a bit (after her friends leave us together alone). Later that night when we were leaving this bar, she grabs my arm and asks if I want to go back to hers. We end up having sex at hers and I actually end up spending the whole of the next day there. When I tried to leave she would say I didn‚Äôt have to and we would end up making out. Stayed till about 7pm cuddling and she put on this romcom movie.

At this point I wasn‚Äôt sure if what we had previously been doing was casual or if she wanted something more because although she‚Äôs very affectionate in person, she has never messaged me first. It‚Äôs always me starting the conversations which has me thinking whether she wants to talk or is just replying out of kindness (as said I am a pretty dry texter). Anyways, I decided to ask her out for drinks (not sure if it‚Äôs a date, given i‚Äôm not sure what she thinks of me), but unfortunately have had to cancel two times due to being  very ill. The last thing I told her after cancelling was that if she was still interested in going out it may be easier planning closer the time when I know i‚Äôm better and she replied saying sounds good, hope you get well. Given i‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a date, i‚Äôve not been sure how to handle this, don‚Äôt want to appear too sorry if it‚Äôs not since cancelling a meet up isn‚Äôt too much of a big deal.

I‚Äôm really not sure what to make of this whole situation. The only time she ever seems to be interested in me is when we see each other. Apart from adding me on snapchat, she has never made an effort to start a conversation over text. This has only got me wondering since we don‚Äôt actually hang out too often - if she were interested she‚Äôd want to text in-between not seeing each other right? I did ask my friend and he said he thought she seemed interested but at the same time he‚Äôs not the most reliable person.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2kggt/does_this_girl_f21_seem_like_she_wants_to_date_im/

I met him on Bumble, and I always ask what a man is looking for in a relationship before meeting in person  I'm 32 and not a stranger to dating or relationships This guy told me he was looking for chemistry that would lead to a relationship. Our first date got rescheduled because I was sick and he stated in touch with me, even called me before we met to see how I was and if an alternate time would work to meet. 

 Anyway, he is a doctor, so very busy but was very clearly making an effort to stay in touch, schedule time to see me, and express his interest in me. We only saw each other 4 times but we had a very deep connection. We would talk for hours, about family, life, what we want etc. He was very romantic, would sit next to me in the booth at dinner and hold my hand, once even said if we had kids he wishes they would look like me. We slept together and had great sexual chemistry as well. He even said I was wife material (wtf).  The last time I saw him, he asked.to come see my apartment so he could meet my cat (who is very special to me of course), and was so thoughtful and sweet when we were together. 

Anyway, of course his texts started to slow, and then a few days went by without hearing from him. Again, he's busy and I don't need to text every day so I didn't worry. But it's now been two weeks with no plans and few texts. After a few days I got a 'Hey there' text, and no reply to my response for another day. I finally reached out and said, 'i was really enjoying getting to know you, and I would like to see you again. If you're too busy or not interested you can tell me that'. 

Of course the guy replies, 'I am interested but I am too busy for anything serious right now'. 

Of course, I initially hung on to the 'I am interested' part, and replied that I'd be cool seeing him casually still, and he replied he'd be happy to still do that.

But now I have thought more, and feel.angry, and very used and led on... Let me be clear, people have the right to change their mind. But to say you are looking for something, say and do things consistent with that for a whole, and then slow fade is very poor dating etiquette and behavior.

My question is this, is it a bad move to reach out and clarify my feelings? I'd like to just point out that if he is not looking for something serious, he shouldn't use such leading language and behavior. Once you're no longer interested in someone, you should tell them so things can end without confusion. In my eyes this could save other women the time, effort and emotional drama I went through and also unburden me from feeling Iet myself down by allowing myself to be an option to someone who didn't care. I don't want to make things work with this person so what is the downside?

I was sad that he was leaving and asked when he was coming back. He said ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have any family to visit on Thanksgiving?‚Äù I stayed quiet because I didn‚Äôt wanna reveal that yes, I indeed don‚Äôt have any family and that I‚Äôd be alone today. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd feel so bad leaving you here alone all day. I‚Äôll take you out to dinner tonight and then I‚Äôll stay at your place after. Book the reservations now for 9pm‚Äù

I was so happy and told him how grateful I was that he was doing this and that yes , I indeed would be alone today. I kissed him goodbye and he left, and at 3pm I sent him the booked reservations for 8:45pm.

He didn‚Äôt answer for hours. This was our exchange.

(7:31 PM) Me: ‚Äúcoming where?‚Äù
(7:40 PM) Me: ‚Äú(his name) it‚Äôs 7:40‚Äù

He proceeds to call me at 7:57 PM and tells me he‚Äôs in a city 30 miles away (near where he lives) and that he drove up with his brother and he left his car at home. He then said he can‚Äôt do dinner but he can still come over. I told him to please not come over. 


I‚Äôm so heartbroken.

Last night was our third date and I offered her to come to my place and I'd cook for her.
She loved the idea and we had an amazing night. We made out and things got pretty intimate, we were all over each other. 
Than I took her to bedroom, we kissed and got more intimate there too but she suddenly stopped and said it was too fast for her and she'd like to know me more before we sleep.
I respected that and left the room to let her get dressed.
Before she left, she said she'd like to keep in touch but there was something off. I know she'll text tomorrow to call it off. 
I totally respect her and understand everyone is different.
That happened a few times now and I decided to not rush and not to have sex or invite someone to my place on 3rd date.
I was dating this girl few months back and we had such great vibe and we were intimate too but because of my previous experiences I didn't want to invite her to my place to have sex and next day she dumped me because she said she was looking for more intimacy (sex)
I'm actually very confused what women want. Some want to have sex on first date, some don't want to have sex until there's love.

However, as many of you might know, sometimes things don't work out the way you think they will. After that first date I felt something in myself that I have not felt since I was with my ex. Every date I went on, no matter how great of a match we were, there was no chemistry. But this girl finally gave it to me on that date--after such a long time. Now, after that date I called her and I got the news that she has developed a crush on someone else which is totally cool and all. She offered to ""stay friends"" which I declined because I value self respect a lot. However, what I did not anticipate was me thinking about her over and over again for the following month. Now im in this conflict of whether or not to text her--to see how things are going with her, or see if there is still a chance for me. However, as much as i like to, there is always something that pulls me off of doing it...

Also hasn't replied for 2 days after texting everyday for a month when I was talking about a show I watched (I personally found that rude because we were in middle of a conversation) and this is not the first time. I doubt he was just acting like a ""nice guy"" for the first few days.  
The thing is, I'm not even surprised anymore because that has been my situation with every person. I don't know if I'm doing anything wrong here. I try to be as nice as possible and I feel people see it as being too available? I don't get the point of pretending/ playing hard to get/ taking hours to reply just so the other person thinks I'm busy (as some sites suggest).

Just a bit of background: I am 26, she is 30. We have been dating for about 4 months now. She said she enjoys my company and I enjoy hers. We have agreed to meet up at least once a week.

We have been on all kinds of dates. Normally, when something pops up for a date, she suggests another time. Vice versa for me. We were planning on going to coffee this sat afternoon, but she canceled to go the the spa with a friend. She did not suggest another time: I said no problem, even though I was not too happy with it. I also suggested Friday or next week sometime. She said next week could work. After, we talked about other things: what she is going to do at the spa etc. She said she has no concrete date to be home, so i suggested if time permits we can hangout on sun. There was no reply, so I followed up again yesterday. Still no reply. I plan on calling her sun to ask how was the spa and talk about my feelings. It‚Äôs odd she doesn‚Äôt reply- normally she does within a day , no matter how busy. Have I been ghosted?

66,r2s31e,1637946924,Im in a confusing situation,"There's a girl in two of my classes that I have a crush on, we're both 16. Sorry this is long, I just wanted to provided detail if I could.

In the first class, there are two sets of three rows of desks, facing each other, and we face each other at an angle. 

The teacher's desk is on my side, but by the other wall where the whiteboard is. She doesn't really have a reason to look towards me because of whats going on in class, but I would see her look my direction a couple times each class. It wasn't a lot of staring or anything, but more than normal. I tried to avoid eye contact so im not being creepy, but it would occasionally happen, and typcally we both looked away quickly.

This goes on for about two weeks, and there was a time when I was working in the hall alone, she looked back at me over her shoulder. Again we didn't make eye contact, but I was alone so I can't imagine she was looking at something else. 

So, I go sit at her table in the the second class as she sits with a few of my friends, and we can move around to collaborate on worksheets. The first day, I ask the whole group if I should stay to do a mini presentation with them, or go back to my group. She's the first one to tell me to stay, but my friends do too. Normally she's quite shy around people she doesn't talk to, she'll talk really quietly and that sort of thing, so this kinda surprised me.

Over the following couple of weeks, I go to her table when we have worksheets. I could get her to laugh, but that was when everyone else laughed too. We've got a good bit in common, we both play soccer, we both have a lot of the same classes, that sort of thing. There was a time where a sub incorrectly said my last name, and she brought it up later when I went to her table. So, she's paying at least a little bit of attention to me even when I wasn't at her table. She also would lean over to watch if I was coming over to her table when my friends invited me over.

 I see a lot of good signs, and I ask for her number after a class. She gives it to me, I immediately text her so she has my number. That weekend I text her asking a question about soccer, as it's something we have in common and we can start talking more outside of class. I get no response.

So, I think she's not interested and I messed something up. But then she's staring even more in the first class. She'd glance over while laughing with her friends, she'd angle herself so she could face me, and she'd even lean up and over people at times to take a glance, and I noticed her messing with her hair sometimes, something I didn't previously notice. Again, I avoided directly looking at her as I thought she didn't want to talk to me and I didn't want to be weird.

A week goes by of this, but we moved tables in the second class so I no longer have an excuse to talk to her. I do manage to catch her before lunch one day, and I asked her why she didn't respond. She said she was at a soccer game so she couldn't text back, and apologized quite a bit. That doesn't really make sense why she couldn't text back later.

Another week goes by, and I decide to text her again, as I don't think I'll have a chance to randomly talk to her, and I have no other choice. I ask her if she didn't respond because she didn't want to talk to me, and tell her I don't mind if thats the case. Again, no response.

That was a thursday, and the day after she's staring waaaay more, and its pretty excessive. With the new seats in the second class, when she turns her head to look at the board she has an angle to look at me before she looks at the board. When im looking at the board I see her in my peripheral vision, and every single time she looked to the board from her notes and back, she paused for a moment when she had an angle to look at me. 

I am not exaggerating here, even though I wasn't directly looking at her, I could clearly she her head turned towards me, she was touching her hair a lot, and sometimes looked at something irrelevant like a wall after she paused for a moment, and sometimes staring for several seconds. Again, I never made eye contact as I thought she didn't want to talk to me.

This goes on for the following week, just toned down a bit. She's still messing with her hair frequently, and glancing over very frequently. We get off wednesday for thankgiving, so I finally decided I should try to talk to her before the break. I stare back that tuesday to get her attention, we made eye contact a few times and I'm pretty sure she noticed.

She left the first class a good before I did, but she was walking usually slowly and ended up right in front of me. I still was unsure of what she was thinking, so I just chickened out and slowed down too. After the second class we both go the same way again, so I figure I'll just try to talk to her then. I usually leave first, but this time some people I know wanted to talk about a recent test. She was about to leave behind me, but sees this and stops to look at her phone. As the group leaves, she follows, and I see her staring at me the whole time when I look over my shoulder at my friend. I figure I'd just wait for the group to leave to talk to her, but she goes home early. So, I feel like and idiot for letting the opportunity slip twice.

Based on that, is she interested or just being weird? I know all I can do is actually talk to her, I'd just like to see if someone else has a better understanding of wth is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally i'd just let it go by now, but she's a very nice person, she's also in like the top 1% of kids both academically and athletically, like she probably has an equal chance of getting into a D1 college for soccer or a 10% acceptance rate school. Plus, she's very pretty so if I have a shot I definitely dont want to quit before I figure out what's going on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2s31e/im_in_a_confusing_situation/
67,r2s3co,1637946948,Seeing someone with depression‚Ä¶don‚Äôt know what to do,"This is a long one, sorry in advance lol.

I‚Äôve been seeing a guy for just over a month now and it has been going well. We were texting almost everyday, and at one point I was seeing him 2-3 times a week. I‚Äôm aware that he has depression because he once mentioned he goes to therapy and explained his struggle with the loss of his dog this summer. Earlier this week, I texted him asking how his weekend was and he said he was having a rough day so I kept it simple and offered to help but also gave him space.

This week our communication died down a lot and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs not having a good week mentally. He would still check in and ask how my day was but it wasn‚Äôt a lot of back and forth like usual. On Wednesday, he eventually asked to see me Friday (today), but then a few hours into his work day today he texted me that he‚Äôs leaving early because he‚Äôs not feeling great and that he needs the night to himself. 

I‚Äôm a very empathetic person, however I don‚Äôt know what to do because I‚Äôve never been in this situation. I really like him and I know he likes me too but I‚Äôm afraid his depression is taking a toll on him and I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs ready to be pursuing a relationship. I am a very anxious/overthinking person myself so sometimes it‚Äôs hard to be patient because I do want to see him but I also want to give him space. 

Should I give him more space and wait for him to get a little better? Or should I ask him if he‚Äôs in a place where he can pursue anything? I really do like him and want what‚Äôs best for him, but I just don‚Äôt know if I can handle it long term.

I would try an app like Tinder, but it feels like most people use those apps to ""meet up for one night"" you know, which I'm probably wrong about. I just feel like I hear more stories of people looking to get physical than getting into long term relationships with those apps.

Where I live we have local churches dedicated to people between 18-30 who are single, but for some reason I get the feeling no one will have similar hobbies and tastes and stuff, which is also probably a wrong assumption since my other religious friends have the same tastes and sense of humor as me.

I want someone who is really nerdy, loves to play video games, loves super heroes, is kinda introverted etc. And I feel like I‚Äôm being too obsessive when I probably already have good enough of a plan set, which is going to places where I can find my type including geek conventions like comic con, gamestores, game tournaments etc.
And a matter of fact I have tried online dating too like Tinder and none of that worked for me cause I could never really find me type, I honestly feel like most of the girls on dating apps just want attention and so I think they may have gotten in the way of me actually finding who I‚Äôm looking for. And I would try non dating sites too like discord and any online game that I like to play but then I always have thoughts like ‚Äúdo I really want to have a long distance relationship? How do I know if this is a catfisher or not? How do I know if this girl is my type in terms of looks?‚Äù
Also something else to note too is that I bet alot of girls that play online always mute people probably because of all of the weirdos that they come across.
But yeah I honestly feel like I‚Äôm overthinking a little bit.

Or should I wait on her?,"Been talking to this girl for a few months everyday, we were so close that we bought gifts for each other and cooked for each other all the time. All of a sudden she stops calling me and texts me back whenever she feels like. So I just told her that I was afraid that we'd stop talking, and I just don't understand why. I also told her I don't think she feels the same as me...
She responded:

 ""I did feel a connection, I'm not even gonna lie about that. But Mike idk right now ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my head is not in that space anymore. And like I can't be like side tracked because I'm tryna reach my goals.""
""Like I promise it was me that started showing change. And it's not even the fact that I didn't feel the same, I just can't focus on us right now... and I'll be leaving soon anyways.. so like...""

I'm really inlove with her and don't want to lose her, how should I handle this? She's also leaving for college in a couple months.

Around the same time we met online I met another girl and went on a date with her shortly after the first girl. I have *not* slept with either woman. Only brief kissing.   


How do I approach if girl one asks if I am seeing other women? Right now I don't know100%  who I would want to be with completely as Ive only seen each a maximum of 2 times.

Masculine or Feminine men"," So it's something I have been curious about as a man, since conventional wisdom around me dictates that women like more strong masculine guys, but then I see these huge fanbases of actors and musicians who are more feminine looking like Kpop singers and many Hollywood actors as well.

So I wanna ask you what type of man do you like?

Also if you are somewhere in between, then I'll make a scale:

Let's say feminine is zero and masculine is 100. Then give me your preference in masculine and feminine in terms of a number",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2v7oj/girls_who_do_you_like_more_masculine_or_feminine/

96,r2vgy9,1637956772,How do you find balanve between getting better and you are good enough for relationship?,"Hello

I am 23(M) and Flfor quite some time I have this chain of thoughts about me as potential partner. I have never been in a relationship or dated for a reasons I am about to explain. I am following few rules like trying to make my own life happy before I find someone so I do not depend on the other person as main reason to be happy in life. As well I am trying to like myself in terms of looks and character. It all sounds like good plan yet I think these do not have end goal. At once I want to be better but from the other I would be happy to have someone on that journey so I can share happiness and hopefully make the other side life better along the way. 

So I almost did not date at all. I had two usuccessful attempts to ask out for a date before pandemic but it was alright since I understood reasons.

Is this vicous cycle that I need to get out of? Do you relate to that ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2vgy9/how_do_you_find_balanve_between_getting_better/
