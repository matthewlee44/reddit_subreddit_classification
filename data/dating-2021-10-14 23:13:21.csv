0,q8giws,1634271627,M Turning 26 and Feel Like I'm Reaching my Expiration Date,"I know this is silly. I can ""logically"" realize it's silly and irrational but no matter how much I logically refute it I still ""feel"" this way. I ""feel"" like I'm getting too old to find love. I worry that as I age my dating pool is going to shrink and that eventually, I'll just be too old to be viable or lovable. 

And I feel worse because there was a brief moment of time when I had real love. It might be rose-colored glasses but it really felt perfect. Maybe it's that I'm no longer that young and my hormones have leveled out and I'll never feel the love that same way again. 

I'm honestly wondering what's the point, I have a great life in every single other respect but the one thing I want more than this awesome job, or this money is a partner and I can't seem to find one. Hell, the only reason I want his job and this money are to support my loved ones and children. But I can't even get that so what's the point? 

I'm sorry this is a lot of vent and layout but I just feel frustrated as I grow a year older than I had everything I wanted for a moment and lost it.

1,q8gkx6,1634271825,Did I miss a hint?,"So I got in a bit of an awkward situation a few weeks ago. I’m a college student and I briefly met this girl from last semester but didn’t have much interaction with her. Well apparently I’m not as good at recognizing faces as I thought I was and this semester I was in the cafeteria and I thought another girl was the same person from last semester (to be fair they both have red hair and masks were required so I didn’t fully see her face but still embarrassing either way) and I approached her and made some friendly conversation asking how her week had been and stuff like that. Because of the way she responded it seemed like she recognized me so I thought it was the same person and asked if I could have dinner with her, and she said yes and I ended up sitting with her and her friends.

Someone mentioned her name and as soon as that happened I realized it was the wrong person and I was embarrassed and worried that I had come across as creepy because in their perspective it was like some random guy asked if he could dinner with a girl and I was the only guy at the table as well. I then apologized and explained what had happened and then just had a general friendly conversation to try and make the situation less awkward. Well fast forward to last week and she saw me in the cafeteria as I was eating and came over to say hi while she was holding her food and it lasted a few seconds and then she left, but then I was wondering if I had just missed a “hint” that she wanted to have dinner again.

So just from this information how do you think I came across? I’m thinking that I must have not seemed creepy otherwise I doubt she would’ve gone up and said hi, and then I was wondering why she seemed excited the first time I asked (when I thought it was someone else). So do you think she was just being nice and thought I was just being nice, do you think she was creeped out, or do you think there’s a chance she’s into me somehow?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8gkx6/did_i_miss_a_hint/

5,q8h4ye,1634273967,"As a more introverted person, I have a hard time trying to establish relationships.","Hello everyone! So this is my first post here, and I wanted to see about getting some advice from other people who have come from varied lifestyles and such. 

&amp;#x200B;

For context, as the title says, I've always been more of an introverted person. I tend to keep my circle of friends relatively small, and said circle tends to share similar interests and the like with me as well. Now one may ask, ""Well why not simply expand that circle?"", which lies the biggest issue for me, or at least one of them, but we'll get to the second issue later. So when it comes to expanding my circle, it's difficult for me in one way, but not another. Finding groups that I hang out with online and such is fairly easy for me, as often times it's just a matter of people with similar interests. But as for expanding the circle in a more ""real-life"" setting, if you will, I find it much harder. That's not to say I have never had IRL friends and such, I do, but therein lies my second issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never been sure exactly why, but I have this one of two bad tendencies when it comes to establishing potential relationships with those within my circle. The first issue I've often run into is that person already having a significant other, in some form or fashion, in their life. This has happened to me too many times count and has often been a great sting to me. The second tendency is born from fear, and that's not speaking up at all. I don't exactly take rejection the best, at least not always, so out of fear of potentially making myself look like a fool or losing a friend because of a confession, I often times remain silent.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I'm just not sure where to go from this point. When it comes to hobbies and such, I mostly only have interest in things like gaming, anime, and the like, so if I'm not at work or out running an errand of some kind, I'm usually just at my apartment playing games and chatting with friends. College is in a kind of weird spot for me right now, as I may end up taking the remainder of my classes online just to help out with being able to work and such. Side note, I just moved out on my own, and although I have financial support to a degree, I still have to put in the time to keep things up and running, while also having enough time set aside to ""live my life"". I've also tried many dating apps, and all have flopped for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious to hear what advice anyone can spare, as I'm stuck in this sorta loop where I'm unsure of what to do or where to go.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8h4ye/as_a_more_introverted_person_i_have_a_hard_time/

8,q8hc8g,1634274730,I'm not sure how to approach dating.,"I've been trying to figure out how I want to date.  

I'm a female in my late 20s who hasn't really had a lot of dating experience. I just did not grow up very confident and didn't really see myself as attractive. I've also just focused on my studies and finding work. These past years though, I've slowly been feeling more confident and started putting myself out there more.

I've only been on a couple of dates with only a handful of people. Ultimately I would like to be in a long-term committed relationship. But since I'm only just starting, I'm trying to find a balance between exploring/having fun, but at the same time not wasting mine or anyone else's time. Its definitely not the easiest thing to find a serious relationship and if I focus only on that, I feel like I would face a lot of disappointment. On the other hand, I'm not sure only hooking up is something someone without much experience like me can maneuver easily. Although, like I said, I do like being physical and having fun. Talking/seeing several people feels like a chore to me but maybe it's something I should get better at?

Right now I'm talking to someone who I've gone on dates with who has been dropping hints that he's not ready for something serious. I enjoy spending time and having fun with him and I don't think I want commitment from him right now, but I find that I've been wanting consistent communication and more time spent together. 

Does any of this make sense? Haha. Do I just need to find someone looking for the same thing as me? What exactly am I looking for? 🙃 Haha.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8hc8g/im_not_sure_how_to_approach_dating/

We’ve been on about 4 dates in this past month and text every day. We’ve been moving pretty slowly and haven’t kissed yet, but things have been going pretty well and we always have a good time, so I haven’t minded. 

Tonight we were texting and asking about each others days when he casually (as if we were still just friends) told me he had a threesome with one of his friends and his girlfriend earlier today.

We haven’t talked about being exclusive, and it’s only been a month so I obviously shouldn’t expect for us to be, but the fact he so casually mentioned having sex with other people kinda made me feel a certain way. He didn’t tell me about people he was having sex with when we were just friends, so I find it strange that he is now that we are dating. I guess I just assumed since I haven’t been having sex with or talking to anyone else, that he wouldn’t be either.

13,q8hznw,1634277505,Where can I meet women looking for more than just casual flings?,"I'm 45 and both a career professional and musician who does not lack for opportunities for shallow, uncommitted sex. This was fine in my 20's but I'm getting on in my years and I've had so much shallow, lame sex that I'm just tired of it. It's never very good, the women often have alcohol and/or substance abuse problems, lack maturity and good sense and don't make good partners.

I am out playing music several nights a week and what I see from the stage is depressing. Women my age who should want a stable partner acting like college girls interested in only one thing. Getting as drunk as possible and cougaring up with the youngest, hottest stud they can for a night before going back to their unhappy lives. They consistently claim they don't want a stable relationship of any kind. They want their cats, kids and the occasional disposable stud to bang them.

Many times they want me to be that disposable stud and they get mad at me because we're vibing, flirting, even making out etc but then when they want to go home with me or want to take me home I tell them I never hook up with a woman on the first night I meet them. That upsets them, like I'm rejecting them. But I'm not. I'm just bored with drunken, disposable sex and want to see them a few times before having sex! I want sex to be the.consumation of a committed relationship.

Is that so horrible? Is this what America has come to that a man who displays respect for his body and the bodies of his sexual partners some kind of loser now and it's socially expected for a man to automatically take the lame one night stand sex and just be happy he got laid in a half ass manner?

It just sucks! Many men would kill to have access to what I have but I'm lonely for a real life partnership. A woman I can start a business with, buy property with, get her out of her apartment where she's living with her kids and pets and build a beautiful home together.

I'm a progressive guy. I cook, I clean, I work, I pay my bills and I play music for the social opportunity it provides me. I neither drink to excess or do drugs. Women know I have plenty to offer but they seem determined to do it all on their own even though for most single people that is impossible to achieve alone. It takes two incomes to build wealth and financial security. Very few singles will ever achieve it going it alone.

Online dating doesn't work for me. It's all scammers and filtered photos and disappointment. 

People say ""Well you are in the wrong places to meet good women"" but there are no other places to find single women that I can find. All I find are women who are married and happy and women who are single and content if not actually happy. I hear lame solutions like join a Yoga class, as if I'm into yoga. Volunteer, as if I have time between my career and music. I'm not giving up what I love to do or doing something just to meet women.

A little bit of objective advice would be immensely appreciated, for I am deeply confused...

I (20F) was spontaneously contacted by a ""friend"" (25M) via Instagram last week.  While we have not spoken in over a year and a half, he was eager to exchange numbers and revisit the past, stating that his most recent musical discovery reminded him of me. As I have always fancied this bloke, the reconnection proved as a most pleasant surprise...

That is, until the mixed signals ensued. Despite his regular exhibitions of flirtatious behaviour (emojis, innuendos, etc.) and what appears as a seeming appreciation for our conversations, I cannot properly read his intentions toward me!  Does he simply like me as a friend, or does he want more?

Due to the litany of torturous questions infesting my mind, I finally addressed the situation this evening by laying my cards on the table, for BS is not tolerated in my book. Instead of providing me with a direct answer, he proceeded to dance around my request to know where he stood, finally saying ""I like you"" after what felt like an eternity of inquiring.  He confessed that he sometimes does not know his emotions well enough to pass them along, vehemently protesting that he is ""doing his best though"" and encouraging me to ask more direct questions due to the fact that he does ""not know what \[I\] want."" How could I possibly make it more clear? 😂

After this, I plainly wrote that I needed to know whether or not I am a friend, something more, or just a person to talk to in his eyes....His response? ""I think all three of those things."" What does this mean? 😂It is impossible to get a straight answer out of this guy, and I honestly do not know if this is a red flag or not (probably). 

Although frustrated by his murky response, I begrudgingly let the matter slide as we continued to converse in a lighthearted manner for the remainder of the night.  He opened up to me about some personal matters, leading me to (foolishly) suppose that he might truly consider me as more than a mere friend...however, his indecision nevertheless prompts me to question whether or not the feelings are truly mutual.

As I am a guarded person who desperately resists heartache, I do not know whether to go with the flow, continue as friends, or end the discourse between us entirely...

Based upon the evidence provided, what are your thoughts?  Am I overthinking the matter, or should I be wary and preserve my emotional wellbeing before furthermore pursuing whatever the two of us are currently engaged in?

22,q8jcck,1634283406,Power Imbalance in a Relationship,"I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (19F) for close to 8 months now. I've fallen in love before and have had both serious and casual relationships.

She's never been in a relationship before. Just a few crushes which didn't result in anything more than talking.

We met at work together (she's pursuing college from distance and working to support her family). She told me she had a crush on me, we met a few times, and kissed. It was her first ever kiss.

I was subconsciously aware of the power imbalance it might have, and right after the first kiss ""She asked me do you love me"". While I definitely didn't love her at that point, I was attracted to her and told her the same. Further I tried to explain, how she might be surging in emotions but she doesn't know me fully, and to take time before deciding if she loves me"". 

Over time, we met more, and fell in love. However, the one thing I've noticed is, the more I started expressing myself or doing things like calling her more, or being sweet, she's a little pulled back. Not like she doesn't enjoy talking or meeting. During our meets, we can't keep our hands off each other even. The spark and attraction is definitely there.

However, in a weird way I feel I have started to get affected from her mood a lot more. Like wanting to meet her more, wanting to be on call, etc. I don't become clingy, I might call once, if she's busy, I won't force her or even request to talk more. I respect individual space, but I feel the desire to talk, or communicate is greater on my end than hers.

However, she does give me occasional hints on how deeply she is invested into me and wants a long term. She has introduced me to her family and close friends.

So my question is, 
1)Is it fair to assume I have a power imbalance due to it being her first relationship? If so, how to difuse the imbalance?

2) The situation of wanting to talk more, weirdly I was worried that she's going to want to talk constantly and I might have to limit it. But the initiating feels a lot more on my end

25,q8jz4x,1634286325,Is the 4th date too soon to ask about exclusivity? I know it’s case by case and different for each person,"So far we’ve been on three dates and due to go on the 4th tonight. We’ve been seeing each other for a month and the last date we got more intimate than usual, cuddling in cinema, more physical contact and a lengthy make out session at the end.

We text a lot in between, we both respond after a few hours with detailed texts. We both ask each other questions, emojis etc and she always seems keen to meet up. For tonight I mentioned half 6, but she said 7 would be better as she may be working late so she’ll meet me wherever by getting a taxi etc.

Whilst I’m still using the Bumble app to swipe and reply, I don’t have the same interest and effort in others as I do with this girl. I’m happy to delete the app and just date her, but worried what if it’s too soon for her? I guess I won’t know until I ask, but don’t want her to run a mile if I’m pushing it too fast (I guess if she likes me she won’t run a mile).

The only thing putting me off is that a couple of days after our third date, she updated her main dating picture which signals to me she may want to keep her options open at the present time. I’ve not asked her if she’s dating anyone else as I’d rather not know.

Do you think I should bring this up or let her bring it up in time?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8jz4x/is_the_4th_date_too_soon_to_ask_about_exclusivity/
26,q8k0uw,1634286564,Learned my lesson the hard way. First ever boyfriend played me good. What a way to experience dating for the first time.,"I (25F)admit I trusted so much and give him(27M) lots of chances. Even though my guts telling ne pretty clearly he's not worth it. 

So my story started when I met this guy in tinder. I signed up there pretty optimistic that I'll met someone great man there. As what I see to others. But I was completely wrong. 

First signed I should've have noticed was that he was doing a lot love bombing. As it's my first time for someone to notice I thought wow I'm special. He said ily the very first month. Promises a lot of so many things. Very sweet. Always talking to me. We talked for 2 more years. Then one he just claimed I'm his gf lol. But that time I want to be pursued abd court with. But I ignored that since I fell in love with him in the 2 years we're talking. So I thought he's serious with me. 

1 yr went by and there's still no effort coming from him. So question and doubted a lot. I confront him but he said he's doing he's best to be with me. But turns out he got another girlfriends. My heart dropped when I found that out. Maybe it's my fault too for not listening to intuition. I know deep inside something's wrong but I ignored it. 

Not fun experiencing this. It was not love all along but a huge manipulation. With this I know now how to spot red flags and drop them immediately. 

I gave him my everything but turns out I'm nothing to him. Now I can relate to heartbreak songs 😁✌️",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8k0uw/learned_my_lesson_the_hard_way_first_ever/

28,q8k20j,1634286705,The thought of initiating with women makes me very uncomfortable,"So uh i've always been like this i think, at least my teen years and adult years which is a long time. Back in school i was too afraid to talk with women, was afraid they'd find out i found her desirable and get called out for being creepy and a weirdo. I have completely desexualized and deromanticized myself, make myself as nonthreatening as possible, i dare not make any kind of jokes or implications about romance or dating or anything silly like a joke, no initiating ever, it's wrong to be attracted to women as a man, it might be creepy to women. i dare not ever touch a woman cuz it might accidentally be sexual assault or harassment. It can be summarized that i walk on eggshells around women, very tiny little kingfisher eggs. I am potential creepy sexual assaulter just by being born as a man and every woman is wary of men.

I'll never be able to date, maybe if she (who? lol) approaches me first, but even then i'd just blow the chance by just being too afraid to take it further cuz that's what i gotta do as a man taking things further as dictated by gender norms so nothing would ever happen. I like being a man otherwise but when it comes to dating and otherwise social stuff with women i'm deathly afraid.

29,q8k82z,1634287530,Was it a ONS?,"Never thought I'd post about my personal life on Reddit, but here we are. Last week, I (21f) went out with a female friend to a bar with no specific intentions of meeting anyone. I saw a cute guy (let's call him X, 24m) out of the corner of my eye and pointed him out to my friend. We then quickly moved onto talking about something else. 

Thirty minutes later, a different guy (Y, 24m) approached me to tell me how beautiful my hair was. I looked up and saw X standing right behind him. I couldn't believe my luck! I was a little tipsy (and thus more honest/disinhibited than usual) and said ""Thanks, but I really like your friend."" X was obviously shy and blushed. The two sat down with me and my friend, and we talked for about an hour. All four of us left together to go to Y's apartment and listen to music. 

X and I and my friend and Y quickly paired up. It was obvious that Y was more suave, but during the walk from the bar, X offered me his jacket, put his hand on my shoulder/arm at times during conversations, and asked me lots of questions about my interests and career goals. Once we got at Y's place, X and I danced for about an hour together. He was ridiculously respectful of boundaries.

I went into the kitchen to get a drink, and X followed me. He told me that I was beautiful, and I instinctively hugged him. We kissed, but he broke away and said ""You're a beautiful girl, and I don't want to do the wrong thing. I'm nervous."" I told him he was overthinking, and he kissed me again. It was amazing, and I led him by the hand to the guest room. 

We hooked up, and he was very focused on making sure I had a good time. After the fact, he held me for an hour and asked me things that I've never been asked before by a man on a first ""date:"" whether I'd had a lot of boyfriends, whether I preferred ONSs or serious relationships, etc. I was pleasantly surprised. I told him I should get home before it got too late, and he offered to walk me. However, on the walk home he said he wished I could come over to his place. I agreed but made it clear I just wanted to sleep. When we got there, he completely respected my wishes and we took a nap together. 

Sounds like a real, right? Here's where it gets confusing. That morning, we exchanged numbers. I didn't hear from him after leaving, so I texted that afternoon to thank him for everything and ask if he'd like to see me again. He said he would and that he had a great time. After five days, I didn't get a text inviting me out for the next weekend. I decided to swallow my pride and ask him if he'd like to see me during Halloween weekend. This was yesterday, and I still haven't heard back. Is he not interested anymore? Was he just looking to hook up? I can't stop thinking about him and want to know if it's time to just move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8k82z/was_it_a_ons/
30,q8k83t,1634287534,Extremely Vertically Challenged...,"So I'm a 5 foot even male in the US

I've been having some trouble dating, both online (tinder, bumble, hinge, okc, etc ) and offline. My height has obviously been the source of a lot of self esteem issues. I'm definitely trying to work around it by hitting the gym, cleaning up my appearance, getting more hobbies and interests, and just generally trying to have a better outlook on life. I used my height as an excuse to complain for a long time but I do realize I had more growing to do (pun not intended). 

I definitely want to believe that yeah, maybe I got dealt a crappy hand with the height thing but I can work around it in other ways. I also acknowledge that it's personal preference and I can't really get upset (I have my type as well). I do always call my height out in my online profiles because I'm not looking to waste anyone's time - if you aren't interested, thanks for looking, I'll move along. 

However, I kind of keep getting dragged back down when I see tinder profiles with women demanding 6foot plus or taller than them or posts on reddit like ""I'm 5'6"" - women don't like me because I'm short"". It's a bit demotivating seeing that dudes with half a foot plus on me are getting called short. It might just be a vocal minority but I'm never quite sure.

I knew the bf too and he was a real nice guy and I just feel for the guy. The way she exaplined it to me is that she was tired of being weighed down and she felt like she gave up more than what she got back.

I just can’t believe that she’s dancing around and acting like nothing happened, meanwhile I know that dude is devasted and he was a pretty good dude from the times I hungout with him. Even worse the guy she made out with and is kind of seeing, they hung out alone while she was still in a relationship. This is a close female friend and I consider her like a good friend, and I voiced my opinions and I think she thinks that I’m just jealous or something but I just witnessing firsthand how shitty people can be.

36,q8lpna,1634294209,My maternal grandfather had a stroke in the house of his mistress as she nursed their newborn son. My paternal grandfather is a bigamist who adopted the children of his 2nd wife while neglecting his own. My father is a hero to everyone but neglects his own family. How do I 31F choose a good man?,"\*My maternal grandfather\* had a stroke in the house of his mistress as she was nursing their newborn son. It took my grandmother days to find out what had happened to him, when she eventually tracked him down in hospital she got the update that he was a having a multiple year affair and that he'd never be himself again all in one go. 

He never spoke or walked again as a result of his condition. My grandmother nursed him until his death 15 years later while the other woman made a scene and ensured everyone knew of her and her son's existence. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*My paternal grandfather\* married my grandmother very young before moving abroad alone to work. He would return once a year and had 3 children by her. He never physically raised my dad or his siblings, but practised bigamy; marrying another woman in his new country and taking on her children, being a father to them in a way he'd never been to his own. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*My father\* treats my mother like something off the bottom of his shoe. 

&amp;#x200B;

He has raised his hand to my mother and rationalizes away the disrespect and aggression I receive from my younger brother. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father walked out on our family and moved to another country for 5 years, reinvented himself and returned. My mother was loyal to him the entire time.

&amp;#x200B;

The year he left I was 7, for one year I helped my mum cover the fact that we were home alone at that age because she couldn't afford childcare - I would pick my brothers from class, we'd walk home, I'd dish dinner, help with homework and put my younger brothers to bed while she worked round the clock. My maternal grandmother arrived a year latet from her home country to help raise us.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had 2 boyfriends since 18 who were both a year long. Disrespect, ogling, cheating, physically assaulting me, telling me to use lotions to lighten my skin, telling me to get surgery to enhance myself. I had a getting to know eachother situation that never went further as I flipped out that he'd never replied to my text - I could see he was snap chatting a woman he liked more (his ex) while still getting to know me (in those days you could see others interactions). He also would describe in detail his conquests knowing that I wanted to wait until marriage. Oneday he stood me up as he went to the airport to pick up one of his past women that he'd slept with to drop her home supposedly.

&amp;#x200B;

I basically allow myself to be in situations where there isn't any respect. How do I change these habits without being too protective and assuming the worst. But not being so trusting that I become an idiot again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 31 and single. I worry all the time that I'll get cheated on and I see red flags everywhere. This is complicated by the fact that I'm waiting until marriage so I'm risking not living with whoever I meet before the wedding. I've been trying to go for more sensitive not as machismo guys, this backfired when I settled on a guy who was very conservative and slow in getting to know me, no sexual energy. I thought he was being gentlemanly and respectful. It turns out he was gay and deep in the closet.

&amp;#x200B;

How to filter out to choose the good \*straight\* men. And how do I trust these good men so they aren't a casualty of my past experiences and assumptions. I'm triggered to write this as my parents were returning from a trip 2 hours away but my mum had to stay behind and sort something out at one of her rental homes (my dad is always telling her to sell up but I know if she didn't have financial independence her life would be even morw of a nightmarw than it is now). When he was supposed to be almost home my dad called saying it'd take him about 2 to 3 hours extra to get in due to traffic on one of the most well known routes, and so he'd have to do a detour. I flipped out insisting it wouldn't take 3 hours, that he should stay on the route if the new one would take double the time. He started trying to talk over me getting hysterical etc. I said ""whatever you think is right you do that"" to which he got hysterical ""omg, what are you trying to say, what are you trying to say?!"". 

&amp;#x200B;

He was home within an hour. 

So where did the magical 2 hour addition to the route pop up?

&amp;#x200B;

My thought that he was cruising has been confirmed these past few days as I've withdrawn from him, he's responding similarly and he is now  hovering when my mother was asking if I was ok.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8lpna/my_maternal_grandfather_had_a_stroke_in_the_house/

And, the consensus is that most women do not want to be approached or courted at the gym. So it's a catch 22. The place that they frequent the most is a no-go zone. And the places where it's socially acceptable to approach and meet them are in places that they frequent often 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Due to both of us getting Covid one after an other, then me going away, then him moving 2 hours away for his job we haven't actually met despite talking multiple times a week. (He is a pro sports person so he can't just take annual leave and often has weekend matches). 

When we first started talking I admit I didn't know what I wanted. I was fairly newly single and just enjoying getting to know new people. Our conversations started quite innocent but flirty and we soon moved to texting off the app, but neither of us specified what we were looking for. 

Over the weeks we started having deeper conversations but also more sexual ones. I was going through a bit of a crisis and he was a really good listener throughout. We started to speak over video chat and have also had a few explicit video chats (not to go into too finer detail). Despite the sexual nature of a lot of our calls he is extremely respectful and has confided in me that he doesn't like the player image of his job. 

It's got to the stage where I am starting to see this person as a potential partner despite the distance and sexual conversations. However, we are planning on finally meeting in a few weeks and I have no doubt it will lead to sex. My issue is that a few weeks ago I would have been happy with this, we have insane chemistry and I am very attracted to him, but now I am concerned that I will gain more feelings for this person. I think I have been giving vibes of not wanting a relationship up until now (which was true) but now I am second thinking this. 

I know we need to have the conversation about what we want but I have no idea how to do this without sounding really forward considering we have never met. It is also in the back of my mind that he is somewhat well known and and have joked before that he could get anyone he wanted to why is he calling me. I know this is a silly thing to think but it does concern me that even though I know he doesn't sleep around he is quite in demand from women.

About a month into our relationship my bf had been searching for an apartment so he could move out of his parents house. I was able to set him up to get an apartment next to mine (i live with my mom). 

Right as he was moving in, my mom got covid so i needed to be out of the house (unless i got covid) so i ended up staying with my bf, during the week of the move. a few days after the move (i had been staying with him for a week at this point) we both ended up getting covid and then needed to quarantine ourselves for two weeks, so i ended up staying for even longer. 

After we were out of quarantine we knew the healthy thing to do would be to take a break so we spent a night apart, and then after that i went back to staying at his apartment. since then, (a month and a half later) ive stayed over every night. we take time apart during the day sometimes, but never for the night because we just want to be together. 

i love the way things are going with him, i truly feel like this is going to be a long lasting relationship and he's everything ive ever wanted, but i also know the honeymoon phase of course doesn't last forever. although i feel we have already moved past that, it feels like we've been together for longer than we have and it's just going great. but 

i have been struggling basically living somewhere for two months, without paying for rent or a majority of food/bills, without a place for my clean and dirty clothes, or a place to hang my purse when i get home. ive brought this up to him, and he said hes not ready to officially move in together (which is completely understandable) but that he likes the way things are now and doesnt want them to change. i think hes scared of the commitment that comes when i move all of my stuff into his apartment. and i completely get it, but im not fully sure what to do. we came to the conclusion that we would just get me a hamper and a hook, and i suggested rediscussing our situation in a couple months. but im afraid of what happens if this conversation never changes and he never officially wants me to move in because of his past, or am i just overthinking things? ive made it clear im not trying to rush him, i wont ever pressure anyone to do such a thing, but im just a bit lost",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8mbyl/am_i_overthinking_things_or_rushing/

I asked her if she wanted to meet up again the next day. She told me that she was attracted to me and that we got on well but that she sensed that we wouldnt be right together. She said we should just be friends as she's too busy right now anyway.

I don't really understand? Has anyone had this feeling before? I feel like an 1 hour together is not enough time to really tell if that's even true. I told her I wanted to meet again because I felt attracted to her too and I would like to get to know her more. She hasn't replied but she read the message 🤦‍♀️",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8np0c/date_said_she_was_attracted_to_me_but_just_wants/
50,q8nvoc,1634302664,Need advice for first college date/hang out,"So I (18M) have been dating around and every now and then hooking up for around the past year and a half after getting out of a relationship. I normally just don’t talk to one girl because I like to have my options open. I ended up dating this really sweet girl and things were going great but just didn’t work out in the end. It was mainly my fault and made me want to better myself and focus on relationships more.

I just started college and pretty much only have experience with highschool girls and other college freshmen. Anyways, I started using Tinder again (mainly as a joke and messing around with people or trying to find friends for parties and stuff) and I connected with this girl (20F). We started connecting off the start and we’ve been texting the past few days. 

I’m one who likes to date or do something as soon as possible when talking to a new girl. We go to a big party school that throws big day time parties. We planned on possibly going to the party (if I don’t have to stay till work) or if that doesn’t work going to her house and sharing drinks. 

I’ve never been on a date with drinks and such and normally I kind of just chill and watch a movie and possibly go out to dinner. Any ideas on what we can do? Was thinking maybe listen to music and drink and possibly attempt at cooking food or watching movies like normal. Or should I let her take control of what to do? She also has roommates in her sorority so keep that in mind.

I have a lot of girl friends that are trying to date and they are constantly getting played by the same few fuck boys that play every girl on campus. 

Like when they’re talking to a new guy typically they’ll show me what he looks like, and I’m easily able to tell if he’s a fuck boy or not. Like just from one picture I can be like yes he’s going to play you and they never believe me. But fast forward a month and they’re crying about how he used them for sex and it’s hard for me to be empathetic.

59,q8odzq,1634304281,Just wanted to say I had the perfect 1st date last night,"We met online. I’ve (F23) met many guys off of online earlier and the experiences weren’t that great. That’s why also my standards to meet anyone new were so high I thought I’d never meet anyone again - just too much stress, awkwardness and hassle. 

I matched with this guy (M27) and immediately noticed he’s very very handsome (like out of my league🙊). A week or so of chatting online we ended up going for late night movies.

Immediately when I met him I noticed he’s extremely tall. I’m considered medium tall in where I am so it felt soo refreshing to feel small next to him.

He was super chill, smiling and made me laugh from the beginning. But I wasn’t sure does he like me, totally. Small details I loved about the date was insisted on paying (even though I offered to pay for mine), held the doors open for me and was just respectful overall. I’m usually not shy but given how attracted I was to him, I didn’t have the guts to do stuff I usually would, like touch his arms or similar. 

When the movie ended, I started putting my jacket on, but he didn’t hurry to leave. We just sat there and enjoyed the credits. At this point I realized he might like me  _maybe_ lol.

**The end of our date was like from the movies, though**. We walked out of the theater, the city was empty at 1 am. We both had to depart to opposite directions of the same street. 

So he looked at me and then hugged me sooo tightly, felt amazing though. I just whispered to his ear “I had an amazing night”. He then looked at me, I looked up at him (to the sky basically of the height difference). He asked “will we meet again?”, I immediately responded “absolutely we will”.

Then, I automatically just looked at his lips and he leaned in for a kiss. 

After that we just both departed to separate directions quietly. :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8odzq/just_wanted_to_say_i_had_the_perfect_1st_date/

I'd like to take the next step to spending time in a more casual environment. I invited her over last Saturday to watch some football games, but she wanted to meet up at a sports bar instead. Later I thought that might have been a bit forward for a third date, so I said to her ""I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable by doing so, just wanted to spend time together outside of a bar or restaurant."" She said ok but quickly changed the subject.

We're going out again next Friday to a pretty nice place. I'm looking forward to it as neither of us have been there, and I've heard rave reviews about it. 

So far I can tell she likes going on dates with me, and kisses me every time we part, so I think she likes me at least a little bit.

I'm wondering when/how to move past dates and doing more stuff together outside of that framework. I guess a big part of my ""love language"" is physical touch, and it feels weird not having that with someone I have feelings for. I don't mean to push for sex (which could be how this is interpreted), but cuddling on the couch might be nice. Willing to wait for that. Just don't want to wait in vain.

I know there were things could have done better. Like communicating my feelings better at the beginning. However some things that stuck with me I'm still wondering and confused about are....

After the second date my ex wanted to be official...this made me uneasy and I said I wasn't ready. 

A few dates later she told me that her previous fling ended because he was all in and ready to move with her  within a month..... I took this as she was slow moving like me and very independent. However when she ended it she said I didn't seem to be very into her. Yet I was taking her to meet my close friends and family within two months. 

After two months she began talking about moving in with each other and joked about getting married. This really surprised me and confused me. I told her I moved slowly emotionally and convide that to her since I had been burned in the past. 

In the end of the relationship she wouldn't take any blame for the failed relationship and blamed me and everyone else for it. She also lied about falling for someone else while we were together. Which before I knew I was blameing myself completely 

She then begged that we stay friends and made an effort to stay in my life even after I had set boundaries

68,q8pp7u,1634308402,Disparaging herself to push me away?,"I met a woman about 2 weeks ago that I was very interested in. I met her on a clinical rotation for nursing school. She was nerdy, artistic, gorgeous and not afraid to get her hands dirty. We actually met when she asked me for help cleaning a patient, we met when we were both wrist deep in poop haha. 

We chatted a bit after that, exchanged social media and ended up going on a date. It went really well, we spent 3 hours just sitting at the restaurant talking.  I felt a lot of chemistry and we shared a sweet kiss at the end. 

She came over last night and her whole demeanor changed. I was hungry and told
her I was ordering some food and offered to buy her dinner too. She said no because the last guy who bought her drinks said she owed him a hand job because he spent money on her. I told her that sex isn’t a quid pro quo for me and I just want to buy her dinner. I told her that for me sex is a freely given sign of affection shared between two people. 

She was a completely different person from when we met and when we were on that date. She tells me that she is “an emotionless *****” and that she can’t feel anything for anyone. She said her empathy is gone and she doesn’t care about anyone. She tells me she just got out of a relationship 2 months (which she said was her first one) ago and she’s still torn up about it. When I asked how long they were together (assuming it was years) she told me 4 months! Dafuq. 

She said she sees all men as “the same person” and I asked if she saw me that way and replied “kinda”. I said “ouch” and she goes “I said kinda”.  When I asked her if she wanted to keep seeing me she said she did because I’m not like most guys she’s dated. Then she tells me she’s been on 20 dates with 20 different guys in the 2 months since she broke up with her ex. Idk if she was trying to make me jealous but all I said was “everyone has a past, I’m about the present and the future”. 

I def do not want to pursue anything more with her, but i can’t shake the feeling that she said all that to purposely push me away. That she isn’t interested and just wanted to spare my feelings.  I thought I did everything right. I’m not pushy on the physical stuff, I listen attentively, I’m always kind and caring. I don’t expect anything and I’m not entitled. I really don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 

I’m disappointed. I’m so tired of this kind of shit. I can’t help but feel like there’s something wrong with me and all women see it.

We barely even smoked, we just walked around for two hours. conversation was easy (she was carrying a lot of it anyways), and playing around with her was so easy too. She touched my chest when tryna stop me from stomping on a bug, and put her hand on mine when I put my hands on her shoulders when I was walking behind her. She told me my shoulders were broad cuz I couldn’t fit into her backpack straps, she said my glasses and outfits were always cute, and even stopped the conversation completely at one point to look at my eyelashes and tell me about how nice and long they are. She was even occasionally mentioning stuff that we’d do “next time.” for example, I randomly said I forgot to bring grapes (cuz I wanted to eat grapes while smoking) and before we said bye she was like “ight don’t forget your grapes next time.” 

And when it was night, she stood really close together and was pretty receptive to me teasing her about being scared of the dark or horror things. I even tried playfully putting my arms around her and pushing her into a dark alleyway with me at one point and rather than pushing me off and being like “stop i’m uncomfortable” (which would've been sooo sad) she was just laughing. She also said she was cold a few times and said she decided to leave her jacket in the car, and idk if that was a hint for me to put my arm around her or something, but I didn't take the risk :/ prolly should have though considering how receptive she seems to me touching her already. She even said she started watching a certain show cuz I mentioned it in class (she didn’t say she started watching *because* of me, but close enough lol). And near the end, her windows in the car was foggy and while we were waiting for it to clear, we started drawing together on the foggy sunroof (this one isn’t a sign of interest, it’s just cute lol)

Man, she even started off the hang out by going to her work and bringing me a drink from there, but the thing is, she didn’t work that day, which means she had to go out of her way to go there and get me something before getting to the place where we met up (she even said she didn’t know whether to get me cake or not)

Like, the only thing that made me wonder if she actually doesn’t like me is that she takes like 12 hrs to respond to a single text, which still is frustrating I won’t lie, but she still responds in detail and carries on the the convo, so taking that into consideration, as well as how much fun we had on tuesday, I think I should stop hyperfocusing or worrying on the slow response times. Hell, like I said in my last post, she was the one to initiate getting my insta, was the first to throw out the idea of smoking together, and asked for a possible different day on the movie.

I don't really have much to say, this is just a post of me gushing lol. But I feel like she’s at least partly into me, and I know I definitely need to ask her out next time I see her :) she did say her cousins are visiting for two weeks (to get the vaccine here in america) so idk if I should ask her out by saying “after your cousins leave, would you be down to go out on a date,” or if I should just forego the part about her cousins leaving entirely, but i’ll ask her out regardless :)

my only worry now is that she says no to a date and ending up confused on how I possibly misinterpreted every signal I thought I saw LOL or that she’s only being friendly because we’re stuck in a class together for the next two months (I know that’s just a dumb intrusive thought right now though :p)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8rv1f/small_success_from_hanging_out_with_the_girl_f21/
87,q8rxgj,1634315012,Small success from hanging out with the girl (F20) I'm (M20) interested in!,"so I ended up smoking with the girl from [this post on dating advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/q04k01/my_m20_gut_tells_me_shes_interested_but_i_feel/) and man, I had such a fun time. We barely even smoked, we just walked around for two hours. conversation was easy (she was carrying a lot of it anyways), and playing around with her was so easy too. She touched my chest when tryna stop me from stomping on a bug, and put her hand on mine when I put my hands on her shoulders when I was walking behind her. She told me my shoulders were broad cuz I couldn’t fit into her backpack straps, she said my glasses and outfits were always cute, and even stopped the conversation completely at one point to look at my eyelashes and tell me about how nice and long they are. She was even occasionally mentioning stuff that we’d do “next time.” for example, I randomly said I forgot to bring grapes (cuz I wanted to eat grapes while smoking) and before we said bye she was like “ight don’t forget your grapes next time.” 

And when it was night, she stood really close together and was pretty receptive to me teasing her about being scared of the dark or horror things. I even tried playfully putting my arms around her and pushing her into a dark alleyway with me at one point and rather than pushing me off and being like “stop i’m uncomfortable” (which would've been sooo sad) she was just laughing and having fun. She also said she was cold a few times and said she decided to leave her jacket in the car, and idk if that was a hint for me to put my arm around her or something, but I didn't take the risk :/ prolly should have though considering how receptive she seems to me touching her already. She even said she started watching a certain show cuz I mentioned it in class (she didn’t say she started watching *because* of me, but close enough lol). And near the end, her windows in the car was foggy and while we were waiting for it to clear, we started drawing together on the foggy sunroof (this one isn’t a sign of interest, it’s just cute lol)

Man, she even started off the hang out by going to her work and bringing me a drink from there, but the thing is, she didn’t work that day, which means she literally had to go out of her way to go there and get me something before getting to the place where we met up (she even said she didn’t know whether to get me cake or not)

Like, the only thing that made me wonder if she actually doesn’t like me is that she takes like 12 hrs to respond to a single text, which still is frustrating I won’t lie, but she still responds in detail and carries on the the convo, so taking that into consideration, as well as how much fun we had on tuesday, I think I should stop hyperfocusing or worrying on the slow response times. Hell, like I said in my last post, she was the one to initiate getting my insta, was the first to throw out the idea of smoking together, and asked for a possible different day on the movie.

88,q8sfhh,1634316542,Should I give him another chance?,"I have a dating app that I don’t really use but I had matched with a guy that drew my attention. I had not updated my photos on my dating profile and I had a few of when I was 30lbs smaller (before pandemic). I had told him that I had gained weight during the time gyms were closed and he didn’t seem to care. We talked for about two months before we met in person. We live two hours away so it made it kind of difficult to meet sooner. He even said he was falling for me and it felt like we had known each other for ages. We had so much in common and would spend hours on the phone talking. I would send him cute snaps (no filters) and he would do the same. 

The day we met, I was so nervous (I have social anxiety), that I was shaking and he just gave me a hug and it went away. We went on a date at a nice restaurant and we had a great time. He held my hand and everything seemed to be going great. He even decided to get a hotel and stay the weekend in my city. We spent the whole weekend together and everything seemed amazing. When he got to his house, he called me to tell he had a great time with me and we had a short conversation.

The next morning, I didn’t get the usual “good morning” text. I felt something was wrong but he said he had woken up late for work and didn’t get a chance to text me. Later that day, I asked if I could call him and he said he was too tired and he was going to bed early. Next day, I didn’t hear from him. I decided to not text him until he texted me. 

Two days go by without talking to him. Then I get a message from him saying he’s been busy at work and asking how I was. I asked him if something made him change his mind about me since he wasn’t talking to me as much. He said that when he met me, he thought I was beautiful but that in his mind he had imagined me as a totally different girl. He felt as if I had “catfished” him and said I had lied to him about what I look like. I was so confused because I never showed him pictures of anyone else and he knew about the pictures on my dating profile (when I was thinner). I was really hurt because him saying that just hurt my self-esteem. I’ve felt so down about myself.
He’s been trying to apologize ever since. He said he just needed to be honest with me about how he felt and is begging me to give him a chance to make it right.

I mean, I totally get that the person might be busy (so am I), and doesn’t have all the time to talk, but seriously? Would it be so hard for people in the dating app to show interest immediately after matching? This is particularly true for people around my place.

91,q8skmh,1634316979,Skinny guys who like thick/BBW women how do you deal with the protection or lifting her type questions?,"So  was chatting with this woman, and she claims to be 5'5 200, very well shaped if that's true but she's clearly no delicate flower. I'm like 125, maybe 130 on a good day. She was saying how I could ""get fat"" and lift her. ""I'm thinking come on lady, get real"". But I said to her ""You can lift me, I'll lift the checks at the restaurant"". I guess if this turns into anything I'm on the hook for the bill indefinitely. Was it an okay response? I get even big women often want to feel tiny, nothing I can do about evolution, but I don't seek out 105 pound women and try to turn them into BBWs. 

As to the protection thing, that one kind of sucks, I'm pretty well trained and obviously being 125 pounds has its limitations, I boxed in my weight class along with wrestling and can handle myself pretty well. But it feels dumb to bring it up. Usually I just ask if she's looking for a bf or a bodyguard.

95,q8ss0d,1634317557,1 Females Explanation of Why Gentlemen Don’t Hear Back From Her on Apps,"OUTLIERS ASIDE (Bumble where women reach our first, etc…) here is the reason that it was hard for me to respond, or respond with the substance that I normally would, to perfectly fine gentlemen I would probably connect well with on dating apps. 

I’ve paraphrased and editing a comment below which I had posted on someone’s post, because I thought others might like to see what my personal experience was. 

Follow this time line:

Sign up on the app - you familiarize yourself with the entire thing - by the time you’re done signing up and posting the profile, you’re excited to get to swiping - so you go to the part where you get to swipe - you swipe on 10 or 15 guys that interests you, you get to read their profiles, look at their pics, they’re all nice - go to your inbox -  67 likes/winks/nonmessage  interests and 23 messages - you’ve been there all of 20 minutes. 

Now, you want to message some of these guys who messaged you already back and you never swiped on them so you have to look at THEIR profiles to determine if you want to message them back or delete or block them, while 22 more messages are coming in. 

An hour later you’re exhausted and the ones you swiped on are still 20 messages away, IF they messaged you as soon as you swiped. If they message you tomorrow, forget it, you won’t see their message for days unless you hire someone to read and respond/delete to all the incoming messages 24/7. 

This is why you don’t hear back from me on apps (assuming I likes you) I might LOVE you, but I can’t find you in this attention maelstrom I’m drowning in, and just processing this comment is hard, imagine how it is to slog through these messages.

I’m taking a break from the apps currently and I apologize here publicly to anyone who sends likes/winks and that type of thing because I literally never get to those non messages interests. 

Again I say: Outliers aside, but if you’re a good guy like most, and have a nice ad and don’t hear back from a lady, it’s probably got NOTHING to do with you at all. 

Also, if the apps would take reports more seriously and entirely block scammers/fakes it would diminish this problem, but not eradicate it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8ss0d/1_females_explanation_of_why_gentlemen_dont_hear/

98,q8t3t9,1634318572,"Is it likely a man can do well in online dating if he's not tall, not white, and not physically beautiful?","I have mostly given up at online dating, as I have spent too many days of my life taking photos, having friends/family take photos, and creating/re-creating my profiles with almost universally nothing to show for it.

I am highly educated, financially successful, work out 30-60 min a day, physically fit, dress well, style well, and I have gotten compliments my whole life on my personality commonly.

However, I'm not white, I'm not tall, and no one considers me 'handsome' or 'beautiful' or 'hot' - those are compliments I have not gotten in my life.

The only guys I know personally who do well in online dating are those guys - the white guys, the tall guys, and the guys women say are 'hot' and 'cute' or 'handsome' facially.

Is it a red flag to try to use online dating as a man if you don't have those things?

What about in bars/clubs or cold approach? I have tried that too and found similar outcomes. So I suspect it is a red flag to women in general perhaps.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q8t3t9/is_it_likely_a_man_can_do_well_in_online_dating/

If they are asked to make a decision about something, instead of being an adult and making the call, they refuse to, always put it back on me.
