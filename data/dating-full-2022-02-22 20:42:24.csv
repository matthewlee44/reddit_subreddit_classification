So I met this guy on OKC back in 2020 and maybe saw each other a handful of times due to busy schedules and saw each other once in the whole of 2021 as I lived on the other side of the country for work. I'm finally back and we started dating each other again and meet each other every week now.

Everything is great but theres a few things I'm still confused about. So we both don't have anything in common. For example, I'm an extrovert and love social interaction and he's a complete introvert and doesn't leave his apartment unless it's to meet up with me. I love poppy music and he's into edm/techno/rock.  I love pastel colors and his while wardrobe is black. I love spicy food whereas he can't handle spice. When we do hang out though it doesn't seem to bother me as much. We usually just cuddle maybe cook food, watch horror movies together and call it a night. 

He's asked me a few times if I think he's boring and honestly idk why I don't think he is. He isn't the usual type of guy I date but I feel so comfortable around him to the point I think he might get bored if we do the same routine all the time lol.

I've asked him why he dates me and he says it's because I'm interesting and cute and mentioned he doesn't see me as something short term as it's just not his personality and wants to keep it going long term.

Anyways need advice on how you can build a stable relationship if both of us are complete polar opposites and keep date nights different from the usual cuddles and movies.

And also he rarely takes the initiative, be it to kiss or cuddle but once I do take it hes more comfortable he says hes just too shy. So how can I tell him I wish he sometimes takes the initiative too?

We've been together for over a year now, in 2019 he started talking to a girl let's say her name is Melissa (35 F) that has a 12 y/o kid and divorced. They dated for like 2 weeks and it didn't work out so they agreed on staying friends, she used to call/text him daily. I always felt weirded out by their friendship. after he proposed and we had the most beautiful engagement party I asked him to cut her off completely because I wasn't comfortable with the fact that he is still in contact with her. he said okay no problem and he blocked her without even explaining to her anything, two weeks later she called him no caller ID asking him why did you block me he said that they shouldn't talk anymore, she told him that she understands and that's it. that was on November, 3 days ago I was on the phone with him he told me that somebody is calling him from no caller ID and he thinks it's Melissa, told him to pick up the phone when the number calls again and he did. he called me back telling me it was her checking up on him and at the end he still told her that she shouldn't call him again and she said I get it (like last time but she still called) I was super annoyed at the fact that she managed to call him again after he made it clear that he has nothing to do with her. so I sent her a text and this is how it went. let's say my fiancé's name is Joe. 

Me: Why do you keep calling my fiancé I don't get it? 

Melissa: Who is this? 

Me: You already know who this is. kindly don't try to reach out to him ever again he already said he doesn't wanna be friends with you anymore. 

Melissa: Joe? I meant no disrespect. Not a problem. 

Me: I know! this is just uncomfortable. 

Melissa: I apologize. I worry about him that’s all. But I get it. I wish you guys well.

I am writing this post to ask opinions on a matter that is happening in my relationship and it’s starting to get annoying. (20F,20M).

I am in a relationship 9 months now. I think as a person I can get jealous and a bit protective. My gf wants to go to clubs with me and to be honest I do not like the idea of it at all. I am a person that sometimes can like to go to a club but at this point of my life I want to hustle,earn money, learn and spend my free time in a less expensive and a more chill way. I like double dates,taking her out to dinner or special date ideas etc.

So she told me that she wants to go alone. I am not a person that will tell her no or don’t go, I just expressed myself that I am shitting myself on the idea of her going(I will explain later on) so she is mad at me now cause I am ,in my way telling her not to go, because she doesn’t want to see me stress and worry that much.

The reason I am stressed (apart all the non sexual reasons that a club can be dangerous) is that the last time she went on her own a bunch of guys approached her group and bought them shots, she went ahead and accepted these shots with the excuse that its free alcohol. In my opinion this shouldn’t have happened because clearly they were flirting with her. I just don’t want another incident like this to happen because I am going to lose it. Also I know that by delaying the inevitable its just going to make matters worse. I’ve lived in an island that its full of tourism for 5 years and I know the dangers and the shit quality of people that it can hold.

But yeah another thing that I should state too is that I don’t quite drive and have a job yet though, but I will in hopefully a couple months though.
Another thing too is that I’m currently learning game dev as well as programming and so hopefully in a couple months I will start working on my first project.
But yeah as of now, I kind of feel like a bum and so I’m going to wait a few months to start online dating again otherwise I feel like I will have shit luck again like most people do on these cashgrab apps/sites.
And by the way I deleted all of my accounts and I even did it like two or three times too, so hopefully I don’t get shadow banned.

My ex boyfriend (28m) and I (23f) are currently trying to work things out over the next year to two so we can talk about getting back together when the time comes. We have agreed to be friends (with benefits) and I am left feeling a bit confused by it. 

Also before people assume he’s double timing me. The reason we broke up was I had a lot of issues with telling the truth. Also when we “quassy” got back together I fucked things up by talking to someone else on the side. He has forgiven me for it but said I need to work on my honesty and re building the trust between us which is why we are talking about getting back together in a year or two. He has NEVER been the player type or the type to two times someone so I’m not concerned about that. 

Over text/snapchat he will talk to me sometimes about other stuff like a video game we both play or about other stuff like general life talks, work, etc but the majority of the conversations are heavy on sexual stuff/sex talk. 

However in person when we meet up he wants to cuddle, he wants to hold my hand, he will kiss my forehead and tell me how good I look or how cute I am, he’s even called me once a pet name he used to call me when we were together and before we part ways each time he kisses me bye and tells me to drive home safe and to text him when I get home safe. We talk in person about all kinds of stuff like life, work, family, friends, our wants for ourselves in the future, etc. Really we talk about anything. 

It leaves me confused though because why does he act this way in person but over text he doesn’t want to talk about much else besides for sex (again we do at times talk about other stuff but it’s heavily sex based conversations). My boyfriend in particular is a very sexual person (I am as well) so I’m not sure if that’s it but it leaves me confused because he is so affection and sweet in person. 

He has said he wants to start out this friendship (with benefits) slowly and if all goes well work up to going out and doing stuff with a mutual friend (the gym, the movies, the mall, walks, out to get food, etc). So we are taking things close and going at it the way he suggested. 

He has told me multiples times he still cares for me and still wants me and knows he does (we both have work to do as people before we revisit a relationship though as we ran into a lot of problems because of this).

Oddly enough, He even denied that the dinner outside we had alone (He invited me and planned everything) was a date. 

During our interactions and in particular while discussing LGBT topics, I've noticed that He has never used the word gay, much less when referring to himself. 
When I discussed the topic of sexual fluidity, He seemed captivated but He didn't dare to add his personal view. I tried to ask him about his opinion on this but He tactifully ignored it and moved on to other topics. 
Later, when talking about his struggles to figure out his orientation during his high school years, I asked him if He has ever had a crush on a girl and even then He dodged my question. 
Of course I won't insist ever again. Anyway, I find it really strange.

We've known each other for a long time and been friends for about 4-5 years, I've always liked her and always been drawn to her. In this space of time she's had a few boyfriends but I that has never bothered me because I've been playing the long game.
Finally after years of waiting we went out a month ago, kissed and have been very close ever since. Very close but not sexual (we're taking it slow) we've been at each others house cuddling and talking, getting to know each other so much more and now we really like each other. I think Im in love with her but when do I tell her?

I'm travelling to see her very soon, we are going to have a night in the place she stays then I'm going home the next day. I've had an idea to tell her directly before I leave to go home or should I just randomly tell her. I really don't want to scare her but it feels so right.
We always tell each other how comfortable we are with each other and how the situation feels so right.

Please tell me what you think I should do because I can't lose her. Tell her I love her or wait just now

I’ve studied in a male-dominated major in college, and did several internships in that same field, so it’s not like there weren’t single guys my age around. But it just never happened. I’ve also tried making the first move several times with guys, like on dating apps and even by confessing irl to male friends that I liked. Got rejected every single time. I have also tried dating guys I’m not attracted to, and it never went well.

After several *years* of all this, I am wondering what I am doing that is so off-putting to men. I have friends, and my coworkers like me (so at least I have a good enough personality??). I also get along with my family, I have a well-paying job, I’m educated, I have no debt, have five figures in savings, don’t do drugs or smoke or drink or anything (not sure how much any of these things matter to men tho), etc. 

But I can’t help but wonder if I’m just too ugly to be in a relationship. If I’m being honest…I blame my appearance for my dismal dating experiences, because I usually only ever get rejected very early on in the process. As far as how I look, I am 5’8, slim/not overweight, I don’t have body odor, I don’t have any glaring facial defects (I posted my pics on a different Reddit account and everyone agreed I’m “conventionally attractive”, and I’ve even sent my pics to modeling agencies before and I actually got responses from a few!). 

When it comes to the men I go for (cuz I know some will be curious about who I go for), my friends tend to have mixed opinions on them overall. Some friends say the guys I go for are “cute”, others say that the guy is thoroughly average or even below. They are around my height or taller (😖). But bottom line, I go for guys that are sort of like myself in most other characteristics. 

After another rejection yesterday (I literally paid on a certain dating app for a feature that allows you to message people without necessarily matching them, but I later saw that my message was gone, which makes me think he declined my message), I’m just feeling super upset and beaten down again. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong, and I’m lowkey scared cuz I’m approaching my late 20s and I feel like society isn’t kind to “older women”. So if it is already this hard in my early/mid 20s, how will I survive in my late 20s/early 30s?

I met a person on dating app, and we saw each other regularly in the first two months. I don't know what happened exactly, but he started to be more distant after a while. I was okay with it, none of us was looking for serious stuff. But somehow we kept in touch through messages etc. and met a couple of times in between. It went like this almost for a year. We didn't always have daily communication (sometimes we did) but we would communicate a couple of times a week for months. There were times he wouldn't reply to my messages and I would check if he's alright and he would reply, and it would go on like this for a while. This last time he didn't reply to my message, I decided not to text him anything until he does, and it has been 2 months since we talked. I am trying to understand if it is ghosting or not. Honestly I had no expectation of romantic relationship or anything, we hooked up, I had fun and all but just because the time we spent together talking over a lot of things, I thought we got to know each other a bit, and for me it doesn't make sense to have one particular kind of relationship or nothing, I thought we could be friends after months of keeping in touch. In the beginning he mentioned he was not very good at keeping in touch but that didn't necessarily mean he didn't want to do it. And I took his word for it and never expected our interaction to be like a transaction, so I was alright being the one checking and asking most of the time. If he didn't say that, I would have just assumed he was just not a confrontational person and ghosting me in the first time it happened, and just move on. And as someone on autism spectrum (me), I understood some of the challenges he faced and felt like he already struggled a lot with cPTSD and trying to fit in as a neurodivergent person, so I tried to give him as much space as he needed. But gradually he just started to become more and more dismissive, so I stopped always being the one who initiated the conversation and that was it. So it has been a confusing interaction for me so far, we spent a lot of time talking for a relatively long time but both of us maintained a certain distance as well, so I wasn't sure where we stood. I don't feel angry, bitter or anything, but kinda curious how he's doing and missing the stuff we would share with each other every now and then, but I guess this shows that he has no curiosity about what is going on in my life or no interest whatsoever, so maybe I should've taken the hint long ago? I honestly have no idea because he never said explicitly he wasn't interested, on the contrary he would always say he wasn't able to reply due of his mental health problems. And I am not good at picking up these kind of clues.  So any comment, or advice is more than welcome

FFwd to the end of Jan where I felt in a good place with myself and I re-downloaded Tinder. I was talking to way too many people at once but eventually after a few meh dates I went out with two different guys the same week and really clicked with both of them. I wanted to get to know them both more and see where things would go with the intention of things moving a little slower but things got deep quick. 

I've gone on 6-7 dates with each of them, talk to both every day (one I video chat with a lot), and really enjoy both. I hate that I'm comparing one to the other to see who is going to come out the ""winner"" and I honestly feel so guilty for dating both even though there has been no discussion or question about exclusivity with either.

I've never had this situation come up, usually there is only one I find a connection with and then I don't talk to anyone else, even if not exclusive bc I don't want to introduce too many variables into the equation. But here we are, seeing two people and things going really well and my mind a chaotic whirlwind of emotional fuckery. I just feel like I'm doing something wrong and I know at some point I'm going to have to make a choice.

I'm really worried about hurting them and giving off this idea that I'm not ready to commit because I'm waiting around for something better and they're just ""Mr. Right Now"". I'm trying to navigate these emotional boundaries I've set for myself of figuring out if I can actually trust someone and not letting myself think something is what it isn't. And I definitely don't think 3.5 weeks is long enough to figure that out but I just feel things getting heavier and it's freaking me out. I'm not a player, I just have a lot of feelings.

I haven’t asked her out yet, I plan to soon enough. But there’s these boundaries I’m not sure if I’m insecure about. To give some background, my crush doesn’t have a lot of real friends she sees on a daily basis (i.e. school) so I assume that’s the reason why she talks to people online. It’s never with the intent to date people, just to make friends, but apart of it makes me feel uneasy, and her chatting with other dudes about some pretty dirty jokes that are meant to be sarcastic just sets me in the wrong direction. Like I said, it’s meant to all be a joke, I’m just not sure if I’m in the wrong for feeling uneasy.

I seriously have found no one like her. Her smile, voice, aspirations in life, her interests, her dimples, like man. But I don’t want to be the kind of person not to allow her to do anything. Perhaps tips on how to feel better about myself would work.

I never had a real guy friend and I just always ended up in all girl social circles. 

I had a few major crushes and they were never interested. With the first few, I was too shy to make any moves or anything like that but in high school I literally all but directly yelled at this guy that I like him lol, he expressed zero interest. 

I had like 1 guy try to ask me out growing up but he was definitely very creepy and to this day I am very glad I turned him down (we're not talking red flags, we're talking red ALARMS). Besides that, guys never complimented me or came up to me or really seemed to want to interact with me at all (I can only remember being complimented by a guy once at senior prom and he was another guy that had a lot of red flags about him). I was left the only one in my fairly large friend group that never had a boyfriend (or even a first kiss at that matter). 

Enter college, I had hope that I would maybe meet a guy in a student org or class or something but nothing. I crushed on and talked to a few guys and nope, zero interest. At all. Besides that, same thing continued, guys didn't even hit me up to start friendships lmao. 

Flash forward to this year, I'm studying abroad. I decided to download Hinge for shits and giggles since it seemed to be less focused on hookups (which I'm not interested in as I feel I would DEFINITELY get way too attached with my inexperience). I went on a few first dates but did not feel I truly clicked with any of them. There were also a majority that definitely seemed they had an underlying motive to turn this into a hookup situation. 

The last date I went on went...fine but I still didn't feel that click, even a friendship click! I feel like a potential partner should at LEAST feel like a budding friend, I mean when I meet certain people that I end up becoming close friends with I get SOME KIND of signal from the first meeting that we have things in common and we get along. I never got this from any guys I met.

At this point I'm stuck watching all my friends in beautiful relationships and being pressured from my family to find someone and it's kind of starting to feel hopeless. I want guys want to talk with me but the guys that I do interact with never usually end up showing red flags or we just don't match personalities at all. I want to date but I'm also very guarded with my feelings and vulnerability as I don't want to give everything to someone who just wants to use me for sex or a short term thing. I want to feel desirable but I also hate wearing makeup all the time and forcing myself to fit into beauty standards that seem to be getting harder and harder to fit into.

However over the last week or so she was starting to get dry w her replies so i messaged her today asking if she wanted to cut things off. Her response was to ask what i was doing right there and then, i responded saying not a lot and she said i could come see her at a spa she was staying at. 

I drive around 30 minutes to get to the place and she comes out in pyjamas, telling me that her mate is in the spa with her and she has just broken up with her bf in the last 10 minutes so couldn’t leave her. I say that’s fine, and she proceeds to FRENCH KISS ME. I was shocked but went along with it, we spoke for a couple more minutes before she got out my car and i drove home. This whole exchange took place within a 5 ish minute period.

However, i started to get a little suspicious after remembering one or two things. Firstly, a couple days before, whilst she was still in the spa with her mate, she asked for pics to remind herself of what i looked like. I sent her the photos, and her reply was something along the lines of ‘my mate likes the look of you’. On top of this, i’d actually recognised the mate after matching with her on bumble not long before i matched with this girl. Because of these suspicions, i decided to do some digging.

Quite quickly, i found the mates insta and bumble profiles. Firstly, I noticed how the mates most recent insta photo, which was around 2 weeks old, was already on her bumble. On top of this, I had also found her Facebook page, which listed her as single (I know she technically was single after ‘splitting’ with her ‘bf’ but i highly doubt she’d change her status so soon.)

This, along with a private snapchat story of the girl i saw posing in a pool about 30 minutes after i left (one way to console your mate i suppose) lead me to the decision that I was being lied to. I messaged the girl, calling her out with screenshots as proof. She responded by telling me that they had only been together about a month (as i previously mentioned, her insta photo was around 2 weeks old) and that it was in fact her running the account and not the mate because she didn’t like her bf. Of course, I told her how poorly put together her story was, and i was promptly blocked.

I then decided to message the mate on instagram (yes, I’m petty) and advised her to teach her friend how to tell a lie. She proceed to tell me that it was all true, and that she approved of her friend editing her bumble (what a loving partner, eh?). I was also informed that her friend had told her i was clapped (ugly, for anyone outside the UK) and that this was another reason why she left.

This has all happened in the last 3 hours or so, and honestly i’m still so confused. I wonder whether she wanted to just bin be off for her mate, but was surprised to be attracted to me, or if she had arranged another man she preferred to come over instead. If anyone has any ideas as to what she was playing at i’d love to know!

TL;DR: met a girl off bumble spontaneously, told me her mate split with bf so needed help, proceeded to french kiss me, i found out the bf didn’t exist and exposed the girl

I’ve been thinking about her a lot and also my actions leading up to and during the split. I said some things that I regret and I have already apologized for that.

However she said “sure” which doesn’t exactly sound good but, I’m running with it. 

I’m extremely nervous and I don’t know how it’s going to go. I really want to treat her to a nice dinner and try to patch things up. I don’t want to be dishonest I do miss her very much.

I've been doing it because I believe in the campaign and also because I enjoy meeting new people, but I'll admit that one of the reasons I've been doing it so consistently is because of a crush I had on someone who works for the campaign. I ended up asking her out a few days ago and got rejected. However, she took it well and it looks like we're still on good terms, so im honestly not upset about it. She said that she didnt want to because she needs to keep things professional, and i respect that. Its only been a week, but i still want to continue volunteering because I still really enjoy it and feel that we're both mature enough to move forward.

About two days after I asked her out, a new friend asked me out for coffee. We've made plans to get together this Thursday, and I'm really interested in this person. We also have very similar interests, as shes very into social justice and activism, so I've been thinking if things go well, a good way to get to know her better would be to invite her to go volunteering with me on this campaign.

I really want to pursue this, and I know she was impressed that I spend my weekends volunteering, so this seems like a good idea to me. However, I'm concerned that it's only been a week since I asked the field organizer out, so it might look like I'm bringing this girl with me to make her jealous.

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 8 months. I was starting to feel I was falling in love with him, then all of a sudden I felt anxious that maybe he doesn’t like me as much.

He’s never said ‘I love you’ to me, and sometimes I see he’s searched his ex on Instagram and Facebook (when he’s showing me a picture of something). He’s never planned a date but goes ahead with my ideas and what I plan. He’s never mentioned the future before and never seems that passionate about me. He’s kind and supportive. But I’m so scared he doesn’t actually love me. I got him a card for Valentine’s but he didn’t get me one in return.

My last ex Said ‘I love you’ and then he took it back and said he didn’t mean it so I’m scared I’m unlovable.

We recently started hanging out in public together and talking a little more often lately. Our friendship has a bit of a rocky beginning and I feel like he was pretty inconsistent and distant initially. I’ve only ever seen him be interested in the girls around me, but I feel like things have changed a bit now that we’re closer.
 
We have good chemistry and great conversations which only seem to end when one of us really needs to leave. Recently called for four hours late at night and got into our personal lives. Felt some sexual tension over certain topics indicating our romantic/sexual compatibility. I feel like he dropped a few romantic hints but I’m really bad at flirting. Also pretty sure he flirted with me the following day.
 
Thing is, when we’re with others I feel like I’m a friend out of convenience or that we’re platonic until he gets more invested in our private convos. He claims to want to hang out with me but I feel like I put in more effort to do so.
 
I’m confused because I don’t know many guys who’d willingly talk to a girl for that long and drop the hints he did without some sort of interest. Maybe it’s just our dynamic but it seems like there is the potential for something and maybe he’s just confused, or maybe I’m bad at making it clear I like him too? I know I need to flirt better.

While that does limit who I'm selective about being serious with, I do feel guilty for not availing people of their long term options for other ethnicity, I just don't believe it would be a good cultural fit. 

Some of the criteria I have are similar religion (Buddhist), come from the same part of Asia, and second generation (ideally not first) to the US as that would likely be the same for long term chance of a relationship working out. 

I find that a lot of people have issues with those that have ""racial preferences,"" when it comes to dating. If I found the right person and they happened to be a different ethnicity then I'm sure my attitude would change that. 

How do you balance being traditional when it comes with dating? Ideally I want to keep the same culture in the event that I end up with a significant other for the long term.

I realize that how I was brought up doesn't reflect necessarily how people date in the west. 

For context my family are legal immigrants to this country, I'm first generation born here so while I am Americanized I still appreciate someone that carries similar culture.

How do you balance religious preferences and culture when it comes to dating?

The day before the date, and day of the date we talked less than normal, but still talked.  We met up at a bar for some live music &amp; hung out for like 5 hours, we were there before the band started &amp; then stayed after they were done.  While the band was there it was obviously hard to really have a lot of dialogue because it was so loud in there.  However, at the end of the date we both seemed to be in agreement that we had had a good time.  He even brought up “next time” a few times at the end of it.  When I got home that night I reiterated that I had had fun and wanted to see him again if he was interested &amp; he said that he was.  

Because he had planned the first date, &amp; we had already previously talked about a 3 date rule where he plans it/she plans it/they mutually agree on it, later the next day I have a few options for a next possible date &amp; he narrowed it down to a couple.  

Then the next day (today) later in the afternoon I told him that I knew this weekend was out because of plans, but asked if he was free the following weekend.  He said that he possibly had plans but that nothing was set in stone yet.  I responded that his potential plans sounded fun &amp; that if anything changed to let me know and that I had plans one of the days but maybe we could figure something out for a different day.  I haven’t heard from him since.  

It is very possible that I’m overthinking &amp; overreacting, but I just want some outside perspective.

She ends up texting me about 8 times while I’m asleep that night and then sends a message over the app we met on as well. I woke up randomly in the middle of the night and texted her that I had a good time and would talk to her tomorrow.

Honestly we didn’t vibe and I was kinda put off by the late night obsessive messaging so I decided to just wait and let her message me the next day which she did around 2pm. I’m on a FaceTime with my family all afternoon on Sunday’s so I had every intention of messaging her back when I got done but…. She sent two more texts and another text over the app we met on over the space of an hour. The message on the app asked if I was “still interested in pursuing a relationship”. 

Needless to say at this point I was thoroughly put off and just blocked her and unmatched. It’s not my normal M.O. but I figured one night on the town and the weird stalkery/overly attached vibes would make continued communication worse. 

The next day she adds me on Snapchat. I didn’t know who it was so I added them back. I talked to them for about 15 minutes before I realized who it was and blocked them.

she came onto me very strong professing feelings etc, but says shes emotionally available and stuff too 

she seemed to be all over the place really, walking on eggshells and stuff but ive been patient and enjoy things with her as it has to do with her past as well. 

anyways i stayed over one night, we are very intimate, she tells me how happy she is with me etc. 

few days later a bunch of stuff happens and she is stressed etc. she asks for time, i ask for specifics and she ends up saying shes unsure of feelings but then doesnt want to pursue romantically anymore. 

shocked and hurt i didnt fight or anything for her i just blanked out and accepted blame even though it really wasnt entirely mine lol. 

she wants to see each other again though to talk about everything when batman comes out. not sure if that is gonna happen. 

the next day too i got a message on insta but it was deleted so i didnt see who it was.  she ended up basically disabling her account and doesnt post on her snap anymore, she hasnt blocked me or anything as my friends noticed too. pretty much has fell off the face of the earth. 

so a few days later my friend texted her “best friend” whom she got in an argument with recently and hasnt talked to really though.  but we figured she still told her everything. 

anyways her bf said for neither of us to contact “my girl” right now and its nothing ive done..that shes in a very dark place. 

im gonna text her best friend probably in a few days myself, if i should? and just ask what she thinks i should do. its been about a week so far. i care about her and dont want to just block her on everything now if theres still a chance to be in each others life. sigh. 

i know i should probably just forget about her.  but

i just miss her in so many ways.

I’m okay with it but he does 50hrs part time a week near his place so it’d mostly be work,game and sleep or work ,game,watch movies with his buddies or him alone then sleep.He would be in discord or on video call with me while he games or watches movies and sleeping but it’s like he’s in another dimension and I can’t connect to him. 
So I talked to him about giving me quality time and I said I need like 2 of us alone time 2-3 times a week to feel connected and starting from this week,he gave me quality time for 3 hours straight for 2 days and another one after 2 days. But the problem I have is ,on other time then those quality time,he barely has attention on me. Wouldn’t pause talking to his friends for a min and reply to me even when things are urgent.moreover, he plays (for 4-6hrs) right after work on other days we don’t have my type of quality time which I’m fine with but he wants to sleep right away after but would have energy to jerk off sometimes. Also on days he claims he is too tried to do anything with me after work, he would jerk off then say ugh so tired then after a minute he’d be gaming. I know he must be tired and he needs sleep but while he was playing game or talking to his friends, I’m there for him alone in my room on video call.I’ve to purposely separate myself from my family to be able to call him because my family can’t know I’m dating him for now. What I’m trying to say is, I stay alone to be able to call him and see him but he’d just go to sleep other days just because he has given me quality time other days. He’d also just jerk off and get back to gaming on other days while I get up for a min to wash off. The moment I come back from toilet,he’d have his headphones on and not have attention on me anymore which makes me feel used and unloved. Am I asking too much if I want a bit of attention on other days after getting my quality time for the week (8-9 hours for this week)? He says “ I’ve stayed with you as you asked. You don’t like me having my personal time. Can’t I play with my friends?’ 
It made me feel like I was asking too much. Am I ? I’ve told him I don’t mind him playing I just want him to know I feel lonely when I have to be in my room alone just to call him when all I have is a phone. I can’t even use other apps freely,he’d come call me as soon as I leave messenger and use other app but won’t have attention on me after 20 secs.
