But in the rare times that I do, it's always someone who's significantly younger than me that I'm obviously not comfortable dating.

When I was 19 I befriended a girl who was 15-16. She was cool and a great friend, but eventually she told me she had a tiny crush on me. I was flattered since I'd never heard that from anyone before, but that was still a little uncomfortable to hear from a 15 year old. I established a boundary with her that we were just buds, and she understood that.

Since then, I've had 1 girlfriend who was only a year younger than me. There's nothing wrong with that age difference, but as the relationship progressed I started to see that she also wasn't exactly the most...emotionally mature.

Something like this has happened 1 or 2 more times since then. Not sure why I'm only able to attract younger kinds of people. Is it something about how I present myself? I'm 5'5 and pretty thin and small, so maybe I look younger than I am? Not really sure if I can change that, though

She posts romantic music and quotes taken directly from story books, these quotes are about love, suffering and depression. I listened to the playlists she puts on her stories and I quite like them, especially those from Cigarettes after sex, I LOVED the band and I listen to them all the time.

I am designing many playlists on spotify and I plan to show to her through my stories (she sees them, even though she follows 1000+ people 😉). I was thinking in asking  about her to her probable colleague, but my psychologist Said it was too weird. What I think I really wanna do is to talk about our moments when we met, apologizing for my bad behavior and maybe opening up, it would be the first conversation about us, I think she would like it, it would deep our ""relationship"", geeting us closer, and depending on the conversation, I would even consider asking for a call (never heard her voice before 😓).

From call onwards I think it would be much easier, we would start to schedule calls and then we would have our first date.

It seens so GREAT Just thinking about it, I already see the thrill 😍

I am happily married now, but I still follow some of these dating subs because why not share my experiences with those who might benefit from it?

When I was dating, there’s something that always bothered me: How people treated me because of my disability. Short story: I have very limited vision. I can’t drive, I use some tech assistance, and sometimes I maneuver myself in ways that can be a bit awkward. It’s actually not that noticeable to strangers unless I do something really obvious, like if I’m reading my phone only a few inches away from my face. It’s something I live with every day and that I’m used to it by now.

What bugged me is how often this would be an issue for other people. I’m at a point where I’ve worked hard enough to be independent. I lived alone for years before I married. I could hold a job and be an exemplary employee, whether it was physical or more computer-focused. Yet, whenever I explained this to a date, I could often see the wheels turning, as if knowing me would be a burden. It didn’t matter that I took care of myself. Driving is the biggest thing, and it’s the thing that rubs me the wrong way whenever someone says that anyone interested in them has to have a car. And I get that being the sole driver is a big responsibility, but it’s something I’m happy to compensate for.

If someone didn’t like me because of my personality, or because of how I carry myself, that’s one thing. That’s just chemistry, or lack thereof. And I can adjust my behavior or treat others better. But here’s the thing: Any physically disabled person knows when you’re treating them differently because of whatever condition they have, like we’re broken or no good. We’re not stupid. Also, we’ve been living our lives. We can take care of ourselves so you don’t have to. And yeah, there are people who are assholes. That’s one thing. The far more common thing is for people to pretend like it’s not an issue and you can see them lying, particularly when you feel them disconnect. It’s the fake niceness and cowardice of thinly-veiled, even subconscious condescension. It sucks to be penalized for something you work hard to control but ultimately can’t change. 

If you ever come across someone disabled while dating, guess what? We’re usually pretty cool--not me, so much, but I’ve tricked my spouse into believing so. And if you’re scared away because you don’t understand how we live our lives, I get it, but it’s okay to ask basic questions. We get them all of the time; we’re good at answering them. I’m not also not trying to guilt anyone into spending the rest of their lives with someone just because they’re disabled, but try to keep an open mind. And if you feel a twinge of hesitation because you feel like it's beyond you to deal with someone with certain needs, maybe interrogate that a bit. You might surprise yourself.

Anyway, I figured I’d get this off my chest. Best of luck to everyone!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1089621,public,self,When you go out with someone disabled...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qdrm9y/when_you_go_out_with_someone_disabled/,all_ads,6,,,,,

He and I live in different countries, and there is a small language barrier between us, but we still got along really well. We hung out for multiple days for several hours at a time. While on the trip, he met some other people our age, and they would go to the bars at night. He invited me to come, and so I did. 

I met the other teenagers, and they were all really friendly. One guy (19M) in particular was very friendly, and we'll call him Guy B to avoid any confusion. I had to sit down on a couch because I was getting a bit drunk, to the point where I was almost falling asleep, and Guy B sat down next to me. He put his hand around my waist and placed my head on his chest. I left early, but everyone else was still there. Guy B started talking about how he wanted to get with me. Guy A got mad at Guy B and pushed him, telling him that he couldn't have me. When Guy B asked why, he told him that it was because he liked me. 

And of course, as any teenager would, the next morning, they all told me. They did nothing wrong; that's what teenagers are going to do. But I got really excited because I liked him too, and before he left, I asked him if he liked me. Turns out, he had a girlfriend the whole time. 

I was bummed out that he was with someone else, but I hoped that we could be social media friends at least. I sent him a request on Instagram, and he left it pending for about two weeks before rejecting it. That's when I knew that he didn't want me in his life. I have to admit, it really hurt, but I understand that he was trying to do the right thing for his girlfriend. Even if he did like me, he needed to distance himself in order to fight for his relationship. I just wish he hadn't gotten my hopes up like that. 

Two months after he and I met, he broke up with his girlfriend. He then started being all over my social media, watching my Instagram stories and my TikToks multiple times. He still hasn't reached out to me, though. But the reason why I know that he still likes me is because he still talks to the other kids we met on vacation. They tell me that he thinks about me everyday, and that he's sorry for what he did to me. And that he fantasizes about having a future with me. I'm not sure what to think anymore.

My friends husband passed away 1 years ago from a heart attack (he was much older than us) and I have let him stay with me and my daughter since he didn’t like sleeping in his house alone since  his husband passed. He’s one of those people who don’t like to show their emotions, so he didn’t really have a reaction when his husband died, he didn’t even go to his funeral because he didn’t want all the attention (he’s very shy). I went to the funeral and said something in his honor since he couldn’t be there. 

But fast forward to about a month ago, he comes over to my house one night because that’s what he usually does when he’s bored (btw he doesn’t live at my house anymore, he eventually moved back home to his). Me and him were sitting on the deck just talking and we were completely sober and we eventually hooked up for the first time ever. In the morning I practically shoved him out of my house because my daughter was going to wake up for school soon and she would freak out if she saw him.

 I didn’t want this relationship to go any further so I completely ignored him for like a month but then my daughter invited him to watch her basketball game like she usually does but she didn’t tell me she was doing that. He came to the basketball game and convinced me to have dinner and talk with him and after a few drinks, one thing led to another and you know what happened. After a couple of days I realized I might have romantic feelings for him and we had dinner one night and he said he felt the same way. 

Idk if I should pursue this relationship with him in worry that it may ruin our friendship and lose the most important person to me in this whole world (excluding my daughter). What should I do?

Side notes: 

Along with my daughter, he is really the only family that I have because I’m not close with my family because they don’t like the fact that I’m gay. He’s also not like a brother to me at all, he’s more like a gay best friend even though I’m gay as well (I’m not sure if that made sense). But I’m just wondering what I should do? Do I take our relationship further and hope for the best? Do I wait till I get officially divorced before starting a relationship with him, but who knows when that will be? Or do I end whatever this thing we have going on right now?

27-year-old female here. The person in question is 29 year old Korean male. I live in the USA and he lives in South Korea. We recently met on a dating app. Is bio only said ""give me love"". I didn't think a whole lot of this mostly just thought it seems like a cute little bio straight to the point I guess. 

We got to talking he eventually tells me that he hasn't had a girlfriend in 9 years. Mind you, this man is quite gorgeous I believe. I'm not going to compare him to K-pop band members but he's a good looking man. He has the cutest dimples and smile and long hair. 

So he tells me he hasn't had a girlfriend in 9 years and the last girlfriend he had they only held hands. He said she refused to do anything else with him and when he went to the military she cheated on him and ended up marrying another man. 

Since this event he says he has not met any other women. Although he does have women friends. He has three different female friends from three different friend groups. I found it pretty interesting to understand that Korean people seem to make many different types of friend groups. Anyway he only ever asked one of the women out and she rejected him. 

He's a good looking guy it just seems like from what he tells me he has some anxiety and he says he's introverted and timid. Also he doesn't have the best sense of style. Sometimes he does but some of the pictures I think his style looks pretty horrendous but it's kind of endearing although I've never dated somebody who I thought had a horrible sense of style. 

Maybe he's just as introverted timid kind of guy who was hurt badly by his first relationship and doesn't know how to communicate with women and also happens to have a bad sense of style which can turn women off. Perhaps ? 

He says if I understood Korean culture and women I would understand why they aren't interested in him. He even said that he would swipe right on Korean women on the dating app we met on but he would never be a matched with Korean women. However he says he matches with other women and they tell him he's handsome. But still, no luck as far as a relationship goes. 

The second day he was saying that he feels like he loves me. But I told him this is too soon to say although I did think he seems like a really awesome person. Aside from all the above stuff seeming out of the ordinary for me anyway (never dated or met a virgin of this age) we get along really well and seem to have a strong connection. 

However I just can't shake this feeling that something to feel right. Does this sound weird to anybody?? 
Normally I would immediately stop talking to somebody who proclaims they are feeling love for me so soon. In this case I haven't done that because he seems like a genuinely sweet and good-hearted person. Of course only I know what was said between us. 

I've had this nagging feeling that we shouldn't be moving too fast. Although just yesterday I agreed to a relationship after only 7 days which is something I do not do. I only agreed to it because of how strong I was feeling towards this person. I can't shake this feeling that maybe I made the wrong choice and it's going too fast. 

Aside from the possibility that maybe it's going too fast, does anyone have an opinion on the rest of it?? 
I know another Korean man who is 38 years old and he told me this all sounds very weird he says he thinks he's either weird or a liar. 

Can anyone give an opinion please?? Does this person sound strange ? Is it really possible to love someone in one week? I have read stories about it. Honestly I do feel love for this person but I can feel love for anybody that treats me very well. I'm loving by nature.

I was going out with an older guy, and he came on kind if strong, talking about Marriage and kids on our second date.We had actually known eachother for about 6 years, but we never thought about dating until recently. He said he had actually been interested in me for a while  but knew I was in a relationship, so when he heard I was single again he didn't want to lose his chance. I didn't mind, because honestly I really liked him and I was hoping we could have a future together. I let him know that he was moving too fast, however,  and he seemed to understand, which I thought was great. He asked about my ex a few times,  and I answered everything honestly, but when it came to his ex he didn't like to talk about it.

 We continued to talk regularly, and I even let him know when my ex contacted me because I didn't want any secrets between us. He met my family, and even went on a trip with us, which I thought meant he was serious about us. Anyways, after 3 months of seeing eachother I asked him how he felt about us. He avoided the question, and said we would talk another day. I contacted him like usual after that, until finally he stopped answering. 

I stopped trying to contact him, after all he clearly did not want to talk to me anymore. When I saw him again a month later he was super awkward and avoided me. I was low key hoping we could clear things up because we would still see eachother because of the friends we shared. However,  I also wanted to respect his space and did not aproach him directly.

 The last time I saw him was this week, and apparently he's starting to go out with someone else. I was actually crushed to learn this, and I felt even worse seeing them together. I'm not sure if I should try to get some closure, or if I should just leave things alone.

It’s been almost a month since we became official and we’ve been vc-ing almost every night due to school and time zone differences. He’s really nice and is considerate of my hearing disability and and we both like gaming and food. 

However, there are some habits of his lately that have started to annoy me. We’ll be watching anime in vc together but he often likes to inject live commentary that lowkey insinuates spoilers every couple minutes or so, whereas I enjoy just texting in the channel when watching something. Another thing is that he keeps apologizing for things that he doesn’t need to. I’ve discussed it with him and he’s been working on it which is great. Third, he plans on joining the peace corps for two(?) years after graduating college. I’m really not optimistic due to the length of the volunteer service and the fact that my cravings for physical time and sex are already not being met.  He’s even admitted to never really masturbating whereas I’m very horny all the time.

And this part is on me, but I am a senior graduating this semester and I’ve found myself balancing academics, extra-curriculars, job applications, and interviews stressful asf. I’m getting annoyed by the fact that I want to have alone time bc I love  my alone time, but don’t really get to have that.

I have subconsciously been living in ""crisis"" mode since at least the age of 14, from unhealed/self-imposed suicidal trauma. 

I knew something was wrong with me, but I chose to feed it, and then ignore it. Now know I suffer severe OCD and ADHD, which spiraled (because of me ignoring - if you are reading this, please talk to someone if you need help!) into trich episodes and DPP. Only ignored because I was young and well, living in panic - the few people whom I did open up to didn't understand, or couldn't handle it given their own mental health.
After a year or two, my 'young buck' self was ready to mingle (i.e. find someone to cling to so I didn't have to be alone, or thinking of myself.)

After a few relationships, sexual and otherwise, it became apparent my many scars (figuratively sub-conscience, literally on my upper thigh), a product of self harm, were going to be a problem.

Raised in a small town, my parents sent me to a Catholic school; this led me to hate God ('God' has many names), and thus, I began hating myself.

I met my bestfriend/ex beginning of Jr. Year in high-school, and we went on to date until graduation. I changed much over those couple years; worked my living ass off, it was the only thing that kept my mind occupied. This resulted in an arrogant and egotistic version of myself; having the abandonment issues I did, I left her after discovering she would not be moving away with me after graduation.

At the time I couldn't have handled a long-distance relationship, so I ignored my heart and chose to be an asshole.

I paid the next few years of life for this.

After a year and a half, I was broke, broken, and empty. I couldn't leave my room unless drunk or high af on something. Few too many bad trips later, I knew I still loved her and needed to go home. I moved back, switched universities, and we reconnected.

After years of testing, therapy, medications, etc. I slowly recovered.
All along, she had hidden her pain from me out of fear I couldn't handle it - life slowly pulled us apart, she closed me out even more, but promising we were okay..

Long story short I am stable now, and wondering what to do next, as my bestfriend (literally only person I could/would truthfully communicate w on many days) and former rock. She made me talk the demons out with her, and showed me I was capable of living and most importantly:
That life was worth living.

I gave her all of myself, doing everything I could to build myself into a man she deserved; she spoke of marriage, and once I finally had enough, we agreed after making it through a smooth weekend getaway to book a ring sizing appointment. Became evident as she grew colder that she was too consumed in the past (where she saw by bad sides) to maintain healthily, so out of fear of hatred, we agreed to end it - knowing we were both too exhausted and broken to continue.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1090408,public,self,"How to handle the loss of a ""first"" long time love?

The relationship is great; we send each other funny cat videos on Instagram, Snapchat each other and try our best to keep a streak going, text, and he calls me almost every day, even if it is on his break during work. We see each other once to twice a week. But now, for the main reason for this post. He recently moved into his own house. I want to get him a housewarming gift that is thoughtful, something he can use, and isn't too forward for the relationship.

Here's what I was thinking. He has two cats and when he was moving out, he mentioned that he needed to get them a new scratching post. I haven't seen him get them a new one, and even if he did, his house is 3 bedrooms/2.5 baths, there would be plenty of room/spaces for a second scratching post. I'm going to get the scratching post for his cats regardless, but he is not a cat and, therefore, not useful for him.

I have done some research about gifts to get your significant other and nothing has really peeked my interest. I found this Junk Drawer Starter Kit on Etsy which I thought would be kind of cute and useful. It comes with  2 AA Batteries, 2 AAA Batteries, 1 Box of Matches, Multibit Screwdriver, LED Flashlight, Rubber Bands, Scissors, Tape, Pen.

My mom suggested getting him something for his kitchen. I couldn't really tell if he needed anything for his kitchen till the last time I saw him. It looked like he only had two reusable medium sized food containers (like you would use to out leftover food in). So I was thinking I could get him a set of nice reusable food containers. I found the Rubbermaid Brilliance set a few years back and have yet to find a nicer set of reusable food storage containers.

He hasn't mentioned anything he needs or wants to get besides furniture and purchasing furniture or offering to help with purchasing furniture is out of the question as of now.

TL;DR: I want the housewarming gift to seem thoughtful (not to generic), something he can use, and isn't too forward. What do you think of what I have already picked out in my mind? Any other suggestions?

The majority of post on here, are asking why “men don’t want relationships”or “men can’t commit” or any other subject involving toxic men. 
Women, let me start out by saying yes there are shitty men out there, completely.
But here I have to say, I feel many woman cause their own issues. Woman will blindly run after toxic and messed up men, red flags everywhere, but “oh but he’s a nice guy” no he’s not, your only feeding him to be worse. See all these post have men committing they are wanting a relationship, women your responses are as follows;
“Your just saying that”
“If your single there must be something wrong with you”
Or simply ignore.
Women you have taking the word degrading, and changed it to preference. 
Oh I want a guy who is 6ft, brown hair, green eyes, nice smile, good job, loving, sense of humor, good muscles, or my fav, his dick better be big/bigger than x inches. You realize you didn’t describe a presence, you describe an exact picture perfect person, and all else men, be less than. If a man posted about a woman’s body in anyway, he would be called a pig, he would be harassed, he would be torn apart. Yet you woman do it everyday. You don’t even stop to consider how messed up that is. Not to mention how shallow it is. 90% of your description is looks. Than you date by looks, find your dream guy, ignore any and all red flags like, he drinks to much, he won’t respect my boundaries and pressures me into things, and you stick with him because why? I honestly like to know. And soon as you are free and away from that guy, you go to the internet to shout how all men are trash, yet we aren’t. And if “all the men” you have dated are trash, it might say more about you and how awful you are at dating. Now I can stand up for myself and other men, and women here will attack my post, say I’m not a man or that I’m a red flag because I dared to open
This communication. So what I want in this post is simple. If your single, men or female, post in here, state what you want. FWB, relationship, either one.
