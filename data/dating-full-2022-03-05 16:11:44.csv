I warn you: English is not my first language.

Hello everybody in this subreddit, I am currently interested in a girl of my class (university in Germany). We came across with each other 3 weeks ago, while we were waiting on a queue to get some coffee after class. I started talking to her nicely and she was very comfortable during the whole conversation, we said goodbye and left after 2-3 minutes.

Then, we would start to stare at each other during our lectures. She was the one who started, by the way. Firstly, she stared at me and broke eye contact as soon as I started looking at her. But since last week, she now keeps eye contact and she puts her face directly pointing at me.

Last wednesday, we were in a common event with some friends and classmates, and before leaving, I heard she would drive her car to her house, and I thought it would be a nice opportunity for me to ask her to take me home, as it is right in the middle of her way home. I approached her and asked her if she would take me, she answered ""yes"" and immediately after her and her friend (who was next to us) got shocked (not in a bad way, kind of surprised). Her friend got very excited and happy to ask that.

She went to talk to her friends (I couldn't hear nor see her faces) and went to her car shortly after. I went with her and we talked during the drive. She was very nice and comfortable, even bringing up topics of conversation etc. I had a good feeling. I also excused myself for this rude behavior, but she didn't care nor gave any excuses to get rid of me.

During last days in class, she greets me (like always), but doesn't stare at me so often, I may be too paranoid here, nonetheless.

I try talking to her, but she is always talking in her group of friends, with which I don't have a great relationship.

Men on the other hand (if they aren’t among the best looking, top tier) have hard time. And it leaves lots of guys desperate, depressed, thinking that they are not good enough. I can’t even complain about it without seeming weak. You need to man up, stop whining about it, get your shit together, be a man, you need to work on yourself first. Fucking bullshit. Guess what?

He broke up with me last night. used the ""it's not you, it's me"" cop-out, but also said a bunch of other excuses.

now its all different. I wish he would reconsider, I tried to get him to. maybe one day he might. who knows. but for now, for a while I'm not ok. but I eventually will be. I'm just really really sad. I lost the best bf I've had to date.

By November we were both in love with each other but also both afraid to ""I love you"". Next two months of was long distance (November to January). We were never official but had agreed to be exclusive since December. She was the one to bring that up, but she refused to commit officially and this is because of her job uncertainty which makes having a future with me up in the air. I visited her for a month recently and it was clear that her feelings have changed. When I left we agreed to continue being exclusive but not official for three more months until she visits me. Long story short, I wasn't happy with her being so up in the air in terms of how she felt and ended things with her after she refused to commit officially. SKIP TO END IF NOT INTERESTED IN DETAILS.

\-------------

When I visited her for a month in mid January to mid February where we spent that entire month traveling together, we had some major issues. Although I noticed no significant change in her behavior (still lots of sex, high level of intimacy, great conversations, etc), halfway during our trip she said her feelings for me have changed ever since we started becoming exclusive in December, that she is starting to doubt us having a future together, and that she almost didn't want me to come. It pissed me off that she didn't tell me before and that we didn't have a chance to address this before I spent hundreds on a flight thinking she was still in love with me. I told her I needed to go for a walk alone. Looking back this was a horrible way to react and I should've tried harder than I did to open her up.

The next day, out of nowhere, she said that she wanted to end the trip early and just spend one more night together. We were literally making out in a corner right before that. I was confused, shocked and really pissed off. We argued for two hours. Eventually I convinced her to continue the trip as planned and that we should just enjoy the time left with no expectations. Two days later, she made plans with friends a day before our trip was supposed to end. She told me she already booked the flight. I had thought I sort of fixed things but it became very clear that her interest level had dropped MUCH, much more than I had thought. We argued some more and she said that it was selfish of her to not at least tell me before she booked and she apologized.

The days leading up to my flight home felt stressful. We were on borrowed time and I felt like I needed to do something to raise her interest level back to where it was. It was a complete shift from November when she was in love with and chasing me. I avoided talking about the future and just focused on having fun. On the last night she started talking about it after dinner. We realized that the only feasible solution for long term to work was for me to move in with her. She was not down. We argued for hours before bed and I ended up going for a walk cause I couldn't sleep. An hour later I came back and she was awake the whole time. She said she felt horrible while I was gone and realized how much she would miss me. In the morning, we decided to continue our exclusive but non-official relationship for three more months until she visits me and see what happens. We spent the rest of the day together and it really felt like we fixed things. It was an emotional goodbye that made me feel like she was starting to be in love again.

Right after we said goodbye and in the days after I get home she keeps texting me about how she can't stop thinking about me and how much she misses me. Then during a video call she said that even if she agrees to move in together, she would want to ""settle in alone"" first. I wasn't fully against it at the time so I just said OK. But after the call I thought about it and I wasn't OK with it at all. It already felt like I was on ""probation"". Now even if I pass ""probation"" I have to wait to move in with her. It felt like I was being strung along, that at any point she could drop me and I was no longer OK with it.

A week ago I told her we needed to talk. She called me and I told her exactly how I felt. That I was not OK with being long distance exclusive, not official and having to do MORE long distance before moving in. I told her that unless we become OFFICIAL and I can move in whenever I want, we're done. She was firm in her position. Although I spent more time than I should trying to convince her, I decided to end it. She mentioned still wanting to see me in May but for whatever reason I shut that down. We respectfully said goodbye and have been in no contact since.

I DEFINITELY SCREWED UP when I shut down her offer to see me in May without even asking if we can do that with no long distance exclusivity. Part of me still wants to make it work and feels that if I talk her into seeing me in May as originally planned, I have a shot to make it work and make her be in love with me again. Part of me thinks I should just move on with my life and spare myself more potential heartache.

\-------------

I feel like since I technically was the one to end things, it's on me to reach out if I wanna try to get her to see me. Our long distance situation also makes me think she will NEVER reach out even if she misses me. And it's also time sensitive since right about now she's negotiating the start date for her job (which WAS gonna be June but will probably be May now that I'm out of the picture).

If I wait too long, I'll probably not have another chance to see her again for weeks at a time. After she settles into her job I'm sure within a few months she'll be in another serious relationship and I'll lose her forever. If I don't wait, I look weak, desperate and unattractive. And I rob her of the chance to re-grow her attraction through missing me.

Her birthday is in mid April. I sing and play guitar. I'm thinking I send her a video message then of me saying hi and giving her a birthday surprise in the form of a cover of one of our favorite songs (wouldn't be weird cause a lot of our texting is videos or audio). Or I reach out in the next few days and be cautious, reserved and not overly eager so that the logistics are better.

This made me reflect on what I'm looking for. After talking to some people about it, I'm in a crisis over what exactly I want. I don't want to think of a relationship as being defined by sex.

Basically, I don't know if a relationship (to me), is just a close friendship with more physical intimacy, and maybe some level of exclusivity. I develop very intimate friendships with people who I am both attracted to and not. I haven't yet heard people describe a level of emotional connection with their partner that exceeds my openness to my closest friends.

Thinking about my friend who I want to ask out. I know she may be someone I could be very intimate with emotionally. But I also want to be physically intimate, and have the affirming feeling of mutual desire.

Is this a relationship? Wanting to develop a deeper friendship, wanting physical intimacy and the affirming feeling of mutual desire?

I (24F) have been talking to this guy (24M) that I’ve know since we were in 10th grade, recently. Let’s just call him JC. So JC and I had an on/off relationship throughout high school and beginning of college. We kind of always thought we’d end up together, because no matter who we dated, we’d always find our way back to one another. He joined the Army after our first year of college and moved across the country, but we still kept in touch as friends. 

We have always had a strange relationship. Like sometimes we are into each other and we get along great, other times we do/say something that pisses the other one off and we go months to a year of not really talking. So JC recently moved back to the area in the last year or so, but I haven’t made the time or effort to go spend time with him. Not sure why, maybe nerves of not seeing him for almost 5 years. But anyway, I started seeing someone else during the pandemic for almost 2 years and it was serious. I had told JC about it and we haven’t been in contact since last summer. But it didn’t work out with the new guy and I ended things. 

Coincidentally, a few days later JC texts me, like I said, somehow we always find our way back to each other. He just wanted to see how I was and he ended up asking how my relationship was going so I told him things didn’t work out. So of course we keep talking and eventually get a little flirty and old feelings flood back. He tells me that he still loves me and that he’s sorry he took me for granted when we were younger, and he wants to start over and make sure we build a healthy long lasting relationship. 

So we’ve been talking for about 3 weeks now. But I’ve noticed he’s so different. Like in a good way, he’s more mature and wise and it’s kinda really sexy haha. But he’s like this new man that I have to get to know all over again and it’s weird, because I feel like I don’t know how to go about that. We have always had this hot heavy, fast-paced relationship every time we got together. And all of my relationships were never slow paced. But he really wants to take his time and be friends and build our romance and I feel lost honestly. Especially this coming from him (like I said totally new man). I’m not used to taking things slow, I’ve always wanted a slow burning romance but now that I get one for the first time at almost 25, I don’t really now how to navigate it. He’s hard to get to know and open up. Always has been, but it’s never really been an issue until now. I’m an empath and an open book, he’s more closed and doesn’t really know how to handle his own feelings let’s alone other peoples. 

Sex, passion and fun has always been our go to and now we have to really get to know each other and it’s foreign. I’m always busy with my new job and too exhausted after work, and I take the weekends to recoup and catch up on my to do lists, so I haven’t gotten the opportunity to be with him in person yet. But he says I’m rushing us and trying to hard to get him to open up to me, and I’m trying not to. So basically, I guess I need help resisting my urges or persistent ways. I can’t make him open up to me, but it’s hard when you’ve known someone for so long, but still don’t really know them. I feel like he should trust me enough to just share his life, especially if he claims to love me.

Something I've come to realize is that most people on them are not having fun, and I think that is the root of the problem with dating nowadays.

Many people expect the worst out of others to the point that they're self-prophecizing something not working before even meeting someone. They won't even allow themselves to enjoy the process that is dating and meeting new people. In short, no one really gives it or a person a chance. Before you have even met, many want reassurance that you will be ""the one"" and if you are not, then you are just another match who is wasting their time and trying to get laid. There is no gray area in between where you meet someone who is , but the reality is that there is a lot of gray areas in dating. 

Someone might not explicitly come right out and say, ""If we go on a date, I want to be involved in a serious relationship with you"" but it does not mean that as your connection grows, you get there. It's okay to want a serious relationship, but it's also ridiculous to ask someone you've never met to say they are certain they want a serious relationship with you, and if they realize after dating you for a bit that it isn't a fit, it does not mean they were trying to deceive you. That's just part of the natural process of dating. There's no full-proof way to go about it protect yourself from something not working out.

I think this is how so much time gets wasted and the lack of enjoyment comes in, too. When we should be open to meeting people, having new experiences, and learning from them, too many people out there just want to fast-forward to the end, which is an idealized relationship in their head. Also, if you say things like ""All guys just want hookups"" or ""All women are just juggling their options,"" then maybe you need to be asking yourself what type of people you're matching, because I can assure you that there are a lot of people who don't do that, but maybe you're going after the same type of person all of the time who reinforces this opinion.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162854,public,self,"Dating should be fun, but a lot of people the suck the fun out of it by being too fickle",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t7g5vw/dating_should_be_fun_but_a_lot_of_people_the_suck/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I don’t know if this is the right sub for it.Please kindly direct me to right one.

I’m in long distance and currently doing on and off relationship with my current boyfriend. I haven’t been able to finish or get horny naturally for about 15 days now after having a big fight with him. Even when we fight in the past , it wouldn’t affect my sex drive. It’s affecting me really bad this time and I’ve talked to him about it but his drive is even higher than before and doesn’t struggle with anything at all.Right now, I get sad when he calls me to do it together. We haven’t done normal calls after the fight,only been texting. I tried to do it with him yesterday and started getting overwhelmed and had to stop the call. Today as he was teasing me and me feeling a bit heated, I tried again. It was going for a long time and he finished first. I got out off mood and just told him “I think I’ll stop,I don’t feel like I can finish and you look tired so go sleep” I think some parts of him felt bad to end the call right away so he asked me if I wanted to continue the video call. I said’ no I’ll end it in a few minutes ‘because in the past we usually sleep on video call but it felt like he’s only here because he felt bad because he asked me to do stuff for him on call. He just slept right away. Didn’t even say anything I said sleep well and take care when you go out later. It’s just I felt extremely sad of seeing him sleep without asking what’s holding me from finishing. I feel like a selfish person to want him to stay for a while but we’re not even that close anymore I guess.

In the past I’ve asked him to stay with me for aftercare because it makes me feel used if he switch to smth else right away. I always ask him if he has time for aftercare before we do and if he doesn’t, I’d take a rain check. I felt like I couldn’t tell him about feeling sad because I told him to rest because he looks tired, which I really wanted him to but I low key also wished he’d have more energy for me on stuff like this. I know it was wrong of me to not tell him about it but even if I did he’d go sleep because he needs sleep.

Technically wasn't a formal date per se, just a chat and a few drinks.

A few drinks lead to more drinks and whatever follows too many drinks.

I kinda liked her. But I think maybe I came across a little aggressive because of one or two kinda altercations that I found myself in.

When I was in her bed this morning there was no chat and when I left I said *hit me up if you fancy a few drinks again sometime* and she kinda just said *yeah ok I will*

She didn't really give me a *we should do x y z* or *get the fuck out of my bed*

Alot of it was guesswork and unsaid on her part, which left me kinda wondering what she actually thought.

She felt so uncomfortable about it and felt as if I was ghosting her.  Although, I was telling her to relax and I'm here if she wants to talk about it....  2 weeks later, I had a big muscle guy at my job to scare me about how I slept with her and then ghosted her.  🤷🏻‍♂️ I talked to her again after telling her she didn't need to do that, I was here to talk to her about anything....

Here is my little hall of shame and horror.
1. ( numbers not exchanged) but I received about 30 something messages on the app while I was working. Man was having fun, talking to himself.
2. ( numbers exchanged) if I don't answer a message straight away, calling starts. Ends up in verbal exchange of "" pleasantries "" and a block.
3. Messages from much younger guy...is it OK if he calls me "" mummy""? No, son, it's not. 
4. Send pics
5. Send pics with boots on
6. Marriage proposal because he needs a nice quiet wife ( what do you mean quiet?). I'm pretty sure that was organ trafficking...
7. Trying to guilt me into going out ( "" you think you are too good for me""). I'm quietly staring at the screen at this point...
8. After normal conversation about work and life and some decent messages,the great while hunter strikes.
Love bombing, guilting , calling, trying to video call..trying to find my address...explicitly stating that he would go rough and force himself on me if he knew where I live. It has to happen since I'm perfect and he decided that he will have the relationship with me, weather I like that or not.

I just wanted to see what redditors think, and if there were couples here who are the same age, or where the female is older, that can share their experience. I really could use some advice before getting myself into the dating stage.

TL;DR: had a convo with dad about relationships. He suggested that I be at least 4 year older than her cuz women tend to lose sexual interest earlier than men do when they get older (i.e, in their 50/60s). What do yall think?

I cannot wait until I begin dating, you will be rejected 90% of the time but this just allows you to narrow down to the girls who you do like and are worth you investing your time into, just make sure you invest less time in to them as they do in you.

Occasionally here and there i try to put in some effort into starting a conversation but she never really reciprocates the same type of energy when i do. First few days she was always responsive with texting. A lot of emojis, quick response times and some voice messages of her practicing English (doesn't speak English). But slowly its been tapering off these past few days to just one worded responses.   


One day she was very minimal at texting. At around 9pm i asked her how her day was going and her responses were dry. Said she hadn't eaten yet. I offered her if i could order her some food delivery and next thing i know my phone's lighting up with responses. Its kind of confusing to gauge her interest level. At that moment i thought i was being used. I thought maybe she just got excited at that moment and it reflected on her texting?  


On the other hand she hasn't turned down a date yet. We've gone twice and tonight will be our third. In person on our dates she is incredibly lubby dubby and lively with me but on days we dont see each other her texts are incredible dry. Now its just heart smiley emojis and one worded responses. My energy is still the same however since day 1. So now im at a point where im not sure if i should just keep texts brief from now on but i kind of worried i might send the wrong signals of being uninterested already.  


Seeing her again tonight and apart from the basic good morning texts and confirming picking her up thats all im going to text. Id like to say however that im excited to see her again but a part of me is telling me not to because i might just come off too needy. Then again i think maybe shes waiting for me to say it cause shes just a nervous texter. Then again i'd think if she was as interested in me she'd match the same energy like this whole time like i would do if i was definitely still interested. Gah, why is dating so confusing.

In 2019 I started talking to this guy on tinder. He was basically the perfect guy, at least to me. He was very attractive and talented, a former model, he could sing and play a lot of instruments. He told me when we matched that he thought I was very attractive and hot, and that I was the cutest guy in town. We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do all kinds of dirty things to me. I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I would like to have sex with him, but that I to take things slow, and said he understood.

We went on a first date and it went really well. We had lunch at a diner and then made out, which was my first time. We lived an hour away from each other and he told me that he usually wouldn't drive that far to meet someone and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended a few months before then, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things, and he held my hand for a bit while he drove me home.

We kept texting afterwards and the told me me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, (things no one's ever said to me before) and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I was elated to have this guy so into me. It was everything I've been wanting for years. 

He told me about how his family was being kicked out of their house by their aunt. He texted me at the bank before he was about to find out if he could get a loan for a new house for his family and I sent him encouraging texts. He told me that I was his sunshine and that he liked how attentive I was.

We planned a second date and he said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. I was a little hesitant, since I'm a virgin and he told me that he was well endowed. He said that I just had to get over it. He also wanted it to be unprotected, saying that he wanted to cum in me.

One day I brought up that I wasn't sure if we were sexually compatible, since he told me a few times that he needed to know if his sexual needs would be fulfilled if we were dating and I didn't really want to have sex with someone that I only knew for a few weeks. He said that he couldn't be with someone who was debating whether they wanted to be with him or not. I really liked this guy and didn't want to lose him, so I sent him a bunch of texts begging him to reconsider. I know it was a very desperate move and I'm not proud of it or justifying it. He said that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that maybe he could get them back if  I had sex with him. I was going to at first, but after a few days I realized that I didn't want to do that, still wanting my first time to be with someone that I knew for a bit and had a good established connection with, and also we would have had to have sex in his car since his family was losing their house and I couldn't have sex at my house since I still live at home too, and I wanted my first time to be in a bed, and we stopped talking.

Since then I went back and forth between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me and being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who really liked me, the first time anyone's liked me like that in my life. Last month I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked him if he actually liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me, and he said that he really did like me at first, and then I ruined it.

I never really dated in high school because of strict parents, and never really had anyone (to my knowledge) show any real interest in me. I just started my freshman year of college and it feels like I’m so far behind everyone else in terms of dating and relationships- I don’t really know the ropes of any of it and have no idea where to start. 
So I, (19f) met this guy (20m) at my college’s martial arts club. I’d previously seen him at our rock wall but didn’t really talk to him much. He’s been attending club meeting more regularly as well as teaching a few of them. I’ve been looking for advice on here about how to tell if a guy is interested but a lot of the things are like “he makes excuses to initiate physical contact” but that one’s kind of rules out since our classes include a lot of partner work. I did get his number but so he could be added to our group chat.  Here are some things that he has done, but I’m not sure if he’s just being friendly or not. 
1. Added me on social media (Instagram and accepted my Snapchat request)
2. Offered to help me start to learn bo staff again 
3. I’ve caught him looking my way a couple of times
4. On days I’m not teaching class he’s offered to partner up with me for drills 

Idk, I know I’m probably overthinking stuff but it’s hard to judge because by nature we’re doing a lot of partner work in class so I have to get a read off of everything else. I just got his number the other day but I’m unsure of how to start a conversation without coming off as clingy or bothersome, especially if it’s out of the blue.

We both have spent quite a lot of time together and at this point have been on roughly 5 dates if you count random coffee trips here and there as dates. Last night was our first formal dress up dinner date night where we finally became intimate after. I was very nervous as it does take me some time to warm up and feel comfortable getting into bed, and I tend to get into my own head. But it was very nice and she sort of took control a bit and eased my mind.

So far I’m hearing all the things that I *want* to hear. She told me last night that she is not actively dating anybody else and I told her the same. She said she wants this to blossom into an official relationship, but right not we're just dating with no labels (makes sense, we're two weeks in). She does make references to the future, saying “*I know this sounds weird, and hopefully doesn’t come off clingy but*” every now and then when the future is brought up. I enjoy the excitement she has too, as well as the hesitation and asking a lot of the time if ""I'm ok"" with the things she's saying and she's also said she does not want to rush things and often catches herself. Green flags.

She has said that she recently got over her codependency issues. She’s in therapy as am I. I struggle with wanting to be very optimistic, and very excited about a new relationship, and also not rushing it. I haven’t talked about anything big, no house purchases or marriage or kids talk obviously. I don’t plan on introducing her to the kids for quite some time. I just really wanna have some fun with her.

I do have codependency issues in terms of relationships where I tend to move too fast or want certain things out of the relationship too soon. I’m definitely tempering how I come off to her, As not to act too clingy or desperate. So far she says that she really enjoys spending time with me and hopes that this can blossom into a relationship with labels. 

Any advice on how to work on myself (meeting my needs as an individual without sacrifice) as well as enjoying my time with her? I want to have both but being an enneagram 6 it's tough to be anything but the skeptic and the worrier.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162862,public,self,Trying to be less codependent,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t7kcdc/trying_to_be_less_codependent/,no_ads,0.0,,,

This girl I started talking to recently.. We had a really good conversation.. It was pretty brief but she was definitely interested. I confidently approached her after we had been sharing glances for days..

Since then, she has this guy she hangs out with stare at me all the time.. Even when she is with him, he stares to see my reaction.. If I don’t react.. Then she just has a blank expression.. If I make any kind of gesture to the guy like hey wats up.. She’ll just smile to herself…

I went on a date with this girl; the first date was amazing everything seem to click and go smoothly. No awakened pauses or anything. A perfect date. 

Then comes the second date, I think I got too comfortable because of the first date and how great it went but I saw she was cold and I put my arm around her. I could tell she didn’t like it and after that there grew some awkward tension between us. we both tried to make the best time out of the date but I could tell she wanted to go home. So the date got cut off early and I’ve been kicking myself for fucking doing that. Did I fuck up that badly? I thought I was doing something nice but shit just got super awkward.

I also texted her after we left, I’m sorry for the awkward tension I created.
