4,qe4eb8,1634993716,Willingly starting a relationship full of red flags even though I know it‚Äôs gonna go down in flames.,"I left a miserable two decade marriage in June, started dating in July, and met this guy in August. It‚Äôs mostly just been sex, which is amazing, but I‚Äôve also started to like him a lot. We‚Äôve gone back and forth with whether or not we‚Äôre a thing or just hooking up. I broke it off with him a month ago because he kept making plans and then ditching me and I got tired of it. He now wants to talk and work it out. 

This guy is incredibly sexy, has his shit together, and is so much fun to be around. But there are obvious red flags I‚Äôve seen from the beginning. Since we weren‚Äôt serious, I didn‚Äôt worry about them at first. But now that I like him (why???) and apparently he wants it to be more, I can‚Äôt ignore them. 

Or can I? I hadn‚Äôt romantically touched a man for 2.5 hrs prior to leaving my marriage. This guy is exactly what I want physically. He is also pretty awesome in other ways, but he‚Äôs never let me get close enough to get to know that side of him. 

I am completely aware of all the red flags. And I want to date him anyway. Even if it ends badly, which I‚Äôm pretty sure it will. Because I have spent years feeling lonely and disconnected to the man I was with. I just want something right now that feels like a relationship.

Sometimes though not often it was twice  a day. That was our 'honeymoon period' I guess. He could last very long during that time.

Currently we see each other about once a week. We are going though some complicated times and probably the most decisive period in this relationship. Last week we did not have sex when we met. This week we had sex on consecutive days, and each time he ejaculated earlier than  planned. He said he was trying to control it to last longer but accidentally came. This happened on Fri and again on Sat. He seemed slightly embarrassed but I didn't make a big deal of it.

What could this mean? Is it too long a period in between sex or possibly due to age? I didn't think 44 was old enough and anyway wouldn't it be the opposite problem when guys age (difficult to get it up instead of ejaculating too early)? We did try some new things.. maybe it was just that.

So my question to the ladies out there is where would up go to meet someone ""like"" me?
I am looking for a down to earth lady, none of these ""I want to look good and party"" ladies... So bars and nightclubs are not really suitable.
I do a ""nope"" on  to any lady showing her cleavage on tinder, it is not what I am looking for...for a bit of context.

21,qeudr8,1635089267,dating dysfunction,"Hey there Redditors‚Ä¶

Trying to figure out if my approach to dating is dysfunctional, and how soon to give up on a potential relationship/friendship (I put a slash mark there because I‚Äôm not even sure which I‚Äôm looking for, which is part of my dysfunction).

Let me say first that it‚Äôs really hard now, as a 46-year-old woman, to get used to the way guys are not coming out of the woodwork anymore. It‚Äôs hard in a couple ways‚Ä¶first of all, throughout my younger years, before I got busy getting married, getting divorced, and raising a kid, the lesson I took in from the time I was a teen was that my most valuable currency was my body and my looks. Not gonna go into the dumb mistakes this led me into, but it‚Äôs kind of ingrained in me that that‚Äôs what I see as my most valuable asset--to men anyway. Now that I‚Äôm older, and 20 lbs heavier than I‚Äôd like to be, and showing signs of middle age, obviously I don‚Äôt have as much ‚Äúvalue‚Äù in this way. It‚Äôs a blow to my self-esteem, and I feel more invisible nowadays. Also, I have to figure out new ways of interacting with men. I was never great at making my needs known, but at least formerly, they were more interested in finding out what they were. 

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt have other qualities‚Ä¶I think I‚Äôm smart, kind, giving, creative‚Ä¶I have things to offer. I would say that some aspects of my personality, qualities that are important in adulthood like responsibility and self-sufficiency, were undeveloped for years, though. 

Anyway‚Ä¶trying to figure out my present situation. I haven‚Äôt really been dating and haven‚Äôt had sex with anyone for 3-4 years, and that was intentional. Recently, I‚Äôve started to think maybe I‚Äôm in a better, more stable place, and have started to think about OLD again, etc. The other day, I met someone while I was out‚Ä¶in person! I thought this was really cool, because it happens so rarely nowadays. 

This guy is mid-50s, attractive‚Äînice face, nice eyes, my height but physically fit (usually I do like taller guys). He approached me, and I thought he was warm and interesting and quirky‚Ä¶intense and a little nervous, very forward. Maybe the kind of person who is quick to get insulted but also really good-hearted and generous‚Ä¶that‚Äôs that way I can think to describe him. He has a grown daughter he helped raise and obviously loves a lot, and he‚Äôs gainfully employed and just seems like a decent man.

After we met at this live music show, we met to go for a walk at night (during the recent full moon). Before we went for a walk, he felt the need to let me know he was carrying a gun. ?! He said he googled it to find out whether or not he should let me know, and how he should let me know, etc. So this was odd and honestly, for a minute there, it made me nervous to go for a walk with him, but plenty of people had seen us together and I wasn‚Äôt getting danger vibes off him, exactly. And I‚Äôm not murdered or otherwise assaulted, so‚Ä¶all good?

Anyway, that night, I tried to have this conversation with him, asking him, what are you looking for? Like, just to be friends, or is this a date? I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure, because we hadn‚Äôt discussed anything like that at the show. He HAD asked me if I have many friends, and I admitted I could use some. 

Well, on the night we met up for a 2nd time, he was making a lot of flirty comments and was generally a little cheezy-romantic‚Ä¶like for example, he had sent me texts calling me ‚Äúmilady,‚Äù or saying, ‚ÄúI am at your disposal‚Äù or just being kind of flowery; purposefully looking really deeply and intently into my eyes; touching my hands all the time. Which is why I was like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù And he got a little cagey and he said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see what happens; I really like you; if something happens, great; if something doesn‚Äôt happen, great.‚Äù And I was like, ‚ÄúWell, for me, having a friend would be awesome, and it would be nice to have something more too.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know if I made a mistake. The fact is, I could use friends, and yeah, I would love to be in a relationship. I‚Äôm not looking to get married again, but it would be nice to have someone to go out with and do things with and have sex with. Someone I can trust, someone I feel comfortable with, even if it‚Äôs not meant to last forever. But in saying that, I feel like I didn‚Äôt set any expectations, and I was letting him take control of the situation, in a way. 

I am not that physically attracted to this guy, but I do think he‚Äôs \*attractive\*, and I‚Äôve found attraction can grow with intimacy. But it would have made more sense if I‚Äôd said, ‚ÄúI want to be friends right now, and I want to take it slow.‚Äù Because I‚Äôm NOT there yet physically, and the romantic comments were annoying me a little bit.

(He also asked me what my astrology sign is, and when I said I don‚Äôt believe in astrology, he almost seemed a little hurt or miffed, which now, thinking back on it, I think is kind of ridiculous.)

Ok, so‚Ä¶here‚Äôs some crazy shit. I was supposed to meet him last night at 6:00 to go to this event-thing, which started at 6:00 and went til 8:30, but I got hung up at an appointment in a town that was far away from where I was supposed to meet him. That afternoon, when we made the plan, I told him I had an appointment. Anyway, I texted him at 5:45 and told him, so sorry, I‚Äôm on my way, but I won‚Äôt be there til 7:00. Then I drove up there. I didn‚Äôt bother to check my texts because I was driving. Well, when I arrived, I checked, and he had texted me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt rush, be safe. I‚Äôm going home. Not gonna wait.‚Äù 

Anyway, I called him and said sorry but also said I thought he was being a little touchy. He said he thought that was really inconsiderate of me to show up so late. We went back and forth, and then I asked him if he wanted me to go to him (the event where we agreed to meet was in a halfway spot).

So I ended up going to his place. Meanwhile, he makes this statement to me a couple times, like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be a good friend to you.‚Äù We smoke a little pot, I have a couple beers, and he‚Äôs kind of trying to be romantic, like touching my face and my hands all the time, which half-bugs me, but then again, I‚Äôm like, kind of feels nice to be touched? Maybe I should see where this goes? 

I tried talking to him about how I feel about relationships, which is‚Ä¶I think my sexuality has always been shaped around what‚Äôs pleasing to the guy. It‚Äôs been my belief and my experience that most guys don‚Äôt really want or aren‚Äôt capable of monogamy, so I kind of molded my own expectations and desires around that. Before I got married (a green card marriage‚Äîanother story, and another symptom of my confusion), in my 20s, I was only brave enough to say ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù one time that I can think of, and I was in a few relationships where we just sex and there was no commitment, or where the guy had a girlfriend and he was cheating with me. 

So I was explaining to this guy that even now, I say I don‚Äôt know what I want, when I date online for example, but it may be because deep down, I‚Äôm scared to hope or ask for commitment. What I wanted to go on to say was‚Ä¶now, at this point, I just want to be friends for a while first before getting physical or romantic (and not for a while for, like, months or years, but at least a couple weeks?!). But then he kind of cut in and he was like, ‚ÄúThis is how it is. I don‚Äôt date people unless there‚Äôs a commitment. But once we have a commitment, if we want to open the relationship up, we can discuss that.‚Äù

I mean, this is what I remember, anyway.

So then he keeps trying to dance with me and I was not feeling it, even though I did feel like being held. I suggested, let‚Äôs just lie down next to each other. I wanted to see how it felt maybe to kiss or cuddle‚Ä¶.and maybe more could happen, I figured we‚Äôd see. We laid down together and of course he wants to kiss and stuff, and I wasn‚Äôt really feeling it, but I participated. And, to make a long story short, I went down on him. Ha‚Ä¶that‚Äôs kind of skipping ahead. 

But this is something that, again, I have done on more occasions than I like to remember. I suck this guy‚Äôs dick almost so that he leaves me alone. (This guy doesn‚Äôt have a very big dick, btw.) I MIGHT have asked him to return the favor this time, but I was on the tail end of my period AND‚Ä¶guys just need too much guidance in this area, in my experience, which I don‚Äôt even feel comfortable giving most of the time. I‚Äôll usually just let them try for 15 minutes, and it feels nice, but I‚Äôm not gonna come, so I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOk, thanks, that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to have sex either because I‚Äôm not on the pill, I didn‚Äôt have a condom, and I didn‚Äôt even ask him, but anyway, I just didn‚Äôt feel like taking any kind of pregnancy risk.

It was kind of late at that point, and I had to get home, so I left. But now I‚Äôm feeling kind of cold towards him, AND he keeps sending me romantic-ish texts. He wanted to meet up again tonight, but I can‚Äôt. I have family coming from out of town tomorrow, and I won‚Äôt be able to see him again for a few days, at least. 

I hope this guy isn‚Äôt on Reddit, but if he is‚Ä¶uh, hi.

I feel kind of shitty about myself because I put out too easily, plus I‚Äôm too dumb to even ask for any pleasure myself.

Should I give this guy a little more time, and more of a chance? Can I even really respect someone intellectually who believes in astrology?! Maybe that‚Äôs petty‚ÄîIdk.

I don‚Äôt even know what this post is about. Any feedback would be appreciated, I guess! Sorry it‚Äôs so long.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qeudr8/dating_dysfunction/

It has been a hot minute since my last post, mostly accepting solitude.

Whether she was trying to be nice, speaking from a beer-enhance brain, or even htting on me, all I could do was be super defensive to everything she said, as if to scare her off from even trying to talk to me.... That makes me sad, because it just tells me I am unable to accept the kindeness of a beautiful stranger, which also tells me I have no hope for a future relationship, and I so want one. :(

It's not OLD's fault, not your exes, not your trauma, not the area you choose to live in, not your looks (ugly people match up all the time). All these things are impediments, but ultimately (and for the sake of this topic), let's admit that it's WE who are the issue. So, what makes you incapable of finding the right person?

So, let me start with some not-so awesome honesty about my issue:

I'm not good looking enough for the quality of woman that I wish to date. I'm easily able to match up to plain, not-attractive or heavier women that are on paper very suitable for me as far as values, interests, etc, but I can't get around the looks. I've tried, even dated a couple, but I can't become sexually attracted to them. I will get lucky occasionally and match with a woman who is attractive or turns me on, but the personality isn't there or they're looking at me like I look at the women I'm not attracted to. They like the personality/compatibility, but can't get around that I'm not 6' and Ryan Gosling. I want to lower my aim and be happy with someone less attractive but a good person, but I don't know how to. This more than any other thing hurts my efforts.

It's a rotten thing to come to terms with, because I would love to will myself into a different set of eyes and be all Shallow Hal about it, but at this stage of my life I'm still a sexual creature and want someone who makes me excited to be around her and see her.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qf608b/this_should_be_fun_why_are_you_single_we_admit/

Excerpt:
Romance scams continue to climb, and over the last three years people have reported losing more money on them than any other fraud reported to the Federal Trade Commission. These scams, typically run on dating apps and over social media, increased among all age groups with losses of $304 million, up about 50% from 2019, the FTC says.

Age is just a number to romance scammers, who bilked older adults (aged 60-up) out of more than $139 million during 2020. That's 65% more than in 2019, when reported losses were nearly $84 million, finds ""Protecting Older Consumers, 2020-2021, A Report of the Federal Trade Commission,"" released earlier this week.https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/facebook-friend-romance-scammer-older-120030077.html",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qf6hpu/older_americans_60_fall_for_romance_scams_more/

I had 4 dates over about 6 weeks with a lady i really liked alot.  We both had emotional intelligence or so i thought, liked each others humor, intelligence, faith, support of kids.  We really opened up at date 3 about our pasts and baggage and held hands and a kiss on the cheek.  I gave her every chance then to not continue if she had any issues but she planned a 4th date park picnic for just 5 days later eagerly and was very accepting of me.  For the picnic, I cooked and brought all the food.  She said no man ever cooked for her before and loved it.  I gave her two big eggplants i grew in my garden she asked for.  We went on a walk after, held hands, had a good conversation.  I asked her out for date 5 to a museum the following weekend.  She gladly accepted.  We ended with our first real kiss, and it was very mutual and natural.  We share brief texts the next day.  The next I get a text saying she doesnt want to continue, and she sensed I wanted more and she didn't.  So would never see me again or talk to me.  Now again, all we did was mutually hold hands, mutually kiss once.  No talk of sex or anything and not what i was looking for at all.  Some talk of visiting each others houses in the future for a date but no plans for that.  I told her i just enjoyed being with her.  I really liked her alot at this point but we were just starting to get to know each other.  I feel really played, taken advantage of, manipulated by her in this.  Giving me all the signals she was happy and wanting to continue dating, telling me some plans sounded ""enticing"", etc.  I'm very saddened by it and pretty destroyed right now.  How can women be so cruel and dishonest and not even give a promising relationship a chance?  I think she just played her role of interest and acceptance to have someone go out with her, easy to be accepting falsely because she really had no interest from the beginning of keeping me around more than a few dates regardless.  It makes me want to quit trying to find a female companion.  Advice please!  Especially from women.

So at least I‚Äôve got that going for me lol.

So I have met someone really special and am building an emotional connection with him. Honesty I feel like a 20 year old again.
Scary bit is I am scared as we are meeting in RL soon. We met on OLD.¬† (Long story but Covid and holiday has meant a RL meet has not been possible for a few weeks.). He is a single dad as well and is emotionally available, respectful, consistent and mature 

Ok fact is he is older than I am, taller/bIgger than I am and just totally physically not someone I would ever have expected to meet. (Tend to be into younger, thinner and shorter guys). 

So I keep getting photos from him and there is no instant physical attraction as I am used to. But when I speak to him or hear from him my heart sings. 

My fear is the attraction won't be there. I will hurt him and I never want to do that. 

I am not such a catch nor my ego so big that I realise he may also not have that spark when we meet. Although he seems enamoured of me physically. 

So what is other people's experience of this? Any advice from people whose love grew and the other things were so much more important than the chemical cocktail that wears off anyway!

65,qgam31,1635266834,Judgement by Potential Dates,"I guess this question is more for women....well anyone really. 

I'm a 44 yo  divorced single woman with no children. I find sometimes that potential dates judge me and make assumptions about my education level, life experiences, etc based upon my current jobs.

Although I did attend college (2 year degree program) and have two professional certifications in two different healthcare occupations I chose to work as a laundry attendant and a home health aide. Sometimes men I meet assume that I'm a slacker, uneducated, lazy, unmotivated, and just not a go-getter. Tbh that may be due to my weight ( I am considered morbidly obese due to my height and weight but still under 300 pounds) and my chosen occupations. Or that I'm looking for a man to finance me. None of that's true. I'm obese for a couple reasons. I've battled with my weight all my life. Maybe I will lose more maybe I wont. But I'm certainly not gaining. 

I'm not bothering anyone, live alone in my ow place, and have my own car. I work as a laundry aide In a skilled nursing center so its fairly physical work still. I like interacting with the residents, the lower stress levels, and working hours. It can be hot dirty smelly work at times. And I dont make a ton of money. But I'm self supporting and doing ok. My other job I work as a home health aide/direct support professional with a client that has mental health and intellectual disabilities. Also important work but not exactly glamorous or high end. 

So many men have asked me if I'm going to get a better job or dont I want to do better. Honestly I'm good with where I am. The last few years have been very tough. I've battled depression, lost family to Covid. Had covid myself but recovered, went through a divorce and took care of my father until he passed. I'm rebuilding my life at my own pace. I chose to drive an older but paid for car (no payments) live in a small but comfortably decorated apartment.  I do all I can to keep my stress levels low to avoid triggering my depression. Plus I like the scheduling flexibility the two jobs offer me as I have medical appointments to go to to manage my health. 

If someone is self supporting and not asking for anything why the judgement? I dont get it. I'm not looking to date a dr lawyer or Indian chief. Im a working class woman looking to date a working class man.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qgam31/judgement_by_potential_dates/

I think he's in a panic -- about to get ""everything he thought he wanted"" as he turns 36 next month. 

He is moving up the corporate ladder and is in our organization's formal executive training program.  This has resulted in him moving cities three times, once before we met, once to my city, and once to his current. He will be officially qualified for the next step up at the beginning of 2023, but could move up next year with provisions. He's contracted in his current role until mid-2024.

I have the opportunity to move to his current city next year; we've discussed living together. 

Yesterday, he forwarded me an internal communication which said the company is very likely to move me there when our fiscal 2022 begins.

Today, he was told that there is an open pool for the next up executive position *at his current workplace*. Yes, that's the one where I would be transferring. 

Now, he's being weird.   
Says that he'll leave the company if they don't promote him into this specific spot. Says he'll move to another country for better employment opportunities. No mention of our relationship. When we spent a week together in the beginning of October, he expressed concern about his future as he ""approaches 40"" -- he would like to change companies and countries, but ""doesn't know what to do about me.""

I'm taking it slowly -- it's been less than 6 hours-- and letting him vent about workplace issues. Asking him about his corporate future. NOT mentioning me or us.

80,qh2cxq,1635357083,"Ladies, some thoughts on profile behavior and opinions welcome...","I'm in a friend's group with 8 guys, 4 girls, and all but one of us are single in our 40's/50's. Most have a lot of experience OLD, so we talk frequently about expectations and experiences. The topic of women's profiles came up and I thought I'd throw these to a broader audience.

1. I Like You! Now leave me alone.

The first that came up, and this was pretty universal among the men's experience with women on multiple apps, is when women will like, match or send you a heart/flower/whatever token and then not initiate a conversation, or respond to one. It's rampant, certainly has been with my experiences. It seems to not matter how you respond, whether short and friendly or witty and thoughtful. For most of us, all of our success has been reaching out because the women who are (otherwise attractive to us or interesting) that do send us a signal then never reply. It's baffling to men, because the signal says ""I like you, talk to me"", but that's clearly not what women are wanting. What would be the rationale for going out of your way to match or send a positive signal to a person you don't want to talk to? I can't imagine doing this. Even if I had many more interesting prospects, I'd still at least entertain this person who I invited....obviously I was interested enough to match. If I didn't want to talk to them, I'd NEVER send a like, heart, swipe, etc. One friend suggested these are the same people who message for sale boards and ask the people if the item is ""still available"" but don't respond or buy it.

2. I am nobody.

The second behavior we find baffling with women is how many have no bio or profile info whatsoever, or so sparse that it borders on comical. ""Describe yourself: Fun"". One word? I mean, even if that was accurate, you're just fun? Divorced? Kids? LTR or a hookup? Smoker? Serial Killer? Anything at all would be more helpful than ""fun"". If you're only going to use one word, try ""Lazy"". I've heard the rationale for this to be that men don't read the profiles anyway - but that's a terrible excuse. First of all, it's not true...not even close. The men you should be avoiding don't read them. Me and all my friends read the profiles down to the letter...clearly some men do. But, if you think no one does then you've eliminated the possibility of it working as intended by doing nothing. You took your best filter and disposed of it. And, you've also created ZERO filters for your profile that are useful and are bringing the whole opposite gender into your pasture based on nothing but photos. For me, I'll tell you, that an empty profile says ""just here for casual"" or ""too lazy/indifferent to care"", and both eliminate any possibility that I'm going to reach out or respond favorably. That was consistent with all my single guy friends too. Is there some other possibility that I'm not considering? I'm at a loss to understand why you'd want to reduce yourself to a photo-only advertisement if you were looking for compatibility, even casual...but certainly for a relationship wouldn't you want the most surface level description of yourself and your aim with a partner?

3. Pictures of your kids...especially adolescent or teenage girls.

Oof. This was a hot button issue as ALL of our female friends had pictures of their kids in their profiles, but the men were unanimous that this was a bad idea across a spectrum of opinions, from safety (advertising your kids via YOU as an avenue to be around them to dangerous men), to consent issues (kids don't get to choose to be part of the profile), to just being a general offputting part of the dating profile. I think most of us agreed that if a woman has children and they're an integral part of their lives  and it's wise to say this or even relate how many children, ages, or relate how much you enjoy being a mother etc., but the pictures were not a helpful thing and potentially turns men off. One of the group says he takes it as a red flag that she's not thinking very clearly about her kids by putting them in this role. I'm not sure I think that strongly, but I definitely would NOT put my children in my profile and never have. That's for after I meet and vet someone, never to a general public audience. Thoughts on this?

82,qh4dcg,1635362572,Tired of starting over again and again. Tired of ‚Äúthe chase‚Äù. [rant],"Maybe it‚Äôs just feeling the effects of another breakup. It isn‚Äôt easy even if you‚Äôre the dumper. I‚Äôm feeling, so, so tired. Put on some of my favourite perfume, some Air album, laying in bed typing out a rant at 2am.

Ever since the divorce, I‚Äôve been ‚Äúlucky‚Äù, being able to be in relationships every year. I‚Äôve grown, I‚Äôve healed and learned so much, I feel like a different person now compared to my 20‚Äôs especially. I feel like I could write a book about romantic relationships and friends around me come to me for advice often when they encounter issues in theirs.

But really, I‚Äôd rather be lucky than having had to learn all these lessons in love. All these lessons, experiences came with a price and it feels taxing upon my soul. I‚Äôd rather be lucky than ‚Äúgood‚Äù, I wish I met my partner for life right off the bat, but instead, I‚Äôm circling round and round.

I go through periods of being single, sometimes by choice. Do I feel better then? Sure‚Ä¶ but inevitably it creeps in. I want a partner. I desire sex. I have friends but life is feels more alive, more satisfying with a significant other.

Funny enough, most of my partners came into my life when I‚Äôm not looking actively for one. It just kinda happens sometimes, I‚Äôm out doing things in the world and boom, feels are caught.

But, looking back, I‚Äôve always had to be the one doing most of the work in my relationships. I‚Äôm the one that has to confess feelings first (and face rejection, but thankfully at least, if it gets to this stage, I don‚Äôt usually get rejected). I‚Äôm the one that had to plan most of our dates. Do most of the cooking when we‚Äôre staying in. The relationship progresses at the pace that I work towards basically. Isn‚Äôt there this quote that says, women are the gatekeepers of sex and men are the gatekeepers of relationships? I‚Äôm so feeling it right now and I‚Äôm so tired of it. I wish I had partners that put in equal efforts in the relationship, especially in the beginning, the getting-to-know-each-other phase.

From talking to my exes, most of them said that they‚Äôve been interested in me very early on after meeting me. But being the guy I guess, I‚Äôm the one that‚Äôs expected to make the first moves and more. To be honest, I‚Äôm tired of that.

With the most recent ex, I remember how difficult it was to arrange to meet her in the beginning. How I had to be the one to initiate our chats over text, keep the conversation going. What ended up happening was that the first time we met, was after weeks of texting, with us ending up in a hotel room having lots of sex, cuddles and chatting. WTF? If she wants all this, why was it so difficult to even meet for a lunch or dinner first? After we got into a relationship properly, perhaps due to her anxious attachment style, she would hound me on the phone sometimes when she‚Äôs feeling insecure, calling me incessantly at night and whatnot. Where was this in the beginning?

I‚Äôm so tired of having to ‚Äúchase‚Äù. I‚Äôm so tired of trading life stories with people after we begin in a relationship. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been in too many? My first serious relationship was when I was 24-27. Second one with the ex wife from 28 till 36. Had a 6 month long relationship at 37. A 3 month long one at 38. A year old one at 39. A strange situationship last year for a few months. A 5 month relationship this year. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any objective measure to how much is too many, but I feel like I‚Äôve been through enough for one lifetime.

My relationships post-divorce run shorter now because I‚Äôve become more aware of what my deal breakers are. And I wish there aren‚Äôt these deal breakers.

From my former marriage, from being in a dead bedroom for years, I learned that sex is important. So that‚Äôs the end of two relationships.

I‚Äôve learned that intellectually connecting with my SO is important for me to feel like I‚Äôm understood, and maybe, just to feel like I am in love? So no more dating of Sensors (using the MBTI lens of looking at this). So that‚Äôs the end of one.

I‚Äôve learned that attachment styles matter, a lot. Insecure attachment stems from childhood neglect or abuse. It can be really tiring, frustrating, to deal with someone else‚Äôs demons when you‚Äôre also dealing with yours. I thought that I could, I‚Äôve been patient, supportive, tolerant, kind. But, it leaves me feeling stretched, sometimes more parent than boyfriend.  I try my best not to fall into this role, but what else can you do when your girlfriend is having a breakdown through no fault of your own? Even just holding space, offering solace can take a toll. Especially if you‚Äôre already a parent. It‚Äôs tough being the anchor of support for your child, your lover, and well, myself. I‚Äôm trying to keep my own ship sailing too.
