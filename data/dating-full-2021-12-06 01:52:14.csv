She was so complimentary toward me and genuinely seemed suuuper into me. We planned a second date at the end of the night. 

Unfortunately, the next morning we both woke up pretty sick. We texted back and forth a lot about our sicknesses and she mentioned she was really glad we got to hang out. A few days later, she texted me saying she was negative for covid but thinks she has the flu. I asked her if she got tested for the flu...read no reply. I sent a meme an hour later and asked her 2 days later how she was feeling...to both of which she read no reply. BOOM I got ghosted and it has absolutely torn me up.

The first date, we went to a pretty exclusive social club that costs $5,000 to be a member of. I wasn’t aware of this before the date. He didn’t mention it, but I Googled it after, as the vibe was so strange (I’d never been to a place before where I had to prove I knew who I was meeting by him calling down.)

On it, we had a good conversation, and he kept trying to get me to drink. I didn’t think much of it, but, by the end, I’d had five drinks because he kept motioning to the waiter to order more (way more than I would normally have, especially on a first date.) 

We walk back to my car and I am trashed. Like, I don’t feel safe driving. He makes out with me for several hours, and wants me to go back to his place. I say no, then call an Uber back to my house.

He is really obsessed with me and wants to go out again. I go on a second date. I’m way more cautious with alcohol and do not let him order me drinks, but I still have THREE (by his encouragement.) He tries to put his jacket on me several times, and I keep saying no, and then he does anyway.

We go back to his apartment, which is this extremely expensive hotel apartment, and the lack of food and surplus of alcohol makes me feel extremely dizzy and unwell. I tell him I am drunk. He starts making out with me and tries to perform oral sex on me, which I say no to. I am feeling stressed and upset.

Just as a note, for some lucky reason, even if I have had six drinks (that’s the most I’ve ever had in my life) and feel like everything is spinning, I am still able to look someone dead in the eye and clearly say “I am too drunk to consent and moving further is rape and I will report you to the police.” It’s super weird, but it’s stopped all misbehavior, as I sound so serious. I have gotten super lucky so far as everyone has listened. 

So I tell him “I am too drunk to consent,” and he kind of stops. I tell him I want to go home. He says I should sleep over. I now feel concerned something will happen to me if I fall asleep, so I call an Uber. He’s not happy with this.

When I go home, the next morning, I send him a long message detailing the number of things he forced on me and how, if we had had sex, that that would have been assault. I tell him that I think he tries to get girls drunk so he can sleep with them. Then I say that, at his age, he should know better.

I blocked him so I wouldn’t have to read his response, and it made me feel better.

However, after observation and reflection I now realize that in order to be successful in this field that I have to take a proactive approach in this mating competition. I encourage other men to follow my advice if they’re struggling to attract women.

I plan to use sex workers to fulfill my sexual desires and donate my sperm to successfully reproduce. It seems that in women’s sexual strategy of out pricing themselves in the sexual market they’ve allowed undesirable men to partake in sex work, an underground market that the law of supply and demand has allowed to be made, to successfully obtain sex. 

Women don’t seem to recognize the irony in allowing undesirable and rejected men to have sex with them in exchange for money because they think that men are the ones being most disaffected by having to pay for sex, but they don’t realize that men only care about what they gain and don’t care about women’s gain in this exchange. The irony is even more exemplified when women advocate for the legalization and normalization of sex work which is actually benefitting men.

Sex work actually benefits men more than women because men’s sexual success doesn’t depend on women having sexual failure, while women’s sexual success does depend on men’s sexual failure. Men’s ultimate goal is to have sex which is made possible through sex work while women’s ultimate goal is to restrict sexual access to an extremely small portion of hyper-attractive men which isn’t achieved if unattractive men can obtain sex through sex work.

I view sex work as a cheat code in a game that is rigged against men and a way to cheat the system that society has set in place that helps women achieve sexual success over men.

Its been about a week though and she isn’t accepting my follow back. I can see she is accepting other requests but I am stuck on requested. She has a lot of followers too. 

And yes, as soon as exams are over I am going approach her in person and make my intentions clear, rejection or not.  (Just in general, I don’t plan to confront her about the instagram situation). But in the meantime I have no way to in person approach and this is just teasing me so bad.

One of the first people I got to know was this kid I had study hall with, we’ll call him Tyler. Tyler would always come over and sit by me and my friends. I was an awkward 14 year old that hadn’t hit puberty yet, and I had a HUGE crush on him. Nothing ever came of it, and to be honest we didn’t talk a ton after freshman year. We had lots of mutual friends and some classes together and were friendly, just not close. I had an off/on crush on him throughout high school. I still liked and dated other people but always went back to liking him at some point during the year.

Fastforward to after high school, I found out that Tyler had liked me back at the time. We went to different colleges across the country, but to this day he still crosses my mind.

Anyway, I’m 23 now. We were both home for Thanksgiving and a mutual friend told me that Tyler had wanted to hang out with me and some friends. Then, another one of Tyler’s friends messaged me asking what I was doing and said that they (him and Tyler) were together. A friend of mine got a snapchat of him and his friends telling them to tell me hey (I think alcohol was involved in this one lol).

Nothing ever happened. Tyler never messaged me directly himself, but now I can’t get it out of my head. All the feelings are coming back, and I feel really dumb considering I haven’t really talked to this guy in like 4 years. I’m not sure if he is coming home over Christmas considering he has family elsewhere, and I would be wayyyy too chicken to message him first anyways.

I have been looking back at old pictures and, to be honest, am super sad. I got excited at the possibility of seeing him again but then nothing happened.

I reduced it significantly while giving as much context as possible, but let me know if specific details are necessary?* 

**Important:** I am originally from Eastern Europe and lived around France for college, before I moved to the US for grad school. Although I consider myself a citizen of the world, there are certainly some cultural differences that should be taken into account.

**Me (27M)**, have been single for 9 months prior to the beginning of this story (on good terms with my ex (25F)). In these 9 months, I have been on about two dozen dates, but nothing serious came out of it. Then I met **her (23F)** on a dating app. 

She is great: beautiful, funny, smart. After about a week of texting, we go on a date. Everything goes perfectly, she is very genuine, there is a good feeling and connection between the two of us, at the end of the date I drop her off at her place and we make out. It was the first time in those 9 months that someone made me feel this way, and by the time I was back home, I already knew that she was someone special. 

She plans our second date (cute and thoughtful). We text almost nonstop since we matched, and it feels like we are both 16 again, sending cute messages with emojis and hearts. At one point I briefly opened up and told her how I felt about what was going on, and she confirmed that we were on the same page. I have been in 5 long-term relationships prior to this (which didn’t work out for various reasons), but at that point, I had some good experience in dealing with emotions, communication, and just reading into another person’s feelings. She was genuinely into me and excited about how things were evolving.

Then something changed. At that point, it has been about 3 weeks and 5-6 dates. The last time we saw each other, we spent the night at my place. The next day she went to a party with some of her girlfriends in the evening. We texted again in the morning, and things still seemed fine. But then she didn’t reply for more than a day, which felt very inconsistent with our previous interactions. I sent her a text asking if something was wrong, to which she replied very casually that she gave it some thought and she didn’t think it would work. I sent her a few more messages trying to figure out a “why” or “how” and if I did something wrong, but she just said that “I was a really great guy and I was really nice to her”, but she just had a feeling and something was off. She didn’t reply to my next text. 

Needless to say, I was very sad and confused. I couldn’t figure out what could have caused such a reaction and a radical turn in her attitude. Just a day before we were sending each other cute messages, and now she low-key ghosted. 

I am a bit of a tragic romantic by nature, so I thought I’d give her a few days to figure stuff out, and in the meantime, I wrote her a letter and a poem. I put an enormous amount of thought and effort into the words, design, and even made an origami flower to accompany it. My best guess was that there has been some misunderstanding, and I thought that if I am honest and vulnerable about how I was feeling about things would at least initiate a conversation and we could figure things out. About a week later I drove to her place and left the letter and poem at her doorstep. After 5 days, there was no reaction from her side, then I noticed that she blocked me on all social media (facebook, instagram, snapchat, probably SMS as well). I noticed that even a friend of hers that I met once unfriended me on facebook. That was very hurtful and sad for me. At worst I was expecting her to say thank you for the letter and the effort, but explain that it just wouldn’t work for her. Nothing of this magnitude. 

Moreover, a few days later, I realized that she didn’t block me on that dating app, and when I looked at her profile, she added a line to her bio saying: “Never bringing anyone to my place again, because the last guy that I brought home was a stalker”. That completely shattered my heart, as I couldn’t have envisioned that my actions would be perceived in such a way. I know friends and exes that had issues with stalkers, and that was just terrifying, and I couldn’t believe that she would think that of me just because I wanted to do something romantic and thoughtful. I sent her a brief message on that app saying that I was shocked, but also apologized and told her that I didn’t mean to cause her any distress. She blocked me there too. 

Now I’ve dealt with rejection before, and although it is never pleasant, you get over it eventually, and it’s always possible to see the signs of it coming, once you got to know that person for a bit. But not here. I spent a couple of weeks after this just ruminating and trying to find an explanation for everything (I also have ADHD, which didn’t help too much). Nothing made sense, nothing I did could have caused anything proportional to this, and I consider myself a good judge of character and I know that she was a good, genuine person, so telling myself that she just played me and moved on wasn’t an option either. Not finding an answer consumed a good amount of my brain cells. After that, I got distracted with grad school, work, and just life, so I thought that I moved on. However, about 2 months later, it all came back, and that sadness and confusion took hold of me again. 

I talked about this with my best friend from college (that I have known for over 8 years), and she got curious about the situation as well. I thought that getting a fresh perspective would be a good thing. I let her read our entire text conversation, and she agreed that it seemed to be going great, but only until the last day we spent together. We cycled through those events in more detail, and she helped me realize something that I was overlooking before. We were both convinced that we cracked the case! 

What we believe actually happened, is that this girl misinterpreted something and thought I was stalking her. In brief, right after she drove off from my place on that last day, I hopped into my car and went grocery shopping (which I believe I mentioned to her). After a few minutes, I realized I was driving behind her, but she made a turn (towards a fast food) before I could catch up so I wasn’t sure if she actually saw me or not. I jokingly texted her about it, thinking that she would ask if she would be confused about it. She seemed to have reacted normally to that, so I didn’t develop on this and we never talked about it after. 

Now what my friend pointed out is that she must have assumed that I was stalking her, and as a huge red flag, she didn’t react to it, because she wasn’t sure how to deal with it on the spot. What happened next, is that she and her girlfriends at that party probably analyzed my actions and they just convinced her to “run away” (I would have probably told the same in their place). Then to my horror, I realized that me bringing her stuff to her doorstep is the worst thing I could have done. All this time I thought she overreacted to this when she called me a stalker, but now I realize that she was already thinking that, and this only reinforced her beliefs. It was a horrible and painful revelation. Anyway, everything that happened afterward started making more sense when I was taking this into account: from the way she ended things so casually, without giving an explanation (you don’t know what a crazy person would do if you’re letting them know you’re into them), to how she had no reaction to my letter and then blocked me. It is something that I learned over the years, but I solved many relationship issues through communication. Even though I wish she communicated her concerns to me, how can I be mad if the poor girl thought I was crazy and she most likely feared for her wellbeing? 

All this time I was thinking that at best, something bad happened in her life and she cut me off, or at worst she was just crazy or emotionally unstable. Now, after spending over a week with this new realization, I am just horrified at what she went through and must have thought about me. Although I don’t know how I could have made things better knowing what I knew at that time, I am now extremely remorseful and sad that I was the source of her distress. 

I am unsure about what to do next, knowing this now. On one hand, I am extremely uncomfortable with the idea of her thinking this about me, and at the very least I’d want her to know my perspective and explain things. I am also very sad about the fact that such a misunderstanding has ruined the good thing that we were having. I know that even if she believed me and accepted my sincerity, it is a tough thing to process and accept. But I can’t help but think what if? On the other hand, although I know her postal and email addresses (which I have not abused all this time), reaching out to her directly in any capacity would send the wrong message. One of the thoughts that I have is to write a letter explaining my actions and my perspective and to reach out to her friend (over facebook). If I could explain it to her friend and hopefully gain enough of her sympathy that she passes my letter along, it would be a much more considerate way to reach out to her.  

So to sum up, at the minimum, I want her to know that I am not who she thought I was, and ideally I’d want to somehow re-establish communication and maybe see if something new could come out of it, eventually. 

What are your opinions about this and what would you do in my place? Has anyone lived through or heard about something similar, and how did that turn out?

Today was the end of a 5 month relationship with who I perceived to be the girl of my dreams.

She was my very first girlfriend (im 22) and I thought I struck gold. Of course she wasn't perfect but no one is without their issues.

There were so many red flags and I was warned and told by friends and family to leave her but I didn't want to because I truely fell in love with her to the point where my dignity was thrown out the window.

I was belittled, disrespected and made to be the bad guy with anything I tried to talk to her about. Somehow, with all that, I looked past it because I wanted to be with her but suddenly this soon after things ended, I realise that I just wasn't happy half the time.

It ended because she cheated on me. A second time. The first time, she kissed someone, someone I knew. This time she slept with someone, then had the nerve to try to end the relationship because 'we are growing apart'.

I'm a uni student, final year, and I will be back home where she is in 2 weeks. And it's not like I've been gone ages, she was here with me about 3 weeks ago.

I just don't understand how she could do that to me I cant help but wonder if I did something wrong, or I didn't give her enough love. I gave her my whole heart and life and now I just feel so empty, so alone, and so used.

Even though he is a pretty self centred person and we were definitely not right for each other, I hate the fact that I still miss him. 

But that’s not to say he’s a bad person. He’s definitely not that at all. It just pissed me off knowing everything in our arrangement was so one-sided - the sex, the moral support, the conversations we had. I felt like I was always doing him a favour and being there for him; he’s never once asked me how I was or cared much about anything exciting that happened in my life. Even if he did, he couldn’t hide how disinterested he was. We talked almost everyday but it was always him initiating the conversation about his training at the gym or his work or how stressed he felt and that he needed sex to make him better. All in all, it felt like the benefits apart of this arrangement was always scheduled on his time and his mood. If I asked him to come over, he never really reciprocated. But I always felt pressured to go see him (he lived quite far from me and stopped offering to pick me up especially when it was so late in the night).

I had an awful breakup earlier this year which really impacted my self esteem, which is why I really valued the fwb situation I was in with this guy. I do admit, I had some feelings for him but knowing that we’d never work out in a relationship kind of stopped me in feeling anything deeper for him. But the sex was really really good, and even he always gushed about how it was the best he ever had. He was also decent company to have around when we were lying on the couch watching TV or cooking together; even though we established that he didn’t want anything serious and neither did I with him since I knew we would be incompatible romantically, I still enjoyed our late night cuddles, the feelings of intimacy and security and physical comfort when I was with him. 

Earlier last week he admitted that he wanted to take things to the next level with this girl, Vivian, he was also seeing. I already knew he was dating her as he was upfront about it; but it came to me as a shock as he had told me previously the sex with her was very lacklustre and he did not feel comfortable or close with her as he did with me. But he did admit that he had feelings for her and she was smart, funny and ambitious, and was very into health and fitness the way he is. I couldn’t help feeling so jealous that I was being replaced. I don’t think it was because I had any deeper feelings but more that I was going to lose his “friendship” and readily available sex and his company. I don’t even know why I feel like this; I always knew FWB arrangements were never meant to last. So obviously we had to cut things off, in respect of his new girlfriend. 

All my friends tell me I’ve dodged a bullet as he didn’t exactly treat me properly (felt more like a booty call most of the time - he was pretty selfish in bed too. He only wanted to have sex when he needed it but when it was the other way around, he’d get all huffy and push me off). He also always made plans at the last minute which was super frustrating but, being the meek doormat I am, I never brought it up with him. 

He is also the messiest person I know! We both live alone and we both have super busy work schedules. He also goes to training 5-6 times a week as soon as he finishes work, but still it was no excuse for him to leave his dirty dishes in the sink for days at a time or not do his laundry while they stank up the entire apartment. He also rarely washed his bed sheets even though they were stained from sex and I felt gross sleeping on them! I would stay at his place once a week for 3-4 days in a row and did my work there too; honestly, it felt like I was mothering him all the time, despite being younger, and telling him to clean up after himself. But in the end I always did it anyways, and it was pretty frustrating having to do so, even though I didn’t have to, but it was annoying to stay at his place in such a mess. 

Despite knowing all his faults and the fact that we would never work out long term anyway, deep down I’m worried that I’ll be alone forever. I miss him cuddling me in bed, I miss the incredible sex we had. But most of all, I miss his friendship (even though he wasn’t much of a friend) although it still feels as though I lost someone important to me. I will admit that I was growing too attached and relied heavily on his company to feel better about myself (I haven’t for a while since my ex broke up with me earlier this year). I know it’s something I definitely need to improve on - basically learning to love myself and not depend on anyone else to feel happy.

So I was feeling kinda shitty considering I walked away from a bunch of potential suitors in my early 20s.  


This weekend I got a little creative and I googled ""best dating apps in"" \[my area\]...  
And I downloaded a bunch of bs apps, most of which you literally have to pay to message people, view people, LITERALLY DO ANYTHING ON THE APP.  


Like holy crap why??.....  
So I ended up making some profiles on a few dif apps, Badoo, Coffee meets Bagels and ChristianCupid...  


The moment I made my ChristianCupid dating profile I was getting spammed with likes, messages with girls wanting to meet, almost suffocatingly fast, I was trying to figure out how to stop people from other countries messaging me.  


So I messaged support and they basically kept sending me the same pre-recorded message that is not a feature we possess for every one of my requests. (This is not a review for them btw if you want to LDR go for it, you'll have women wanting to marry you tomorrow)  
Spoiler alert, I am not down for LDR = Long Distanced Relationship...  
The website does not have filters at least to my knowledge for who can message you...  
This is problematic considering I had zero clue before I spent the platinum membership fee to view my messages.   


I emailed the staff back and forth for a few hours complaining that their filter didn't actually work. But then I found out that I am literally the only person in my country.   
Why do dating apps just seem like such a cash grab, spent 60$ on dating apps this month and had more luck with free ones?   
F!  


47 Likes, and 50+ messages later of random women ages between 18-50 overnight, and I realized that I am the only person on the app in Canada.

With these married men, I can have nice, sometimes miiildly flirty interactions with them and then they happily go back to their partners without asking anything of me.

We never go out. We constantly hang out in sweat pants and I play video games with him for hours on end. At the end of the night, I’m so tired and he purposely stays awake to chat with other women so I constantly get ignored. I feel like absolute shit about this.

I recently agreed to let him do his naughty chat thing (what other choice do I have since he is going to do it anyways) and said I would try it out too. The problem is I find it so fucking boring. I’m not allowed to be myself in these chats and I can’t send pics of myself. Plus 99% of the guys I find to talk to online are so boring. If I’m completely honest about the situation, the fact that my husband is doing this and I’m just doing it so I can feel somewhat even is a huge turn off in itself. 

All that being said, I feel like I’m completely being ignored in every way I actually care about (sexually/emotionally). I don’t know what to do about this since my husband probably thinks I’m neglecting him as well. The problem is that his behavior is just such a turn off. 

I want attention. I’m good at getting attention when I want it, but I hold myself back because of a relationship where I don’t think he does the same. He likes this online attention, but doesn’t much care for in person attention. I don’t care for online attention, but love in per an attention. 

I wish there was a compromise we could come to where I didn’t feel so fucked over. Like I wish I was allowed to go out and flirt with guys irl, but that’s apparently an unfair ask.

Hi I’m a 14 year old guy who is having a dilemma. Currently I’m in a new relationship with a girl that lives 3 hours away. I’ve never met her irl, but she’s really nice and I know her through friends.

The problem I’m having lies in a few things

1. I don’t think I’m old enough to go along with what I consider a long distance relationship. I think it would be easier on my mental health to be with someone at my school

2. But she has a really awesome personality and cares for me

Now I’ll preface a few things because this probably sounds like an open shut case. She is going through a tough time right now, her nan is in the hospital right now and I’m really scared what effect breaking up with her would have on her mental health. I feel like such a selfish person when I even consider breaking up with her. But I’d rather be in a relationship that’s a bit easier because I’m still a kid. I’m really stuck on what to do.

Tl:dr

(Im a guy) I’m in a relationship with a girl that is long distance (for a 14 year old) and I don’t know what to do because I feel like my mental health would greatly improve by having a girlfriend that goes to my school.

Im not exactly welcome where she’s at either. Like I said I come from a family, and while I was never directly involved I was essentially affiliated by blood according to some people.

The other day she was feeling low and messaged me that she was feeling alone. So I told her she that she can come to my place as my housemate who is also my childhood friend is good friends with her so that she doesn’t feel alone. As she was staying in my room we ended up in the same bed cuddling and I made a move trying to kiss her. As our lips brushed against each other she told me that she’s heartbroken and not mentally well. I kinda backed off but the whole night we were together and cuddled like crazy. She said that it just may be physical attraction and it meant nothing to both of us but it meant something to me. After 2 days she was back at my place and I was feeling low so we hugged but after sometime a common friend of ours messaged her something which made her anxious and she said she wanted to go back to her place. We texted for a while after she admitted that it was his text that made her uncomfortable and she wanted space.

How do you actually get over the feelings of inadequacy? Going to be honest, I'm 24, a virgin, only been on 1 date ever, only had one person have an interest in me for one night in the clubs, which messed up by not knowing what to do, not wanting to make her uncomfortable etc. (found out she was into me from a mutual friend afterwards, but even when I got her snap after didn't know how to flirt or anything. Still friends but yeah)

Everytime I have an interest in someone, always feel like I'm not good enough and let it slip away, isn't helped that a few times I've been getting close to someone a friend comes along, and to the person it feels like I'm instantly dropped for this new person, further fueling these feelings of inadequacy. This has happened twice with 2 different friends this year.

Currently, I've decided to stay single for a while in which I plan to work through these issues in my head amongst others (&amp; hitting gym etc.), just I don't know how to go about it. Literally all that I've tried truth be told is a close friend tells me stuff like ""I am good enough"" etc. but it just won't ever sink in. Is there anything else I could try/anyone been through similar and got over it?

I was on OLD but deleted these while I try and work through these issues. I didn't have a massive problem getting matches truth be told. Just struggled to message most people consistently, only like 10% of my matches I would speak to

I do also have an issue understanding the difference between platonic and romantic, any advice on telling the difference? One I thought was heading the complete other way turned out to be close friends, but I still can't work out what made the difference in the two.

So its been 10 months of our relationship , we’re in love and we’ve kissed no sex, and recently I gave him oral. It sort of happened in the heat of the moment. We were kissing , giving hickeys and he was begging me to give him bj and I couldn’t say no but I’ve never seen a penis before and I really didn’t know what to do but I couldn’t say no and well gave him one, a handjob too.

I was embarrassed like zero experience but it’s fine like no big deal I’d want him to be happy and satisfied no, but the thing is he’s very happy about it about me giving him hickeys and oral, that he went to his friends and told them about it( 2 female friends, my mutual friends as well) . He showed them hickeys and told them stuff about how I gave him oral.

The thing that bothered me is why would one want to tell intimate stuff to people 😭 like my friends were very shocked that I did those with him, they’ve known me for a really long time, first I can’t wrap my head around what had happened I was wayyy too embarrassed after the oral sex process, he kept saying pls that I couldn’t say no but that’s okay we’re partners but then he told our friends and now I can’t face them. Idk what to feel? Is this normal? Like he tells what we did to his friends and me being a private person do not want this to happen. I’ve told him and he says it’s normal. Idk I need perspective since I’ve got no experience in anything Idk if this is ok or not but I don’t feel ok telling friends about what we do privately 😭

I can’t tell any of my friends well cause no one says anything about their sex life with their partners, idk I’m so embarrassed to tell anyone or talk about it. So I’m here for advice 😭

We've been together for a year now and I think the magic is gone. Not entirely because of time but because of stress. I work 10 h/day 5/7 and I have a very limited time in which I can do w/e I want. She is a stundent and doing part time jobs for 20h/7.   


The truth is, whenever she starts to do her school stuff cause of her exams, she gets extra stressed and cold. Doesn't even want to have sex tbh. Nothing like before. Usually she's a cheeful, charming, responsible woman that want's to do all kinds of things together. Now she wants to be home and watch netflix. Which I would gladly do too! But if I want to stay home, then I rather go on a computer to play games or watch something new - YT focused on learning or a podcast about something interesting. I don't feel like she wants to spend time with me at all. She rather spends her time with her bestfriend.   


In the begining it made me a bit jealouse but in the end I realised that he is making her laugh more than I do (they know e/o longer than I know her) so I get she wants to laugh when she is stressed. I'm trying to do things they way she likes them, or suprise her with a flower or something so I can cheer her up.   


As I get this is a seasonal and will eventualy pass anyways it makes me write here and have a discussion with perhaps older perhaps more experienced people.   


Am I doing something uncalled for? Should I just wait and not stress about it?   


PS.:  


I've talked to her about it and she confirms what I am saying. That she would want to do something more but she feels crippled with anxiety and something like depression.

I don’t know whether to give him the best night of his life and then cut it off, as i think that’ll have more of an impact (he’s a complete psychopath, shows very little emotion) or to meet for coffee and do it the old fashioned way. it. may seem attention seeking this way but i’m going to be devastated if he’s not as upset as i am and the only way i can really get through to him is with sex.

I have been casually dating people these past couple months. This one guy that I've been talking to for about 2 months invited me to a weekend trip. I originally declined because I wasn't sure if I was ready and knew that sex would probably be an expectation. I shared my reservations with him and he said that 'im safe' with him and that there 'were no expectations'. So I agree and go on the trip. Everything was going good. I like this guy but am not sure yet if I see myself wanting to pursue a relationship or anything more. He has made it pretty clear that he likes me and wants to be in a relationship with me. So we go out and do all the touristy things. We come back to the hotel and take some shots (my idea, because I was nervous) and then one thing leads to another and we end up having sex. 

Here is some background info: I was a virgin. I told him that right before and I said that 'we are not having sex'. He ended up not believing me. I was drunk at this point btw. I believe we both were. Before I knew it, he was about to go inside of me but I said put a condom on. I feel like I should've stopped it right there but I was fucked up. I wish I said something. Anywho, it happened so fast. I didn't enjoy it, it was quite painful tbh. He did not finish. I believe he said something about drinking too much making it hard for him and I just said to stop. He did. I just feel like shit. I also feel confused. I was waiting for so long. I didn't expect or want to lose it this way. 

So we kind of talked about it after. He mentioned he wasn't sure if I was telling the truth. Said he wants to be in a relationship blah blah blah.
