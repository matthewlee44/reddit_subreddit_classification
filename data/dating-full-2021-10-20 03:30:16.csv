We've hooked up and the first time he forgot a condom and did not want to fuck me without one bc i was not on BC. The second time, we actually had sex but the condom slipped and he paid for my plan b. Furthermore, he said that he actually enjoys spending time with me and that sex has just been a bonus. He's said a couple times that he missed me and that he had to wait another week to come and cuddle with me. He's been texting me good morning and good night for the past week. He's told me he cared about me and that he wouldn't bother me while studying so I would do well or like I shouldn't sacrifice my club parties just to be with him bc he wants me to make friends. We text/snap every day. He's also ss many of my snaps because he thinks I look good in them. Also, his mom has been curious about me bc he's been seen me 3 times already. He's shown her a photo of me. And he's asked what my parents would think if I dated a white boy. Also note: my parents don't know about this bc ""i'm not allowed to date until med school"". While before I just thought he was a hookup/fwb, I'm now catching feelings and starting to get a lil confused.

So. I have a close male friend that I am quite in love with, and I met him about a year ago at work, where it was pretty much love at first sight for me. 

The thing about overnights is that it's usually a crew of three, and one is always a manager. Our manager for the first several months of working overnights together was ~20yo girl, and she dubbed me the mom of our little group, and she dubbed my friend the dad, which made us married. Well, my friend and I started calling each other ""husband"" and ""wife"", and at first I just knew he was rolling with the joke our manager had started, as we also called her ""daughter"", but here's the thing...

She left the job a few months ago. We still call each other ""husband"" and ""wife"", and he even started saying things like ""my dear wife"" and even a few times ""my dear, kind, beautiful wife"" (when he wanted something but still...) And we also say things like ""this is why I married you"" and ""we've known each other for 20+ years we should know this by now"" etc. He even opened a discussion of whether I'm Mrs (his surname) or if ours was a modern marriage, and I'm Mrs (my surname). There was even a period where I made more of an effort to call him by his name, not because I wanted him to stop but because I was seeing if he would still call me that, and he still called me ""wife"". 

He even said once ""if/when I get a wife, I hope she understands my sarcasm"" after an instant that made it apparent once again that not only do I understand, but I can dish it right back.

Well, first of all, thanks for your time that you will probably spend reading this, I really really appreciate your time. Let’s begin with myself, Im doing last year of my uni, almost 21, chubby, funny, outgoing, charismatic and romantic (the last 4 traits I have developed myself throughout the time of university despite being rejected 1000 times).  She is doing her last year as well studying in the best uni of the country, has a unique beauty, very smart, funny, deep, gorgeous and sexy ( that’s at least how I see her). A year and a half ago,  I get a notification about her adding me on social media and that’s when I decided for myself that I should try my luck, cause I believe despite not looking as a hot guy with 6 abs I have something else to offer. So I tried and It worked but due to corona we could not meet, after 2-3 month of us occasionally chatting and lockdown getting eased, I decided to travel 3 hours to finally see her. It was like a blind date and I got everything planned out so we could definitely have a great time. I chose a nice Japanese restaurant for us and we had some nice Japanese wine but after we couldn’t make it to the adventure park since we got late in restaurant. After that, I went back, we chatted and talked to each other for a bit while being occasionally ignored because of her being busy on her work and studies (Im not surprised cause she is studying a very hard course). Then, I offered to meet and was very excited to plan out next meeting to the beachfront but she had several interviews therefore she couldn’t come despite her really wanting to. I already booked everything, bought the tickets, it all went to waste but I still told her that it’s ok and i really hope she gets the job. Anyways, on our summer holidays we both got busy so we didn’t really talk to each other and this April after I texted her I came to her city for a week since she hinted to me 
- “when are you going to come to  my city with a winky face”. 
So I was like fuck it let me not lose my chance with the girl of my dreams. Anyways, we went to a nice restaurant had a 3 hours dinner and we finally went to adventure park the next day. We had a lot of fun it was really really romantic, I even won her a huge teddy bear. Anyways, when took a bus back to her place ( it was night and I couldn’t let her go alone since it might be dangerous and I care about her safety) I told her that I like her. I also said that I don’t wanna make her uncomfortable or put pressure on her, I just want to put it out there she smiled at me, hugged me and said that she will text me before leaving to her house. After all those emotions, I have been waiting every day for her message but after a week I decided to text her and she replied after a day and It’s all the same story, she doesn’t answer on time blaming it on problems with university and some family issues, what do you think I should do next? She didn’t say anything about “ let’s stay friends or we’re different, or it’s not you it’s me type of shit” so please tell me the community of Reddit WTH do i do in this situation",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1081426,public,self,Help needed with my crush (been on 3 dates),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbugpz/help_needed_with_my_crush_been_on_3_dates/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

She invited me over to her house which I thought was pretty forward after we didn't even kiss on our first date.

I get there, we order dinner, and start watching Squid Game. One thing leads to another and before long she's straddling me on the couch while we're making out. She leads me to the bedroom and the sex was fantastic and keeps saying how attracted she is to me and how turned on she is and I'm saying the same things back to her. Later on, we're cuddling on the couch again, and she even has her head in my lap at one point and I'm stroking her hair. It felt so intimate for only having been on two dates. 

I stayed the night and thought we could hang out in the morning but she had a doctor's appointment and then was meeting a friend later that day. We both expressed the fact that we'd love to see each other again. I messaged her later that night thanking her for having me over and letting her know I had such a great time and didn't get a response.

The week leading up to our second date she texted once, maybe twice a day so I know she's not a big texter. She works 12+ hour days sometimes and I know she has a medical procedure scheduled on Wednesday, so obviously there's a lot on her mind.

I met a guy on a dating app, we both are in open relationships and partnered.

When we matched, he told me both him and his gf crushed on me IRL (we went to the same conference a week earlier, didn't now it was him when swiping).

We had a first date a few weeks ago, went well. Nothing happened

Yesterday, I invited him at my place, we've been chatting on the sofa, everything was nice ! I was a bit flirty to make him understand the.... possibilities. He left and told me he'd love to see me again soon. 

I was like : ????? (since he doesn't seem to be shy, I thought he may only like me as a friend and doesn't want to hurt my feelings)

So I texted him something like ""hey, I wanted to tell that I'm attracted to you, I'm telling you this to adjust my behavior if needed, don't wanna make you feel bad at ease""

He responded ""I noticed that ! It doesn't make me feel bat at ease""

Me : ??????????????????????????????????? \*even more lost\*

A few minutes after this, he texted me again to say ""I don't know how to act about all of this"", And I told him I wouldn't take offense if it wasn't reciprocal.

He responded ""The thing is, I don't know if I like you or not. I wasn't sure of your moves, so I didn't want to ask myself if I like you or not.""

Me : ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

I'm of those people who know if I like somebody or not without asking myself, but well, everybody's different.

I like him and we could totally hang out as platonic friends, but I need to know what to expect first. (The kind of relationship I'd like to have with him would be ""friends with benefits"", no couple thing.)

There were two registrars but I immediately thought that this one was one of the most attractive men I’d ever seen. 

For the first month we never talked much. He only worked at the clinic once a week, sometimes on the one day I didn’t work so we never had much time to talk to each other, but when we did on lunch breaks it was always fun. We both laughed and matched each other's banter and I remember wishing the conversation could have always gone on longer and being sad when he wouldn’t be rostered to work with me that week. I went home and tried to find him on social media several times but for some reason never could and through my stalking basically accepted that I was infatuated with this man and any judgement I made was definitely clouded by the idea that I really wanted to date him, but he was so clearly older so I could never make a move (for reference I am freshly 18, he ended up being 34, in the beginning I thought he was like 26-30 though). 

Two months went by and one day I ran into him at the bookstore (as a reader this was a literal dream) and he didn’t even remember my name, however did reference things from past conversations we had once I reminded him who I was. After that I accepted that this man, while nice, had no interest or ever would in me and probably didn’t care for my existence, which was heartbreaking but understandable.

Two weeks go by when I see him again (it’s his last month at the practice at this point) and I have cut my hair, no reason just because, and this man usually spent most of his time in his office, so it was startling when I watched him come out of his office and stop what he was doing to compliment my hair. I convinced myself who immediately got super flattered and flustered by the experience that he was just being nice, just like when he would always wave to me at work no matter the time of day, just when we would cross paths and stuff, it was nice.

Then I go on and notice that he is looking at me a lot, like usually it was just me staring at him because he’s beautiful but suddenly I’m catching his eye throughout the day already looking at me. I convince myself it’s just the hair.

The next week comes and I officially have two more shifts with this registrar (yes I counted) before I inevitably never see him again. It is annoying how into him I am at this point. I breathe and tell myself to suck it up and go to work and just accept that this guy is my office crush that never reciprocated feelings.

I go and it’s all fine, then out of nowhere the registrar is walking out of his office and in his rare quiet time between patients up to my desk and asking me what books I ended up buying that time we ran into each other at the bookstore. Admittedly, caught off guard I entertained the conversation and he ended up getting back to work after giving me a few recs and talking about what he bought the day we ran into each other, later throughout the day it comes up that we’ve both watched the Netflix show Squid Game and I could tell that impressed him.

At the end of the shift this guy ends up waiting outside a doorway while I’m talking to a client, assuming he was waiting for somebody else I almost couldn’t believe it when he asked for me and then went on to invite me out for drinks with “some of the guys” for his birthday that was next week. This was when I ended up finding out that he was 33 and became confused by the whole thing, especially because he was very aware of our fifteen year age gap, even mentioning that he remembers it’ll be my first night out drinking (detail he remembered from our previous convos).

I sceptically waited for him to text me but a week goes by and he never did.

Our last shift together happens and I wish him happy birthday (yes our last shift together was on his birthday) and this registrar comes out of his office and talks to me at my desk enough to have the other receptionists comment that they think he’s flirting with me. One even told me that mid-conversation when I had to go do some work he left straight away despite also seeming to be engaged with other receptionists while I was there. We talked about all sorts of things; books, TV shows, tourist attractions. I think in total he came out of his office at least 5 times that day but this is all happening with the knowledge that he’s moving next week and that these “drinks with the guys” he said he would text me the details about most probably already happened without me. However he continues to come find and talk to me, even at one point waiting outside a testing room’s door just to catch me outside and talk about how interesting the machines are (he’s a literal doctor reminder who uses these machines everyday).

So all this happens and the end of our last day together arrives. I get offered to go home early but insist on staying back because I’m curious to see how this guy says goodbye to me after the weird day we had.

It ends basically like this…
“Thanks for all your help, it was great working with you, you guys were the best.”

I, having nothing to lose, decide to respond.
“Yeah you too and if you want to catch up on your last week here at all just text me.”
He replies that he will, also adding that he’s going to drop off one of his favourite books he wants me to read at my house despite not knowing my address.
I say text me and I’ll text him my address (since only he has my number and I don’t have his) and he says sure thing but he also said he’d text me about the drinks he invited me to but then never did.

Am I crazy to think that there might have been more than just a one way crush here, or should I hold out that this guy isn’t going to text and leave town without a word?

To set the scene: we're both in our early twenties, both kinda awkward and introverted people, he also often refers to himself as a weirdo. So we started going on dates, but it was never quite clear to me where this thing might go, since we never 'discussed' anything or were too shy to be outright flirty, god forbid we express our honest emotions, but I've always felt like that we have a connection and weirdly understand each other. Yeah, so we somehow ended up at his place on the third date and did the deed which went amazing lol (he was the initiator). 

After that I was very doubtful whether he was in it only for a one-time thing or if he potentially wanted to keep seeing me, buuut I gave it a bit of time and shot him a text if he wanted to meet up, and the answer was positive! But. And there's a big but coming. It was like we went back to first-date level awkwardness, as if we were starting from scratch. Also, the following dates (if they were dates, that is) never involved any \*romantic activities\*, not even a kiss. But he always seemed happy to see me and we had fun together. I tried suggesting a few times that he could come over or smth and he responded well, but then he always cancelled the date last-minute with a seemingly valid reason. Which, after a few times, was really annoying, so I always convinced myself that okay, that's enough, I'm not gonna text him anymore, not gonna invite him anywhere, and then there it was, a new message from him... Idk, overall he seemed to put in less effort, but at the same time he also got a lot more honest with me which I can only think that it must've meant that I earned his trust and he got more comfortable with me? Or I am really naive to think that?

To be fair if this all happened to a friend of mine, I would probably tell them to get over this guy in the romantic sense. That's what my rational brain suggests based on his actions at least. But you know, here I am, thinking that it could be just how he is, and I should be patient and try to get to understand them. 

Btw the circumstances aren't in our favor either, since now we're back in college again and we study in two very different cities far away from each other, and would probably only see each other in person during Christmas / summer. We still talk regularly tho. Idk, just makes me wonder why would he still talk to me now that we're no longer living in the same place if he wasn't interested at all? But if he is interested, why doesn't/didn't he show it or at least put a teeny tiny bit more effort in? Or is it just his personality? 

So, I'm genuinely confused as to what's going on. Does he see me as a friend now? Does he see me more than a friend just doesn't know what to do about it? Does he actually not think too much about me just doesn't have the heart to cut me off? What's the deal? Should I confront him about what he's thinking or should I tell him about my feelings? Or should I ditch him cause he's obviously not worth the effort and move on? But I do really like him. But I also don't want to make a fool of myself and keep pursuing someone who's clearly not into me.  And yes, I do realize that I'm also very late to think about these things and I probably should've taken action sooner.

It was a rough draft of some cringy/funny stuff I was looking to add to my bio. But that's not the whole point of this topic.

Other than the swarm of people saying ""lul height is your only personality"" , the other swarm of guys were clearly giving me the feedback that it's more than enough if I just put 6'7 into my bio and girls will swarm.

WRONG. I am serious people, height is not the silver bullet like some guys (shorter ones, maybe?) would LOVE to believe it to be.

What I am trying to say is. If you don't have good PHOTOS, it literally doesn't matter what you put into your bio. The stupid crap I posted on r/tinder yesterday won't make a difference in my matches either.

Sure, there are women out there who won't date you unless you are a specific height, but if you are attractive looking on your photos you'll be pulling plenty of matches .

First things first, I went on 4 dates through my entire life (23M), and 2 of those were in the last month. Those dates were actually really good, but ended up actually into them ghosting me or just them wanting to be just friends and nothing else. Obviously, that crushed my confidence and self-esteem down to the rock bottom (which they were actually down because of my looks and stuff) and after those dates I tended to feel really sad. Also this made me have a big fear of rejection.

What happened now? I’ve met this girl through OLD a month ago, and we started to chat, and last week we decided to meet on Sunday. I tried to convince myself to meet with no expectations, even though I was nervous as sh*t hours before.

On Sunday, we met each other, we went to a café near the place we’ve met at, we spoke about a lot of things, our lives, etc… After that, we decided to get ourselves a carsharing vehicle, because she wanted to try it for the first time (she lives a bit far from the city I live in). During the whole driving stuff (which lasted 1 hour), we laughed a lot and had a lot of fun. After that, we went to another bar and we continued to speak about our hobbies and all that stuff.

It was time for her to leave because she needed to pick a bus and it was getting late (12:30 AM). We hopped into the subway in order to go to the bus stop. When we arrived, she hugged me and then, I didn’t know what made me do it, but I asked her:

“May I kiss you?”

She answered “Yeah, of course!”

And then we went for it. Couldn’t believe what was happening in that moment. We started making out even though I didn’t know how to, but she guided me through the process. We made out for a considerable period of time and she smiled when we ended. She hugged me then and I whispered in her ear to please let me know when she arrives to her place. After that I stole from her another kiss before she finally went into the bus lmaooo.

When I was returning home, I had this smile in my face that wouldn’t disappear at all. All I could think of is “MY FIRST KISS EVER!!!!”. I finally did it, even though I convinced myself before that I was going to die a kissless virgin. So this is for you guys, don’t ever let yourselves down if things don’t go as you want, because when you least expect it, you can find some beautiful surprises coming along.

We planned another date on Friday, and I hope there will be more kisses like this first one.

First things first, I went on 4 dates through my entire life (23M), and 2 of those were in the last month. Those dates were actually really good, but ended up actually into them ghosting me or just them wanting to be just friends and nothing else. Obviously, that crushed my confidence and self-esteem down to the rock bottom (which they were actually down because of my looks and stuff) and after those dates I tended to feel really sad. Also this made me have a big fear of rejection.

What happened now? I’ve met this girl through OLD a month ago, and we started to chat, and last week we decided to meet on Sunday. I tried to convince myself to meet with no expectations, even though I was nervous as sh*t hours before.

On Sunday, we met each other, we went to a café near the place we’ve met at, we spoke about a lot of things, our lives, etc… After that, we decided to get ourselves a carsharing vehicle, because she wanted to try it for the first time (she lives a bit far from the city I live in). During the whole driving stuff (which lasted 1 hour), we laughed a lot and had a lot of fun. After that, we went to another bar and we continued to speak about our hobbies and all that stuff.

It was time for her to leave because she needed to pick a bus and it was getting late (12:30 AM). We hopped into the subway in order to go to the bus stop. When we arrived, she hugged me and then, I didn’t know what made me do it, but I asked her:

“May I kiss you?”

She answered “Yeah, of course!”

And then we went for it. Couldn’t believe what was happening in that moment. We started making out even though I didn’t know how to, but she guided me through the process. We made out for a considerable period of time and she smiled when we ended. She hugged me then and I whispered in her ear to please let me know when she arrives to her place. After that I stole from her another kiss before she finally went into the bus lmaooo.

When I was returning home, I had this smile in my face that wouldn’t disappear at all. All I could think of is “MY FIRST KISS EVER!!!!”. I finally did it, even though I convinced myself before that I was going to die a kissless virgin. So this is for you guys, don’t ever let yourselves down if things don’t go as you want, because when you least expect it, you can find some beautiful surprises coming along.

We planned another date on Friday, and I hope there will be more kisses like this first one.

TL;DR: After 4 unsuccessful dates in my life and 0 romantic/sexual experiences, met this girl on Tinder, chatted, dated, and kissed (and also made out a bit) at the end of the date.

I go pretty regularly so I’m in the gym 4-5 days a week, and I have noticed that this girl is in there pretty the same time and days as me. The thing is I constantly catch her staring at me or if I walk into a new area of the gym she will look at me. She doesn’t really smile at me, maybe one time when I first started going. But she mostly just locks eyes with me. This has been going on since I started there so I’m curious if it is a sign that she may be interested in me? And honestly it confuses me a little bit.

So if anyone has experience with this or if a women can fill me in that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

We went out to dinner this past Friday and then went to a haunted house. I never brought up any sort of relationship topics or any conversations that related to us or our relationship as I'm trying to avoid that for now and just hang out and focus on having fun with her.

We were making tentative plans for this upcoming Sunday to go to a pumpkin patch and go pumpkin picking and basically spend the day together and make some soup, carve pumpkins etc.

When I checked in yesterday to see if she was available to hangout after work potentially this week, before the pumpkins on Sunday, she said she was pretty busy and that we may have to wait until the following week to get something in. I asked if this included our plans for Sunday, to which she replied yes as she was going to be seeing some friends. 

Now this bothered me but let me preface it by saying that this was a common occurrence occurring our relationship when we were together and it caused me to feel like I wasn't necessarily a priority in her life.
So I got a little bit upset and questioned her about it and then we got into a bit of an argument about it the same argument that we've had in the past. She said that she knew it was a bad idea for us to go to dinner but she said yes against her better judgement as I mean a lot to her and she really wanted to see me. 

I think the biggest issue is that I always feel that when we are together but as soon as we're not together and it's texting or setting up plans it always feels like I come second. Although this is never the case when we we're hanging out in person.

I guess my question is did I ruin all the progress that we've been making and working towards, by getting upset about the change of plans and rehashing an old argument that we've already had?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1082021,public,self,Help with an Ex?!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qc1xp9/help_with_an_ex/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Before that I went to a school where none of the girls really liked me or talked to me, so I only had guy friends. In that time I saw a lot of posts on the internet about relationships, and developed a longing for one. I just wanted the gentle words and touch of a girl to soothe me every now and then.

So along came the new school. I knew it was stupid to hope for love, but I couldn't do much about it. So in the new school I met most of the few girls in my class, and I started texting with one of them (15F) over some homework. We got closer, and started texting about other stuff as well, and now, a year later we're at a point where we tell eachother all about our day every day.

I found her interesting and attractive, and she was very kind to me, but I tried to not rush into it, because I was still worried that I'm just imagining the connection. After months of thinking about it, I came to the conclusion that my best shot is to try it, so I've been flirting with her for a while. We haven't met one-on-one yet, but we soon will, and I'm pretty sure she's into me, because she calls me things like ""sweetheart"" or ""dear,"" sends me random pictures or videos of herself all the time, and when I went to travel somewhere, and was offline for two days, she sent me a video saying she misses me.

This is great and all, but recently I got introduced to another girl (16F), who's... Different. I'll call her Lily, and the first girl will be Cassie.

So, the thing is, Lily just clicked with me quicker than Cassie. She likes more of my interests than Cassie does, and she's also more similar to me in personality.

That said, I still really like talking to Cassie, and she makes me feel appretiated. I've texted with her for over a year, and we know eachother pretty well. As I said, she's also likely interested in me. I don't want to throw all of that away, just because I met someone who's more like me than Cassie.

The easy way to do this would be to just stay with Cassie, not do anything about Lily, but Lily's already acting and texting a little like she's interested in me.

I don't know, what to do. On the one hand I have Cassie, who I know well, and who I've flirted a lot with, and I'm afraid I'll hurt her if I date anyone else. On the other hand, I have Lily, who I barely know, but have a really good first impression with and who would probably be sad if I acted dismissive towards her.

I don't want to be unkind to either of them, but if I'm friendly towards both of them, that just feels wrong. Or not that it feels wrong, I can be platonically friendly with either of them, but it's going to seem like I'm being more than just friendly to anyone, who takes a look at my texts.

Oh, and I've told Cassie about how I met Lily, but not about what I think of her, while Lily doesn't know about Cassie's existence yet, since the topic never came up.

TL;DR: I've been flirting with a girl for a year, who I get along with really well, but now I met another girl, who has much more things in common with me. I can only pursue one of them, but I don't know if I should stay with the one I know, or the one I met recently.

This seems so ridiculous, especially since I'm not a relationship with either of them... But I just had to ask someone, because I feel like I'm going to hurt one of them, if I'm not careful.

Anyway, fast forward and we've been on 3 dates now 2 of which he paid for and all the dates he initiated. Oh yeah and I volunteered to pay for one of the 3 dates.  
 

So he's expressed interest in hanging out again but this time he hasn't put a day or time on it... it is beginning to make me think he's seeing someone else or seeing if something better comes along while having me on back burner, which is unacceptable to me and honestly hurts.  
 

He typically plans in advance so this is kind of odd, could be busy but still hasnt stopped him in the past from reserving a date, weekday or weekend  
 

I just hate feeling like I might be his back up girl... I wish I could for sure know but I can certainly say if he can't be courteous enough to give me a minimum of 24 to 48 hours notice it's a definite ""no I'm unavailable"" ....regardless of if I'm actually busy that day.   
 

It's just annoying and disrespectful to do that to someone you're still getting to know.

She wanted to hangout SO BAD last night, and was like “I’ll even suck your dick” and all that. I said we can just hang out lmao we don’t gotta do anything u don’t want to do.

So we agreed to smoking some weed and chilling. She hyped herself up about being a HUGE stoner, which I’m not but I do smoke a good bit.

I ask her what she wants to smoke with, bowl, bong, blunt? She says bring the bowl. Okay no problem.

So we meet up and we’re just listening to music and I pack up the bowl and get it ready to go. She wants me to hit it first and then I passed it to her and she didn’t even light it. She was just inhaling air?! Then when she tried lighting it she didn’t know how to use it. It made it so awkward. I had to sit there and teach her how to do all this shit when she straight up lied about being a avid marijuana user. 

She barely even talked, she’s asking me lame questions that just go no where. This was at like 11pm and I work at 5 am. I told her yeah I think I’m gonna get going I need to go to bed. I left and haven’t talked to her and even deleted her off of Snapchat.

I’m so sick and tired of people lying and not being themselves over messaging apps and then when it comes down to it, don’t know how to function infront of someone in person. I wasn’t even upset about the weed thing, I’m not gonna force someone to get high as giraffe nuts, I just let her look dumb for lying about being a heavy user.

I’m 26M, she’s 24F. 

we hit it off pretty well, went on a date, hung out &amp; got ice cream &amp; then a movie. our sense of humor &amp; sarcasm gel pretty well together but after our first date she was pretty straight forward about not being ready for anything(i knwo red flag) but we still saw each other again &amp; our conversations were still great. 

recently, almost simultaneously, old flames from our pasts creeped up. we were supposed to go on a nice hike but she was very honest &amp; straight forward with me about rescheduling &amp; not being in a great place rn, which is fine, i had to deal with my own past &amp; figure out how i felt about that. 

last week we caught up &amp; thats how we found out we were in similar situations. for the most part, i think i’m in a good head space. based off what she said it seems like so is she, but clearly she was caught up on whoever it was for a while(emotionally unavailable). i think she’s dope, &amp; super honest &amp; transparent. 

is it worth waiting around until they’re ready? lemme be clear that im of the mindset that imma still be doing my own thing, dating other people, etc. if she still wants us to see eachother &amp; talk thats fine but i dont plan on getting caught up with one person unless shes genuinely interested back in me.
