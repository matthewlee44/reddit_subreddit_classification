One night we stayed up talking and before we knew it the sun was rising already.
However when they aren’t around they are terrible at communicating. They text me once a day at most, and to make things worse they have rescheduled a date last minute three times now. I am understanding because they have medical issues and sometimes it is so bad they can’t go anywhere. However they don’t tell me until an hour before. Last weekend they rescheduled two days in a row and then said we should go out this weekend. That’s 2 weeks without seeing or really talking to each other. 
Every time this happens I assume it’s over and they don’t care, but in person they are so different. 
Maybe this is all coincidence and they really have been busy lately, but I’m getting tired. I really like them. I’ve tried dating other people and it’s not the same.

We haven't had the ex talk yet, but I'm fairly certain that they haven't been in a relationship before. I was their first kiss. 

I'm a little bit worried because I've been in long term relationships since I was 13. I dated my last girlfriend for almost two years and we lived together as well. The past few months I've just been hooking up with people, but I'm looking for something a bit more serious now. 

I feel a bit jaded when it comes to relationships. Or... like I've almost been ruined somehow? They seem very nervous/excited about it all, and while I like them a lot, I'm just not sure if I'm able to feel that way. 

I don't know exactly why this is making me feel so weird. Part of it might be feeling bad about having slept with a lot of people, as if they are somehow morally superior for not having that experience. Another part I think is that I feel there's this weird power imbalance... my first relationships were with people who were also having their first relationships and we could figure out what we liked/wanted together. I don't want to take on the role of ""showing someone the ropes"" because that's GROSS, but I've also been the one to initiate everything so far, and I think it's because I'm more comfortable with what I'm doing. I don't know how to avoid that weird dynamic.

And then I'm worried about sleeping together. Even if I really like the person, I always see sex as something fun and not very emotionally involved. I'm worried because your first time will always have some sort of emotional significance. I feel weird about this after months of casual sex. I want to be on the same page about what sleeping together means and I'm not sure if that's even possible. This worry has stopped me from trying to initiate anything...

I was talking about this with a friend after one date and she said, ""They're too young for you!"" It's only a six month age gap but it does feel a bit like that.....

I would love to hear people's thoughts on this situation. Have you been in something similar, and how did it go? Also - How do I even bring this up with them?

Pandemic, don't know anyone, work from home. Perfect combo to stay single lol. I came here married, divorced now final 8 months, I'm extremely happy with my life and career and I don't have the capacity to settle for anyone... I want someone who fits me but that seems increasingly like a difficult thing online...

In person, in clubs/bars etc I get looks from women constantly. I sometimes even get approached by the few brave ones but most women tend to either not want to approach for fear of rejection or they just are too intimidated. I approach if a woman gives me a few hints (I'm good at catching them), but something has changed in my heart and I don't know how to describe it...

This used to be/is a successful dating way for me. I just go to the bar/club with a friend or two, and sooner or later throughout the night, while me and my friends are having fun I'll catch women here and there who look approachable and try my thing. Usually works well too. I've had some rejection which I'm fine with too, I know I'm not everyone's cup of tea and that's obviously totally ok.

It's just, I did this all between 18-25. I got married at 27 and divorced at 30. I never really lost my 'mojo' if you will its just, I totally lost my will to go approach women EVEN if they look approachable. I'm not sure what it is that is stopping me. I'm totally confident and know I'll probably do ok, if not I know how to handle rejection so I'm not bothered about that either. So why aren't I doing it?

I feel like OLD had almost everything to do with this. Before OLD I didn't have a choice, I pretty much had to do approach in order to date. But OLD SUCKS for me. I get matched with girls way below my preferences and the few promising dates I had ended up being short flings/sucked. I want a LTR with someone real...

I just deleted OLD. I need my drive back to approach because women won't approach me. It sucks.

Long story short, it was an amicable breakup. We were clearly not compatible with each other (family values, religion etc), and we both emotionally checked out of the relationship last year, but I was unfortunately in denial about it therefore prolonging it. She eventually initiated it, which I was obviously against, but eventually it took me about a week to realize in the grand scheme of things, it was better off this way.

As fate would have it, I met this amazing woman \[F28\] on OkC in late Jan, and we hit it off immediately. I asked her out a few times and have been texting her on the regular.

Now here's the kicker. I've seen her about 4 times in person, and the only physical touch we have shared is a hug on the second date. I am worried that by taking things further, (i.e. initiating hand holding/a kiss etc.) would come across as moving too fast? A close friend of mine also advised me to come clean about my recent breakup.

Personally, I feel like I am completely over my ex. I have not contacted her or had the urge to contact her since the last time we met. In fact the last time we met, we went for a drink to ""send the relationship off"", and parted amicably.

I am meeting her again on Sunday for dinner. I plan to tell her how I feel about her, and coming clean about the whole sitch with my ex. Would this be a good plan?

I think he’s absolutely wonderful and we always have a great time when we’re together. He always pays for the date, I never have to touch a door handle, we talk about serious topics while also making jokes and spend the majority of our time laughing, and the sex is out of this world. He made it pretty clear from the beginning that he was really into me. We would text fairly consistently and talk on the phone at night for hours. 

Lately that seems like it’s diminishing. He’s a single dad and works full time (I’m a single mom and work full time as well,) so I totally get that he’s busy and can’t be on his phone all the time. But I can’t help that I’m a little bothered by the fact that I sometimes rarely get a text from him. For example, today he texted me good morning and I didn’t hear from him again until later tonight. There was no conversation throughout our day like usual. I guess I just got used to talking to him often so now I’m wondering what happened, if anything at all or if I’m overthinking and being dramatic. 

This has happened a few times over the past few weeks and it made me question things. I asked him what he was looking for on dating apps. He said he doesn’t care for casual sex with someone he doesn’t care about but he doesn’t know if he’s in a place in his life with kids and schedule where a serous relationship would be easy. He said he wants to connect and spend quality time with someone and if it turns into a relationship down the road then that’s great.  I told him I was pretty much in the same boat, as I’m fairly new to dating and seeing what’s out there.

I started liking him because of our connection and I always thought he was cute. We’re apart of the same friend group. 

One day he texted me and told me he slept with a girl he met online and…not going to lie…it did hurt my feelings. It shouldn’t have because he didn’t even know I had feelings towards him and that’s when I figured it was platonic. I had this gut feeling that I had to tell him I liked him. So I did, and he was super sweet about it and said he didn’t know - if he knew, he would’ve made a move on me. He always thought I was pretty, he just thought I thought of him as platonic so he went along. I didn’t really say anything after and we continued talking how we used to. 

Now, we were talking, and he said that he would want to initiate a friends with benefits scenario - and asked how I would feel about it. I just don’t know if I should go through with this. I’m afraid of the outcome, what if he doesn’t like me and just sees me as sex? 

My friends said there’s no way he doesn’t like me, and it’ll be fine. However, I don’t know if I should take the risk if it’s just sex.

Has anyone gone through something similar? So basically this girl (21F) that i’ve (20F) been seeing for the past month or so has been the most incredible thing for both of us. We immediately hit it off, had immaculate chemistry, and spent a lot of time together. We started to become more emotionally vulnerable with eachother and she opened up how she struggles with emotional blunting (side effect of meds which causing lack of emotions/feelings) and had mentioned how it’s so hard for her to feel anything. We continued to open up to eachother and she opened up about how she has these walls built due to past relationship failures. One thing lead to another and she decided that it would be best for us to end contact as much as it pains us both as she needs to work on herself because she knows I deserve the best. While we both don’t know what the future holds, we agreed to always be there for eachother and that after she sorts out her switching meds/working on herself, if she feels better we’ll likely get back together.

I need some advice. 

I must admit, I’ve found a little too much comfort in my reclusively and I want to get out there finally and just be free but it seems so hard. 

I started texting this guy off of social media for about a week and a half now and he’s planning a “date” for v-day. Informally. Which I personally find detached and cowardly. But that’s not a big issue, the issue is he’s weirding me out with the gushiness. 

I’ve been practicing being open. Open to people, experiences, conversations, etc. That’s the whole reason I have been responsive, but he does weird shit like says “ilysm” to the minuscule things I text and insinuates us being together and having children. I understand he may be trying to flirt but weird, inauthentic stuff like that makes me want to go right back into hiding. 

Dating feels so rush and cringy. Nothing authentic like getting to know someone on a personal basis. It’s so sad. I’m about to text him that I don’t want to go on the date. 

On one hand, I’m upset with myself because what’s the harm in trying but the pressure I feel to submit to something I’ve never done and have reservations about, makes me feel sick. Plus the freaking pressure of it being on V-DAY 🤮. 

On the other hand, I want to follow my gut and stick to my guns. I want something authentic and not rushed. It’s just too much pressure feeling the need to play house with someone you literally know nothing about. I know I am not wrong for wanting a genuine connection starting from 0 and gradually going forward. 

I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this. Everyone around me is seemingly in a rush to fall in love and be adorned with “ilysm”. So when I try and tell them my fears and inner dialogue they roll their eyes.

We have a deep emotional connection and he treats me really well. My concern is he seems to have apprehension about taking the step to putting a label on our relationship, despite us being exclusive and pretty much treating each other like partners. He says everything is great, but he wants us to build on our friendship connection more before he can commit to calling this a relationship. I think he holds the idea of boyfriend and girlfriend as a commitment to build a life together, which is true in a sense, but I feel like relationships grow over time and calling it what it is does not mean we have to fast forward and move in together for example. He said he wants to find more things we have in common, even though there are already things we have in common. I don't feel like we need to like the same things to be compatible. I am feeling really insecure about this and am still not sure how to process what he means, I am trying hard to find things we can do together, but he doesn't really ask me about anything I like. I don't know if he is just saying this because of his own relationship fears, as has a lot of trauma from past relationships, or if it's something I am not understanding. I just am worried my feelings are going to keep growing stronger and then he is going to leave me because he doesn't feel like we have a friend vibe. I don't want to be 3-4 months in and not be able to say he is my partner. What do I do in this situation? Does anyone have insight on what he means?

Then out of the blue three days ago his personality shifts completely into this weird put on fuckboy act that he seems convinced I’ll find attractive? I do not.

Usually nothing ever comes our of it and there's only been like 5 women that had potential for a relationship. I do not consider myself an expert when it comes to dating, in fact I'm probably an amateur. What happens usually is we talk, I ask her out, if she says yes we go on a date and if goes well we go on another date. I like to take things slow and get to know the person before making any moves or telling telling that I like them. I have only kissed 3 girls in my life and I'm always terrified to make a move because I don't want to make her uncomfortable or be too forward and I always think ""the times not right"". Then it just never happens because I waited too long. It's just unpredictable how they're gonna react and I hate the awkwardness that comes with rejection. I always ask permission before kissing, hugging, cuddling, or anything else the first time because honestly in this day and age I don't feel comfortable touching someone for the first time or any physical contact without their permission. I also keep things very casual when I start seeing someone and I'm afraid I'm just giving odd that platonic friend vibe but really it's just me trying not to go too fast. I'm also not great at flirting, I am a good listener, I take an interest in what they're saying, ask questions, and compliment them but it just doesn't feel like enough.

I never had sex before cause I was not sure if the girl I was seeing wqs ready, plus I'd rather wait until we're officially in a relationship or we both feel the same way before engaging in sex. It's not something I want to rush into because of my inexperience. I really think I need to do something different if I want a successful relationship but I don't want to be too forward or creepy and scare away a potential partner. I think it might be because I don't have enough confidence in myself, and I'm always waiting for the perfect moment that will never come.

I 20M broke up with my ex F20 of 2 years because of my trauma and mental health, but we have been in contact and was about to try and fix it

A month ago I broke up with my girlfriend because I was facing severe depression and really bad trauma, 

I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD 3 weeks ago and I got diagnosed with autism 4 years ago. 

Back track - a drunk driver hit me and my mum going 90 in a 40 and hit us  head on, we was both in hospital for a month, I broke both my legs and my mum broke 4 ribs + her arm, and 3 days prior to that my Nan who I would see every other day so I was extremely close with her passed away..

Since then I’ve had approx 2-3 hours of sleep a night waking up in sweats and nightmares.. every time I close my eyes I hear my mums scream and I see her head bounce of the window, 

I was deteriorating big time. I pushed everyone away and I ended up breaking up with my girlfriend a month ago.. recently ( 2 days ago) we came in contact again and we have came to the agreement were going to try out this relationship again..

She said straight away look I was single I went abit crazy and slept with people

I said “ look, your single you have no commitments you can do what u want” it’s okay, you don’t have to be sorry” 

*backtrack* before she met me ( we was just about to be 19 when we met ) she knew this man ( her cousins best mate ) since she was like 13-14 ( he was 25 at the time ( 2 years ago ) and when she turned 18 they ended up sleeping together for about 6 months. 

5 months into our relationship after meeting up several times with her cousin and that man I finally found out that she had a “ relationship “  thing with that man.  Heartbroken because I really didn’t want my girlfriend who I love dearly bring me to meet someone she’s had sex with several times without even telling me… *id never of Brought my girlfriend out with me to meet my cousin and my ex shag situationship thing, I just think it’s morally wrong*  so after we have a MASSIVE argument. I just think not telling your S/O and meeting him like your just friends is just morally wrong on so many levels..so anyway after  I confront him. U know your angry he’s being all nice to your face and there’s a proper deep past between him and your girlfriend and no one bothered to tell me. 

The way I found out was she was saying in the phone to her friend outside that he’s still an absolute **** etc etc. so I over heard and said what do u mean? And forced her to tell me.. 

She said she was going to tell me soon but I honestly don’t think she would of told me ever.. otherwise she would of told me right?? So that’s the backtrack and a big part of the story

So anyway, she’s single.. u know she’s just been through a break up and she’s doing single girl shit, and she tells me that she slept with him again without protection and doesn’t regret it..

I don’t mind that she’s slept with a complete stranger that has no connections.. but the fact she’s slept with someone who played a massive part in her life and a massive part in our relationship has bothered me quite abit.

And I know she was single but it’s made me feel sick to my stomach.. I just don’t know if I can recover from it… 

You keep the fact that you was sleeping with  cousins friend who I was meeting 6 or 7 times in our relationship for 5months and I had to find out over a overheard phone call to then sleeping with him when we had broken up..

I just don’t think I can now go through with this and I just want some of your guys opinions..

*sorry if it’s hard to understand.. I’m autistic and I really can’t read / write sentences well so it’s a struggle trying to explain and write what’s happening*

When I first met him I wanted to be his girlfriend but decided later I only wanted to be friends. 

About a year or so after we met he started abusing painkillers which turned to heroin and then meth. We drifted apart but still talked once in a while. He apparently was selling and got busted for it. 

He went to jail in September 2018 and got out of prison almost two weeks ago. When he got out I decided to contact him and he responded right away. We have hung out almost everyday since his release. 


I only want to be friends with him but we did have sex a couple days ago for the first time. I know it shouldn't have happened. I don't know why I let it occur. He jokingly asked me if we could have a child together since he really wants to be a dad. I just kind of laughed but didn't say anything. Due to his issues, his exes have all refused to have children with him. I personally don't want children at all. I had a miscarriage when I was 16 weeks along and was depressed for a long time. As far as I'm aware he doesn't know about the miscarriage at all because it happened when he was incarcerated (no the child wasn't his). 


Yesterday I told him I got a job offer at a clinic. He was like, ""I'm so happy for you babe. We need to celebrate. ;)"" A couple hours ago he came over to my house to hangout. We were sitting on the couch and he started kissing me. I should have stopped it but I reciprocated. We went into the bedroom and I laid on the bed and he got on top of me. I finally came to my senses and told him I wanted to tell him something. He asked if I could tell him after we finished. I told him I needed to tell him now.
