So I decided to join some dating apps at 19 and get some experience under my belt, no pun intended, and it ended up destroying my self confidence and self worth. I began to steadily lower my standards for the sake of having experience. I tolerated short responses from online dating, began to accept the ""lets just be friends"" situation in which I would never actually meet up with women for even platonic events since they made excuses,  and overall put up with lots of emotional abuse form women that I would never put up with in person. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 21 I deleted all my dating app profiles because the stress, anxiety and feelings of worthlessness were too toxic for my mental health. I know Im not alone in my experiences with dating apps as my friends either are extremely successful with online dating(lots of matches, lots of conversations, women are engaged) or they significantly lower their standards in hopes of finding someone.

It’s been a little over 3 months since we broke up (I pushed him away due to low self-esteem and communication problems) a few days after we broke up, I offered an apology and did not hear from him.

I’m moving in 2 months, and I don’t want to reconnect just to leave his life again. I understand I’m not entitled to have him back when I pushed him away.

Here’s what I wanted to say:

Ive been thinking a lot and wanted to reach out to say if at any point now or in the future that you would like to meet up and reconnect, I am here. No pressure to respond to this. I understand my actions have consequences and I really want you to do what is best for you.

I haven't had a single relationship since i moved here and i haven't been with anyone for 18 months now. By all accounts, i have my life together. I am turning 27; i make over 160k; well educated; nice apartment; well travelled; fluent in multiple languages; pretty tall; in good shape and; decent looking. 

What i believe is holding me back is the fact that I am black in a largely non-black city. This mainly limits my dating pool to black women (unfortunately very few where i live). Any other attention i get is from women who either 1) don't have much going on in their life/don't properly look after themselves health and cleanliness wise or 2) women who want to date me simply because i am black - and this lot is quickly disappointed because i am not the stereotypical black american male (whatever that is), mainly because i am english.

My dating attempts and (few) successes have all come from online dating. I dislike in-person approaches because of unpleasant experiences and bad energy i get from people here. It is not an issue of confidence (i think) - i am a litigator and I've had to get over nerves early on in my 20s. But, on the streets people don't even look at me in the eye when i am trying to smile at them (a common courtesy in most places i imagine). I've seen some women physically avoid walking by me. This weekend, a young woman literally jumped scared when she saw me walking beside her in broad daylight and on a very busy street. She came up to me to apologize afterwards but i was so upset by it all that i started thinking about relocating then and there. Again, this is a very large and supposedly the most progressive US city. The several times i've tried chatting up women in person have all failed and sometimes spectacularly. I don't mind being rejected, if they aren't interested then i don't really need to know why and i won't pester. But they were often dismissive and very disrespectful. Comments about my blackness came up on three memorable occasions. On top of all that, I frequently hear people saying things about me/giving me strange looks in the street or the cafe i like to work in, and even in my own office and apartment buildings. Like I am somehow not supposed to be anywhere i am supposed to be. All that to say, i am increasingly uncomfortable in these ends and that is why i don't approach women in person. 

My female friends, my workmates, and my sisters all told me that everything will work out and that i need to be patient and more proactive. Oddly enough, they all advise against online dating as apparently ""there is nothing for me there"". At this point however, i am really over it. Im highly successful in all my other pursuits but my dating track record is starting to make me feel like there is something wrong with me.  I feel like i wasted my best looking and most exciting years in a city that i madly really fell in love with when i first visited. I passed on london, nyc, and paris to be here but it is what it is at this point.

However, she was also openly touching me at times on the arm and at the end she hugged me and said we should grab drinks at a later date (I have no idea if that includes her friend or not). 

I am thoroughly confused about this situation. I was a bit annoyed that she invited her friend...I felt like that is something to do if you want a platonic relationship.

I was hoping I could establish that today.

After we met for the first time he was literally perfect he met all the boxes and treated me really nice.

Several threads on height preferences and one I saw the other day regarding a woman that wanted men without facial hair. 

If a woman posts on this subreddit saying she thinks 5’9 men are short, she’ll be inundated with messages on how shallow she is. The average American man is 5’9, does anyone here genuinely prefer anyone that’s truly *average*?  I’d assume if men said they didn’t want a woman that weighs 170lbs and is 5’4 (the stats of the average American woman), people here wouldn’t shame them for not being into bigger women.

This girl clearly wanted sex but made it a point to let me know that she wanted to wait until we were older.

I was completely cool with this as I wanted to just date her normally and find out where it goes. As time went on though it was clear that she wanted me to be more assertive and get sexual with her. And ironically even more so she wanted me to break her rule that she told me about wanting to wait because anytime sex was brought up she would get so angry for the fact that I wasn't trying even though she said she wanted to wait

Looking back it was so idiotic for me just to act so stupid and wait because I was trying to be loving and respectful but clearly that was not turning her on.

This girl reopened every single insecurity I thought I got over by the time I met her

I finally thought I would be okay being a sensitive nerdy big tall black man until I met her.

But something that I really regret is the fact that I still haven't virtually no sexual experience

By the time we both met each other again years later she was able to go on and sleep with 10 men.

Throughout all that time I was struggling trying to get over her abuse while trying to date again and I had nothing but failures

It makes me very bitter and I never wanted to coerce a woman into sex especially if she wasn't comfortable but looking back I wish I would have pressed for sex more

Throughout all that abuse at least I could have gotten some type of experience out of that to further use in my future interactions.

We first messaged through a dating app in February. I told him that I was looking for a FWB-type situation (but I was open to dating, didn’t disclose because I have problems with vulnerability). We would not be able to meet until he was fully COVID immunized. 

He was out of my mind until he notified me that he got his second dose at the end of May. For the next 3ish weeks, I thought about him obsessively…it was not healthy.

So we finally met a couple of days ago and he was awesome. I wasn’t having a good day, and I feel like I completely whiffed my first impression. The sex was amazing, but when it came to conversation, I had no confidence in my words. I feel like he’s just so much more…advanced than I am, in many aspects of life. I was dumbfounded the entire time and I came across as an idiot. 

After we had sex, we were lying on his bed and I asked him if he’d be interested in hooking up again. He admitted that casual sex doesn’t satisfy him. Once you have sex with someone you love, it just doesn’t feel the same. Makes sense, but it fucking hurt. Casual sex probably isn’t for me, either. 

I shot myself further in the foot by saying I didn’t want to be in a relationship so young, which probably shutdown any chance I may have had to meet him again, IF he is interested in me in that way. 

I don’t know if I’ll see him again, probably won’t. How do I get over him?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,864510,public,self,Idealized hookup to the point of no return—help,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9bznr/idealized_hookup_to_the_point_of_no_returnhelp/,all_ads,6,,,

It started because he came up to me and just gave me this intense, oddly intimate stare for two seconds in silence before asking a question and for some reason my dumb female brain cant get over it. It's the worst. I dont know what to do because the other girls I work with have told me it's totally attainable and to ask him out, which has only made it a bazillion times worse. Instead of it being a distant attraction I am now thinking of this actually working out which is NOT good. I dont know what to do. It doesnt help that I cant even tell if he likes me. Half of the time I talk to him he seems annoyed and the other half he is agreeable and generally friendly but we havent ever had one real conversation. I've only worked there for a month or so which makes this all worse because I love this job and I dont want anything to disrupt it.

What do I do? I asked one of the bartenders for his age thinking it would deter me but I have no problem dating someone who is 24. Its not enough to convince my emotional brain that it's not appropriate or possible. Help. How do I stop? I havent had a crush in a long time cause I always shoot my shot before I develop any sort of feelings but obviously that is not possible here. Too much at risk.

Currently going through a situation with my bf of 8 months...he’s devotedly religious, and I’m hovering somewhere near agnostic. Have had ongoing conversations about the place of religion in our respective lives. He definitely wants to carry his faith forward when settling down and starting a family; this also, to some extent, insinuates that he’d ideally have a wife who has similar devotion to her faith.  I have very little experience with his religion (Islam) and so am trying to keep an open mind until I learn more abt it, and what this could mean for our relationship.

To be fair to me, I lost my virginity to her (hopefully without her knowing since I didn’t tell her), I was amazed at how close of a connection we had, and I was so hopeful for the future and the things we were planning. We even went skydiving together and I think that brought us closer but throughout the whole thing I remember thinking that this would never workout bc she was never really available or seemed down for a relationship, but I stupidly ignored that. It lasted like 3-4 months and the funny part is that we had gone on one date a whole year before snd we reconnected on tinder, and in my head I was like “oh this is meant to be.”

She was a lot of my firsts, and I had a thing with a girl before but i was too afraid to do anything with her lol, and the most we did was hold hands. Embarrassingly enough I was a freshmen in college when this happened and so this gikr that I’m talking about was my first ever real “thing”. 

I finally got over my fear of making a move snd she made me comfortable with physical intimacy, and I remember we would just cuddle and stare into each other’s eyes and massage each other. I remember anxiously caressing her and it probably got annoying to her, but she also made me feel desirable bc she didn’t hold back when we were kissing or doing whatever. Before her I would shake at the thought of kissing a girl and I was just afraid of intimacy. 

The day after I introduced her to my friends she broke things off bc she said she didn’t want to lead me on into thinking she wanted something serious snd basically broke things off saying she realized she wasn’t ready for a relationship. I was devastated for a couple days but surprisingly felt fine after like a week. I remember going out to a club and dancing with a girl that week feeling like I was the man.

I even slept with a different girl the week after that and I remember feeling sad that I didn’t have the same connection that I had with the first girl. After that I haven’t really shot my shot anymore and I sort of just take whatever comes to me which is light flirting, getting girls social media’s, but nothing ever progresses further.

The worst thing is that I feel like I lost my swagger after that and I find myself thinking about her when I’m lonely, even after 3-4 months. I know it’s a confidence thing bc when I was seeing her, I felt like a ladies man bc i quite literally didn’t care what girls thought of me and therefore could better flirt with other girls. I don’t know how to build myself back up snd im trying to you know do the whole workout thing but I have injuries on both my shoulder and knee so Im just doing rehab constantly.

How do I get out of this rut? I’ve gotten some success since then but it’s mostly been on night outs where I talk to a girl, maybe there’s flirting involved and we’ll exchange social media’s, but nothing ever comes from any of it. 

There was this girl at my old work who I felt like gave me that butterfly feeling, but I didn’t want to ask her out since she was a coworker but also bc I didn’t want to risk making anything awkward.

You will be alright. Please stop worrying. Don't chase the relationship, but rather work on attracting it by not caring so much about having one or not. 

Be you, be kind, be open to new things, don't slouch and be polite. 

You don't need your own house or your own car in order to get the right person by your side. And why would you want someone who prefers you just because you own things?! As long as you are ambitious, have goals and work on achieving them, you will attract the right person.

If you like someone, ask them once. If they say yes, then great! If they say no, go about your day as if nothing happened. 

Set your standards. May I suggest avoing people who are oriented towards materialistic things? Holding someone's hand or taking walks, greeting them with a smile on your face and offering them moral support is always better than paying for their stuff.

Sorry to say it, but if women only pick the people at the finish line, they don't deserve them. Relationships are a marathon run by both parties. Don't forget that. Both should put in the work and the means. 

Do your thing and learn how to be alone until the right one comes along.

Now I know that most people still find others attractive even when in relationships. It is not the same for me. I only find the person I'm attached to attractive.

And honestly being with someone who does find other people attractive ,be it straight or bi men , is an absolute turn off.

Now keep in mind that I'm not completely writing them off but it does kind of make me uncomfortable.

Am I wrong for feeling this way? I was called biphobic for not wanting to date bi men but I've noticed that bi people come with a lot of baggage:

 Feeling that they should date the same gender to be adequately bi even when in a relationship, 
 missing the same gender and I know that this is just as applicable to straight people except they only look at the opposite gender.

And honestly I get it,I get that there are a lot beautiful people in the world and people will look. But that makes me feel like I'm replaceable. 

When I won't look at anyone else if I were in a relationship,I certainly don't want my partner to not afford me the same respect.

My family and I (20 y/o M) are heading to Colorado to visit my grandma. We’re originally from South Dakota and have a cabin that is 5/6ish hours from where we live. Also, it is pretty much in the direction we needed to go. We figured that we’d stay a couple days at our cabin before heading to Colorado. 

So, we’ve been here for a few days and tomorrow we leave for CO. today me and my family had dinner at this 50s themed diner and I saw a really cute girl who was a worker there. I guess you can call her a “waitress,” but the way the restaurant was set up was that you order ahead and then they bring the food out. Anyways, my dad and I walk in there and boom there was that really cute girl taking orders. While my dad and i were trying to figure out orders for the family, the girl and I kept making eye contact. Then it was our turn to order. She was polite and took our order, but we still kept making eye contact. she then started to fumble with her words and dropped our order number and awkwardly started to laugh at herself. I laughed with her but then thanked her for taking our order. 

Now i’m seated with my family and we’re waiting on our food. the cute girl and I continue to make eye contact, but i try and limit it so i don’t seem like a creep. but then she starts to act funny. She starts acting all goofy and dancing all while looking at me. she then starts bussing tables near where i’m seated. At one point, she stopped her friend and whispered something and i could see the other girl turn around and look at me. I’m sure you get the point, we’re interested in each other… at least i hope? 

our food comes out and she periodically checks in with my family and I to ensure that we have everything that we need. I was originally gonna make a move and ask her for her # after we finished eating but i didn’t. She thanked us for coming in and told us to have a nice day. I walked right by her and smiled, but held back on asking her for her #. I always opt out last minute when it comes to asking girls for their numbers as I am reserved and socially awkward. although this time, i got this feeling of bravery and that i was determined on talking to this girl…but i blew it. Another thing that held me back was the fact that I don’t live in the town where she works at. The only thing out there is our cabin. 

As a 20 year old male who has been in several relationships, I never thought i’d be constantly thinking about this girl and the situation i’m in rn. However, this girl really grabbed my attention. She behaves in a manner that i do at times and seemed really fun to be around. i’m not saying that she is gonna be the love of my life or anything like that, but i really want to get to know her. idk maybe i’m just crazy.

oh and here’s another thing. once my family and i are finished visiting our grandma, we will comeback to our cabin again and spend a few more days before heading back home. so, my question is, should I make some excuse to go back and eat at that diner again, even if i’m by myself, so i can truly make a move with that girl? or, should i just act like my age and move on? If I do end up going back to the diner, should i just write a note with my number on it for her or should i try and catch her attention? 

The only time i’ll be at our cabin is later in the month with my dad.

As i’m reading this i feel absolutely ridiculous, but i keeping telling myself that i’m young and that i should be brave and just go for it. I mean to be honest, if she isn’t interested in me it’s not gonna be the end of the world, but i’d rather have tried than not.

I'm a critical overthinker who overanalyzes everything and gets paranoid.

Quick backstory, we had class together this past semester and I saw her look at my IG story before she had followed me or we even really interreacted in class. A day later I messaged her privately on zoom and said we should keep in touch over the summer. She said she agrees and we exchanged info. We found out that we live like 30 seconds from each other. We texted for a bit, we have hung out twice, and we've talked quite a bit via text. I didn't start talking to her with the intent on becoming anything serious but as I've got to know her more I've kind of started to like her as more than a friend, and I kind of want to ask her on a real date. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had messaged her a few days ago because it was her birthday. The reply I got made me wonder if perhaps **she's reminding me that we aren't going to be anything more or if it's just a natural progression in the timeline of things.** 

I had sent her ""Hey Happy Birthday, I hope you're having a dope day today. I'm really happy we met, and I can't wait to see you again."" The reply I got was ""Awww, Thank you so much (KotaIbushuBIGTIME), that's so thoughtful of you. I'm glad I've made a friend like you, it means a lot. Good people that you can just vibe with is harder to find as we get older. Let's do something this week?""   


The overthinker in me says ""she is telling you that you are friends and you can not be anything more with her,"" but one of my friends had said ""You have to become friends with someone before you can ever date someone seriously, like yeah Tinder and stuff exists but it would be strange in this situation to just go on a date before anything else.""   


I think regardless, I'm going to ask her if she wants to go on a date and if she says no thank, whatever no hard feelings I'm fine remaining friends. Related to that, I could also use some advice on how to ask her on a date if I'm doing that...is it like a ""Hey, what are you doing this weekend?

&amp;#x200B;

I think of myself as a shy person, suffered from depression during pandemic because I was alone and was thinking I will be single my whole life. Worked on my way of talking and how I am as a person but I am a little on the perfectionist side and felt like I am not near social enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I was hiking with some cousins and while we had a break I thought it's a good idea to ask strangers how long is until the top, how are they doing and so on. At some point 2 girls come near and I start to talk to them, gave them some advice and recommend them a break if the feel tired. They continue the trip and after 10 min my group departs as well. Was thinking if would met one of them again, she seemed pretty nice. After 10 minutes I see them taking a break, we took one as well, started talking, they even offered me a place to sit on the blankets they use ( really nice girls). Out group continued together, we talked a lot on our way down, similar interests, we both work in IT, my problems to better manage my tasks and extra work and become a freelancer are problems she just solved and she want's to get into stocks which I am already there. We like to do sports, like to travel. Exchanged instagram to continue to talk (this was on Sunday). We left the mountains because we needed to go to a city that is 2h away and not the one near where she stays at 30min. We talked on that night, she asked me if I arrived (liked that). 

&amp;#x200B;

Continue to talk a little everyday, things go good, at some point I was outdoor walking at night to have some exercise and ask her for the phone number and talk to her on phone for almost 1h. Yesterday she message me first and we talk a little again. 

&amp;#x200B;

The downside we both live and the biggest cities after the capital at 4h away. But I have a car she has a motorcycle and we can work remote from anywhere. I like talking to her and want to ask her if she will be in the city in the coming weekends because I want to see her. 1 of my cousins is living there so I could have where to stay just in case.

That threw me off tbh and I didn't know what to say next. As a guy that respects himself, wtf do you even say to that? Lol 

So I made a joke of how she puts people on the spot (now I feel like I shouldn't have done that, but the situation asked for it tbh. I'd have more regrets if I didn't say it), then I go on saying that I don't see the point in trying to impress anyone over text, since that would make me put on a facade and make me someone I'm not.

 I prefer getting to know people irl, since it works best for me anyways vs doing it online, unless it's someone, who's continents away... I feel like the only people I should really try and impress are the employers, unless I simply feel emotions towards that other person.

Maybe I'm wrong tho. But I did find it toxic.

So my questions are:
1) what the hell did I miss in the last decades that made girls like that, that the majority of them now think that guys should bend over and twist from the inside out before even meeting them, over text, in order for them to be approved for the potential chance to maybe get an improbable date?! Isn't the whole point of a date is to try and get to know a person?
2) Am I the only one who thinks that technology hinders the ability to meet people IRL, something like two complete strangers starting up a random conversation that could lead to a date? Don't get me wrong, I like technology, except when it comes down to dating.

I can now recognise I am an attractive person and I am going to let myself have fun for the first time in years. I am no longer seeking validation from people, I want to have fun for myself. I feel so good!! 

I highly suggest asking out people if you haven’t given that a go. And if you have and aren’t having much luck PLEASE KEEP AT IT!!

I have been single for over 12 goddam years man. For a while I've been happy being single due to no baby mama drama, or money issues. 

But after the damn rona hit I have been a social mess since.

Right now Im in college and working part time saving money for a car as well, but for a year straight I was an absolute NEET.

This social isolation has made me a hormonal ticking time bomb.

I have a bad tendency to heavily flirt with girls but never ask for any phone numbers whatsoever due to me being insecure as shit and also social media is draining.

Looks where I live (the deep south) aren't really an issue (except for the damn height) since almost everyone is obese and have messed up features due to inbreeding and a diet of Sweet tea and Newports.
