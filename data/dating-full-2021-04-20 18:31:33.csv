We met on dating app and just after three days he visit my house. (We live in different cities, about 40km between. ) He first asked if he can come to my place. Everything was nice. My dreams come true, finally I met someone with who I can imagine long relationship. He used to call me by cute nicknames, he wrote sweet things such as ""I wanna cuddle with you"" Or ""I hope we can meet and spend time watching fireplace when cuddle under the blanket"". He first sent me nudes. He was really romantic and was giving me all the signs you can potentially imagine that he liked me. I started to fell for him. I get emotionally attached pretty fast. He start to open up and told me a lot of secrets that you won't share with everyone. We were meeting once a week and going to parties where he met my friends. When we we're together everything seems fine. We talk a lot, have fun, sleep in one bed. And when we don't see each other in real we play online games or chatting. But! About month ago he stopped doing all the romantic things, he stopped sending photos and voice messages, he stopped calling me by cute nicknames. Now it is plain conversations and waiting for next meet. I felt bad with that change so I reached him and we talk about feelings. I told him how I feel and that I like him a lot, that I feel safe around him. It is totally different experience than my one night dates. He said that he liked me and my friends but he doesn't feel THAT.  In shortcut he said that he like me but doesn't love me for now. It can change. He also said that he doesn't have much experience in love relationship but he is glad to earn new one not connected with love. For context I can say that I did him a photoshoot as a drag queen and support him in artsy career, I was the first one ever who took him on Valentine's Day date.. I don't wanna lose him but if he doesn't love me and he will not love me in future, I would prefer he tell me now because I don't want to end up with broken heart. He gave me hope that it can change but idk. It looks like he start to think that it isn't love and just give up on me. Also I don't want to be that one who give myself and my time for something which is unlikely to happen. My question is: should I try to fix that or give up? Should I end relationship or be friends with him? Should I try to talk with him one more time? I know he is shy and doesn't like to talk about emotions.

I didn't hear from him for two days, before I finally reached out to him Saturday...he responded and we talked for a bit. But, I haven't heard from since, with the exception of I sent him a picture Sunday morning, and he replied with an emoji. I don't know when she is going home, but I presumed it would be Sunday, with it being the end of the weekend at all. But...I still haven't heard from him so...maybe the stay isn't over yet. Maybe it was extended.

Again, I am happy he gets to spend time with his family. I know that when I spend time with mine, I can sometimes put my phone down and not look at it for hours. But, to just go off grid for days at a time...it's a bit frustrating. I mean...I highly doubt that they are together and talking 18 hours a day, from sunup to after midnight. Every single day.

Then, I wonder to myself....if maybe spending time with his family has led to some sort of clarity...the bad kind. Maybe spending time with them has made him think of the past, ex-girlfriends, etc. Or maybe he was able to discuss life with him....not me necessarily, or even relationships...but just life in general. And those deep talks have led to him deciding what he wants...or what he doesn't want.

I am turning 28 (M) and she is turning 30 (F). 

I’ve come out of a 6 year relationship (been single for approximately 2 years) and been with others via dating or just for a good time.

On the other hand, she has had a multitude of relationships - 4 of which were serious such as:

20 for a year

23 for 6 months .. first love

24 for 1.5yrs.. he cheated, secret relationship

28 for 6 months, uni friends of 10yrs

Then she mentions, ‘The rest were dating or a good time’. Which is fine because we have needs I guess.

It’s been approximately 5 days since we met in person and close to a month when we started talking on social platforms. She is compassionate, caring, empathic and really in touch with her emotions.

 She has already introduced me to her close friends     on the 3rd date, especially one who she considers as her second mother (not biologically) - I don’t know if this means anything? She has also invited me to social gatherings.

Concerns:

Because of my abandonment issues, I am concerned that I will be let down.

I tend to sabotage my own happiness as I am reflective within looking  forward (I live inside my head if that makes sense)

I have suffered from anxiety &amp; depression my entire life (caused by the toxic environment that  I grew up in). And I am aware that this may affect decisions or how I conceptualise things but have been undergoing progressive treatment for the last  2 years to day to help combat in order to live a better life for myself

She has been in multiple relationships where I have been in just one

 She had a 3 some in her past life but was upfront about it from the start (did not go into detail because did not feel the need to - I feel like I can look past this)

I can see that her profile in the social dating app we met is still exists (so does mine) but unsure if she is still using. I did not want to ask because to avoid coming off as being a jealous person.

Student culture in my country is pretty much partying so I met a lot of girls. I didn't even need to hit on the girls. I just had fun with my friends and girls always came talking to me, told me that I'm good looking, asked number or some even asked me to leave the party and go with them. So yeah, my self confidence was sky high and I was doing fine in Tinder too. Girls seemed to like me and always wanted to go on a second date. But then the corona pandemic started.

I downloaded Tinder again last September when the situation with the corona was better here. I started dating and actually met very nice girls. However, non of them wanted to go on a second date which was strange for me since we had a lot of in common and had fun. I decided to delete Tinder and focused on my studies, hobbies and also worked out a lot. I think I got my confidence back during the winter. This month I decided to download Tinder again and I've been on a couple first dates now. But non of them wanted to meet me again either! Two of them didn't even reply my messages after the first date which has never happened before. I have no problems getting Tinder matches or dates but getting a second date seems incredibly hard now. Also, getting rejected by girls isn't doing wonder for my self confidence. 

Any ideas what could be wrong? I took 5 new pictures for this Tinder profile. Two selfies and three pictures are taken by my friend who was using my DSLR. I also still have similar clothes, haircut and beard style so no big differences in my look. I've met girls in cafeterias, bars or just outside and we usually go for a walk. I hug when we meet and hug when we are heading our separate ways. Just like before the corona pandemic.

I could also tell something about myself. I'm 24 years old male university student. I have a lot of friends, good relationship with my family and nice part-time and summer job. I play the guitar and bass, go to the gym and I also enjoy reading and walking outdoors in the nature. So all in all, I'm doing fine (apart from bad luck in dating) and my future seems bright.

There was a time when pretty much all social interactions had some form of agreed upon, ***and documented***, framework.  A lot of that stuff was about mundane things like, *which fork is for salad, and where should your water glass be placed in relation to your dinner plate, etc.*   I can't help but wonder though... if there were ever these kind of ""text books"" written for dating.

We quickly learned, as we talked, that we are VERY similar in almost every way...The way that we look at life, our sensitive natures, how we analyze and vibe to music, politics, intelligence, introspection, empathy, humor, mental and physical health...It's uncanny. Neither of us thought that anyone existed that could REALLY understand us.

When we met, we hung out for 15 straight hours, and it was one of the best days of my life.

Sounds great, right? Well. It is. Except, the deal breakers mentioned in the title. First, she is morbidly obese. I am not superficial, in general, but I do have some standards. That said, I think that I can look past this.

Second, because of her hard life, she didn't have the best dental hygiene, and now has no teeth. Dentures hurt too bad for her to wear. This one is a little harder to overlook.

Third, her house is in pretty awful shape. Growing up poor, I have seen worse, but this is a pretty worrisome.

We connect on a cosmic level. It really is something that I have never experienced before. I want to be able to overlook these other things, but if I press on, it will only hurt her more if I suddenly decide I can't handle them.

(TLDR): People take being good looking for granted. Being pretty is a privilege. Just because you experience different pain form ugly people does not mean you experience the same pain.

*Disclaimer. This is my experience. I am describing what I have personally experienced when it comes to dating and conversing with women. I am not trying to direct my hate towards *all* women; I am not trying to initiate misogyny, I am not trying to behave in an entitled way. I am simply, expressing my experience and how this has affected me and my outcomes on my life.* 

Good looking people have it easy in life. Let’s not pretend. You get the job you want, the partner you want, the future family prospect you want, the social circle you want, the attention you want, the admiration, the respect, the recognition, reap all the joys of life.

Being an ugly person like me I find you get ignored, people want to keep away from you, people give you less opportunities, you get less success in dating (that was obvious), people are generally rude, arrogant and spiteful towards you. I have literally noticed good looking people speak to me with so much hostility, and then approach a pretty person with respect and politeness immediately afterwards.

When it comes to dating, I have had my fair share of insults from women. Women have called me disgusting, ugly, men have said “he’s so ugly ain’t he” just after walking out of the room I was in with them. Women have called me ugly (to my face). Women have pretended to throw up around me and make retching noises. So do not come at me with the personality and loving yourself bullshit because I will get arrested for punching someone if i hear it.

On tinder I’ve had no better luck. Women ghost me, it’s *exhausting* trying to force an unwanted conversation (why the fuck would you match in the first place??) women have used the vomit emoji to describe my pictures.

So like I said. If you think you don’t have an easier life being pretty; you are extremely mistaken and I honestly believe more awareness on this subject needs to be raised to promote change. How can you tell somebody it’s what’s inside that counts when people avoid you like the plague because you look so ugly to them? If you can’t even get your foot in the door!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 24yo heterosexual man, and the fact that I haven't ever dated anyone just weighs on me so much; I don't know where to turn to with a lot of these feelings of inadequacy and emasculation. I have never had sex or kissed anybody, and I am excruciatingly touch-starved. It's not an exaggeration to say that nobody in my life has shown me love, and there have never been many people in my life that I can rely on to be emotionally supportive with these issues. I've had to overcome great hardship, and face most of it on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

I try so hard in everything I do, and I'm so close to understanding what it means to love somebody, but without actually living it, love is still just like a color I've never really seen before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Online dating has been a total bust, even when I put my best foot forward. I've had girl friends of mine help with setting up my profile, on multiple apps, to really limited success. No amount of thoughtful messages, carefully chosen pictures, or change of locale has improved my experience. I consider myself to be a pretty good looking guy, but it's hard to hold onto that belief when I only get a handful of matches every *year*.

I know I'm not alone in that. I'm painfully aware that sad, lonely guys like me are a dime a dozen nowadays, especially on dating apps. My problems aren't special, and there's plenty of other dudes, even in my own life, that I see in similar situations. And it's not totally about sex, either. Don't get me wrong, I'd be more than excited to explore my sexuality and learn what it means to be a good partner, but the emotional connection with someone else is truly what I've come to care most about. Given the choice, I'd much rather just cuddle up and be near to someone for a few hours. I think that would be nicer for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I work on myself. So hard. Hundreds of hours in therapy, constant self-correcting and trying to improve the way I socialize, losing over 20kg of weight, and I have a great job in a well-respected field. I'm proud of myself, my character, and all the obstacles that I've overcome. I strive to find great friends, hobbies, and culture; in most ways, I feel like I'm very lucky and very successful. I try to love who I am, and I'm alright with that on most days.

And yeah, I do actually shower on a regular basis.

&amp;#x200B;

But every time I hear ""you just need to put yourself out there"" or some similar platitude, it keeps making me feel that all the effort I've put in up to this point hasn't mattered, and that I'm still *missing something. That I'm still not good enough.* The deluge of half-hearted advice from people who don't take the time to understand me just becomes increasingly demeaning. More and more often I just feel... drained, knowing that there is a massive facet of human life that is still completely *alien* to me. Sometimes I'm reminded that I've never held anyone in my arms, or woken up next to someone by my side, or gotten truly lost in passion and love. Sometimes I have to grit my teeth and sit through conversations with friends who reminisce about what it's like to be passionate with a woman. Sometimes, I feel so emotionally rattled that I feel *physical pain* in my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

To think that there are people 10 years younger and more romantically experienced than me, who know what it's like to have somebody hold them and tell them that things are going to be okay... I have no issues admitting that I am deeply jealous. I am a fully grown adult with a good grasp on how to live my life, yet who feels wholly immature next to these children. I know it's young love that's probably bound to include heartbreak, and isn't all sunshine and roses. But I'd take loving and losing over never having loved at all; that's a part of life, and I want a part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure with all of this complaining, you may think it's no wonder that I'm single. Honestly, I try to stay hopeful and contented so as to not seem too desperate or damaged when I meet new people; I don't expect a potential partner to fix my trauma and self-worth issues. My depression is my own, and while I'm sure it would help having someone walk through it with, I take responsibility for it. And although I continually feel defeated, I count my blessings as much as I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I've just come to understand that it's all luck. Just pure dumb luck. You can follow all the rules, you can be the best *you* that you can be, and still not be happy with life. That's kind of how life is. Of course, I'm deeply worried that the longer I go without finding someone, the harder it is going to be to continue to try to do so. As people my age start getting older, there will (on average) be more expectations placed on *experience* when searching for a relationship. Not to mention that given my sensitive emotions surrounding my self-worth, I have to be careful to find someone who's nurturing and patient enough to support a guy who doesn't know what it's like to date at 24.

&amp;#x200B;

But without anyone else showing you guidance or compassion or empathy, I've found it's nearly impossible to do this on your own. I guess it becomes a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy: nobody wants to show you love when you don't know how to love people, but you can't really know how to love someone without first being loved yourself. It's a tough position to be in, and I've gotten a lot of advice over the years, but nothing's brought me much peace when I think about all of this.

I'm a gay male. There is something that has happened quite often in the last few months. I'd agree to meet up with a guy, after he arrives he rejects me in person from the very start.

I know what you may think, that I'm probably using flattering pictures that make me look much better than in person. No. All my pics are unprofessional, taken at home with bad lightening and a bad iphone 8 camera, using selfies or a broken tripod. I don't filter or try to smooth anything, not on the pictures I use on dating apps at least. In addition to that, I open video call. We all look much worse on these video calls. Yet they liked how I looked on them, and agreed to invite me over for a hookup. I do the video call thing to make sure they and I are interested, also for safety.

Yet for some reason, it happened 3 times already. And I left absolutely crushed. Getting blocked on a dating app or ghosted is much better than being humiliated at someone's place like that. And having to waste all that time and possibly money to hear something like that.

I'm also pretty honest about everything really, looks-wise. I showed them my upper body on these video calls. And used the frontal and back camera with a mirror to make sure. They also know my height, weight etc.. since they are on my profile.

Two guys said it wasn't how I looked, but how I acted in real life. Mind you, I'm autistic, but I don't look the way people expect autistic people to look like. I appear shy, cold and aloof because of it. I have to remind myself to make eye contact. But otherwise I just look bored and keep swapping my fingers, touching my arms. My voice is monotonous and appears flat and funny, and it is kinda feminine as well.

I really wonder if it is my autism that is the boner killer. Do they see that something is ""abnormal"" or uncommon with me and lose interest? I just highly doubt that someone you think is hot enough on a freaking video call yet in real life he apparently disgusts you so much.

I'm not taking it personal and don't feel entitled to anything. I'd do the same if I didn't feel it with a guy.

I appreciated the honesty and was happy to stay friends. Over the next couple of months, we continued chatting and met up in person for walks a couple of times (as friends). 

I continued on with my life as is (matched, dated and broke up with somebody else late last year). Earlier in January, X told me he’ll be busy with work for the next 6 weeks so he’ll be even worse with replying to texts than he already was (usually takes him a week or two to reply). I told him that’s fine cause I was gonna be busy too and wished him luck with his work. Six weeks passed, presumed he was either still busy or bored with the chat and decided to ghost (it would be almost a year since we first matched). 

I was a little disappointed (if he had actually ghosted me) but decided that I didn’t have any expectations of him since I presumed we were just friends, and even then the fun chat sort of friend not deep dark secrets sort, so I didn’t think he owed me a reply if he didn’t want to chat anymore. Got on with my life and then got a text today from him saying sorry for not keeping in touch for ages (no explanation why, but I suppose he doesn’t owe me an explanation or does he?) and said he hopes I’m well. 

I’m unsure what to make of this: (1) does he see me as an actual friend and is just terrible at keeping in touch with friends? I’d think 6 weeks is a long time to go without checking in with a friend that you were regularly chatting with before that. Especially since during that period, I came across his OLD profile and noticed it was updated. So this made me wonder, (2) is he keeping me around as a backup option and is back for attention when things didn’t work out with somebody else cause I was always up for a chat before?

It's been pretty fun for the most part considering I am now super selective about the character of the men I see. All have been excellent men. Some have been terrible potential partners.

HOWEVER...

I met this guy. He's a professional creative (not going to give away identifying details) and we seemed to get along pretty well on the first date. We kissed at the end and I was weak in the knees (when I usually feel nothing when I kiss someone). So naturally I was keen. He texted me the same day to thank me and arrange the next date.

The second date was great, he texted to organise a third time to see me in a couple of weeks after, and I asked him on a date for that weekend.

So the date count is up to 4. By the fourth date, I had a crush on him and was starting to develop feelings. Over text we'd spoken about what we were looking for which basically ended in him saying that he likes hanging out with me too much to be fwb, and he'd like to 'see where things go'. I told him that I not looking for fwb or casual and that I'd also like to see where things go. Also that I'm not ready to be exclusive but I'd like it to head that way. So we agreed we weren't exclusive.

But so far, they haven't gone anywhere. He texted me later that week to talk. I invited him over and we had sex. After sex we lay down and cuddled for a bit, maybe 30 mins, and then he left. The sex was great. I shot him a message the next day to say it was great and wish him well. He replied and the comvo continued in a basic way for the rest of the day. That was 1 day ago.

Now, nothing. He hasn't asked me out again or reached out since my last message (it was kinda a closing message).

When we text, he puts in a lot of effort to reply, ask questions etc. But he is REALLY slow with his replies, I'm talking hours (6+) if not days. This frustrates me to no end.

I wonder whether he's not that into me, or whether I need to make my feelings more known? I really do like this guy, he's smart, funny, talented and attractive and makes me feel things, but this communication and uncertainty is killing me.

I'm not devoting tons of time to these apps as I have personal projects and all that, but my goal is to have respectful conversations.

This one guy I matched with asked me, within about 5 mins, ""how is the app going for you?"" and I simply said I was brand new (true) and I didn't have much to report. His next question is ""so what are you looking for on here?"". I told him that I was looking for a serious thing. Another guy (31m) had asked me before (but after some actual conversation) and I said the same and he was happy to hear it, so I figured I'd be honest with this other person (29m). This guy (29m) goes ""well I'm looking for new friends mainly, not looking to rush it. I want a partner eventually some day too but I'm not looking to rush but I definitely miss having a partner who cares about me""... lol. ok? So I took him at his word, and respectfully said I understand and it sounds like we aren't on the same page (as I don't have endless amounts of time for conversations with men who are just looking to take it super slow), so no problem at all, but that basically I'm investing in serious-minded folks. Then he goes ""well I am looking for a relationship. Wait. I just said not tomorrow. I need to know someone for 3 months before it gets to that.""... I'm about to go, ""yeah of course not tomorrow, it takes time. People here are total strangers so I understand needing time as do I.""

They would rather wait 2 or 3 weeks, or they're busy for a month and meet up again, and that's cool and all but I feel like as weeks go by and maybe a month or so, the momentum is lost, the connection of wanting to know each other any further. 

So for someone like me, who is looking for a relationship, if things go well on a first date, am I rushing it by wanting to see them next week or so, and seeing if they're available by following up the next week?

hello fellow humans of reddit!! well there is no easy or right way to start this off so i guess ill try to give the most unbiased story about the situation i am in. i apologize in advance for jumpiness or holes in the story so feel free to ask for clarifications because this happened fairly recently.  to start, been with a girl for about 3 years. been friends since 11 and started dating at 16. i know this sounds cringe and cliche, but we were much closer than most couples are at our age. although we always had feelings for each other, we fell hard for eachother junior year. a lot of this background information is insignificant so ill try to keep it short. we did absolutely everything together and she always told me how “im the love of her life and how she sees a future of marriage and family down the road” etc. etc. although this is fairly childish to be thinking about at a young age, we both very deeply believed in it. we did absolutely everything together. 

i have had a very rough childhood and the majority of my peers and friends know this. she was there and helped me out of many holes i found myself in due to my dad being diagnosed with a fatal disease, my mother cheating, my parents getting divorced, and many family members dying. at the time we started dating i may or may not have been part of some illegal activities and ultimately cleaned my act up and got out of that life mainly for her. if it wasn’t for her, i could very well be in prison like a close friend of mine. not to mention near death experiences such as getting a gun stuffed in my face and robbed or horrible car accidents. i have had close friends die due to drug overdoses, car accidents, and even murder. she is the reason i stopped breaking the law and the reason i got clean and began succeeding in academics such as presidents list and getting accepted into a great university. her family treated me like a son and i actually worked for her brothers company for a long time. during this time her brother and i grew close. my family adored her as much as they adored me. my mother expressed to me many times how this girl seemed like the one for me in the long run even though we are very young, and she expressed how she has seen no other girl look at me the way this one does. she said we were meant to be together. my mother isnt one to sugar coat jack shit either she always tells me things how she sees them.


during our honeymoon phase our friendships with others suffered but we ultimately fixed this after we realized what was going on. she had to cut off some friends due to them either flirting with me or causing issues. we trust each other on a very real level and even share locations and would always post each other on social media like all couples do. at about the two year mark, we were at a wedding and got into multiple fights over stupid things. i was extremely intoxicated like everyone else there and it led me to making the worst decision or my life by dumping her at her brother’s wedding. there was no screaming match or anything dramatic, but by the next morning everyone had a gist that we were on a rough patch. i made this known to her how much i regretted it and how i didnt mean it etc. etc. and her family understood that this rough patch clearly wasn’t intended for the wedding and knew i had some personal problems going on so they never held a grudge against me for it. however, her oldest brother (not the one i used to work for) never looked at me the same way again and i don’t blame him for it. i broke his little sisters heart the night of his little brother’s wedding. 

even though we fixed things up quickly after, the damage had been done. i did not go over her house unless no one was home because she was uncomfortable about the whole thing until i finally spoke with her dad in person at a job site which for sure eased some stress. he honestly seemed happy to speak with me after such a long time. although i didn’t see her family nearly as much as i used to. she continued to come over my house all the time but wasn’t sleeping over like she used to due to us being casual. we used to sleep over each others houses all the time. we ultimately got back together but decided to keep things slow and steady but still continued to do everything we normally did. i apologize for the jumpiness but i also forgot to mention we graduated high school together and are attending the same college. during this entire time including the “temporary break up” we always showered each other in expensive gifts and always attended each other’s family events and bought gifts for each other’s families.  out of all my friends and hers combined, we were seen as an ever lasting couple and no one ever thought we would break up. it was surprising enough we began dating in the first place due to me being a “wild guy” and her the “innocent school girl”. 

we both agreed to go into college together with realistic expectations despite our past discussions of our entire future together and having a family of our own. recently after my 19th birthday i noticed her delving into sadness that i have never seen her succumb to before. after many attempts at trying to talk (which 9/10 times she always opens up to me) she finally admitted how she was depressed about the thought of me finding another girl in college even though we go to the same college, and that she is never happy unless i am with her. this was heartbreaking for me to hear and she admitted how she always thought her problems were so insignificant to the issues i have had to face in my own life. i stressed to her that anything she cares about, i do too.

 after multiple long and heart throbbing conversations, we decided that it would be best for both of us to go into college single. i believe she needs to be more independent and become happy with herself instead of only being happy with me. this conversation wouldn’t have come as soon as it did if i hadn’t addressed it but it was pretty much a mutual agreement. we have since taken each other off most social media although i am still tagged in some instagram stories and we both posted each other on snapchat just a week ago. we still send photos to friends when we find ourselves meeting up. we still talk via multiple social media platforms and facetime, but we are officially single. unlike the usual “30 day no contact period” we went a few days without speaking to allow us to calm down and focus on what happens next. this hurts me just as much as it hurts her. we ended things with saying “if you love something set it free, if it comes back to you its yours, if it doesn’t, it never was” 

the other day i dropped off a nice basket of flowers and gifts including a very heartfelt letter. we still meetup every now and then which usually leads to sex, but we still deeply care for one another regardless of that. although this happened fairly recently, we both say how the thought of each other with a different partner is gut wrenching and horrible to think about. neither of us are pursuing a new partner anytime soon, but we all can agree how college is... we also still share locations although im unsure of how long this will last. i am not trying to ramble more than i already have, but we both share the same ambitions, values, and hobbies. i am basically asking for advice, opinions, and brutal honesty about whether or not you personally believe we will get back together in the future. just last night we went to sleep on face time together. we still continue to help each other with school work (some of the same classes) as well.  i understand we are young and nothing is set in stone, but we have never fought over anything major besides the wedding bullshit and are always stronger and better than ever after any conflict.

 i am for sure forgetting some vital points so feel free to ask for more specifics and i will make edits as i go. it hurts to know we will most likely meet other people at our college, but thats a thought we will both have to get used to. i just want to know about what others think about us possibly getting back together in the near future after we focus on ourselves independently. thank you for reading this holy bible of text and i appreciate your time giving me opinions and feedback.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,727546,public,self,my (19m) and girlfriend (19f) broke up...is our idea of the future possible?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mv4uta/my_19m_and_girlfriend_19f_broke_upis_our_idea_of/,all_ads,6,dating,19ec58c2-9f74-11e7-81a1-0e2bf15991f0,I Need Advice,,,

So, picture this: I'm in the supermarket and I see this cute girl. I ""had"" to walk passed her to get produce and thought to myself how cool it would be if she noticed me and we started up a convo. That doesn't happen.

I get my mushrooms and just go on about my shopping right passed her. I need salmon so I go to get it. As I open the door, I notice the same girl in the glass and she is headed my way. I get what I need and then I notice the fresh salmon at the butcher. I start looking at it, but can't help but notice the girl buying salmon too. She then comes over and starts talking to the butcher about it.

She and I then start talking about different kinds/brands of salmon and she mentions about her uncle liking fishing and I mention about liking fishing. The butcher hands her salmon to her and she backs away from the counter. 

My dumb brain couldn't think of anything else to say and I blew it by saying, ""HaVe a GoOd NiGhT"" like a goober. She said ""you too"" and then stood there for a second before walking off.

I felt like I missed an opportunity to have real genuine conversation with a pretty girl that I shared something in common with. I partially blame COVID and Online Dating for my lack of in person social skills when it comes to women, but at the same time, do women want to be asked out at the grocery store? 

To give further context, she had airpods in, which I always take as a ""buzz off"" sign. I don't want to feel like I'm bothering someone by approaching them and normally there isn't that organic (no grocery store pun intended) conversation started just by walking up and saying ""hi"".

I \[23F\] went on a date about a week and half ago with this guy \[24M\] that I'd be talking to for a while on Instagram, and the date went really well. We went to coffee and talked for about 3/4 hours with no awkwardness at all, and we had a lot in common. I wasn't sure if it was just friend vibes or not so I'm interested in going on a second date to see. Since then we've messaged a fair bit, usually he initiates the conversations, but I have too, and the chat is pretty basic and not too interesting- we definitely had more to talk about in person. It's not very flirty at all, but I would put that down to us two trying to figure it out and I would say he is somewhat shy. 

I asked him out the first time, and he has not asked me out again - yet he does message me so seems interested.

Is he really interested? and what should I do? I obviously would prefer if he asked me out this time so I know that he is interested too, and because I feel like I've taken my 'turn', but I'm not sure if he will. I also think he might think I'm not interested romantically, which is somewhat true as I'm not sure yet and I'm hoping a second meeting will help with that.

 On one hand,  she actually initiates texting conversations,  she asks me lots of personal questions (including some pretty intimate ones)  and (this could just be my perception)  she seems to tailor her responses to be more in line with my beliefs and values.  

On the other hand,  she doesn't flirt at all.  When I made a flirtatious statement she did kind of reciprocate,  but it was pretty neutral.  

The reason I'm asking this on reddit like a teenager and not just asking her directly,  is because we live about 10 hours away,  and I'm afraid if anything does come of this its going to suck because long distance relationships don't work.

This is going to be a longer post, but I'll try and get the point quickly and keep my word count at a minimum.

I was visiting with my mom back in January and while I was there she became very insistent that I message one of her coworkers, a girl about my age. I was hesitant at first, but eventually I gave in and did so. We hit it off pretty well and began messaging semi-frequently. Sometimes there'd be an hour between messages, usually there would be a day or so, and on a couple occasions there was a whole week. The pace worked well for us both since we were/are both active college students working full time.

The convo was fairly light and casual during this time. We made plans to eventually meet up and go hiking, but we were both short on free time and mutually understood that it would probably have to happen sometime in March/April.

After one of these week-long delays, I received a message from her. I read it and thought I responded without realizing that I'd only thought of a response without actually sending it. This was in early March or so. 

Three weeks of no communication followed. Then, at the end of March, she got ahold of me by sending two duplicate messages via text and one on Messenger. I realized then that I had been the one who failed to respond last time. I was also kind of taken aback at the effort to get ahold of me on her end. It seemed like she really, genuinely wanted to keep talking to me. 

Our conversations vastly intensifies afterwards. We began sending each other extremely long messages everyday, without fail. Neither of us are very flirty, but we both also expressed a strong mutual fondness for one another. We were comfortable communicating and the convos were very fluid and easy. We set a date to meet and go hiking in stone.

There were other signs, too. One weekend she went backpacking with a couple friends and afterwards she told me that they had invited me to come along next time they were in town, which told me she was telling her friends about me. She was suggesting activities for date #2 and beyond, such as pizza night and wanting to do some board game/tabletop stuff. My mom, who works with her, told me that another coworker of hers had told my mom that the girl had said that I ""Made her smile inside."" This told me she was also telling her coworkers about me.

The day of the hike came and it went incredibly. I felt it did, at least. We had a picnic and were out and about for roughly five hours or so. It was wonderful. I was super nervous beforehand but as soon as she got in my car I was comfortable and judging by how much we were laughing, I think she felt the same.

 Towards the end of the date, as I was driving her home, she went out of her way to invite me to a family campout of hers all the way in June. At one point, as we were hiking back down to my car, we were talking about friendships and I mentioned that I didn't really feel like I truly had a ""Rock"" in my life. She was quiet for a moment before saying, ""I volunteer as tribute.""

Eventually I dropped her off and we shared a hug, which she initiated. I drove home and about two hours later I sent her a text thanking her for spending the day with me and letting her know I was looking forward to the next date, which we had already decided would be a pizza/movie night. She got back to me the next day, letting me know she had a blast with me and expressing excitement for pizza/movie night. She also let me know that I wouldn't be able to get ahold of her the next day because she had a final but afterwards she would be on spring break. I wished her luck and told her I totally understood.

I didn't hear from her the next two days. Two days after her final, my schedule got changed around, so I thought I'd text her and let her know I was available over the following weekend if she wanted to do pizza night. Previously, we hadn't decided on when the next date would be, only that it would happen. She got back to me a couple hours later apologizing for not texting me the day before as she was really worn out by the final and spent a lot of the day resting. She told me she would check her schedule and see if she had any time during the weekend, but wasn't sure since she made plans to spend time with her cousin at some point during the week. 

I replied it was all good, no pressure either way and that I hoped she felt better. She replied later that evening expressing great fatigue and issues at work, to which I replied asking her if she wanted to vent and by also sending a M E M E to hopefully cheer her up. It's been radio silence since then, about a week ago.

So one half of me is telling me that she seemed exhausted and super busy and that she may be dealing with other personal issues, hence the silence. The other half is desperately worried that I may have done something wrong or come off as too clingy after the date. I've spoken to a couple of friends about it and they've all said I was overanalyzing the situation and that I should just chill, maybe send a text in another few days or so. Part of me fully believes that, but another is worried that I'm missing something and that I've messed up somehow.

It just feels jarring with the complete drop off in communication since the date. I'm nervous I put her off, but then I also wonder why she would invite me to an activity with her family in June and offer to be my ""rock,"" all towards the end of the date, if that was the case. I kind of want to reach out again just to see how she is doing, but I also really don't want to come off as too clingy. If she isn't texting me then I feel like she must need her space or otherwise doesn't feel inclined to talk to me. There have been times in the past where we didn't talk for a week or two, but things have been so different since we picked up at the end of March that it seems strange for it to happen again. One of my friends said something interesting; that maybe she feels comfortable enough with me that she can stop talking to me for a while and know I won't take it personally. I dunno.

I'm not trying to be high maintenance or be demanding of her attention and I hope I'm not coming across that way here. I'm just trying to figure out what exactly is happening. Should I be worried? Should I check in on her? Should I just sit tight and let her come to me, if she comes to me? I really like this girl and I truly don't want to blow it here.

Also I hope I've worded this okay. I'm very tired and just finished class so I'm doing my best to be comprehensive 😅

* I am 21 and he is 19. We'll call him J. We met at college almost a year and a half ago. He's my best friend in the whole world, and I am his first relationship. (I do have other friends, too: currently living with my high school best friend of 17 years and a college friend.)
* My first real relationship ended with me being manipulated and physically bruised. My second was my high school crush and we dated for 4 years before breaking up. J is my third real relationship, and we started dating in January of 2020. 

We broke up. The absolute love of my life, yet it ended up making me the happiest I've been in years.

I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, depression, and PTSD when I went off to college about 4 years ago, and I was just learning how to cope when I had to hold my grandfather's hand as he took his last breath after a quadruple-bypass open heart surgery and 2-week-long coma. My life was on a downward spiral from there until I met him. 

When I met him, it was like everything fell into place. I fell *hard.* I know everyone says this, but I loved him like he would be the last one I would ever love. My family loved him so much that my 8-year-old sister would run to hug him first whenever we would come home from college to visit my hometown together. My dad even **hugged him once.** (This doesn't seem like a big deal to you, but my dad is exactly like Ron Swanson from Parks &amp; Rec, if that puts things in perspective.) He and I are opposites that compliment each other perfectly and grow mentally and emotionally as a result of this, but he's also the only person in my life that likes the nerdy things I like and will talk about controversy and space and parallel universes and other deep stuff with me. 

He told me he loved me within the first two weeks of dating. We talked about getting married and building a life together, and we worked out a plan for the future so that we won't have to do long distance (since I'm 3 years older and will graduate before he does). 

As some of you may know, mental health issues come with ugly symptoms like ""depression room"". Mine was so bad that after I couldn't see any more of my floor due to all the clothes and garbage, it took over every inch of my entire living space. I literally had not cleaned my room, bathroom, closet, or desk area in two years. Eventually, he would ask me to go out to eat with him or to go bowling or do some other kind of date, and I would say no nearly every time. I just never felt like I could get up and go anywhere. This was for months. I never gave him any reason to think things would change. He started to think about what our future would look like with me being like this, what kind of wife and mother I would be in this state. He also realized that he would often blow off studying for tests or doing assignments because he would rather hang out with me, and he is failing one of his classes as a result. He decided he wanted to break it off before things got any harder. 

I was devastated. Blindsided, though I should've seen it coming. I knew why he did it the moment it happened. I got up from my desk, sobbing, and crawled into my bed. I looked at the mountain of clothes at the foot of the bed so high that I couldn't see my bathroom door around it. And then... Something inside me just... clicked. I normally would've spent the day crying and trying to find some kind of numbness at the bottom of a bottle of vodka, but I just got up and started putting clothes away. I washed at least 15 loads of clothes. I cleaned my entire bathroom. I organized my closet, top to bottom. I spent **2 whole hours** on my hands and knees vacuuming every inch of my small living space in my apartment. I'm still working on my bedroom floor. 

And yeah, part of me was doing it in hopes of getting back together with him. I definitely thought that was the dominant reason at first. I sent him pictures of my room after I had gotten the very thick layer of clothes off of every inch of my bedroom floor. When he said he was proud of me, I didn't feel that surge of pride and intense desire to hear him say it again like I thought I would. I realized that I wasn't doing this for him. I was doing it because of me. I've been cleaning and organizing, working on my area for at least a couple of hours per day, every day, for a week. I even started going to the pool to get some sun, exercising, spending more time with friends, and turning in assignments early. 

Maybe it was because I subconsciously realized it was overdue. Someone like me should know how to take care of themselves, after all. Maybe it was because I needed to prove to myself that I could survive without him. Maybe I started just to make my brain be quiet. Either way, I see a huge difference in my happiness after taking that initiative, and my roommates told me that they've never seen me thriving like this the whole time we've lived together. 

J and I have been hanging out and texting because we determined that we can't go without each other's friendship. 4 days ago, he told me he still loves me and kissed me in his car. He said that he needs to study really hard for finals which are in 2 weeks so I've been giving him advice on how to learn time management, and he's already seen results himself. We plan to regroup on May 3 when finals are over and possibly get back together then. I'm finally someone deserving of him-- and with or without him, I'm who I was meant to be all along. I'm so proud of myself and love myself so much more now.

It absolutely blows my mind how I went from being so controlled by my issues that I neglected myself, my surroundings, and my relationship, and being the one that needed help so badly, to pulling a complete 180, getting literally every area of my life together for the first time in over 2 years, and being on top of my \*\*\*\* enough to be able to help *him.* 

I still don't know what happened in my brain that prompted this. And even though I'm really happy that we might get back together, I'm even happier knowing that I'll be ~~okay~~ thriving either way.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,727749,public,self,Breakup Epiphany,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mv74ze/breakup_epiphany/,all_ads,6,dating,fd9c03b8-a1ce-11e7-9172-0e8c9f9ecf4c,Other,,,
