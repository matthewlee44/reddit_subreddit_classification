A few weeks ago I 24F made an online order for some pizza. I thought the delivery dude was pretty cute 24M, so I offered my barely used delivery bags up for sale so I could see him again. We exchanged numbers, and when he picked up the bags, I asked if he wanted to chill. He mentioned he was new to the city and was looking for friends. We texted eachother and planned a date, we met up had a great time getting to know eachother, it seemed like we had great chemistry and similar values, and there was lots of flirting, overall it was a pretty fun time and we laughed alot. It was such a great time that he asked if I was free the next day, and I was. He said he was working from 6:30AM - 9:30PM and he would confirm with me. He ended up canceling because he didn't meet his delivery goal for the day and rescheduled for next Monday, I told him that I would update him. I texted him on Sunday and we confirmed a time. He said we definitely needed to see eachother since he was leaving town for a month. He texts me on Monday, asking if we can meet tomorrow instead. I didn't immediately get back to him but I assumed he needed to work the extra hours,  I gave him the benefit of the doubt and told him that I could make some time. Tuesday comes by, and he sent me a sad face emoji saying that because he didn't meet his goal he would have to cancel, he said he would see me after his trip fingers crossed emoji. 

I like this guy but at this point I'm under the impression that he's too busy with work to prioritize our dates. I also understand that he may need the extra hours. Not sure if his work ethic/schedule lines up with dating. I haven't responded to his last cancelation text yet. He made an effort to let me know before the dates and rescheduled with me everytime but flopped 3 times. I don't want to lower my standards and keep making time for this person but I also don't want to make the impression that I'm unsupportive of his goals. My roomie says that I need to date a new guy with a different hustle who doesn't need to work extensive hours. Not sure if I should also just leave him on read or tell him how I feel. Is he being inconsiderate, or does he really need the hours? He was able to make time for me the first date. I'm not sure, any advice y'all?

I remember she would go out of her way to come chat with me ,always laughed at my jokes like I am the best comedian kept telling me how funny and cool I am and all around she seemed very interested in me. The first days we met I remember she even dressed better and even wore make up.

I think she was expecting me to ask her out but I never did (which might have annoyed her) cause for several reasons I found her not compatible with me and also I didn’t want to start an affair with a coworker

Now we kept talking and texting ever since as good friends with some flirty undertones , she helped me out on some things,worked on certain projects together I got to know her better and started liking her cause she seemed like a nice and genuine person

Something like a month ago I decided perhaps its time we become more than friends…not gonna lie the covid lockdown and being unable to meet new people might have something to do with this

So I asked her out and she said she is busy with a huge project but  we could go out some time later…the part about her being busy with a huge project was true at the time

So I asked her again some weeks later and said something about how she has to rewrite part of her project and that she is still busy which honestly didn’t make sense and sounded like an excuse. I took this as a rejection and told her when she is not busy she can ask me out and she said ok

After going around in her socials I am pretty sure she is seeing another guy (but she is kinda of trying to hide it) even before I asked her out which of course is fine she can see anybody she wants but why would she not tell me truth?why would I not deserve the truth? I am her friend after all.Isnt it also unfair for the other guy she is seeing?Am I the backup plan in case things go wrong with that other guy which is quite likely, she does have an unstable dating history after all

During our time when we were married she worked retail and made a friend of her coworker (Beah), and invited her to game night with the rest of our friends. Over the course of the next couple of years they became good friends, and Beah discovered that one of me and Dee's friends was someone Beah knew from childhood (Now known as Ally). Slowly over time Beah became closer to Ally, who she had just became reacquainted with and some where along the lines this caused Dee to feel like a third wheel. Also, during this time Ally and Beah were listening to the marriage troubles of me and Dee, and advising her to leave and/or step out of the marriage as we were having intimacy issues. So Dee eventually did step out with the help of Beah and Ally, as they introduced her to dating apps. In the following months Beah, Ally and I became closer friends as we discovered similar interests in gaming, anime,and other nerd activities as Dee and I were still on the rocks. Beah and Ally soon approached Dee, stating that they felt guilty for their advice as they found me not to be ""that bad of a guy"". Dee, soon before our seperation, had a falling out with Beah and Ally shortly before moving back home with her mom across the country. Since then I've been hanging out with Beah, who've I've seen as a little sister of sorts, much to Dee's chagrin as she sees Beah's changing of attitude about me as suspicious. It's been months since the falling out and Dee's departure back home and Beah had come to me and stated that me and her should date. I do find myself somewhat attracted to her, and do find her personality alluring but I feel stuck in my decision to pursue this avenue. Should I pursue this even though this may cause more drama, or is this even worth possibly ruining me and Beah's friendship?

No real expectations because I know how unpopular it is compared to services I already use like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, etc. But I wanted to have at least one more place to try.  

Among maybe 50 total accounts in my area, about 7 match my filtered preferences and I surprisingly find one girl I'm very interested in and set up a date.   

But one cool feature about Match is that it's not just a long, endless queue. You can see the whole pool at once. Like I already said, there were about 50 total accounts and only a handful were within my age range, body type, lifestyle, etc. So I decide to change my gender and sexualty to see what it'd look like as a straight girl with the same settings.  

There were about 100 options. So I assume the entire pool is probably around 800-1,000. That really put it in perspective for me how it's so easy for guys to get attached to one girl on apps because the options run out really quick when the ratio is 10:1 whereas girls have a mountain of options....  

Now, if those accounts are worth them talking with is another thing. But the point is, I saw firsthand how many guys I'm up against. And from the opposite view, I'm sure most girls think guys have the same experience and have plenty of profiles in their queue.  

And this is not to say finding someone is impossible, or lament how hard guys have it online. Quite the opposite. Both sides have their issues. Having too many guys you're not interested in messaging can be just as awful as not having anyone you're even interested in as an option.

For context we’re both 22 and we dated for a year when we were 17/18 during senior year and going into college. We were each other’s first SO and she was my best friend in high school for quite some time before we started dating. Overall we had a mostly great relationship trying to navigate and figure things out. Towards the end cracks started to form due to external factors that led to me being passive aggressive and her spending less time with me which ultimately perpetuated a cycle that led to our communication breaking down and us breaking up. She initially wanted a break but I felt like a breakup was best for both of us to grow as people and the breakup ended up being rather amicable.

We went no contact for about 16 months as I needed time to work on myself and to get over her. it took me a long time  to get over her but I eventually did. I did a lot of personal reflection and really grew as a person during this period of NC. She ended up contacting me on my birthday and we started talking again. We had an awkward relationship for a while where we would talk on and off for weeks for weeks at a time. Around April 2020 she was still feeling kinda awkward so she mentioned she was not looking for a relationship at time which I was perfectly fine with and wasn’t really looking for one anyway.

Since then our friendship has dramatically improved and we’ve started talking on a roughly every other day basis for the past 4 months. We have a pretty good friendship and have hung out a good amount of times where we have a lot of fun with each other. We have both been reintroducing each other back into our respective friend groups as well.

Over the course of our recently improved friendship I’ve started to catch feelings for her again and I’ve tied to look at the situation as objectively as possible. I have done a lot of self reflection since then to make sure that I would be making a well informed decision. We have excellent chemistry and we’re extremely compatible as we both have a lot of the same passions, values, and goals in life. I really think that we could have a really strong relationship if we tried again as we’ve both really grown and matured over the past 4 years. The external factors that led to the breakup are no longer present. I have worked on my self a lot over the past 3.5 years and have significantly reduced my passive aggressive tendencies and have made an effort to make sure I’m open about how I’m feeling. She also grown a lot over the past 4 years and we are a lot more mature now than when we dated. I also feel that she might be open to the possibility of another relationship now that we are much closer and our interactions are getting to a similar level before we dated.

My question is how do I go about asking her about starting a new relationship? My thought was asking her to hang out and at the end asking her out on a date and saying why I think a second shot would be great. I want to make sure she can make a decision without pressure, so I figured I’d tell her to take her time and think about it. I am completely okay if she doesn’t reciprocate and does not want try again. Does this seem like an okay way to ask her? Would another approach be better?

“It’s worth remembering that for any change to happen in your life, you must be wrong about something.” (Mark Manson)

I notice nowadays stubborn people (myself always included) tend to be afraid of being wrong. We always trying to defend our point of view vigorously without considering that we might be wrong. Ask yourself, what’s wrong with being wrong? Am I afraid of the pain and/or embarrassment that comes with being wrong? 

Do you know that experience pain can be more beneficial than experiencing pleasure? We as humans learn more from pain and past hard experiences than from any pleasurable ones. As for being embarrassed that is how you simply decide to feel, you need to realize you are not that special, no one cares of your embarrassment and being embarrassed is a part of growing up. Actually to deny yourself of experiencing pain and negative emotions like embarrassment is to deny yourself of an opportunity to grow up which is natural for humans. 

Most of social anxiety roots can be trace to being afraid of pain. That’s why you don’t approach girl/boy you like and say “HI”, that’s why you decide to stay with partner that treat you like shit, that’s why you keep using drugs, all of this is what end results can look like when we afraid to face the pain. 

In conclusion I wish to add this, anytime you feel like asking Reddit questions like “why do I feel X and Y, why she/he did X and Y” the questions you should ask “Why do I give so much fuck? Do I give my fuck rightly? Is the fuck that I give about X and Y worth giving a fuck?” 
Most positive and healthy people in life disturbing their fuck only to important personal matters, and give zero fucks about anything that is not important to them, Why you asked? Probably because they know that we will all die sooner or later in the end and amounts of fucks we can give are limited, so choose wisely to whom and for what you give your fucks about.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,854944,public,self,Being in pain is natural and healthy,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o6c8xd/being_in_pain_is_natural_and_healthy/,all_ads,6,

I am Romanian and lived since my birth until the age of 12 in Romania, then my parents brought me to Germany. Now I am 22y old. Finished high school, got my technical degree in IT and now am still single.....

If I date Romanian girls.....they either find me attractive, because I am from abroad, but they don't want to pursue a long distance relationship and don't wish to move abroad either. I can't resonate with the Romanian youngster lifestyle. The slangs and the mentality being raised as pre-teen in Germany. German women on the other side don't see me as a German guy. They respect me, but being a foreigner is really a disadvantage for me it seems. They are not racist, but they wish to found a family and the kids should learn German firstly and foremost. They find sometimes pretty annoying that I have my Romanian accent when I speak German as well.

Germans see me as a Romanian guy(which I am) and Romanian women see me as a German guy.

By the way I don't wish to move back to Romania. My parents gave up everything they had and built in Romania so that I could have the opportunity to grow in a country with chances of a bright future.

Romanian girls who moved in Germany like me like most the foreign guys and not the Romanian guys.

Boyfriend is looking for a job since he is in a place where he immediately requires basic financial independence. We both are from a good college in India (IIT Madras), earning our Bachelor's from there.

So, we have a few options.
Option 1: I apply, he manages to score a job in the same country and everything goes well. (Not very probable since entry level jobs in corporates seldom offer to take you abroad)
Option 2: I don't apply and get a job in India. He gets a job here as well and everything is good. (But I eventually want to move out of India, so that's going to be an uncertainty for a while.)
Option 3: I go, he stays for a while until he finds a way to come there (probably a few years) and we do long distance. (We've already been doing long distance for almost 1.5 years because of the Coronavirus.)
Option 4: We break up and go our separate ways.

I believe we would be able to get through it even if it were to become an extended LDR, he doesn't. He thinks we won't make it if that happens. I'm fine with not applying right now, since I can do it later too. But it's something that is important to me nevertheless. What do we do? Any way he can manage to land a job overseas?

I (F26) was in a very long relationship (6 years) until last year when I broke up with him because he cheated on me. A few months after, I casually dated a guy (more like a FWB) for a short time, but that also ended about 7 months ago. Since then I've been single and kinda okay with that (except for the occasional loneliness and lack of physical stuff), especially because I still need to figure a lot of stuff out after the whole cheating thing and I know right now its just not a good place for a new relationship. I still think about my ex a lot and I am afraid that I will never find someone so similar to me. 

About ten days ago, I couchsurfed in a different city at a guys (M28) place. My stay was only supposed to be for two nights, but I am still there. On my second day he asked me if I wanted to stay a little longer since he got an operation and wouldnt want to be miserable at home. I agreed because we had fun until then and I didnt want him to go through that alone, so I canceled my ride back. The day after that he confessed that he had a crush on me. I told him that I like him too, but that my whole baggage isn't a good spot to start anything. He understood and said that he wouldnt try anything if I didnt want to. He also said that I am the first girl in years that impressed him so much and that I kinda shocked him with my whole personality (I am not bragging, it's just what he said. And at some point it got too much). But I gave my promise to stay there with him and we still had a good time, he wasnt hitting on me or anything. He just gave me a lot of compliments and showered me in presents and food (which already started to make me feel guilty). I already wanted to leave on different days but he always had something new planned for us and said that I could leave after that. It's not like he's keeping me hostage or anything :D but he was very persuasive and emphasized that he wanted me to stay for as long as possible.

After a few days, I started thinking that I maybe had a little crush on him too but I am very conflicted about my feelings (generally and even worse right now). So...I acted on it. Which I maybe shouldnt have done, but I wasnt touched for seven months and he for at least a few years, so I thought...whats the harm? Or idk what I thought, I was horny. I made out with him and it got a little heated up but during it I started to feel really, really bad and stopped the whole thing. I almost cried and told him that its just not fair. I felt repulsed by him and by myself. Ever since the cheating it made it very difficult for me to be physical and not associate it with that stuff. But the next day after, we started again and we had sex. It was good so far, but of course he got more attached to me afterwards. 

Since then, he is talking about us so much, he gives me compliments every minute and treats me like a queen. He doesnt know me completely already and I am sure that he just idealizes me. He is lovely but I just cannot connect to that kind of behaviour (compliments all the time, cuddling, making plans). I just feel suffocated. And he is already making plans for us for this summer and I just feel overwhelmed. I feel so guilty that I started the physical stuff although I still emphasized that I cannot have a relationship right now. He said to give me all the time that I need but he really doesn't. 

It makes me feel so horrible that I cannot give him what he wants. He never had lots of luck with women and now he said that he finally got something good what he deserved. Like I am the woman of his dreams. And we only know each other for ten days. I really want him to find somebody because he is funny, smart, a great guy altogether. Just not a good fit for me. We wouldnt work as a couple, I am afraid. We still have plans until sunday when I'm gonna leave and I dont think I can leave earlier. But I also dont know what to say to him when he asks when we're gonna see each other again. I am just overwhelmed by the whole situation and cannot comprehend how it got that far so quickly.

But now I think I've reached a point where I'm starting to think if I am wasting my time with this guy.

He is probably the most passive and shyest guy I've ever met in my life. For example, during our first sex, I had to tell him to ""go for it"" and ""it's okay to do that"" multiple times. For more than 70% of the time, I am the one who initiates our dates and also, he never texts me in between dates (except for to ask me out), although he is quite responsive when I text him.

Last week I asked him if he was seeing anyone, and he said no. And he says he actually hasn't had sex for the past two years (!) and hasn't dated for even longer. He told me he hasn't met anyone else than me from the dating app. (I don't think he has a lot of dating experiences in general)

I'm not sure if I should give him the benefit of the doubt for his lack of experience and shyness in general and keep doing what I am doing. Or am I just bothering a guy who's simply not interested?

It takes pressure off of us to move too quickly to sex and so far it's been working except for a few... When it doesn't work, it's not just a brush it off and move on, it's a big deal and opens all sorts of issues. 

FWIW: If we were to move to a full on relationship, obviously we would talk about this. I don't want to say I am pro or con to monogamy moving forward. In the past, I was fully monogamous but I was younger and my opinions and views are fluid. 

Anyways, I have since discovered that even just mentioning what non-monogamy is to me, gets interpreted that I'm polyamorous, open to being a third, in a ""triad"", a ""unicorn"", in some hierarchy of relationships, and all sorts of things that I don't know what they mean. I then would spend the next hour walking back what I said and then just wishing I had never said it or mentioned it in the first place. 

I have stopped stating and listing that I'm ""non-monogamous"" but finding creative ways to describe what I believe without actually saying those two words. I still find it odd that two words, automatically mean I'm so many things to different people. And again, no matter how much I define them, polyamory people seem to think that it's an open to me joining their cult or couples thinking I am going to join them. 


Like I said, I quit mentioning this in my profile and have even quit saying and using ""non-monogamous"" but still find it all strange and seems like it's happened in only the past year. Maybe it's just where I live and maybe it's all a fad, still, it's weird.

For context, I’m a university student, turning 21 this year.

Has anyone not been in their first relationship yet? Technically, I did have a chance if I wanted to - I’ve rejected 2 guys before because things didn’t quite work out at the talking stage. But also on my end I’ve never been really active/invested in the romantic department because I never saw the need to?? Like I always see my focus now as to concentrate on my undergraduate education to build the foundation for a successful career. I want to be financially independent and not have to rely on my parents so much. 

But recently I’ve been seeing so many people on social media in relationships??

This has been keeping me worried for quite some time. I (F, 21) have known a guy (M, 21) since high school (about four years), but we only got close recently because we watched the same show (This is Us). As we connected more, I developed feelings for him over two months. He also happens to be my first ever crush back in high school, but I never told him and we went on to date other people.

I was very direct with him about the situation after I wrote a poem about our recent time together and he seemed to have understood from that but didn't know for sure. He was honest about not feeling the same way but said that he would be open to something happening in the future. He was also particular about wanting to be with a friend, which is why he said we should remain so.

I thought light flirting and mentioning my feelings every once in a while was okay until I was confused about signs from him and he told me how hard he's tried to see me that way, but it is not happening for him and he's afraid that it may not be natural.

Although I stopped mentioning my feelings, I did realise that there was no effort from his end in being friends with me, and I decided to tell him that as well, yesterday. Patient as always, he asked me what I had on my mind, and he received the longest string of texts I have ever sent to anyone — including how I think he feels sorry for me because he doesn't reciprocate what I feel, or doesn't share as much as I do, or how I think he feels obligated to reply to me within a certain period when I don't expect him to. It was full of emotional troubles and how it is difficult for me to navigate what is going on with me at the moment. He responded that he was overwhelmed and needed time to respond until he was not. He never says that which means I have cracked him this time.

I have sent him long texts in the past about how I suffer from high-functioning anxiety and my habit of trying to sound cheerful even at my worst until I cannot breathe and I have to stop the conversation. Sometimes I even asked to clarify whatever happens between us, and he is so sweet that he made sure I never felt that I was burdening him too much when I was. We've been on hour-long calls and he never complained. The weirdest part is that I am a calm and quiet nerd in person, but with him, I become something else — bubbly, all out, like a movie character. I cannot believe how many chances I had to just let it go with the flow, as he'd suggested.

Throughout this whole thing, the dynamic has been such that I send too many texts or talk too much and he only responds or can share little. I have taken up way too much of his space while being completely inconsiderate of the fact that he works 14 hours a day and still takes the time to make sure that I don't feel like he is avoiding me. I have been in a weird headspace and I wish I had not been so extra about it to him after knowing that he is someone I do not want to lose.

While he is yet to reply, I know I have taken up too much of his space and I have lost him completely. I know it is tough, but is there any way I can do some damage control and make sure he feels okay? He is a beautiful person and I really wish I could do better, even as a friend. I don't want to force it anymore, and I just want us to be good.

She always seems happy and smiling when she talks to me. But we have never been out yet and we still don't have each others numbers yet and we have never touched each other aside from brushing shoulders and hands when giving something to one another. But we do give eye contact a lot. But I don't know if she is giving mixed signals.

I see her again tomorrow because it's Thursday. 

In my workplace, all the managers are lenient so she tells the manager ""I'm going to chill with him (my name) for a bit"", and they don't care. So it seems she actively wants to spend time with me. She also asked ""have I got a girlfriend?"". She also talks about her tits and her woowoo to me, even though I'm not her boyfriend. She even pulled her trouser legs up and shown me her legs and started talking about how she didn't shave her legs, and she's going out with her female friends after work and she has to wear leggings under her dress. 

But then another week comes and she isn't acting the same. She wasn't talking as much as she did the week before. I'm the one having to engage in majority of the conversations, while last week she wouldn't even leave me for 5 minutes. She wasn't doing the stuff mentioned above. 

She goes on her break and walks outside and talks to a construction worker for like 25 minutes, because there is construction site outside the store. She doesn't tell me who that guy was and here I was thinking I have been played all this time and she has a boyfriend, but she told me that that guy is not her boyfriend, he's trying to get a date with one of her friends. She says she was trying to get my attention through the window, but I was ignoring because I thought that guy was her boyfriend and was trying not to look. 

I like this girl a lot, but what I am supposed to do when one week she is warm, another week she is cold. Even if she acts cold, she still wants to stay near me somewhat. I still haven't got her number yet. Is it still worth to ask for her number or leave her and just only see her at work only and not outside?

The issue sometimes I get in a mode where I wanna be alone and I can’t hold up a conversation unless it’s with someone funny.  Like I find myself being funny with females but once that introvert me kicks in.  I find they get less attractive to me.   I’ve been single for while for a longest time I didn’t care to be in a relationship. In high school I struggled with depression, anxiety, and ADHD.  Now that I trying dating I find I lack the social and dating skills from the years not trying.  I still want to be a introvert but I wanna learn how to build meaningful relationships with friends and dating.  I’m like a 6 or 7 out of a scale of 10 so I’m like above-average looks who also works out.

The title pretty much says it all, I guess. 

Gonna start dating again after about a 7 month break. Probably gonna hold of until August. Here's my problem. I'm fine with the whole online dating thing. I've used it in the past and have had some decent experiences. Unfortunately, I had two very negative ones back to back and now I'm a bit paranoid about dating people that likely/most definitely are dating/sleeping with other people. It never really bothered me before, but some things have happened recently. For people that immediately think I'm being unreasonable, allow me to explain.

About 8 months ago I dated a girl for a month and a half. We went on a date every week and I paid for them all. (no issue there. I really don't mind paying.) We ended up having a movie night which led to sex. Everything was good. Then two days later she told me she'd been dating and sleeping with someone else and that he'd asked her to be his gf. She'd said yes. I was honestly baffled, as I'd have never guessed that, but I just kind of took it in stride and moved on. No negative words said to her or anything. (Their relationship apparently didn't work out. She added me on FB and IG about a month ago and she's single again.)

About two weeks after that, I met another girl. We hit it off immediately and had sex the first night. We hung out a lot but she went back and forth as to whether she wanted a relationship, so after about 2 months we called it quits. A month and a half went by and she asked me to hang out again. Pretty much confessed her love for me and told me how much she'd missed me and that she wants to try to make something work. I was cool with that. I really liked her too.

A few months went by and we had a lot of really good times together. One night she decides to tell me that in the month and a half that we were apart she'd been sleeping with someone else. She wouldn't normally have brought it up, except she was afraid she'd gotten chlamydia.

Now, before I go any further, I did sleep with two other people during that time frame as well. But, I wore a condom each time and actually got tested after. 

So, I was like ""well, whatever. It sucks, but I was having sex with other people too."" And then she told me that she hadn't been tested and hadn't made him wear a condom. So, I was pretty pissed, but chlamydia isn't the end of the world. We waited for her test results and they came back negative. Fast forward about 3 days and I feel a weird bump on myself while showering. TA-Dah. It's Molluscum Contagiosum. A viral STD that is notoriously difficult to get rid of. So, I told her. And she found bumps on herself as well. That was kind of the beginning of our downward spiral, as she was planning on moving, has commitment issues and changes her mind every two days, and I honestly just don't trust her anymore. We mutually ended things.

Fast forward, the Molluscum is now under control and is pretty much entirely cleared up. Dermatologist cleared me, but I think I found some very small ones. Gonna wait for those to disappear and go a few weeks/month bump free before I start dating again. 

My issue is that this whole thing has really tested my fucking sanity. The past two months have been absolutely miserable and I don't ever want to deal with it again. The last two girls I've ""dated"" haven't really worked out too well on my end, and I don't really know if I want to date people that are potentially sleeping with other people. That being said, I'd feel kind of stupid for asking on like the second or third date, ""hey, so are you fucking anyone?"" 

If that's not an unreasonable question to ask, then maybe I'll give the online thing a try again. Before all this, I really had no problem dating women that might be having sex with other people. Especially when I didn't feel that much chemistry with them. I did the same thing, and I would be a hypocrite to expect different behavior from them. But, Idk. I'm getting to the point where I'd kind of just like to settle down with someone I really care about, but I'm realizing that I'd find it pretty difficult to build a healthy relationship with someone that might be sleeping with other people. Especially with the shit I've dealt with for the past 8 months.

Long Story Short; I've had some not so savory experiences with dating, and want to know if my changing philosophy is warranted? If I'm being unreasonable, then probably online dating is off the table.

I’m a 29 year old guy and I’ve been on these apps ever since my last relationship ended two years ago with little to no success.. but for some weird reason I’ve decided to stick with them and push through the pain hoping one day I’ll come across someone cool.

Last straw for me has been the last two girls I’ve talked to. First one liked me on hinge (I didn’t like her first), so I matched with her. Girl was gorgeous, gave me her number pretty quick, conversation was awesome and she was super engaged into it... gave me her number.. and then a few days later I asked her out on a date which she playfully ignored. Whatever.. fought through that.. a day and a half later I asked again.. she didn’t respond for a day and then said “I’m so sorry I’ve been so busy studying for this test” blah blah.. I said no big deal that shut comes first I respect it. Then a few days after that I shoot my third shot.. she leaves the convo on read.

Last night, another girl likes me first. Convo was great, she’s super responsive and engaged in the convo.. she makes it clear that she’s looking for something serious and isn’t looking to play little kid games .. so today I ask her if she free this weekend to get together and do something.. and she unmatched 😂😂

The amount of girls that have straight up stopped answering after asking them out on a date is crazy. It’s like they have no intention to actually hangout.. they just want someone to talk to. I’m done.. I’m over it.. covid is clearing out so I’m getting my ass back out into the real dating world.
