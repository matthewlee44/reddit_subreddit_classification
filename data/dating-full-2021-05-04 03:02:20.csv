I lost the V card junior/senior year in college. I was afraid of having sex due to my religious upbringing. I didn't have a REAL relationship until my late 20s and that only lasted 9 months. Then my next relationship was a total disaster that lasted about a year and half. I've joined a Christian based app (CatholicMatch), I'm pretty much wasting my time there. I don't follow all of the teachings and most guys on there are not looking for that. I deleted Catholic Match within 3 weeks. I'm Catholic, but secular in some areas. I go to mass, but I also believe in birth control and such. If I join Tinder/Bumble/etc. I'm not wasting as much time, but most men expect sex within the first 3 meetings. Even before meeting I say that I'm looking for a long term relationship. If I don't know your last name, I'm not having sex. 

On a date with a guy I really like he unexpectedly mentioned sex. On the inside I was taken back by it, but I played it cool. Later that night before went I home he said I was an ""angel"" and wholesome. I disagreed, but he insisted I was. Is not having sex on the first date wholesome now? 

I don't consider myself an ""Angel"" at all. In fact, I'm a sinner and it's kinda fun sinning. Attending Burning Man and eating mushroom chocolates was one of the best experiences of my LIFE! Obviously I'm not going to mention this to man on the first date due to him thinking I'm a drug addict. Personally I don't find taking certain substances a sin, but to others it's a mortal sin.

To start off, my girlfriend (21F) and I (21M) have been dating for almost two years now. Things have been relatively good between us. We’ve always been a good fit for each other and I really do care about her. She’s sweet and she really cares about me as well. 

We met at a party and it was pretty much your regular boy meets girl sorta thing—and by the next week or two we were dating. 

But lately I haven’t been up to doing things with her alone or been wanting to have sex either. I know she’s been feeling a little weird about me lately since I’ve been sorta distant, and I have been feeling guilty about that. 

I met someone recently, and he (21M) and I hit it off pretty quickly as friends. I talk to him pretty regularly now, and we hang out. He is openly gay and up until now I’ve always thought of myself as straight and strictly into girls. 

It’s just been an entirely confusing thing to me since I’ve never felt this way for another guy before, but every time I see him it’s like I don’t want the feeling to go away. I want to be around him and I like it when he hang out together. I really look forward to when I get to talk to him and see him. 

He invited me to his place along with one of his friends to watch a movie, and the three of us got pretty drunk. The friend (20F) lives in the same apartment complex as him, so she’d gone back home, but I was in no state to drive back home. He let me stay over and I slept in his bed with him. 

We didn’t do anything wrong per se, but sleeping in the same bed as him was probably a bad call on my end. I still had fun that evening and I *liked* waking up next to him the next morning (he’s honestly really cute). 

Still, I wanted to get my mind off everything and reaffirm my relationship with my gf, so we had sex a few nights ago after a while, and everything seemed fine up until the end when I finished and came at the thought of him. 

I’ve been in a sort of panic mode ever since because I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know if I’m bi or if I just like him only, but what I do know is that I want to spend time with him and I think he makes me happy. I also don’t want to hurt my girlfriend anymore than I already have (even though she isn’t aware of the situation).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,753497,public,self,I (21M) think I’m falling for my friend (21M) and thought about him during sex with my girlfriend (21F),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4fisn/i_21m_think_im_falling_for_my_friend_21m_and/,all_ads,6,,,

For almost all of my adult life I've had them and they've worked wonders for me (until recently, not sure what I've changed?) I mainly used them for flings, hook ups etc. I wasn't really looking for anything serious, mainly because I wasn't ready and the apps worked like magic. Now I'm 25 and kind of in a social purgatory. The apps stopped working, my career involves me working with 1 other person and everyone I've worked with is at least 8-10 years older than me, which makes it hard to meet anyone.

I should add that my college job was much different, and I was able to date and hook up with quite a few co-workers over the years. Obviously not the smartest thing, but I was young and dumb. So It's not that I have a hard time talking to women, or not being able to have a conversation, in fact I always get told the opposite, I'm always told how fun I am to talk to and that it never gets boring, or how funny I am, which always felt weird to me, because I never really thought too much about my interactions or how I behaved on a date. 

It's the meeting that's hard now. I'm not in school, I don't really believe in flirting at the gym or with cashiers/ waiters etc. Always just seemed a bit too desperate for me, and it's kind of a taboo these days. I have a good group of close friends, but they live kind of far and it can make trying to go to bars and clubs kind of difficult. They're really not too much into it anyways.

What you shouldn't do is feel out a person, click with them, flirt, start making plans, then ask for the height, and tell the person to fuck off cuz they're short. Which has happened four times this year. It's such a weird and offensive question, because the implication is ""I'm into you if you are tall, this will not work if you are short."" The other implication is there is something fundamentally physically wrong with me which nothing can make up for - and if you think it's appropriate to drop that kind of toxicity on a stranger you have been flirting with, there is something deeply fundamentally wrong with you. Just say ""5'10""+"" or whatever, which is pretty common, so we can swipe left.

Today, i was chatting with someone where I checked all of the boxes for what she was looking for. However, by omitting her height requirements, she was being fundamentally dishonest with what she wanted - she actually didnt want someone with similar values she liked being around, she wanted someone tall - everything else was secondary. That omission just makes everyone unhappy. We've heard it before, we won't get offended unless you're an asshole about it.

I’m going to sound like an asshole but it seems impossible to find a decent woman these days with my standards. I respect all women from all backgrounds but, I have a particular set of standards that I just can’t seem to let go of.

Tattoos are a major turn off for me as well, I have no problem with anyone choosing to get them but if I’m dating you it would be nice to not see a doodle pad on your body. 
Cringey political correctness and activism. I respect anyone who wants to stand up for a cause they believe in but I can’t stand hearing about any political issues. I have a twisted and stupid since of humor that I don’t want to give up. 
I’m also super busy with my job and school which might makes it difficult to find time to devote to someone. I just really hate being alone. 
Someone who can fend for themself financially.
Women who aren’t too promiscuous. I don’t want something everyone else has already had. I might be the only one here but women who do oral also turns me off. That’s your mouth.
Not to mention that I only would want to date someone who is way out of my league in terms of looks. I would prefer a thin woman with a pretty face.

It seems like the women I'm going out with are looking for reasons to get to no whereas I'm looking damn hard to find the good in them. 

So I give up. The first thing I'm doing is no more stipulations that someone be educated and professionally successful. You have to be a good person and that's it. I'm also recognizing it's not likely I'll find a woman who wants to have a Jewish family. I need to be going on a date per week at least and there's just not enough women that fit the bill. Finally, the real way I'm giving up is I'm straight up looking for women interested in my money. This is crass and hard to say, but I think there are plenty of women out there who prioritize financial security or single moms just getting by who wish they could take their kids to Disney.

We just got close and I genuinely thought we both liked each other and felt the same, like he remembered little details about me and went out of his way to make me happy and was there for me, even when I would be stressed after work and wouldn’t talk to him as much. 

After about 10 dates, he stopped responding almost or just giving somewhat short replies but still kept talking to me for two weeks after. He was sick for a bit, and I asked to come over, mostly so I can be there for him and he said he didn’t want to get me sick. When he got better, I asked again and he said he’ll be busy over the weekend. After that, I kind of deleted social media for two weeks because I had a lot going on and finals so I told him and deleted everything and didn’t talk to him. I recently downloaded everything again and started talking to him, and he asked me if all was good now and I said yes, and I kept trying to make conversations, but it still seemed like he was giving shortish replies. 

He doesn’t exactly give one word replies but he used to send me paragraphs before, ask about my day, make jokes, and do lots of other things, but he doesn’t do any of those things anymore, and I’m confused because I like him so much and I want to be there for him in case something is wrong and he isn’t okay. He sometimes takes things I say the wrong way and has self esteem issues and I want to let him know I’m genuinely there for him, and he also once told me that no one ever stays. 

Keep in mind that COVID-19 cases are very high at the moment here, so hanging out would not be good and he is strict about these things. I’m so confused though, if he is going through something or if he genuinely just isn’t interested in me anymore and wants me to take the hint. I don’t want to be selfish and make things about me and make assumptions, but I also don’t want to keep annoying him. He told me his mom might have COVID-19, so I’m assuming he’s pretty worried about that and I just want to be there for him, and I feel that if I make this about me and think “oh he’s not into me” and just stop replying, I’ll seem like a really bad and selfish person, but I also don’t want to keep talking to him until he is forced to say “leave me alone, I’m simply not interested”. Please let me know if you have any advice.

Ok met this girl a month ago on tinder, we saw each other 5 times had sex on the 3rd date at her house by the 5 time we saw each other she answer a question I ask her just to know out of curiosity I ask her so what do you even want or are  looking for with me and she said she got out of a relationship months ago and was super busy that she wanted to be ready but she just was not at the moment but that wanted to keep seeing me then I said good Im down with that and I also said laughing everytime a girl tells me that I know is a lie and she is just saying she is ready but not for me she said trust me is not like that I really like you but Im just not ready at the moment but since that last time we saw each other a week after that she been acting super distant no longer texting 1st, sometimes leaves on read, sometimes she is online and doesnt even open my messages then replies hours later.Everytime I tell her to hangout always says she is busy that she lets me know.

I confronted her through text and told her if she was not interested anymore she could simply just say it and nobody waste anyones time and she said she is interested is just that she just super busy cause she got promoted in her job and doesnt have much time.I kept texting her but she kept doing the same things leaving on read  and being online but not even opening my messages etc and honestly I said enough is enough and  I unfollow her from all social media just to move on from her easier not that I'm in love with her or anything is just thats my way of moving on from someone easier cause she is obiously not interested anymore. But the weird part comes now last time we saw each other she suggest that I should take an hiv text so we could have sex without a condom and more often and without any worries cause the 1st time we had sex it was not that good cause we were both nervous and also the condom made me lose my erection a few times but she understood and suggest to take an hiv test so we can have sex without a condom.And also she suggest to go with her to Chicago on june and was also making lots of plans with me in the future but now is she acting super distant.


Last time we text she left me on seen she reply with Im not talking with anybodyelse besides you I reply yeah right well is obvious you are not interested anymore then left me on seen and thats when I decided to unfollow her and never text her again but the other weird part is she has not unfollowed me since then sees all my stories litteraly the 1st person to see it is her and also reacts to them whenever I post a pic of me she reacts with hearts so what is this nonsense behavior she is doing about? If you dont like me  why you just dont say why keep reacting to my stuff and seeing all my stories and liking my pictures why do you keep following me even after I unfollow her. I dont even care if she text me again or if she want to hangout again I honeslty dont even want to hangout anymore with her cause this kind of behavior turns me off but Im just asking this to know why do women do this and what does it mean?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,753764,public,self,What is the deal with this girl,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4id55/what_is_the_deal_with_this_girl/,all_ads,6,,,

Struggling a hell of a lot.

On and Off relationship for a very long time. It's been toxic. I have tried to extract myself from it for years. 

For some strange reason we circle each other and come back to each other.

Whenever we do it triggers massive changes in our lives. Goes well for a while, we can get progress in it and as much as I put up walls to not catch feelings and intentions as well as put healthy barriers up both of us seem to trample them down.

The emotional connection as well as physical/spiritual is beyond belief. 

But it's not healthy as they pull back often from their own mental health issues and then they trigger severity of my own emotional responses to that with some unbelievable emotional abuse.

It always is the same issues and problem. It always is the fact that they self sabotage after gaining my trust back.

I have blocked them on everything because it's really necessary and I can not be dragged back into this arena constant.

They have not healed from their own trauma. They keep bringing another person into the arena and they never accept the position of responsibility for it.

I really don't like that they have such a hold on myself. I have been wondering how and why for years they can get pass my defence because as a rational person I am in full knowledge how incredibly volatile this is. If I explained to anyone they would just look at myself and wonder what the hell I am doing.

I'm struggling at present with the fact that I have put extreme blocks on them. I don't want them walking back. But....kinda do as well because I see their good. It's just not.... permanent.

Don't know if anyone understands this. It's been hanging over my head for ages and I just want to be strong enough to have them completely gone for good.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,753940,public,self,Struggling a bit,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4ko4c/struggling_a_bit/,all_ads,6,,,

For some reason it was always difficult for me to express myself in any scenario.

Sometimes when she is really stressed about something she is distanced but I get it and I try to make her feel comfortable like I would for anyone, but I show her that I care more for her than anyone else.

And she tells me these things, and I'm like that's wrong. now there are for sure things that I don't know about and hope are worth it.

Hi I’m 22F and I can say that I’m finally recovering from being sexually abused around six months ago. 

The experience opened my eyes. I have just come out of a long rabbit hole of feeling unworthy unless lots of guys were drooling over me. Ew it’s even gross to talk about it now. Even worse, I’ve felt this way since I started highschool. No young person should ever feel that way! 

But I did. It has been a long nine years of seeing friends get into relationships and situations hips and wishing I could as well, guys in highschool only talking to pretty girls, and me attempting to turn into one of those pretty girls and trying to feel relevant OMG. 

On top of that, taking sexual harassment as validation, giving in to hook ups ever since I was 16 with the mindset that since I have an unlikable personality, at least he likes my body. Like wow. That was all so messed up!

And when I was doing all of these things I would kind of go numb- I would pretend I’m not a human being with feelings but just a body for them to use because that’s how it’s meant to be. I would convince myself that it was what I wanted as well- just for the sake of keeping the guy around. 

It took for that abusive situation where I was putting all my worth into pleasing him to jolt me awake into reality. I DO NOT live to please men. My body is beautiful and no one has a right to touch it unless I want them to. My worth does not lie in my sexual performance or ability to keep a man happy. 

Also- who made having a man some sort of trophy? Who cares whether you have a partner or not? I get it, it’s amazing to be in love and have it reciprocated, but who taught girls like me to put all of our worth into it?! To feel like if we don’t have that life is meaningless??? There’s so much more to life than the company and attention of a man. SO. MUCH. MORE.

He said he is open to a relationship but not with anyone (same). I ended up thinking that he was a bit too forward in the kindest way and I had gotten out of a relationship a month or so beforehand. We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6 pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again.

Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. The date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver. We have been in contact via social media a bit since.

I'm just unsure whether he should be the one that expresses what he wants in person or do I mention that this is what I'm after. He works till the evenings throughout the week and weekend so it seems that I can only see him after work hours.He reached out asking how I am, days went by and I started to think that I didn't like it how I wouldn't know when I was going to see this guy again and that if it's not meant to be, it's all good. Immature but I sent him a text saying that I didn't like it how our two dates consisted at just his house and that I'm often left not knowing when I would see him again, I said I don't have expectations around texting.

He said he would talk to me the next day as he had a lot on his plate and he is sorry for not mentioning when he would like to see me again in the manner it deserves. I knew the answer wouldn't be good so I deleted him off my social media. He sent me a very rude message the next day saying I was immature, we ended up calling and he said that he thought he would be open to a relationship but he thinks he cannot provide what I would like. I then said to him that I've only met him twice and I'm unsure myself but I do like to know when I'm with someone if they would like to see me again such as 'this was great, when are you free next?' and weirdly he said he felt the same with me. He also said something along the lines of that he doesn't hear from me for days and is unsure of how I feel. He said forget the relationship talk, that he likes me and thinks I'm cool but he asked what my expectations were regarding texting and said he would like to see me again. He said we don't also have to be sexual when we catch up, we can be friends or anything. He told me that he's meanest to the ones he likes the most. He jokingly said that I'm so annoying when we were bantering over something.

The next day I said I would like to see him again but I would not pressure him but I understand if he doesn't as I don't want to waste my time. I apologised for blocking him. He rudely responded and said ""I don't want to deal with this f\*\*king bull\*\*\*\* right now, name. I said I've been accommodating enough and to not contact me again. He replied saying 'f\*\*\*\*\* off, mate' and blocked my number and on WhatsApp.

The unfortunate thing is I feel he has done this to get a reaction from me and will try and ease his way back in at some stage.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* guy that I would have liked to have seen again has proved to be quite unstable. Unsure whether I've done the right thing but not ever going to talk to him again. We unfortunately are very similar and have similar interests. I've noticed that he's been blocking a lot of people on his Instagram. Unfortunately, we get along really well in person but do have a habit of overtalking each other and that was evident in the last phone call we had.

""Oh, this is another joke post.""

It's not. I'm serious.



My skills and abilities:

- l can hold a conversation. Not saying I'm the best, or we're guaranteed to have a life-changing talk, but I'm very well-capable of doing so.

- I don't watch porn and rarely masturbate. I'm also pretty fit, so I can last a decent amount of time with maximum hardness.

- I'm very understanding. Despite the shallow-nature of the the heading; I'm open to listening to any concerns you might have.

- I can offer emotional support as well. I understand we all get lonely. I understand sometimes you just need to be hugged/held. I'm also good at picking up hints, and I'm aware of when space is needed.

- I can make you laugh. 



What I'm looking for in a partner:

- Someone who can pay my rent (it's pretty low honestly)

- That's all. See? I'm not too picky.



Pros of dating me:

- You won't have to worry about me being unfaithful because I hate people.

- I'm a private low-key kinda person, and I'm not pushy at all.

Cons:

- I sometimes like being alone, and will want time to myself. (Not a lot, just a little)

- If ever irritated with you, I will distance myself; however, I'm mature enough to talk it over after a bit of time to think.

My phone isn't even a year old, Galaxy N20U. And in this last month I've noticed it glitches hard core especially if I write out a text paragraph (yes, I'm one of those) and then go to delete it. 

It doesn't delete it on the screen, but it shows it deleting at the suggested words line. It's really weird. Also, it keeps doing a symbol that is a mix of a ? with ! on top after certain sentences (but I don't know what/if there's a keyword triggering it) and I cannot find that symbol on my keyboard anywhere and I've also never seen prior to this last month.

This is concerning because I am 35(F) with no kids and ultimately single. I am dating, but not exclusive and am 100% honest about not being attached to just one of the people I'm dating. While I thought it was a mutual agreement, this has me wondering if something was downloaded by one of my guys while I was sleeping or away from my phone.

He also smoked 5 cigarettes through out the day. I would go out with him again but he did say he only dated older women, many times. He also said a racial slur while watching TV and that showed me he is probably a dick and racist.

We have alot in common and share some of the same things. He did say a couple of things that were weird.

Hi,
I am a 27 year old woman.Recently,I reached out to someone I went to school with for advice.We both deal with the unique reality of having siblings with extreme special needs. I was touched by the time he took to reply to me,give me advice etc. Despite the fact that we never spoke in elementary school,he was happy to reply back.

I cannot lie,my interest has peaked and I was interested in inviting him for a coffee.For context, we both went to a bougie private school.I am always true to myself but there is a certain climate of elitism and arrogance that stems for those environments.I want to ask him for coffee but how would a man feel about a woman initiating? My friends saw him on the tinder website meaning he is looking,but what proof do I have that he could be interested in me?
Does a man think it is weird to have a woman initiate something? I am a woman of colour and he is white and although I am attracted to men of every race, including my own,what proof do I have that he would be interested in me?

Why does no one use their camera properly? Like no seriously today alone iv'e left swiped several girls because their photo's were either so blurry that I couldn't tell what I was looking at or were intentionally taken at an obtuse angle where you can only see ten percent of their face. 


And don't think i'm just picking on girls here, i'm bisexual so iv'e seen plenty of photos of guys too. Granted guys photo's seem to be more to the point. A clean picture of their face with no stupid instagram hearts or obtuse angles. Though I have noticed a higher propensity of men hiding in group shots.


For the record i'm not picking on anyone for not having a good camera. I have a cheap lg phone. Yet my photo looks clean, because i'm actually in it and can hold my phone straight.

But it’s gotten to the point that I’m so depressed, tired, and on edge and I need to talk to someone other than the people I know because they’ll just tell me things I don’t want to hear. 
Please just know that I need to vent. No advice needed. 


I like this guy a lot. And he likes me. But he said he can’t love anyone (even though he said he was able to love people when we met and even told me he loved me repeatedly for a period of time). I’m sure it has to do with his psychological disorders.

He loves sex, and only really likes being touched if we’re going to fuck. And when we do fuck he goes ham, which scares me. But I like it at the same time because I crave danger due to being so understimulated my whole life. I’d rather he push me past my limits than not talk to me at all. 

 This last time when I went to go visit him in Dallas, choked me to the point I hallucinated and entered a state of severe distress. I thought I was drowning because one of the times I was in the shower and the other time he wrapped a pillowcase soaked in water around my head and gagged me with it. I didn’t like the idea of breathing water up my nose but I went along with it to satisfy him. 


I keep coming back even though he has no respect for boundaries, and I’ve lost so much respect for myself because of it. I’m so captivated by him. The way his mind works fascinates me and how he isn’t afraid to strangle and hit me in the bedroom. Ive passed out from his choking before and while it was scary and uncomfortable I want more of it. It’s a thrill that I never got before. I cried after he pushed me too far one time and he consoled me, but he said he wasn’t gonna stop after that “breather”, and told me to stop crying because it would turn him on. 

He’s a sexual abuse victim and suffers with psychotic schizophrenia and ASPD tendencies. I feel awful for him and I want to do what I can to help him. But it won’t be enough. Sometimes I feel inferior to him in general because he’s so independent for someone his age and I’m still living with my parents rent free working at a grocery store.

He’s found ways to put me down verbally. He says he’s just being honest and at least I know he’s being genuine when he actually does compliment me.
