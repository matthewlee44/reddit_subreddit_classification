We split for a bit and she had a ONS. she was lonely and no one gave her love, so she got with friends and a guy took advantage of her being lonely and and decieved her.l tried talking with other girls but nothing felt like the love she gave me. She ended no contact and she begged to get back together, note this is a while after that ons. Shee cried and said every other guy tried to use her and one guy deceived her to that point and she was sobbing. she had cut all ties to those people and she has been nothing but loyal and trustworthy ever since. I dont have a problem with what happened, i just think of them as one of her exes. But it means everything to her because i was her first and and that guy was the second, she described herself as feeling whory. Which i dont think that, she made an honest mistake i almost made so many times. basically this doesnt bother me, but it bothers her every night. She would call me every night and she would cry to me about how bad she feels and how it makes her feel whory. Its been months since that incident happened and it keeps her up and distracted alot. Ive comforted her but what ways do u think i should comfort her or what things should i do to make her move on. 

Ps. This doesnt bother me because 
A) i dont want to be hypocritical as i had a past with women
B) Whatever happened made her chnage her mind. she came back to me and she promised and proved that she only wants me
C) I was her first, and now im goint to be her last

I only said that because in some of my previous posts some people encouraged me to break up but i just want to say what i have rn is a strong bond im happy with. We are in love and the only problem we have is this issue.

So here’s the backstory. I’ve known this girl for a couple of years but we really only started talking a year ago on and off. Anyway she got into a relationship and i got into a different one and it didn’t work out. We reconnected two months ago after she broke up with her boyfriend. The first date i was going to kiss her but didn’t see an opening (wasn’t a ton of physical contact). So i didn’t. She texted me later saying how much fun she had and thanked me for being so patient. I guess her ex and her had a messy breakup. Fast forward it’s been a month and a half. She calls all of these dates every time we hang out and we hit it off every time but there isn’t any physical contact outside of a prolonged hug before saying goodbye. No lingering no eye contact. She flirts with me though and we talk every day. I’m patient because i really like her and I’m cool with continuing because I’m talking to another person I’m just not sure what I’m missing here. Should i text her about it? She always initiated contact. It’s starting to feel like just a friendship which I’m cool with i just need to know that’s what it is. Or should i try to kiss her? Maybe I’m not seeing an opening but there is one and I’m just choosing not to see it. I know it’s not “manly” to text a girl and tell her how you feel but i also am not attached to the outcome. Like if she wants to just be friends or nothing at all it’s all good. I do want it to work but I’ll be okay if it doesn’t. Any advice would be huge. Or how can i introduce more physical contact without it being weird?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,962601,public,self,Nine dates and still haven’t kissed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p76hnt/nine_dates_and_still_havent_kissed/,all_ads,6,,

I almost got my first kiss on Saturday July 31st 2021 going into Sunday August 1st 2021.  But, I’m writing this on Wednesday August 18th 2021.

So, I was at my female 3rd cousins college graduation party.  Because it was a college graduation party, it lasted until 5:15 am Sunday morning.  There were also like other 3rd cousins there too.  One of my male 3rd cousins, who is probably important to this story, who is also 3rd cousins with the female 3rd cousins, was there.  So, the almost first kiss happened with one of my female 3rd cousins friends.

This is everything significant that happened between me and her.  Btw, she’s either 21 or 22 (2 or 3 years older then me).

First, my male 3rd cousin, the chick, and I were hanging together early in the evening, like 8:30-ish and he was complaining about how I was on my 8th water bottle and that I wasn’t drinking.  (Side note, I was the only sober person there the whole night.  Everyone else (“kids” (college grads in their very early 20s) and adults) were drunk).  Before I even took a sip of my water, the chick starts taking a video of herself and tells me to give her water, so I start feeding it to her.  And my guy cousin starts complaining that she is now drinking water.

30mins-45mins later it was just her and I.  We were talking and I mentioned that I was going to Boston the next day.  She told me to text her when I was leaving for Boston and she gave me her number.  (I forgot to text her when I left for Boston the next day).  We continue talking and she was saying how much she liked Boston.  After a couple more minutes I asked her if she could text me the video of me giving her water, and she texted it to me.

Like another half hour later, her, my male 3rd cousin, three men in their 50s, and I were hanging out and she showed all of us her boobs 3 times.  Her nipples are pierced.

Later, a bunch of us college kids were in the basement and she told me and some of the guys that I was hanging with that she took some guys virginity their senior year of high school.  And she was proud of it.

A long time later, still in the basement, my male 3rd cousin and I were talking for a while.  He eventually asked how I was doing at college with the ladies.  I told him that I’m a virgin and have never had a girlfriend.  He then starts to give me advice and stuff.  I ask him how he does it and he calls over the girl and tells her that I’m a virgin, I have never had a girlfriend in my life, and that I asked him how he does it.  Btw, I was sitting on a barstool chair with my legs spread.  She says nothing and walks over to me and walks between my legs.  She hugs me and leans against my thing and stays like for 10 seconds.  She then breaks the hug, smiles at the both of us, and walks aways.  My male 3rd cousin was shocked, had his chin dropped, said, “that didn’t go as I thought it would.”  Then chuckled and we continued our conversation.  Also, if I mentioned that I haven’t had my first kiss yet when she was hugging me, she DEFINITELY would have kissed me, but I didn’t think of that until after she left.

A while later, she walked by me and ran both of her hands down my body.  She started at my collarbone and stopped at my waist, then walked away.  Btw, I’m extremely ticklish and people don’t really tickle me, so I forget how ticklish I am.  I kind of get reminded how ticklish I am once a year when I’m at my physical and my pediatrician feels around.  So, when she ran both of her hands down my body, it tickled ALOT, and I couldn’t stop laughing, but it did feel good.

Later during the night, it’s like 1:30 am now, her and I and some other people were up stairs and we went outside because she wanted to do a keg stand with me, but we ended up not doing one.

When I was leaving at 2:40 am (I only left because I was waking up for Boston at 6:00 am) she asked if I was leaving and I told her, “yes”.  So, she walked over to me and hugged me.  At the end of the hug, she back up a little bit, but was still hugging me, didn’t let go, looked up into my eyes and told me to text her when I got home.  She wouldn’t let go until I said I would text her when I got home.  Then she let go and said a final bye.  When I got home, I texted her, “I just got home”.  She then immediately texted me back saying, “okay good glad you’re safe🤍🤍”.  I also said Thanks! after that.

I have been long time lurking and looked at posts where people were telling their experience with online dating and the apps they used. so much nice advice. That gave me lots of insight.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am ready to share my experience with you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 32M, both a country guy and able to find my way in Miami beach. I like 90s love movies.

&amp;#x200B;

I had not a lot of experience in OLD before. I met 2 girls once from pof so many years ago. I got in a relationship with one.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm putting all my impression and advice like the ones who did that before me.

First advice, don't pay full price for them, register, wait couple of days or week until you get 50 or 70%  discount. I noticed that the experience is different in okc. paying with a % off get you less likes, paying full get you more likes. I used one app at a time when I had some time. not every months because I got in relationship with girls from the apps. Longest was 5 months. Which is not even close to my shorter regular meeting-gf which lasted 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also noticed that the girls who liked me, hinge, okc, did not appear in my stack (where you left or right )...

Also, I had almost 0 matches when I sent the first like to girls in bumble and okc, I was wasting my time in that. 

&amp;#x200B;

In okc, I even finished the close stack once, and out of nowhere, received likes from girls close to me. Okc hides and restrict our profiles.

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts is that the apps hide actually the users who are active.. so we do our stack for nothing. 

Not to mention okc android got rid of search by questions, so it was too much time going to each profile to see compatibility before my swipe. 

&amp;#x200B;

So based on that thought, overall, my behaviour was to do little swipe couple times a day to see my matches and actually wait for the girls to swipe me in first. so I was mostly swiping to see who liked me by liking-matching them.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been on and off the apps to try . As travelling was closed or difficult, I turned to OLD. I can easily talk to people irl and people often talk to me, so I did not need online dating. 

I was looking for a strictly monogamous relationship exclusive everything total 90s movie package. sex was off the chart, as I do not do pre relationship sex. .

&amp;#x200B;

\-Pof : completely full of scammers, not really the nice pof I used long ago. Are the scammers talking to each others until they found out they are scamming scammers ?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Okc : got around 10 likes everyday from girls close.

Some girls did not speak, some spoke once including sending me detailed text introduction and removed their account a day later. some spoke but they did not want to give number to call them/facetime, some were trying getting followers for IG. some were already did involved in casual relationships.

I still have called a few and met some to hang around, some of them went back with their ex. some were looking for distraction or to talk to someone.

they did not really seem like the personality on their profile, or their texting personality was different than irl one.

I have been involved in some exclusive pre relationship with some but later they would tell me something that would make the relationship impossible or too complicated

(I do not work 9 to 5 and I can work from anywhere, sometimes I don't work, I don't have loans, I'm comfortable, and I look for an easy going relationship where someone is actually emotionally and physically/time available, not someone I can only see on weekends. I don't care about my partner financial situation or education, life can be hard and not everyone can pay college).

I recently noticed that girls did not read my profile or had complete different goals.. I'm much more traditional and more into homebody girls.

I also got even more likes from girls abroad on okc (30 per day at least), but most of the time, it is scam. 

I would advise men to look for someone in the same field of work as them if they look girls abroad.

&amp;#x200B;

I would say good experience because I still have some pretty good fun with couple of girls where I feel I connected a lot more. but that connection did not last long or was not regular. I had an incredible experience of fun, laugh with someone a day (which made me be in relationship with her), but the other days, it was completely the opposite.. took me months to know that one time feeling would not happen again. thought I would have that stuff everyday with that girl. It made me tired and I felt exhausted.

&amp;#x200B;

Adding more or less characterics on my profile did not change anything. I had sometimes a long description, sometimes less. I mentionned what I do, sometimes not.

&amp;#x200B;

I spend couple nights sending messages to ones I really really liked, most did not reply (I think they were not even active), and the girls who replied, did not answer my question or went along with conversation. Still I thank them for the reply.

&amp;#x200B;

By the way, do not pay or repay the subscription so quick, okc will show your profile more leaving it not paid, just wait a week or a month. Even better, remove the app, and wait for discount to come in mail to find your likes.

&amp;#x200B;

I also noticed couple of girls were ready to sext fast, or phone sex, like non even in a relationship ? Did anyone notice that ? 

Did okc became a way to get off for few girls ?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Hinge : my favourite,  got 5 likes per day, less than other apps. but most were talkative and friendly. 

girls were really showing interest (friendship and more) and it felt the more genuine app. I had lots of nice conversations and I met people I would normally talk to irl. It did lead to some friends.

It seems that Hinge did a nice job in matching people. I would use again and recommend to friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Bumble : got 8 to 20 likes a day (meaning right swipe led to match when I opened the app. I did not bother swiping my stack), I don't know why the likes were not regular. Half of the girls sent first message or gif.  same experience as okc. it is overwhelming to have to explain everytime what I want and even more finding what the other really want. the app did not really match me with compatible people.

I made a good friend over the app, we still talk to each other from time to time. 

I would suggest not to pay soon. Like okc, when you don't pay, your profile get shown to more lots people.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Tantan : nice one, but not very practical for distance. some girls were actually in China from China or HK but actively scamming people. bitcoin and stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Tagged : Did not stay long.. I did not understand the app lol.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Luxy : actually very interesting, it is more of a network/dating one rather dating.

wait for the 40 or 70% off to pay.. otherwise it is very expensive and not worth the price.

they don't restrict your profile and it get shown to everyone.

I met people who became friends, very international app,so pretty cool if you can travel. sometimes people are very superficial but there are also friendly educated people around there. academics, finance.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Coffee meets bagel : used a bit , I stayed couple of days , lots of people from finance or IT industry.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Once : I did not pay, stayed a few days, no matches. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Tinder : 0 likes without paying. not going to pay XD. I am pretty sure it is because I don't have abs.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a pretty good run. even if I had matches and girls interested, I don't do casual dating and I will not hang out with someone hanging out with multiple people. As friends yes, for possible love, no.

I focused my attention on one person at a time exclusively, including deactivating apps when getting serious. I treated like I do normally. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will not return to OLD, it is too long to get a feeling of the person I talk to.. sometimes can be weeks before I notice a major stuff... irl I can guess that with body language or the way they talk. especially I can know if I'm interested or the girl is interested.

&amp;#x200B;

I texted her asking if things are not working out we can stop talking (at least I'll have closure), but to that she responded that she was busy and kind of slacks off sometimes.

I find it super weird that she doesn't respond even to good morning texts or regular messages. When we did talk on call she seemed normal.

Hi !! - I am an INFJ Meyers Briggs (heavy feeler) who has been dating a guy that says he’s an INTJ ( heavy thinker) and we’ve been seeing each other for about 6 weeks going on actual dates like comedy shows, dinners, games, and I have met some of his friends. I have a good time with him and when we’re together he usually brings up that we should do other things/ another date together but when we leave he doesn’t text me or only sometimes follows up with plans and we’ll go like 3 days without texting, Sometimes I get anxious and just text him to set up plans so I have validation we’re seeing each other again (working on this insecurity ugh) . Like we usually have plans set up but this week we didn’t have set plans and so I just texted him asking if he wanted to go to a park and we ended up going but just wondering from your perspective if it initiating texts is normal or if this person may be stringing me along? I know the best answer is to ask him but literally he has not talked about feelings a t all.

We met on a dating app. The date went really well and he was very affectionate and held my hand and was very genuine and we appeared to connect very well. So a week later he hits me up around 7 PM on a Saturday night asking what I am up to this weekend. I tell him that I currently am out with friends but might be going out afterwards if he wants to join. He tells me that he can’t go out tonight because he has to get up early in the morning but he wouldn’t mind coming to pick me up if I want to hang out with them afterwards. I end up telling him that it would be pretty late by the time I got back but I would be up for it and he replies that we can hang out another time. 

So the next day I ask him if he wants to get together this week and he replies that this Thursday we should try to get together. I tell him that sounds good. So Thursday comes and it is 8:15 PM and I haven’t heard from him at all so reach out to him. He asks me what I’m up to and I tell him that I am out with one of my friends because I wasn’t sure what time we were hanging out? He tells me that he is probably going to stay in tonight but if I want to come over and hang out with him I can. I end up telling him that I won’t be able to hang out now until like 12am. And he replies that we can just reschedule bc he is going to sleep. 

TLDR;I am not sure if I should just move on already and delete his number. I’ve also saw on his dating app profile that he updated some of his photos in the past week.

We only dated that long because I began to notice *extremely* weird behavior from him: like an extreme obsession with me, never stopped talking (and it was usually nonsensical), paranoia, etc and I broke up with him and advised that he get help. Now, almost three years later, we start talking again, hung out and… he’s normal. He still definitely likes me, but I’m conflicted in dating him because of the incredibly rocky start.

There’s what the title should’ve been. It was written by Fall Out Boy.

But in all seriousness, I’m a bit in shock with how much he’s changed. So far we’ve hung out twice. The first time we hung out at a Kava bar and then we cuddled and watched a movie. He wanted to kiss me but I told him that we should just stick to cuddling and he fucking *respected that*? Not that he wasn’t respectful before it’s just, idk some guys want to kiss when cuddling (and make you), but again my feelings are still a bit conflicted and I want to take things slower with all my dates. 

The second date was a few hrs ago, and we talked a *lot* about life and shit. He eventually slipped out that the weird shit he did was because of drugs and that he eventually put himself in a psych unit for a few nights. 

I guess he hasn’t really touched drugs since— including weed. He didn’t really explain much about it when we talked before the first time we hung out, only that it was a bad time in his life. I assume he’s ashamed of it.

So far my feelings are that he’s a cool guy, kinda quirky but no red flags. A few times tonight I wondered *what if I kissed him?* but I really do need to take my dating life much slower. My goal now is just hang out more, no kissing/sex/relationship and see what happens.

I am male. As I got older/mature, also when I became successful/wealthier, I felt that physical appearance is least of my concerns (as long as they are ""ok""/average to my standards). I consider myself to have pretty high standards. Instead I look at their personality , quality of the person, and enjoyment when being together.  I feel that if it fits my criteria,  then I become attractive to them. I find this more important in the long term than actually be physically  attractive  to them from the start (and to be honest , I don't find most females attractive until I know them). I wonder if this is a common thing if your grown mature, or if your very successful? I have several female friends from a range of age group. I find that the ones who are older with great careers have boyfriends that aren't the best looking (obviously I am not to judge but they just arent and looks average imo), but they seem to fit very well personality wise. While on the other hand, I have a few female friends who are younger have boyfriends mainly because of their looks (I have asked them before) - Obviously there's bias in this. I believe that one can grow to like someone's physical appearance because of the person themselves. I also find that it's probably statistically almost impossible to find some one extremely good looking person plus have the personality, likes/dislikes, etc similar  unless your very lucky. Not only you need to find this person,  but the person has to like you back. So my thought processes is, I rather have a very good fit partner, than a extremely good looking one. Do successful people tend to look this way because of the way that made them successful (they care about the person as a whole rather than appearance)? I am thinking that successful/mature  people's  thought processes may be different. Or is it just a me / people I know thing. Thoughts on this? I thought it was interesting conversation I had with a few friends, and was trying to understand  why some of my friends only care for the looks for the start (they must be very physically attractive), rather than to look for the personality.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,962785,public,self,Physical appearance vs Personality and success / mature,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p78sv8/physical_appearance_vs_personality_and_success/,all_ads,6,,

I didn’t feel huge sparks but we talked a while, had a couple drinks and decided we would like to see each other at least one more time. This is a lot of progress to me! So I am happy about that. I do have one question for anyone who might be able to help though. 

Most of the time when I’m on a date I have the question in my mind, “ok, now what?”. It’s not a fear of judgement - at least I don’t believe it is. But I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to do next or why? I’ve not dated much (too busy with degrees and work) so I’m not sure if this is normal or not. 

I guess I’m most comfortable when there are rules, formulas, and a clear criteria for successful outcomes. In dating I feel like it is so nebulous and there aren’t really any rules and I can hardly even understand what a successful date IS!

What are the parameters? What are the success criteria? It is starting to feel like I’m going about this all wrong, but I struggle to understand a different way.

Maybe it is a fear of letting go and allowing myself to exist as a sexual being. I’m almost certainly scared of giving off sexual vibes, but it is also kind of the point of dating, right? I am scared to sexual escalate, especially physically. Even with something as simple as a touch on the forearm. Even if she was the one to do it, it would make me anxious.

Maybe it is tied up with how I fear a woman will be disgusted with me trying to escalate, fear she will be bored if I don’t, fear I’ll give her the wrong idea if I do, an uncertainty of what is too far because of my religious upbringing (eg. can we kiss or will I feel ashamed about that later?), the fear I’ll come off too needy, the fear that I will get “too excited” then the relationship will go nowhere and I will feel embarrassed that I allowed myself to get swept away by feelings or that I will neglect my duties because of those feelings or that my family will ridicule me for a hundred reasons.

Long story short: my parents own a mountain resort and during the summers I usually come and hang/help around here. This summer, like 1 month ago, they hired a new waitress. In the beginning, we would just randomly talk to each other, but then one day, I asked her if she wants to go for a walk, then she invited me swimming and then she basically bear hugged me for the rest of the day. Fast forward to this week, and now we sleep together every night, kiss, and I frequently slap her butt xD. 

Everything was going great until two days ago. I asked her if she wanted to rent a hotel room for 1 night in order to leave the resort (I mention that we are currently keeping things between us a secret). She started going on a intense talk about how she doesn't sleep around, hates hook-up culture and would be afraid to commit to something like this if she didn't think there was at least a chance for a relationship.

I told her I needed a bit of time to think, and that same day, at 12am, I decided to talk to her. It basically was the first time I was completely honest with a girl about my feelings (not good at this). I basically told her that I liked her and that I would be willing to give us a try at some point in time.

We are the definition of ""it's complicated"".

Furthermore, as I wasn't actively looking for a relationship, I've been talking with other girls, one that asked me if she can sleep at my place this weekend.

I have never had/wanted a long-term relationship, but I do genuinely wanna give it a try with this one. Even though, I am pretty confident around girls, right now the situation is completly on her territory, as she only has experience with long term relationships. Therefore, I am starting to get a little anxious when thinking about what should I do going forward, as I never really taken things slow before.

Complicating things even more, I leave for uni in September for 1 year, but hopefully I'll be able to visit on weekends frequently.

My questions to all of you are: should I put my eggs in one basked for the first time ever? should i go see the other girl that's coming over this weekend? am I looking desperate or needy? how do I calm myself down and stop being anxious about things going forward? how do I prove to her that I don't just want to another random hook-up? should I just end all of this in order not to hurt her or myself?

Other relevant things: I never had/wanted a long term  relationship; She had a 5 year relationship and doesn't sleep around; She knows what she wants; Even though we are very different, we have very good chemistry and agree on a lot of subjects; I am dramatising things a bit here, but this is what is going in my head rn.

Sorry if this sounds pessimistic but I wanted specific answers to some of my thoughts.  

Though I do want marriage and kids, I want to be careful and make sure I am marrying a person for love, who is a good fit for me and not because we both share the same goals.

He hasn't dated in over a decade and I can tell he takes me  seriously and is often confused by normal things I say. He doesn't have any relationship trauma. I have actively dated but my last long term relationship was 3 yrs ago and I have become more introverted and self sufficient than before, I'm finding it hard to share my life with another person. 

I'm not new to relationships (because I've had 2 long term relationships) but neither of them were healthy. So I can say I am new to to healthy relationships and dating and I need advice.

1. How do you allow yourself to be closer to another person? Things like moving together are really big moves for me , how do I get comfortable with that. 

2. How do you not lose your individuality in a relationship? I've come a long way here after getting over my previous relationships and I don't want to lose myself and become emotionally codependent in a relationship again. 

3. What decisions are prudent for long term safety? Of course he is a great guy, but I am wired to plan for emergencies- what if he becomes abusive, I need to have a financial safety net, a friend who knows our whereabouts, etc.  

4. He often travels for work and plans to move to another city in the long term, he makes the assumption I will relocate with him if we are together. I think this is a rather patriarchal, old fashioned mindset and I don't plan to relocate unless it works for my career too. 

5. Family - in my previous relationships, family has often been a source of conflict with my partner s families being too involved- physically and emotionally in our relationship. The guys didn't have a boundary and it ruined the relationship. This guy is close to his family but I don't know him well enough to comment on whether he knows the boundaries. What if I discover later into the relationship that they would be controlling or a big influence in his life? Is it normal to walk out?

So this guy and I went on a nice date two weeks ago. We met on a dating app. The date went really well and he was very affectionate and held my hand and was very genuine and we appeared to connect very well. So a week later he hits me up around 7 PM on a Saturday night asking what I am up to this weekend. I tell him that I currently am out with friends but might be going out afterwards if he wants to join. He tells me that he can’t go out tonight because he has to get up early in the morning but he wouldn’t mind coming to pick me up if I want to hang out with them afterwards. I end up telling him that it would be pretty late by the time I got back but I would be up for it and he replies that we can hang out another time. 

So the next day I ask him if he wants to get together this week and he replies that this Thursday we should try to get together. I tell him that sounds good. So Thursday comes and it is 8:15 PM and I haven’t heard from him at all so reach out to him. He asks me what I’m up to and I tell him that I am out with one of my friends because I wasn’t sure what time we were hanging out? He tells me that he is probably going to stay in tonight but if I want to come over and hang out with him I can. I end up telling him that I won’t be able to hang out now until like 12am. And he replies that we can just reschedule bc he is going to sleep. 

TLDR;I am not sure if I should just move on already and delete his number. I’ve also saw on his dating app profile that he updated some of his photos in the past week.

I was responsible for showing her around and what we must do everyday before the service starts and after it ends. The day was not so busy, so we had time to converse and get to know each other. The girl looks really good and i liked her instantly, so i took my chance to know more about her. Our conversations were really interesting. I noticed that we had a lot in common. We talked about psychology and human behaviour, music, movies.. and many other shared interests. After that day i couldn't stop thinking about her, and looked forward to the next day of work. The first week or so we were talking casually, but nothing really big happened. I wanted to ask her out but i was scared, because we are co-workers and she might see that as weird. The second week, i was not giving her as much attention, because i didn't want to think about her a lot. At some point, she mentioned to me that she needs to make her driver's licence, and i told her that i still haven't made mine too. So, we decided that we want to do our driver's licence together. 4 days ago, i started noticing that she is starting to give me more attention than before, but i didn't react much and i kept cool, not wanting to show her much attention. The next day, she texted me in the morning asking me if i am awake and have time to meet her. I said sure but i inquired why and if everything is alright. She told me that she wanted to meet me to talk about doing our driver's licence together. I was a bit confused, that she wanted to meet just to talk about that, even though we were gonna meet at work the next day. This was the first real signal i noticed that she might have interest. I went to meet her and we went to eat ice-cream and talked for hours (never mentioned anything about the driver's licence). This day with her made me feel so good. I got to know her better privately and  we did have A LOT in common. We were both really enjoying our conversations. She has a kid who is 2 years old and the father of the kid left her after she got pregnant. she needed to pick her kid up from the Kindergarten, so she asked if I'd like to join her. I went with her and met her kid and we went to the park for a walk. During the walk she started asking me questions about kids, and if i get along with them. I don't know if this counts as a signal, that she is making sure i accept her kid. The thing that i must mention about our meeting that day, is that she kept talking about doing stuff together. Like, hey we should cook together sometimes, we should watch a horror movie together, we should go there together.. She is giving me so much attention and she is already seeing me in her life in the future and wants to include me in it. The next day at work she asked me if I'd like to go with her and eat pizza at a local place. Of course, i agreed. On that evening, she started telling me about her family and friends, and about her troubled childhood. She mentioned to me a good friend of her that she knew since she was 13 years old, who newly confessed to her about his feelings, which she didn't share with him and sees him only as a friend, and asked me for advice on how she should go around about that with him in a right way, because she doesn't want to hurt his feelings. I was supportive and we talked about that for a while. This was the sure sign for me that she doesn't have another man in her mind as a potential partner and made my chances rise more. During the night and after i left her, she texted me mentioning that she had a really nice evening.

Ok, I'm telling you all that happened in such details, because i need advice about how you would see the situation. I am a bit insecure and even after all that i don't know if she likes me or not. I know for sure that she wants to spend a lot of time with me, but from the aforementioned signs, does she want a relationship with me? Should i be direct with her and tell her how i feel, or should i wait and give it time. I'm scared of waiting for long and losing my chance and get in the friendzone.

Really need help with this one.

Basically, I'm part of a bowling club at my college where I'm the committee president.

We had a walkabout social in our city near the campus specifically for new members, and I was being a social butterfly by talking to all the new members. My boyfriend is also on the committee but we agreed to restrict the lovey dovey stuff as to not really intimimdate the new members as they were new.

Most of the people in the club are guys, and I've grown up being accustomed to have male friends as most of my hobbies are male dominated. (Anime and being a PC gamer.) 

I noticed this one guy in particular was on his own for a while so I went to speak to him. Think we spoke from the walk from one shop to another so maybe it was 10 minutes? Found out himself and quite a few other people at the meet were gamers too, so I added a few of them in FB and gave them my Steam and Battle net account details.

I went pub with my bf and a few other friends like 2 weeks later with some friends from the gaming club and the guy in his own had apparently joined. My bf left a bit early but I stayed for an extra 10 minutes to finish my drink. When I went to go leave, the guy in question turns out was just leaving too and we had to walk in the same direction as out student houses weren't too far from one another. I was talking about my fav ps5 game and I said I'd give it to him to play at the next meet, we I ended up doing. We spoke quite a bit online, but nothing deep, just a tonne of gaming memes.

Like 2 months, he asked if I still wanted to watch the Matrix some time, (when we were talking during the city walkabout, I spoke about how I knew it heavily inspired cyberpunk, despite never watching it and he said it was his fav movie and that he was going to force me to watch it at some point.) I said I could do this day/time and he said that was cool.

I said yeah, thinking absolutely nothing of it. We were meant to watch it at his student house but he asked if we could watch if at mine instead as a house mate took the living room and I said I had a bigger TV anyway and would try and get my house mates to join. He asked before he left if he wanted me to bring any booze for the film and I said no, I had ciders if I wanted to drink and I had work in the morning anyway.

He came to my house, sat on different sofas, and watched the film. I was messaging my bf throughout it as he was at the pub with his house mates (I have an awful attention span as you can tell, Autism isn't great unfortunately.)

The film ended and I started to kind of feel uncomfortable. The way I socialise with 2 of my closest friends (1 being a girl, one being a boy) was to watch anime shows/films at each others houses as it was cheap, so it didn't strike me as odd while watching. I started to feel uncomfortable because the film had finished, we already spoke for like 10 minutes and he wasn't really leaving. He never moved seats to get close to me or anything, but I was just really confused as to why he wasn't leaving as I had really ran out of conversation topics. I ended up telling him about some issues I had in the Video gaming club I'm in, and he went into some issues he'd been having in some political club he was a committee member in himself which wasted conversation topic. I had a wierd feeling in my gut that he thought this event was something else in his mind, why else would be not be leaving I kept on thinking. I was messaging my BF at the time and asked if we could go for a walk to the store and if he could stop over. When me and the guy left out the front door, I went straight to my boyfriend, and the 3 of us ended up walking to the store while me and my bf were holding hands. We split after coming out the store and my boyfriend spent the night at mine. 

He ended up messaging me saying he was terrified he gave my boyfriend the wrong idea, and I took that as in it defo weren't a date in his mind.

I was fine being friends with him because I'm not attracted to him at all and I know he doesn't have the personality I want (I've been in enough relationships with boys and girls to know the personality I want and I know he defo doesn't have it so I knew I'd never cheat on my bf with him, well, that's hot my Bisexual mind works I guess)

I'm not in a situation where I can avoid talking to him as I'm a committee member and I feel rude blanking him as my intention was always just friendship from the get go.

Well, to be simple about, all the women I've been meeting seem like they'd prefer if I wasn't around and I'm not sure why. If there was wrong that I'm doing I'd understand, but I'm trying to be nothing but nice. (Or Caring/loving, whatever way you'd like to see it)

It's... not working out, as you could likely tell by the purpose of the post. &amp; It's not that I'm expecting relationships for being nice, but I do expect, well, more than I'm getting.

How do I mean? Well, Let's list all of my experiences with women.

\-First-

This person lead me on for two months, lying about literally everything. When I spoke about it, most seemed to see only that I was mad that she doesn't want to have sex with me anymore.

In actuality though, even after everything she says that she still would. (which I can't say I care about anymore, not to mention if she'd have sex with someone she's not attracted to, while already with someone...)

Her lies? (If you were wondering?) Well, there's her lying about thinking I'm attractive, lying about being violated by her brothers and father, lies about never having been with anyone even though she has for the past 6 years, lies about recent death that was bothering her, lies about where she lives, and a bunch of others.

Literally nothing that she told me over the two months of getting to know each other was true.

So there's a ""fuck you"" straight to me.

\-Second-

Around two months ago too I met another person. Nothing's happened really so far, but she said that she likes speaking to me so much that she wants to move the conversation to discord. (instead of the app we were using)

It's been about a month since, without adding me or anything, and, well, I'm pretty sure I just got lied to again.

There's also her proclamation about how she has a ""bad habit"" of not saying anything to people for weeks.

I personally believe that's untrue, and she still goes on the app but won't say anything to me.

Another ""fuck you"" have I earned, reasonless this time as well. At least I'm getting used to it I guess (That's a lie)

\-Third-

About a month ago I started speaking to yet another person. However this person says that I'm bad at communication and don't know how to ""talk to girls""

Which might be true, my experience is slim, I'm slightly autistic and socially/mentally slower, but she can't call anyone bad at communication when she's awful herself. How am I meaning?

Well. she literally just says lol to everything. and gives one or two word responses to anything ever said.

Ask her what's up? ""Lol""

Ask her how her children are? ""Looooool""

Ask her how her game's going? ""Hehe""

....

Good fucking god, I'm sorry, but this all is reminding me of why I never really liked people.

They'll treat you like shit and it's never for a reason. (In my experience anyways,)

you know what else is making me feel pretty hated? How anyone I message on dating apps never say anything.

&amp; My messages are nothing but nice. I usually just send wishes for luck in what they're wanting to find, or a simple hope for a nice day.

But all I get is a wordless ""fuck you"" (actually some of them are said)

You know what I really, really like about all of this? If it was done by someone they liked at all it would be treated well. Doubt they'd be getting no response... fairly certain something would be said and it'd be thanked for or enjoyed.

so, if what I do isn't being appreciated... &amp; if nothing's being said...

...

\---------

TL;DR I feel safe assuming that all these women that ""like"" me would actually would prefer me less alive. (a little far? Probably not actually, I know most only care for those that they may have sex with.)

It's what I'm seeing, so is there a way where I may have people actually like me? &amp; not treat me like shit?

I find it strange how I, with my bad life and only being half-raised because I didn't have parents around, am able to be at least okay. What's all of these people's reasonings for being some kind of harmful? especially those that had nicer lives and Parents and were never abused and happen to have nice bodies? Seriously

I'd like advice on how to not be treated badly by everyone I'm meeting, especially these people that supposedly ""like"" me. (I mean, if they didn't wouldn't they make it so I couldn't be part of their life, or why would they want to know me but not know me? )

""I like you so much that I want nothing to do with you at all"" (It's basically being told that, the whole thing)

I'd like advice on how to not only ever be used or mistreated by people too. I hear people don't like Abusers but they do pretty well. (They need people to do anything, right?)

I'm going to say it, it is pretty awful how you have to be good-looking enough or something just for people to talk to you and not treat you worse than they likely treat criminals and Warlords.

I've been speaking with a really nice guy (34m) and we're currently planning a second date. 

We get on really well and he's very easy to talk to. I enjoy talking with and spending time with him and I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out. My worry is how I'm going to navigate through a new relationship with the (physical and emotional) scars of a previous abusive relationship.

Some background info.. I was in a 3 year relationship with a man who has BPD, I was heavily manipulated, gaslit and abused. I already suffered anxiety, depression and extremely low self worth before but now with PTSD and trauma response on top of that; I tend to either dissociate or flat out panic. I will also always find a way to make myself the bad guy in any situation, I find myself at fault over the smallest thing and apologize constantly, feeling like the worst person in the world.

I have been working on myself and I am in a much better place than I have ever been before, my confidence is higher than ever but still pretty low in the grand scheme of things (eg, I'll never think I'm beautiful but I can look in the mirror without being disgusted at who is looking back) but...

How do I explain the self harm scars? How do I learn not to panic and frantically clear up a glass of water I've spilt? How do I say that I'd prefer to sit on the side of the sofa nearest the door so I can escape quickly incase he might rampage? How do I explain that I'm too scared to be on top because the last time I was thrown off and into a wall because I ""wasn't doing it right"" (after 10 seconds and no instruction)? How do I believe that if he does something genuinely nice for me it's not going to come with strings attached or be thrown in my face later on? How do I deal with the first argument without shaking like a leaf or just full on dissociating?

I'm not saying that I'll have to deal with all of these emotions with this new person but I know that I will have to eventually. I don't want to just come out and say it and be ""that girl"" but I do know I will have to face these issues. This is just completely unknown territory to me and I have no idea what I'm doing.

All of a sudden she started ghosting. No morning texts , random snaps . All we were left with was occasional night calls . 
Now I tried telling her that it's bugging me , the lack of comm part. She was like it's just for sometime. 4 months down the lane things are still the same . 
She acts like a ghost all day and flips completely at night( like big words "" you are my soulmate , love you forever.""  And the whole day dry texts , not even a little bit of affection. )

Where do I even begin without unloading an entire book-load on background info… 

Before summer break started we talked about dating, and it chalked up to the idea that dating between us is possible.  We once had crushes on each other, and the conversation kept rolling after that. Unfortunately, I didn’t articulate myself well and I think I made her feel like I’m not that interested, as the topic was out of the blue.

So here I am at home, away from her until September basically. All summer there have been a few nights like this where I can’t seem to get her off my mind and I so badly want to think of every possible way to bring up dating to her without seeming disingenuous. 

I really do care about this girl, and I would love to settle with her if she felt the same way. We are also on great terms (always have been- even after the talk).

To reiterate the question, how can I bring up dating to her without seeming disingenuous? 

Am I already royally screwed for mixing up the emotions the first time we talked?

I feel like I am in a unique position to be able to fight for what I’m feeling inside. I reject the idea of the friends-dating-failure trope. When I go back to school in September I would love to talk to her about all of this, but for now, I am restlessly thinking of things to say in my head.

My feeling was that she was putting me on the back burner but now i have an epiphany that maybe she wanted me to chase her. 

Heres the detail- our 1st real date (after the initial meetup thru dating app week before) goes incredibly well. The chemistry is off the roof and she opts to spend all night with me without time limit. I ask her for a kiss and her response is that she is open to it but its too soon. She wants to take time because shes just been out of a relationship. We walk more and she suggests holding hands in the future ect. We end the date on a high note and the sky is the limit. But her being only recently out of the relationship is a yellow flag for me.

She asks to meet up again the next day. Again the chemistry is there but im guarded because of that yellow flag. She senses something is off and cuts the date short. 

The texting from her afterward has all the sign of slow ghosting. My text left on read, her not starting any convo. Short replies. So i just flat out say that i like her and im looking for something serious. Now she begins writing long messages that say our chemistry was off last time, she needs to take things slow, thank you for being open ect. I text her the next day that i wanna call her (my plan was to ask her out on phone and also talk about her yellow flag) Shes busy but would love to another day (classic brushoff afaik). Turns out she went on another tinder date that nite. Ive written her off at this point. But then she texts me at random the next date about my bug bite (we had gone hiking earlier) I tell her i need to give her her ointment back (for the bug bite) and her response is to keep it as long as you need it. 

So at this point i know shes blocking further advances from me so i just go what the hell and text her what i wanted to say on the phone about the yellow flag and wish her farewell. Here is where things get interesting. Shes bummed out im leaving her and wanted to hang out more. I say you cut the date short and killed the flow and i cant rely on that. She says it was because of work i swear i would be happy to meet you again. I put a pin on it by saying that i made things too awkward right now so will instead wait for a month or so before contacting her again. 

The above stuff she wrote were in long letters and carefully written unlike the brush off i was getting leading up to it. Which makes me think she did want to keep me on. My first conclusion to that is as an orbiter. Just someone to give her attention while she keeps browsing around. But what if it was to have me chase her? Our first date, you dont find that kind of affection from someone unless they are choosing you to be your partner, from my past experiences, and i was so sure of it all day. 

If you do that one day and simply switch it off the next, youre either mentally unstable or a great manipulator, and i dont wanna imagine her as either.

Warning this is a long-ish story because I feel details are important! Advice appreciated.

I (F/28) met a dude (30) on Tinder about a month ago. I am recently (4 months) out of a serious relationship, that didn't end terribly, but was enough of an emotional disturbance to leave me not wanting a committed partnership for some time. However, I am also a very sexual person and love having sex. After about 3 months I decided it was time to find a fuck buddy, or something casual -I preferably wanted a fuck buddy and not a one night stand because I figured regular sex with someone without strings would be optimal instead of a slough of one night stands that likely wouldn't be very sexually fulfilling,

Anyways, this dude pursued me hard. Not in a creepy way, but enough to have left ME feeling like he may want more than what I am looking for! He was very chatty, charming, sweet, engaged, complimentary. He brought up several times that he wants to meet me as soon as possible throughout the few weeks that we were texting. I had a really busy month so I kept saying maybe next week. I also was unsure if I was actually down to meet this guy. I found him super hot from his photos and videos we exchanged, but still online meetups can be nerve-wracking.

Finally after a few weeks, I gave in and said ""ok fuck it"" (To myself) and let's meet him because I want sex, he's hot, I am feeling sexy and free, and want to feel the thrill. I did notice (And maybe its me just reading into things) that once I seemed to get invested back e.g. saying I want to meet, and we should go here, etc. he started to pull away? This COULD also have been because when we met he was on vacation and had lots of free time on his hands, and conveniently he came back into town and back to work when I started becoming more invested in this thing, Nonetheless, he invited me over one night but it was late so I said no (i didnt want to show up drunk after a night out as our first meeting). So I said why don't we have a phone c all instead? and he said sure or to even Facetime him.

My drunk self got so happy and I was lookin cute so I facetimed him. We talked, and I remember it being fine, but my phone was dying so I told him that I'd call him back if it dies. Now this was like 2am, so very late. My phone dies I charge it and I call him back, but he doesn't answer. My stupid intoxicated self calls this dude like 20 times (im not kidding). both voice call and facetime. I also thought it would be a good idea to SCREENSHOT my face facetiming him and text him that pic saying ""im gonna call till you pick up ;)"". I woke up the next morning so embarrassed thinking WTF was I doing because that is not like me at all. I think i was trying to be funny &amp; cute &amp; careless, but my sober self realized I came across as a psycho.

So I thought about just not messaging him and cutting my ties there. But something about his cuteness from texts the last few weeks and he is so so good looking in my eyes, so I really didn't want to give up an opportunity for a fun thing to happen between us. So he messaged me ""i was asleep"" thats it.. so he did sound annoyed. I said ""im sorry I was pretty drunk"" (which he knew because I was at a wedding that night). And then i said "" did my shenanigans last night ruin my chance of meeting up?"" and he sent back a decent paragraph explaining that it ""scared"" him a little bit and that he has no time for commitment and that he works too much and blah blah, and doesn't know if that changes things about me wanting to meet up.

So that pissed me off a bit because although i felt dumb and wished I didn't call this dude so many times like a fool, it could have been way worse.. But i wasn't that pissed, because he has a right to feel scared from what I did and I clearly gave the wrong idea. But I also laughed because i also dont want commitment, so it was a good time to clear up any confusion and be clear about what we both want. So then I just explained that I also don't want commitment, that im recently out of a relationship and was just in Tinder to find a fuck buddy. and he said ""so lets fuck then"" and i said something about next week meeting up.

The next DAY, he texts me to come over. I say I can't because I am busy. The NEXT day again he asks what am I doing and if I can come over. I said maybe, and asked a few more details about time and where. I decided to just do it, knowing that we both know we just want casual fun. I go over, he is nice, cool dude. We had fun, we had sex, it was great. He is just as sexy as I thought, and i'm guessing he thinks I am just as sexy since he seemed super into it. He kissed me goodbye. so that also told me he wasn't like ""Get the fuck out"".

I left so happy, on cloud 9 because that was the exact experience I was looking for. I also thought it was perfect because even though hes nice and super hot, hes not my ""type"" personality wise. So i thought this makes him a great candidate to be a fuck buddy.

I couldn't stop thinking about the sex and i wanted to wait for him to message me first but said fuck it, again. I messaged him the next day saying im thinking about his C\^&amp;K and how good it felt. He messaged me back and equally sexy message and invited me BACK over to do it again. I really couldn't that night since I was busy so I said ""i need to be a good girl"".

So to recap, he invited me over Monday - i declined, he invited me over Tuesday - we hooked up for the first time, he invited me over Wednesday - I declined. I did send him a few sexy photos in between and he confirmed he likes receiving them.

Come Sunday, I was horny again and said when hes back home from an event he was at let me know if he wants to have some fun. He said to come hang, it was after midnight and I went and we had another great sex.

Now here is where I am going fucking crazy. I've somehow become like infatuated and/or obsessive about him. I hate it, it is so weird and it's like my hormones are completely taking over me. The parts that trip me up the most are that he got a bit weird and distant once I pulled in closer and ESPECIALLY after I ""scared him"". I wish I didn't do that, but I did, and even though he said he understood I was really drunk and said ""we're good"" I feel like he has the upper hand and all the power because I gave it all to him. I really want this casual sex thing to work, but apparently I don't know how to do it? lol.

It has only been one week and we fucked twice, and talked here and there.. but to me I feel like i'm going crazy because I get the feeling he STILL thinks I am coming on too strong, and I know men don't like that, especially one who has already admitted he is scared of commitment. And his withdrawal (Again he was veryyyy chatty before) is making me overthink it all and wonder if he is subtly giving me hints he's not as interested? I truly cannot tell.

I have been looking for other contenders and met up with a few guys but don't feel the sexual attraction I have for this guy, so I really want to continue with casual sex but I am freaking out over here!! Is it me? is it him? did I fuck it up? or am I just being a crazy overthinker?? I have not stopped thinking about him and when he is going to message me again since we met.

I am worried that I am coming on too strong by being too available and he knows it? and will get bored of me? or scared? or perhaps because he's already had sex twice with me, he's got what he wanted? Or I am just being a psycho.

I DONT KNOW! Help a sista out pleaseee. And yes I have already considered just stopping.

I (27, m) constantly sabotage myself by reading way too far into actions with no meaning. I currently like this other guy (30, m) and have begun getting to know him. He's legitimately a very busy person, as well as very introverted, and at times turns down my invitations to go out (but always provides a reason of why he's busy). On the other hand, he also approaches me often to chat, has a good time when we do go out, and many other positive things.

Somehow, my mind can ONLY focus on the negative. Like he rejected my invitations--he must be trying to send me hints that he's not interested. Even though I know he was legit busy, I still take it as he was trying to reject me in a nice way. I'm super insecure and I'm always trying to decode secret messages hidden in his actions that say that he somehow hates me. It's a mess. I want to try just not thinking about these things at all and go forward, but that would require that he be direct and just tell me if he's not interested. My worst fear is that I'm continuing along, asking him out and stuff, while he's actually hinting to me that he's not interested and I'm just oblivious and not picking up on it.

Honestly, though, I'm tired lmao. I'd rather just go for it obliviously than sabotage myself when it's actually going fine. It's on him to tell me directly if he's not interested, right?

I’m a 21 year old boy who needs a woman’s advice. 

Me and this girl, let’s call her Alice, have been secretly seeing eachtoher for 2 months. We also had something for 3 months last year but uni split us up basically, again secret. However, when I was 16 to 18, I used to date one of Alices friends. Visa versa, she used to date one of my friends. I still remain friends with my friend and my ex, she just remains friends with my ex. We think that if we were to get together they would both disapprove and Alice would be left with no friends. My friend, alices ex, has moved away for uni so I don’t think it would be too much of a deal on my part. 

I move to another country to do a ski season in early November. Alice is keen to do one too but I said to her she should work in another resort until January then change to mine. This is because she’s never moved away from home and I think it will be good for her, so does she. 

However today when she saw me, she said she doesn’t want to carry on for the next 2 months because she doesn’t want to get attached for me to move away and have a restricted experience (aka get with someone else). I really like her and don’t want this to end, but it is so hard being a secret, can’t go out for dinner or drinks in our town incase people will see us.

How can I win her over and convince her to see see me for the next 2 months, then we spend 2 months apart but both in same country speaking to eachother, then start a new life skiing after Christmas?? Hope this makes sense, just looking for advice on the situation. I love her too bits and don’t want it to end. I’d hate to lose her and see her wit someone else it would crush me.

So I said “yeah that’s right, then we’ll plan something for the next week then” and she said “it sounds good”. Her speaking English was decent, she definitely speaks it better than writing it.

Since the first date ended she’s been super slow responding to texts. She didn’t take too long to respond after the date and the next day but has gotten slower and slower over time. I asked her if she was going to be free next Monday or Tuesday and she responded saying “yes I think so” and also said “hello” right after (not sure why, maybe because she’s still learning how to communicate in English). Hours after that I said hello then asked if she wanted to get ice cream and walk around the local park afterwards on either Monday or Tuesday. It’s been over 24 hours now and no response. 

Another thing to add is that I’m not looking for anything serious right now. More something casual since I’m moving next year. But I hadn’t told her that yet. I’m thinking maybe I should tell her because maybe she thinks I want something serious and she doesn’t want something serious. Or maybe she just isn’t interested anymore. I really don’t know what to do bc I really would like a second date with her.

This is long, but i think context is important to this story. I am a 29M, she is 25F.

About 3 months ago, I met a remarkable girl via Bumble. We both had downloaded the app as really just a distraction, but found each other and started talking. Long story short, we connected really significantly. 

She got out of a long, emotionally abusive relationship in late April, so her breakup (even now) is still quite fresh. This was always a bit of a looming thing, knowing she wasn’t really ready for much in the form of seriousness/commitment realm. But the time we spent together was always so special that I kept trudging forward. And, we were / still are getting to know each other more and more any who. 

Things started to move really fast, it seemed. I never put any pressure on her to date or label anything, but a few weeks ago, it seems like she got caught up in the whirl-wind of everything and decided to ‘end’ whatever it is that we’ve had going on. She went on vacation the next day. However, a few days later, she reached back out to me, apologized, and said she wanted to start back up again. She is insanely busy, works a lot, has very little free time to herself, so while I didn’t love her cutting things off in the way she did, I understand it. Seemed like her vacation gave her some much needed time to herself to actually think and digest.

We got back together when she returned and hungout again. It was a great time, to say the least. Her and I click insanely well.  However, I knew going forward that in order for me to feel comfortable, I felt like being exclusive with her was something I needed. I pitched it, and she agreed, though it did seem very apprehensive. I urged her to not do it unless she also wanted to, but she continued to agree. Okay, cool. 

About a week later she comes over my place and says she isn’t ready to take that next step to being exclusive. The conversation was honestly very heartbreaking, as she told me a bit about her past relationship, and how much she likes me and recognizes how well her and i really work together. Perfect in every way, other than the timing of it all. She said she’d like to continue what we’ve had, but also knows I need my own end of the bargain to feel comfortable, too. Its not just about her.

I take a couple days to process this and decide what I want. Not an easy thing to do. We meet up the other evening to talk and I ultimately say that I need to take a step back. That I don’t know specifically what that looks like, but ill take it day by day. 

I’ve dated women, seen/talked to them, had friends with benefits relationships. Been in love. Had my heart broken. Done it all. I have never in my life felt a connection with someone quite like I have with her. Never have i felt more myself with someone as I do with her.

I don’t know what to do going forward. I’d really liker her in my life, in the way that we had. I just don’t know if I can mentally deal with the not being exclusive aspect of it. I don't know if I should just say fuck it and hang in there, and try and enjoy the process, or pull out before I potentially get really hurt.

Any advice on how i should proceed? I am really torn on this as I don’t know if this is a situation where I should do what i want, or if i should do what i need?

TLDR: Girl and I are near perfect match for each other - she is still fresh out of a terrible relationship and not ready for any form of commitment, but still wants to see me. I am ready for a bit more commitment (even the most basic form), but not sure if I can deal with not being exclusive.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,963295,public,self,"A perfect fit, but poor timing.

We will often go on a date, think they had amazing chemistry with someone, only to be ghosted or friend zoned afterward, utterly clueless as to what happened. In fact, the signs were there all along, yet we were too busy fantasizing or being nervous to be observant of their mannerisms.

Short answers, limited smiling, appearing distracted, infrequent eye contact, body language that is oriented away from you rather than getting closer, no laughter or indication of having fun.

The signs are there, but when you’re prematurely imagining a future with someone, you’re going to inherently have a skewed version of reality, where they like you more than they actually indicate. For guys with a fragile ego who have a hard time facing rejection, or believe it’s shameful,they will convince themselves that cold behavior is her playing hard to get or being coy.

If a someone has a high level of attraction, they aren’t very good at playing hard to get. You will know in some aspect of their mannerism, even if it’s not blatant. They will want to be around you, they will appear genuinely happy and excited to be around you.

If they go cold on a date or while communicating, they aren’t attracted to you in the moment. Instead of asking ‘are you ok’ or ‘what’s wrong?’, mirror their behavior. Don’t be a dick or rude, but make your answers shorter, don’t talk as much, don’t pretend you’re having fun if you’re aren’t.

If they appears genuinely distressed or sad, then ask if they’d like to try another time and end the date, supporting them if they seek it. Otherwise just hang back until you part ways.

This issue has really bothered me for most of my life and although I managed to deal with it to the best of my ability, recently I've been unable to cope. I'm sorry if I waffle on too much it's just very hard for me to write this.

A little bit about me: 

I am a 22 year old guy who is 5'11 and 200 pounds. I am athletic and in very good shape since I exercise every day. I am ambitious, hard working and currently studying at a prestigious university. I enjoy meeting new people and have a healthy social circle. I enjoy pursuing several hobbies and in particular I like volunteering, because it provides me with fulfillment and helps me to value the life I have everyday, whilst contributing to my community. I would like to think I am slightly above average looking and have not had problems finding dates. I feel it is important to give you guys a little background about me just so you don't assume that I am some social recluse who blames society for my problems. I actively work towards improving myself everyday, however the part of me that I am unable to physically improve has held me back to the point at which I am suffering mentally.

Unfortunately I have a small penis. It is 4 inches fully erect and quite thin. As a result, my sex life, and my ability to develop non-platonic relationships has suffered horribly. There have been so many times where I have met a wonderful woman and we really hit it off and by the time it comes around to getting intimate, it happens. That look. The look of disappointment. I have seen it on the face of every woman who has seen my penis and it absolutely ruins my self confidence. I have had girls literally laugh at me when they have seen how small I am and have simply just got up and left. When I do hookup, the sex instantly becomes bad because I know she is not enjoying it. 

The worst is the pity sex. The women who just feel sorry for me and show pity on me. It's fucking destroying internally. I have tried experimenting with toys, oral, foreplay... everything. But it simply isn't enough. Women have literally told me it's just not the same as a man's penis. The last girl I was dating briefly was super into me and would always try and initiate sex but I would always hold off. I would just only go down on her and refuse to have sex. After a while, we grew even closer and I trusted her enough to have sex. When saw my penis, she burst out laughing. I was on the verge of tears and just left.

I totally understand that women have preferences. For most, a 4 inch penis just isn't enough to satisfy them. But it still fucking hurts to know that I'm not good enough. I try so hard to maintain my current level of fitness, develop my hobbies and excel at college. But to know that because of something I was born with,  something that I cannot change - that I am not good enough? It ruins me mentally. I feel inferior as a man, as a human being because of this issue and it has recently started to affect my life as a whole. I'm losing motivation to do anything really. I feel there is no point anymore in going outside and meeting new people because all of my multiple experiences with girls have ended in the same way - embarrassment and humiliation due to my penis size.

I don't know if I am depressed but my self esteem is non-existent. I have stopped showering and taking care of myself because I no longer believe it makes any difference because even when I was happy and taking care of myself, it all still ended the same way. I have considered therapy but I don't really see how this will help because the underlying problem of my penis size will continue to exist.

I am feeling really shitty and just worthless at the moment. I don't know what to do anymore and I just need help. Please could someone help me and give me advice.

Thank you.

It is not a trans persons job to tell you that they're trans, in fact, it is extremely dangerous for them. 

In 34 American states, 5 US territories and many other countries, the Trans panic defence is legal, which means that you could murder a trans person, claim self defence and get absolutely no jail time as long as that trans person admitted that they are transgender.

This is why if you have an issue with dating a transgender person, it's your job to admit that and not the transgender persons job to disclose that their transgender. If you say you don't want to date a transgender person then they just don't date you. But if we disclose that we're transgender then we are literally risking our own safety.
