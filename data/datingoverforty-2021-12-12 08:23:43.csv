0,req0fa,1639319038,New to this Scene,"I just turned 45(M) and am finalizing an amicable divorce after 17 years of marriage. We get along, but just aren't good together as spouses. I've recently joined a couple of the popular dating apps and just want some advice on what's normal and what's not. 

I've matched with quite a few women, probably because I'm 45 and have a full head of hair, no shirtless selfies, and think I'm still pretty handsome, but not cocky about it. Most of these conversations have ended with the other person just ghosting or never responding even though they initiated the conversation with a Like or invitation to start the chat. Is this normal? Some of them I've found attractive and would like to continue a conversation, but don't want to seem lonely or desperate by continuing to try and contact them. 

2nd question is about meeting/exchanging information. I've been chatting back and forth with a lady that I'm very interested in and finally have a date set for Monday night. She's been hard to pin down, sometimes goes a day or two without replying to a message, but has responded quickly and with good conversation over the past week or so. It's been 3 weeks since our first contact and we still have not exchanged numbers and our conversation is still only on the app. Do people usually exchange numbers and text or move off the app in a certain time frame? She's said that she thinks it's weird that guys will want to exchange numbers or Social Media(Snapchat) so quickly. Am I wrong to think that 3 weeks isn't quickly?

I'm open to any other advice to help navigate this new world. The last time I was looking for a first date, Al Gore hadn't invented the internet yet, so this is all new to me.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/req0fa/new_to_this_scene/
1,rerdzx,1639323311,Keeping exes from owning real estate in your head,"Even if I can solidly intellectualize the reasons I’ve broken up with my exes, I find it very difficult to move on emotionally. I ruminate too much about what was my fault about our demise and what I could have done better in the relationship(s). 

I recognize that the relationship I’m looking for should feel more effortless, and that probably fought with my exes because there were too many fundamental mismatches. I am trying to tell myself that finding the right person is a journey, and just because the first, second, or tenth stop doesn’t work out doesn’t mean any or all of the players were toxic or bad people. 

But I am that person who married the first guy who didn’t leave me. Divorcing him felt nearly impossible, and since then have accumulated two other exes who I loved very much. Being out there dating and starting/ending relationships for a period of several years now, I worry that my overall sense of loss is compounding.

So, I’m looking for tips and encouragement for moving on in my heart as well as my head. I’ve got a very full life with work, kids, friends, and hobbies. I really don’t NEED a man. But I sure do miss my ex boyfriends, and I wish I could just stop thinking about them so much.

Thanks, guys. And yes, I’m already in therapy.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rerdzx/keeping_exes_from_owning_real_estate_in_your_head/
2,rerfjb,1639323440,Dating rules,"Hi everybody, as I am reading Reddit,  I realize ppl suggesting a lot of rules such as “don’t be too available “. May I ask why? Why can’t we be ourselves and be a good human? I can’t do this to other ppl and make them wait when I actually can text them back. If I am at work and I can’t, then that’s a different story but within a few hours( maximum),  I can give some kind of response, even those times when I see the text most of the times I say “I can’t talk right now, I will text you later”. I haven’t started dating yet but this is how I am with everybody. I am just reading and getting myself educated after yrs that I was in a marriage and starting to feel there are too many rules out there. I want to be myself, a good human, be kind , be responsive, treat others like the way I want to be treated, not be superficial, not be judgmental, be a good listener, empathize, not be afraid of rejection and consider it part of growing up, have a good sense of humor. Are these things bad now ? As I read I’ve started to feel like behaving this way is not norm anymore and might be “too nice “ these days? I am a grown woman, but quite frankly confused and don’t understand what happened during the years I was married and not on the dating scenes. Would appreciate any insight. I hope you are all healthy and having a lovely day.

7,rexvjf,1639341941,Is it rude and disrespectful to mention being hit on to your partner?,"I (43M) exited a long-term relationship of seven years and after staying single for awhile, I joined several OLD sites. I met a woman (39F), and we began a LDR. We both traveled for work and found it easy to meet whenever and wherever. We shared common interests, life goals, education, and experience. I was quickly smitten with her. She added to my born-again happiness.  

One night we were talking, and she mentioned a previous fling. She described in great detail about how she arranged this sexy encounter and how it all played out. I listened and took some mental notes for later reference. When she finished her story, she said, ""I don't know why I just told you that.""

I responded, ""No worries. I don't want there to be any secrets between us."" I appreciated her openness. What happened in her past is past.

A couple of months into the relationship, I asked her for a relationship health check - how are we doing, anything on your mind, etc. She said, ""You make me feel so safe. No one has ever treated me this good. I can't get enough of you."" She suggested that we become exclusive. I agreed as I felt we were headed somewhere together.

Fast forward a couple of months. I've traveled across country to handle some family drama. It weighed on me and put me in a not-so-good space. It was also the night before my birthday. I'm big on birthdays, and this is the first one that we shared. She worked a 12-hour, second shift and went in at 1100. She usually called me on her break, and I had not heard from her all day. The phone rang at 2100. It was her. I was excited to hear from her, plus I needed to vent about this family drama.

I answered, ""Hey, Babe.""

She replied, ""Hey.""

I asked, ""How's your night?"" It must have busy because her break came very late.

She said, ""OMG, there's this guy that's beein hitting on me all... night... long..."" Right out of the gate. She drew out the all night long part.

I joked, ""Did he do a good job?"" Come on?! I can't be the only guy in the world who thinks she's hot.

She proceeded to go and on about this guy and how, ""He said this, and he said that, and he did this, and he did that, like all night long."" She went on for a couple of minutes talking about him. It was too far and too much...

I asked, ""Did you tell him you weren't interested?""

""No.""

""Did you tell him you had a boyfriend?""

""No.""

""When I hit on woman who is not interested, she'll make it known. She might casually mention a 'we', or sometimes she'll just get right to the point. Either way, I'll back off.""

She responded, ""I don't know what world you're living in.""

She had to go back to work, and we ended the call. So I thought to myself, if this guy approached her repeatedly, why didn't she shut him down? Why is this nobody even worth a mention? Why did she hide our relationship, lying by omission? Does she not have any boundaries? Who else does she hide our relationship from? Am I a secret?

Well, ladies? What's the point here?

Guys? What are your thoughts?

I found her behavior quite rude and disrespectful. She was totally aware that this guy was coming on to her repeatedly over the course of 10 hours, and she did nothing to stop it. Yet, it becomes from page news in our relationship. This seems like high-school drama.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rexvjf/is_it_rude_and_disrespectful_to_mention_being_hit/
8,reymvo,1639344132,How to move on from someone that is unavailable?,"It's been about a year since my spouse and I decided to split. For a variety of reasons, the divorce is only just now about to be finalized. During that time I've made the mistake of getting emotionally attached to a friend that is not available. Our friendship started to really blossom in the early stages of the pandemic, as we both were looking to make sure our respective mental health situations didn't deteriorate. This friend has also been struggling with their marriage, and it became a subject that was really cathartic to talk through with them. Together we've discussed a lot of what makes relationships work, what our needs and preferences are, and generally just came to understand that we have so much in common in a wide variety of ways. We spend a fair amount of time together meeting up for coffee, lunch, a hike, bike rides, drinks, etc. We communicate with each other more than anyone other than the people we live with. Our spouses know this, and since my marriage is over anyway, it never really dawned on me until recently that we might be having an emotional affair. We've bought each other small gifts, are always texting when something reminds us of the other person, and generally share some of the most vulnerable parts of ourselves with each other. I realized the other day that I've made the mistake of letting myself fall in love with this person. I don't fault them at all, but I do think we've both crossed the line a few times in the ways we talk about how important we are to each other. I want to maintain the friendship that has become so important to me, but also I'm heartbroken at the realization that this person is not available. Of course I'm not going to share these feelings with them, I think I just needed to get this out there to anyone that would be willing to read it. I also know that the best course of action is to just try and let it go, but how? If anyone that has been in a similar situation has any advice to share, I'm certainly willing to listen - but I'm also very happy to just hear a bunch of validating statements letting me know that everything will be fine one way or another. :)",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/reymvo/how_to_move_on_from_someone_that_is_unavailable/
9,rezexd,1639346381,He tipped the female server $50...,"It was our 2nd date, &amp; it was a $40 brunch check (which I offered to split, but he said it was his treat).  As we were leaving the table, I noticed he had left a $50 bill.

Wow, I thought, he's a *really* good tipper ~ or is he hoping I'll notice - or both?  Quiet, smart man.  Big presence, physically &amp; energetically.  Confident &amp; used to getting what he wants, it seemed.

After about 8 dates, he broke it off with a one-sentence text.  I was disappointed - especially because all signs pointed to him really liking me.

Anyway, as I think back, I get a vaguely uncomfortable vibe - &amp; out of curiosity, is a huge tip like that (more than 100% tip!) a code for ""let's hook up""?

I need help figuring out my emotions and how to move forward, if at all","I was on a work trip in a city and after work ended on Friday I met with this guy from tinder. He was witty and fun while chatting so I invited him for a walk then we went for wine and he invited me over to his place for champagne to celebrate some stuff I accomplished at work. I accepted and he was of a good company that I ended up spending the whole weekend with him at his place ( he invited me and I accepted and cancelled my hotel reservation) . We spent a really good time together, fooled around a lot, went for walks in the city, food etc. He was nice, respectful, accommodating and of an easy company overalls. He felt the same about my company.


We both are free souls, have life plans and are not looking for anything serious/ committed relationships, but I'm experiencing a sort of sadness after leaving him for some reason and I don't know what to do about or deal with my emotions. I never did this before, connecting physically and personally this much with someone in a very short period of time then leaving. It hurts a little.


I'd like to stay in touch with him and meet again but I felt he was a bit distant/ detached emotionally thorough the weekend. Maybe to protect himself? I don't know. Maybe it's healthy. I'm just getting a bit crazy about the fact that  he's distant. Maybe it was just a sort of ONS and I don't need to think too much a about it but it hurts a little.


Some background: I only had one previous sexual partner in a committed long term relationship before. So basically he's the second guy I ever had sex with. I haven't been physically intimate with anyone since my former relationship ended 2years ago. I have no tangible experience in dating/ONS etc and how to deal with emotions move forward or not afterwards? I'm also a recovering codependent and a highly sensitive person.



My questions is how how to deal with my emotions and the sadnesses I'm experiencing ? And how to move forward in a healthy way with this guy without us commiting to a relationship or anything? Just meeting in weekends/ hiking/travelling together etc. When should I express this to him? Now or wait a little?

Had just ended a short relationship prior. Texted 3or 4 days before him asking me out. Good looking guy but wasn’t sure what I thought about the guy prior to meeting, or maybe I was still a little sad from other situation ending. 

We meet and have fun.  Hug at the end. Meet a week later for dinner. Steamy make out session. Happens 3 more times before we have sex. No discussion of what we are looking for. Both have busy careers so we are each out town a couple of weeks during this time for work . Next few times we see each other, we don’t go out. Just have sex. I send him a pic of me as I’m going to an awards event. He asks if this is for a date or my job. 

See him again. He asks me what we are doing because it’s kind of weird that we have been just having sex. I’m a little caught off guard because I wasn’t expecting commentary. We talk about going out again but maybe he was just being nice.  Whenever I’ve met people on apps (Bumble or Hinge) most of those things have been casual and were obviously casual so I never discussed.  Blast me. I know I should use my grown up words. Ultimately I would like a LTR, but am open to casual along the way. My last serious relationship was brief (7 months) but ended in January of this year. 

I feel ridiculous.   Not sure what I’m asking. I like the guy. We have a lot in common and he says we have incredible chemistry (I agree). Sex is incredible.

I told him I really didn’t have much to say from his last response and it felt like this was turning into an interview lol. He asked what I meant and I asked him what was MY favorite go-to meal to cook when I don’t feel like cooking. I knew the answer for his because I asked him based off something he shared. His reply was, how am I supposed to know, you never told me lol. Fair point I said, but told him I wasnt sure if I should start volunteering info since he never asked about me after he responded. That’s when he said he was socially awkward and hadn’t been dating in years. 

So if there are any people that are socially awkward and/or haven’t dated in a while and forgot how to converse lol, you can’t go wrong with asking follow up questions to statements or asking the same question back that was asked to you.

One thing that strikes me is that whomsoever I chat or talk to or even meet in real life, all stay with their parents. Somehow that scares me a bit as I stay all alone with my two daughters and I am very reluctant to even initiate any conversation which may take things beyond casual lunches, because soon I may have to start dealing with her family. For example if tomorrow we do decide to spend a night together I am sure she would have to take permission from her family and maybe want me to meet hers and I am just not ready to do that.

So its a question for you folks in general who have dated or are dating; if it is worthwhile pursuing a meaningful relationship with someone who still stays with their parents. Also, is staying with parents only Indian thing or is it that pandemic has made many of us move in with their parents globally.

I dated some after my divorce but in hindsight it was too soon. Now it’s been almost 2 years since the divorce was final and I’m toying with the idea again. (Wow… I had to double check my math there. Time flies.)

Knowing marriage isn’t in my foreseeable future, am I being selfish if I date with the intent of commitment?

Okay, serious question here. I realize this may sound funny, as in both funny peculiar and funny humorous, but I am genuinely curious about this. I keep running across women’s profiles wherein they post pictures of their feet. Sometimes the pictures also feature their legs, which is fine, I am an admirer of a nice pair of legs. But just the feet? What gives with that? I often wonder if they’re hoping to find a man with a foot fetish, or if they’re just open to that and aiming at the widest possible audience.

46,rgidzu,1639519004,What is a normal time expectation for an OLD chat response?,"Question: Once a conversation has begun, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait for a chat response on the dating apps before giving up on someone? 

I've still new to OLD (43M) and had only two dates from being on the app, and they were both with women who responded fairly promptly (ie, we chatted at least once or twice every 24 hours, usually back-forth conversations in evenings). All good! Things went from chatting to me asking them out quite smoothly.

But more numerous are women who say something once every 24 hours, and do this for several days. What I want to know is whether this signifies plain old disinterest? Do women have a long queue of men they are working their way through, and I should be patient? Or is it just a common communication style on the part of both genders in this age of OLD? 

I end of asking these women out more out of impatience than anything else. Sometimes I cheerfully give them my number and say hit me up if you're interested, though by this point I'm annoyed to the point that I don't really want to see them anymore. 

I get the line of thinking that says no harm in conforming to whatever communication style the woman offers up. A male friend of mine once waited three weeks before a woman followed up and they made a date. He just accepts all styles, and this has nothing to do with being desperate- it's a style thing. But this style doesn't really sit well with me. This is such a departure from normal human interaction and it has a psychic toll I don't like. 

I'm leaning towards simply unmatching with the minimal communicators, because hey- whatever their reason it, they probably just aren't what I'm looking for anyway, right? Nothing personal. 

But I want to make sure I'm not eliminating women that would be a good match for me in real life simply because I don't understand some non-intuitive dynamic of online dating communication, particularly as experienced by women. I am totally willing to adjust my expectations if need be. Interested in hearing all perspectives on this. 

PS. I know I wrote a lot of words here on something seemingly mundane, but I think as human beings we need to look closely at how these tech apps are reshaping our natural human instincts...so no, I don't think I'm over-thinking this! :)",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rgidzu/what_is_a_normal_time_expectation_for_an_old_chat/

Recently we've began the process and tests for IVF as Ive got a genetic condition I don't want to pass on to my kids. 

Today he told me he's not ready to put the sperm and egg together to test for embryo's. 

He's known since the first date all I've wanted was kids. We always fight about this because he says he doesn't really want kids. He just does it for me. And that he wants kids because he thinks he will be lonely when he's old. But he's never really seen the point in having kids or why people want them.

It's really heartbreaking for me. I know I'm getting older too and would like to have kids young (before 30)

We both have good jobs and relatively stable life. We fight a lot but always make up. 

Do I leave him? I know none of you can answer that but anyone been in a similar situation where this has happened, left and ended up being happier with someone else who wanted kids?

I have not been in a LTR for the entirety of that time because I've felt tremendous guilt over the possibility of being distanced from my children. I've been part of their daily routine from birth and felt it essential to be 100% dedicated to them.

This is going to sound dumb, but I replay the scene from Catch Me if You Can, when DiCaprio watches his mother enjoy the holidays with her new family from outside their house. Clearly catastrophized exaggeration, but this is where I'm coming from.

I decided to get back on the dating apps recently because one child is at college and the other is more independent. However, he's still a homebody, consequently causing me to still feel a tinge of guilt if I'm not spending time with him while I'm out. 

I have had several dates and one 40F I like wants to have kids. Ordinarily, I'd dismiss this option as too intrusive, but I'm trying be more open-minded. Yes, I'm 47, but I'm in great shape and loved being a father, so perhaps it isn't too outlandish an idea. On the other hand I imagine being immersed in the ""new family"" and immediately feel reluctant.

I don't want to take care of you"" when I'm 60 and you are 77.

I hadn't been in a relationship for nearly 9 years at the time we met. I wasn't seeking a boy friend. I had chosen not to date. He entered my life after hooking up with me, via one of the gay apps.

I'm devastated. I had bought him this very thoughtful gift. We had plans to go see Christmas lights last weekend and he canceled so we were supposed to go tomorrow night. We went on an overnight trip in November and we had so much fun and laughed and it was romantic and sweet and he kept saying ""We need to come back here in the Spring or Summer"" 

I loved him. I can't figure out what went wrong. I honestly don't know what happened. I'm confused and I'm hurt. And I can't believe this is happening right before Christmas. 

I had been looking so forward to having someone to spend New Year's Eve with and Valentine's Day and my birthday in February. It was so nice having someone to hug and hold hands with and sleep with. I thought I'd found my person. Not that I was like ""We're going to get married!"" because we both are divorced and don't want to get married again but I thought I found a good guy to be with. After the terrible loneliness of 2020 it was just so nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with. 

I know these things happen but I'm just so surprised and confused and hurt. It sounds silly to say but my chest physically hurts. I'm at work and it's taking all of my effort to not just shut the door to my office and cry. 

I don't really want advice or anything. I'm just hurt. I don't understand how we can be in our 40s and people still can't have conversations right when something comes up. How people can ghost and hide behind texting and not be willing to work through little hiccups. I don't even know if there was a little hiccup! He won't talk to me. I can't get him to even talk to me.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rhydf0/prechristmas_break_up/

I was introduced to someone through family connections who is around my age and was in a 20 year relationship that ended 5 years ago.  He lives with his elderly mom and helps take care of her.  We have met a few times and there is something very normal snd nice about him- he texts daily, sent flowers when I unexpectedly lost a co-worker recently, no big red flags, etc.  But . . . And I don’t know if I’m explaining this well, it feels very going -through-them-motions and linear.  I don’t feel emotionally connected.  Which feels central to me.  I’m highly cerebral and emotional and have done years of therapy, used psychedelics for mental health, view self-development as essential to my life, etc. and am looking for a relationship where we are both working on ourselves and can talk about anything re our inner lives.  But our daily texts or convos don’t seem to advance.   He will respond to in a very linear fashion to what I say or write.  So if I say “I feel a little low today bc my best friend left town and I’m kind of feeling disconnected from my family.” He might respond and say “I’m sorry you’re feeling low.  It sucks you feel disconnected.”  I don’t know how to describe why this sort of stuff over and over makes me feel so lonely and unseen but it does.  It just feels so vanilla.

79,ri4e1x,1639700850,Break in trust,"So I’ve been dating this guy for a couple of months, we were FWB for about a year before.

We’ve talked about hooking up with another couple. When talking about it I said we should do it together.

But when I saw him yesterday, he showed me messages he’d exchanged with a couple. He’d gone on a free website where you can advertise anything for sale etc, similar to Craigslist, and started messaging a couple.

He had sent them a full face photo of us both, without my consent. Even just to choose a couple and start messaging with no discussion kinda turned my stomach, but adding a photo was really bad. I work in a public position, I really don’t need my face publicly out there in that manner.

I tried to explain why it was wrong, he just kept apologising without really adding anything other then saying he thought I’d like it.

During the same visit, I also told him how I feel frustrate whenever I start to tell some story from life, he always interjects with his own story, but never follows up to ask me to finish my own.

To me, these are all signs he likes the idea of me, more then who I actually am. He is an old school kind of guy, very polite etc. I do trust he’d never purposely hurt me, but he just doesn’t seem to understand me, or even comprehend that that is an issue.

My Ex has intimated that this relationship is disrespectful of her and our Daughter, and may impact my relationship with them.

However, I'm trying to figure out if age makes for a different dating dynamic. After a couple of dates he asked me to come over his house, but I have a strict no hook-up or one night stand policy (I have a tendency to catch feelings quite easily), so I told him maybe another time as it wasn't my style to do that so soon. He said he understood, and that he never perceived me to be the type for casual encounters, and that we could meet in public until I was ready. I couldn't help but sense that he felt chastened, and he seems to have stepped back a bit. He texts every 2-3 days or so, to check in on how I am doing, he asks how my child is and is generally pleasant. If I text him he answers immediately. He calls me sweetie, and sexy, whatever that means, but hasn't initiated any dates since that conversation despite having expressed wanting to see me.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Here's an example from my own adventures...

I haven't dated anyone in awhile. I usually meet women IRL, I don't use OLD. The last one seemed really cool but she was different than women I've dated previously in that she was not athletic so to speak. She liked hiking and backpacking she said, which checks my ""must be active or outdoorsy"" box. We texted for awhile then decided to talk and I was so caught off guard by the convo...

The first thing that got my attention was swearing and lots of it! I'm not even close to a saint, but it was a bit much!

I was still trying to stay open to going out with someone different than my usual type, so I asked her if she wanted to meet up at a large city park, she could walk her dog if she wanted, we could chat, get a coffee/lunch. This was early pandemic. She was up for it, but had a strong negative reaction to me mentioning I'd bring a frisbee. I have never met someone who was so opposed to the idea of tossing a frisbee around. I mean, it was sunny, nice weather, and everything was locked down, I didn't think it would elicit a ""oh hell #$@$ing no!"" response, lol. Not from someone who doesn't mind doing outdoorsy stuff and getting dirty anyway.

I decided to postpone meeting up with her. We had another convo or two and I started to understand that backpacking for her meant a short hike to camp, get drunk, and party. I never learned why frisbee was so bad,. I did learn that she had dated a guy in his early 20s recently (~20 years younger) and that she was open to poly relationships. I noped out of there at that point. She kept initiating contact, so I leaned heavily into doing ""Dad stuff"" and she eventually took the hint.

I guess this is both a pro and con of not using OLD. One one hand, it shows that a person's idea of their own interests can be different than how anyone else relates to those interests. It also shows the limitations of texting/chat. So when you see what they are into on their profile, you don't *really* know. On the other hand, at least with OLD you can get an idea of what a person is into without having to take time to talk with them. Like the poly stuff, assuming that would have been on her profile, I would have immediately passed.

Anyway, I just thought it was interesting that after texting a bunch, I never got the impression that she was into partying, hooking up with young guys, and having an epic potty-mouth.

The situation: I’ve known my colleague for 3 years I think and we get along really well. We share the same interests, humour and all that. But besides that the past year we started making some intimate comments here and there to eachother. Started as jokes but sometimes it doesn’t feels like it anymore. She says things like; “if I was your age we would definitely be a perfect fit”. 

And the worse part is, she has a man. He is a truck driver who is away 5 days a week and only home in the weekends. So I thought; ‘okay OP, this is never going to work and it will be just joking and fouling around as friends’. Until last month when we had a drink with the whole team. After a few drinks we all were joking around and calling out on eachothers good looks. I went to her and sad that she looked really good  but I stated that her husband probably wouldn’t like that I sad this. She turned to me and whispered; “oooh he doesn’t have to know everything“ and she winked afterwards. 

I can’t think straight since that moment. I want to have a drink 1-on-1 since that moment but it feels so wrong. And I’m afraid to ask it because it can ruin everything between us.

We share a profession and a hobby, and it has been great to have someone to talk to. I have not dated in a few years and have given up now: I do not often feel attraction to strangers, but I also do not hit on my friends, so staying single is the most likely prospect - it's not like a woman of my dreams will just land in my living room.

Except, last week I realized this friend and I are now spending much of our free time together, and somehow, over the last couple of months, we have developed a habit of holding hands when crossing a street and sometimes afterwards too, and then cuddling started and... this is clearly no longer just a friendship. I don't know why I did not see it evolving, or how she has been so patient with me for this long. But now I am catching feels and it's nice, even though I am embarrassed about my lack of self-awareness, especially for a guy over 40.

I don't know how things will work out, but I feel like we might as well give it a shot, since we've become emotionally entangled already and I don't see how we could walk it back to a regular friendship. It feels strange to be starting a romantic relationship with a good friend: we already have our communication routines, so there is no anxiety that I associate with dating a new person. And for the first time ever, I don't feel afraid of losing the romantic connection unless I keep wowing her: it seems being myself and treating her well is good enough.
