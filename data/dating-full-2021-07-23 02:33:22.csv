There's so much I could say, but like the title says, dating makes me feel like a dancing circus monkey. I feel like I have to dance harder and flashier than the other dancing circus monkeys in order to get the attention of a lovely young lady to begin with. That alone usually feels too exhausting to keep putting the effort in.

But even if I decide to keep putting effort in to win fair lady's affections, it always, always, feels like I am one of many dancing monkeys trying to get her attention. And even if I do get her attention, it feels like it is just a matter of time before a different dancing circus monkey can do it better and gain and hold her attention better than I can.

This led me to pull the plug on social media and even when I'm shown interest from a woman, this feeling I'm describing takes up all my headspace and trying to return the interest just exhausts me so fast. It does not help that when I am shown interest, it is from women I really find unattractive for various reasons. I won't get into my personal tastes because everyone is different and I don't think what I find attractive/unattractive is anything strange.

I just don't understand the game I guess. Or I do understand it and am just not cut out to play. Those close to me tell me they think my experience with my ex and how that ended messed me up. I don't feel like I'm in a place to know. I just know dating feels like this competition to gain and hold attention, which is here today and gone tomorrow.

And for what it's worth, I have people tell me somewhat often than I'm a good looking guy. Stable job, student loans paid off, trying to work toward new car and a house. Well liked by those who know me, all that. I just feel like I don't have the energy to join the race to give the attention that a woman appears to need. I don't know if I've always been that way or if it's a recent development. But I've had relationships before and I do desire one.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hope you found something worth imprinting on to your brain.

TL;DR -  Giving the attention women I observe appear to need to desire a relationship saps my energy and I think leaves them feeling bored. Even if I'm shown interest, it feels like a guy who is perceived as better in some way will gain their attention and I'll be history.

The day i suggested didn't work for her but she asked me if there was a better day for next week. We settled on Wednesday. I think it'd a good thing she suggested an alternative day. 

We've been on 2 dates, both have been a lot of fun. We talked a few weeks ago and she told me she loves going on dates with me but doesn't want anything serious right now. I'm not ready to commit either but it's been a while since I've been on 3 dates with someone. I have another date with a girl tomorrow as well. 

I asked if she wanted to keep things casual and she said she ""really didn't know but wants to see me again"". I'm just trying to play it cool and not over step despite my mild infatuation. 

I've realized there's potential. Lately, it feels like I've been having to make the first move, but she's usually responsive and acts like nothings changed. Back when we first started talking it felt like she was making the first move more often. Idk if I am over analyzing that or what. 

We have our next date next Wednesday though. Evening picnic in a park. Gonna bring snacks a Bluetooth speaker and a nice blanket for us. I was torn as to if she would accept but she did. I want this to go well and for a to get closer. Does anybody have some ideas?

Hey fellas. I have a story I could talk about all day but I’ll try to keep it short. Basically, within the past month, I lost my girlfriend of 9 years and my two best friends who I considered brothers. Towards the end of our relationship, she said that she didn’t see a future with us and wanted to part ways. Things ended amicably. It seemed like we were two people who loved each other but just didn’t have the same future in mind. We share(d) all of the same friends, and didn’t want things to be awkward when we saw each other at the local watering hole every weekend. So weeks passed, and I missed her, but I knew it was the right decision for the both of us.

Fast forward to a particular Saturday night, where I was with the two aforementioned brothers at the local bar, and she showed up with two girls who we’ve all been friends with for years. At this point we hadn’t spoken in over a week, and I had been doing my best to move on. I was feeling myself that night, so I was chatting it up with different ladies, and generally just being a social butterfly. ‘‘Twas riding a high I hadn’t felt in a while. I’m sure the adderall I took had nothing to do with it. Anyways, my ex calls me around 1 am asking to talk in private. I meet her, and she starts crying, telling me how she hates seeing me talk to other people, and how she misses the comfort of being with me. I could tell she was extremely drunk at this point, and her place isn’t far from the bar, so I tell her that I’ll walk her home and that we can talk more on the way. Little did I know these were my last sweet, naive moments I’d ever have with her. We made out ( I was very drunk too, don’t judge me), laughed, and talked about old times as we stumbled our way back to her place which was my old place. Just being with her and hearing her say these things made my heart swell with joy and love, something I hadn’t felt in what seemed like a lifetime. Time slowed down with every sentence she said to me, and all I wanted was to live in this moment forever. Even though she was so drunk that I had to piggyback her home, it felt like what she was saying was coming from a very real place of love. But that’s the thing about sociopaths, they manipulate your feelings to elicit a response out of you that makes them feel validated about themselves and their lives. She needed to know that she still had me on a hook; that I hadn’t forgotten about her and moved on, and goddamn did she get me. 

So we finally make it back, and she immediately passes out. No problem I think to myself, I’m just happy for the time we spent together. But the darkness begins to settle in, and I can’t help but wonder what she’s been up to. For a while, I had gotten a weird feeling between her and my best friend, but had shrugged it off as me being a paranoid lunatic. There’s no way that she would do that to me, and there’s no way that he would do that to me. But me, being an opportunist, saw this as the perfect opportunity to either confirm or deny my suspicions that had been haunting me for months. Once I saw, I could either move on and realize that I indeed was being crazy, or confirm that my gut feeling was right all along. It’s not my proudest moment, but I looked through her phone. And holy motherfuck, was my gut absolutely right. Between her and my “brother” (let’s call him fuckface mcsnake) were endless texts and nudes sent back and forth that went back to when we were still actually dating. Saying things like “I’ve wanted this for so long” and taking about how he had just got done hanging out with me and was trying to come over to meet her. It was especially shocking because I had brought these suspicions up before, and she convincingly quelled them, telling me that she doesn’t see fuckface mcsnake like that, and that he’s like a gay best friend to her. She pulled me back in because she “missed me” while all along was fucking my best friend who I had known since elementary school. 

Upon confirming my suspicions that had been eating me alive for months, I woke her up, and basically blacked out with rage. I don’t remember much of what I did (I didn’t physically harm her, don’t worry, I’m still the good guy here) but when the dust was settled, her phone, a tv, and other random items were broken and shattered. The house was a mess. Even as I confronted her with the evidence, she still wouldn’t admit to what she had been doing. Never once did I see remorse in her eyes, and she didn’t even tell me that she was sorry. Like sociopaths do, she tried to put the blame on me, and told me all of the things I had done wrong to make her do this to me. I stormed out of the house, and furiously walked towards fuckface mcsnakes house to confront him, ready to go to prison for life. I had decided that tonight would be my last night as a free man, and made peace with it. Luckily, he wasn’t there. Here’s where losing “brother” #2 comes in. I had called him on the way there, and told him I need to talk to him. As soon as I was about to tell him what I had found out, I could tell in his voice that he already knew what I was about to say. I don’t remember what I said to him, but it probably wasn’t legal. This was a guy who I thought was the realest person I knew, a guy that would have my back no matter what. A guy I would’ve helped bury a body for, was the same guy telling me he had known all along, kept it a secret from me, and sided with fuckface mcsnake and continued to be his friend throughout all of this. 

At this point I realized I had lost not only a girl who I thought was the love of my life, but my only two friends. Completely defeated, I walked 5 miles home, and haven’t spoken to any of them since. I’m leaving out many details, but fuckface mcsnake blocked my phone number, and has been hiding from me ever since. My ex told me that if I show up at either of their houses, she’ll call the cops on me and have me arrested. I didn’t even get to beat his ass, and if I do, I’ll be facing a prison sentence. 

So, friendless and unable to get closure, I’ve been doing my best to move on from the situation and completely rebuild a brand new life. Everyone I’ve ever known and loved besides my family is dead to me, but despite that my confidence and sense of self worth gets stronger every day. I decided that I won’t let this turn me into a bitter, hateful person, and it gets easier with each day that passes. I never thought I’d be the person to post this kind of shit on Reddit but here I am. I’m as single as I possibly could be, with nowhere to go but up. If you’ve made it this far I appreciate you hearing me out, and want anyone else who is in a dark place to know that things can always get better. Take care of yourself, be a good, real person, and one day if we’re lucky, we’ll find the people who are right for us. I spend my days working out, mapping out my plans for the future, and sitting at the bar alone hoping to find another lost but good soul to talk to. I’m tipsy but I hope that wasn’t too hard to follow. If you ever need someone to talk to hit me up, I’ve got plenty of time on my hands nowadays haha.

Would it be worse to skip the swimsuit photos altogether and just have alternative photos, or are “body” pics a good idea?

I would say I'm this way for a few reasons.

1) Social Anxiety. Being the kid that was picked on, and made fun of by both guys and girls has definitely left a dent. It ranged from being made fun of, being ostracized, even flat out racism. It made me retreat from other people. My anxiety has definitely varied in severity over the years, but even now I always feel the need to be on the defensive, that everyone is just waiting for the opportunity to degrade me again, even if it's not true. It just seems too dangerous to talk to new people.

2) Physical insecurity. Biggest issue being my height at 5'3. Now I know it's not impossible, but it seems like the odds are so stacked against me. I have no issue if a woman is shorter, my height, or taller than myself what so ever if that matters. Also to a lesser extent I'm kind of insecure about by nose, it's more of a prominent nose shape when seen in profile, I'm not sure if it detracts from my face.

3) Perhaps just a general lack of opportunity. I went to a local university for engineering so you can image the guy to girl ratio. While at school I commuted from home via public transit. I was frankly too anxious to learn to drive so that definitely held me back. In the past few months I've taken lessons to drive, and am just waiting for my road test. 

I still live at home with my parents, at my age I know that may not be seen as very good. My dad had a pretty bad heart attack which left him quite fragile and my mom is dealing with the onset of arthritis, so a lot of the household chores are left to me, which I don't mind at all, keeping things clean is the default to me. 

Good news though is I did manage to land a really good full time engineering job, so I'm starting to save money. Every month I contribute to the household financially. I'm saving up for a car as well.

So about a month ago, I went to a party. Had a fun time and drank a lot. On the way home, my drunk ass decided to FaceTime one of my friends (a girl) and ask the friend she was with on a hangout (not really a date). I think I just wanted to get to know her. So I took her to chipotle because I’m a broke teen and felt it was comfortable for both me and her. I felt like we connected, but I didn’t really feel any romantic tension or anything like that. After our “meetup,” she started asking to hang out a lot more so I had a feeling that she likes me. The day after, me and her and the friend that I FaceTimed that night, got breakfast. We all talked and had a pretty good time. That night we got into a deep conversation about relationships and I caught feelings. The following week or so she kept on asking to hang out and I think it is because I told her I will be going on vacation to NY from where we lived, Florida. Unfortunately I couldn’t because I was extremely busy with finishing coding an app that I needed to get over with. When I got to NY, we instantly started FaceTiming at night and snapping her every day for about a month or a little more.  During our conversation, I found out that she will be taking a 9 day vacation to NY and I’ll see her. A couple days before she left, she became a little more dryer but we still FaceTimed every night. I just assumed it was because she was busy since she had 2 jobs for this summer. On the day she came we finally had our long awaited “date” for that day. She was running on 2 hours of sleep and a long flight, but we still hung out with each other. We went to the city got touchy feely but nothing sexual and watched the sun set with the view of the entire city on the coast of Brooklyn. We had our masks on the entire time, but for a couple minutes she took her mask off and grabbed my arm. I knew in my head that it was a perfect time to go in for a kiss, but my ass started to overthink and missed the moment. I also didn’t have my first kiss yet so I was scared shitless. She put on her mask and she made us leave. On the subways back I felt like she became more distant and I wasn’t sure why. But when we finally got to where she was staying (the girl that I was FaceTiming when I was drunk), I found out that she was holding in her pee for like half the day. So I kinda subconsciously pushed the thought of me fucking it up away. 

Ok at this point I’m realizing that it’s confusing because of the referencing of people so to clarify, the girl I’m talking to or dating is Rgirl and her friend that she is staying with and was the one I drunk FaceTimed is Agirl. So back to story time.

Agirl made a complete schedule for what we are doing everyday until Rgirl leaves and the most time I had with her alone would be yesterday. Today was Agirls turn with Rgirl. I hung out with my cousin that I haven’t seen in a while and Rgirl was with Agirl and her guy cousin. Idk why but I feel jealous of the cousin for some reason and I kept overthinking things again. So I decided to snap Rgirl for a bit, I was giving lengthy Q and As while hers were 1 or 2 word responses. I tried FaceTiming her when I thought that the cousin left but it didn’t last very long and ended with her telling me that she will call me back after a shower. Also she never did. I can’t tell if I’m overthinking it or just acting insecure. 

Also, Rgirl is going to the same college with me in Florida while Agirl will go here in upstate NY so technically this week will be Agirls last time with Rgirl. In addition, she is going to an Airbnb with 4 other girls and 4 other guys and I didn’t really feel jealous probably because I met all of them already. My jealously didn’t really reveal itself until she showed me how many guys hit on her but this was towards when she was about to leave for NY.

She's pretty attractive for her age. Ing story short, she came back into my work, gave someone my number to text her, and I did. One conversation led to another and she invited me over to hook up, saying her house would be empty for the night.   


So I get there and I come in and we sit on the couch and talk for a bit, everything seems normal enough. Then I start noticing her slurring her words a bit... she's clearly drunk. Thats unattractive enough, but not a deal breaker.  She insists we go to the bedroom and she leads me down the hall. I notice the room looks a bit... off. She says it's her DAUGHTER'S room. Immediately I'm thinking ""what the heck... why are we in here"". her daughter is 25 but still, why the heck would you want to have sex in your daughter's bed... like WHY???  


 she then takes me back into the hallway and asks me if I want to meet her son. Again, I'm like WHAT and I start panicking. She opens the door and she has a FREAKING SON playing video games on his couch in his room. I'm guessing he's about 18 or 19. At that point I feel awkward as hell and TOTALLY sorry for the kid. I almost wanted to ask him wtf is wrong with his mom but I wanted to get out of the room asap.   


She then brings me back to her daughter's room and tells me to ""get comfortable"" while she goes in the bathroom for a bit. I take my jacket off and am pacing back and forth thinking ""ok theres no way im doing this with her drunk in her daughter's bed with her poor son in the next room"". I then grab my jacket, quickly grab my wallet and Keyes and haul ass out of her driveway. She texts me 10 minutes later asking what was wrong, to which I basically said ""THAT WAS WEIRD"". she played dumb like I was totally over reacting. YEAH RIGHT.

It started about 2 months ago. She was with a guy at the time, I knew this, and we met as she lived in the nearby home. She finally said hello as I left my house, and wondered if I'd like to spend time with her after talking a bit, I said yes. Well anyway, she makes a move on me and kisses me, and instantly I was hooked because I thought she was gorgeous - just attraction at this point. She tells me she will leave her current boyfriend, talked badly about him, and then ultimately left him whilst she was still flirting with me. (First red flag I dismissed due to infatuation, she was dishonest to her ex and I was also a dick for allowing it to continue)

Anyway, she left him and it became a little messy. She would often talk badly of him when with me, but then after express how much she was attracted to me and how she wants to build something stronger, I went ahead with it even though my gut told me it was probably a bad move, I was just sick of being lonely and I liked her and the affection I badly missed.

Fast forward 2 months I notice she pulls away a bit, which started to hurt me a little because she literally would express her admiration and future with me, and then she started seeming not as interested even though we'd spend time together. Anyway last night, she starts arguing at me because I was honest and said I don't think she has been thinking things over properly.

She starts shouting at me and it clicked in my head that she doesn't care about me, she just wanted to use me as a rebound. I lost my shit, and shouted ""You don't care about anyone but yourself. You didn't care about your ex when you were cheating with me, and you just wanted to string me along and you were never serious!"" I mean I was furious and raised my voice and told her to F off, in the heat of the moment. Eventually it cooled down, she then said sorry for hurting me and apparently the reason she was acting off and not interested is due to the fact I said she was too much a few weeks back, but what I meant was the situation was too much and not her, she took it personally. But since I said that I noticed her interest plummeted.

She said I scared her and she doens't like aggressive guys, and I feel terrible as since this I've been nothing but nice, and I was totally in the wrong, but she said she still would like to see me and she understood why I was angry as I was hurt.

It may be obvious but do I just walk away? I'm ashamed for getting angry, but I felt used and betrayed because she really made me feel special for a while, and again said how into me she was for her to then just act cold and talk to me badly.

Where your mind is blank and yet filled with the memories of the past. Maybe it would have been better if everything was a dream so that you won't feel this, this emptiness in your life which you know you shouldn't have. You know it was temporary yet you always hoped. The smile you smiled those days was from your eyes, the laugh you laughed that day was from your heart and the things you spoke were never doubted by you. Or them. You didn't speak with a boulder on your chest or with second thoughts of what they'll think, you spoke like yourself. And maybe that's why it stings like a bee, they loved you when you were you. How can you feel heartbroken from something that should have been a normal goodbye? How did you miss it when you are finally home? How is home a place which feels more distant than that memory?

Maybe you can convince yourself that it was a dream. Maybe then you can feel what you always had before this. The time was constant but it moved so fast that you forgot to tattoo it in your brain. Maybe if it didn't touch you in your heart, you could have written about it now to remember it, but you write about it because you cannot bear the weight on yourself. If it was a dream, you would never know what it felt like, and maybe that could have been so much better.

My sister helped to convince me to get on it after I’ve been single for over 3 years. 

Last night, I deleted hinge, tinder and bumble. Im still single and not doing it because of a terrible event. Don’t get me wrong though, I had some bad experiences from meeting people on these apps but I also had many more good experiences. 

What concluded to me deleting these apps was that I just can’t form a connection through a screen. Yes a hook up comes easier and faster than your asos order, but forming a connection? 

I’m talking to multiple guys, different apps, going on various dates but I always feel that there’s something missing. 

I’m an introverted extrovert and not only I’m happy alone, like my own company to the point I don’t get effected much without human contact for days but once you get to know me and I become comfortable I am so open! So when meeting new people I can easily shy away from conversation and will usually hide beside an extroverted friend. 

But here’s the fun thing, thanks to apps I can talk to guys, I’ve grown my confidence in my texting game. But mostly, my texting game. Starting to talk to someone through an app is easier than an actual person. I’ve always wanted to be able to and confident enough to talk to guys in real life. Whether it is in a coffee shop, library, bar, groceries store etc… with some personal events in my recent life and this feeling within me wanting to learn and put myself out there I decided to delete them.

Had a few first dates, seem to be doing pretty well on OLD, and recently found someone who I click with a lot. She seems to have the same values that I do, she is kind and emphatic, she’s gorgeous, we have a ton of similar interests and our physical chemistry while a little awkward at first just keeps getting better (no sex yet but some fun PG/PG-13 moments).

So it all seems great, she is very understanding of my situation (in the middle of contentious divorce) and on paper she seems the opposite of my STBXW. My ex and I had nothing in common, from interests to core values. My ex was a narcissist who did all of the classic things such as love bombing, isolating etc etc. this new person I suspect may be a narcissist as well as she shares some of the traits my ex did:

- Love bombing: she tells me she “rarely feels a connection like this with other dates” and does not let many other people touch her (I kissed her on our first two dates and she pulled away, due to abusive past relationships I think she was a bit scared to kiss), however on our third date she told me she was attracted to me emotionally, intelligently, and physically and how important that is after a string of bad luck dating, and then we made out like horny teenagers 

- not respecting boundaries: she asked me to hold of f on overtly physical contact until she was ready to which I obliged (not a problem at all in my book). However, after our second date I told her I don’t think we should keep seeing each other due to me still working through the emotional trauma of my divorce. She asked if she had done anything wrong and said she was surprised because how well we clicked. I tried to tell her I just cannot do this mentally right now and she asked if we could take things slow or be friends, I agreed to take it slow but I have this nagging feeling she convinced me to do something against my wishes.

- questionable personal life: I’ll keep this short, but between a terrible string of exes, numerous falling outs with close friends, and constantly changing jobs and not taking responsibility, my alarms are going off.

She is kind and sweet, patient with me and my situation, shares many values and interests, and works with kids. But I see a ton of similarities with my ex (particularly personal/professional life).

We talked for a week or so, and then we went on a double ""date"". 

I'm gonna be straight up it was my fault it went poorly. But heres my defense, it was my first time actually hanging out with a girl and I did not know how to act. I am very introverted and almost anti-social, cold, hard to reach etc. But my lack of social awareness was still suprising (this happened like 8 months ago). I realized there was some words you probably shouldn't say around different groups since you're not with your friends. 

Also more on my brother and his girlfriend. I suspected something to have been wrong with her , there was just something off about her. So accordingly I acted stand offish, because at the time I wasn't very confrontational. This put me in a spot where I wasn't in the moment and wasn't really paying too much attention to the girl I was trying to get with. This happens for awhile then we sat down at the food court, we played a purity game (odd for the first date looking back on it). She asked me to go to the bathroom with her (I thought this was weird). She offered to buy me food and I decline (I made it very boring). 

Then we started talking about certain topics, then she asked if I knew where to get edibles. I was and still am very anti-recreational drugs, (personally feel like they ruin lives and lead to bad habits, I live in an area where people abuse them all the time) After this I just got up and left because I just wanted to go home lol. Made it very awkward. 

But more on why I acted, the way I did towards my brother's girlfriend. I felt like she takes advantages of him and his mental issues. I  didn't say anything to her about it during the date but my brother came up to me complaining how she makes him feel. This really turned me off from the date in general. 
After the date I shit talked it and everyone involved (immature I know) My brother snitched on me and declined anything was wrong with his relationship.  

Come to find out, he was in an abusive relationship and they recently broken up. 

I dunno how to end this, the girl I went on the date for apologized to me. She actually gave me so many chances but at the time I was too stupid and acted so. 

8 month later here I am still thinking about her, the date and everything that happened. Sorry if this post is all over the place.

I really need advice, I’m sorry if there’s any grammatical errors or confusion, I was anxious and tried to go through everything as much as I could.) :(

I and my boyfriend have been dating for nearly 2 years, we dated for 6 months my freshman year and we were then broken up for 6 months, and then shortly got back together my sophomore year. Between that 6-month breakup gap, my ex best-friend had introduced me to a boy she knew who was a year older. He was extremely similar to me and by similar, I mean it felt like I was talking to a version of myself that was a step ahead of me when it came to figuring life out. 

He was just like me, he was sensitive like me, emotional, everything. The only real difference between us is that he had never been in a relationship. We were still pretty similar when it came to relationship issues though, the only boy I had ever dated was my current boyfriend so I was still pretty brand new for me, while my boyfriend had several relationships before dating me.

I instantly felt a connection with this boy, he was genuine and when I tell you I felt like I had met my person, it felt right. Everything felt right with him which is pretty strange since I didn’t have that instant connection with my current boyfriend. I opened up to him so quickly and so did he, I told him about my struggles and he made me feel safe and listened to me while I did the same. 

Although it was only a month in, everything felt like it was meant to happen, things were so peaceful. I don’t know how else to explain it, but he was a better version of me who was also still figuring the same things I was trying to figure out, it felt like we were a team. To make it clear, I and this boy did not have sex or do anything sexual, that’s another reason why I’m so confused about why I’m so attached to him. 

Things weren’t perfect either, we’d get frustrated but we never ignored each other, we’d talk about what we were worried about and how we should fix it. What lead to the end of our relationship was how busy I was, due to the extra stuff I had gotten assigned to at my new school, I was always doing work. He was very understanding about it but I have to admit, I didn’t make as much of an effort to see him as he did for me, I feel guilty for that. 

My and my current boyfriend have had a lot of problems but we’ve also had a lot of good times, there were some things that he did that made me feel extremely insecure like lying to me and other things, we do eventually talk about it out but it’s never the kind of talk where he listens to me, he’ll just tell me something quick to end the argument and that’s that. I don’t understand, am I supposed to be with the other guy? He’s tried reaching out to me multiple times and he’s told me he loves me and expresses the same feelings, but I never told him how I was feeling due to the respect I have for my boyfriend, I always made sure to just be formal. I have had these same feelings for him for the past few years, it’s so confusing because I’ve talked to other people longer than my ex and was never as in love or just attached.

TLDR; I (F17) still have feelings for a boy (M18) I dated for a month, I’m in a relationship right now and I’ve known him way longer, but I’ve noticed that there were healthier aspects and experiences I had with the boy I dated for a month.

Hi this is a throwaway account as I don’t like to be a downer on my main.

I’m not an above average guy in really any way. I don’t have a great face; in fact I plan to get plastic surgery sometime in the future, I’m only about 5’9, I’m in college and I don’t really have a job as I have a pretty heavy course, but I get a stipend from the university. I live at the gym and work out a lot but I’m still not in great shape. I’m just a normal guy. I don’t think Women my age want just a normal guy. They want the super attractive super popular guys and since things like tinder and bumble exist, I don’t think I can compete. I feel hopeless.

I’ve always wanted to get married and start my own family but I doubt that’ll happen. I’ve never had a girlfriend, I’ve never even gotten a girl to agree on a date with me.

I’m thinking I should just give up. I doubt I’ll find someone anytime soon and it feels like the rejection is just crushing. Too crushing to keep going on with. I feel so depressed. I can’t even make friends with girls and I don’t know why. I do everything everyone says to do. I join clubs, I go out, I try to meet new people and no girl will even be my friend.

I really cared for her very deeply, but I was so inexperienced and was working through a huge number of issues, particularly around physical intimacy - I didn't tell her about either of these things and I think it ended up pushing her away. I really regret how passive and avoidant I was.

She ended things with me in May. She said she felt really confused and had feelings for me but just wasn't in a place for non-platonic relationships, 'with anyone', at that time. She said she really wanted to stay friends. I asked for some space so I could reframe the dynamic as friends, and she obliged. We didn't speak much after that.

A few weeks ago, though, she called me very randomly and said she was feeling incredibly vulnerable and in a place of mental distress, and needed to talk to someone about it. I was there for her, happily, and it felt really good to be able to help her. Since then, I have found that she keeps popping up, finding excuses to text, asking to make plans (I've been very busy and so haven't been able to see her). I don't know if this is her just wanting a friend or angling for some sort of romantic reconciliation.

I have my place entirely to myself tomorrow night, and am at a loose end. I was thinking of inviting her around for dinner, and assessing what the vibe is, and maybe attempting to reinitiate something. Even if nothing happens, I'd still like the opportunity to be able to talk to her in an intimate and familiar setting about what was going on with me through the time we were dating.

I'm slightly worried this would be too 'forward', and that initiating anything might be a betrayal of our agreement to be friends. I also wonder if this is just my passive side coming through again, and disregarding my own agency in relationships (which I often do). Do people have thoughts on this? I'd love to hear them.

SO there is a girl I am talking to for a long time.

We have been meeting in school and talking a lot thought snapchat we also had like 10 hours video calls.

But when I asked her if she would go outside with me she said she would and then cancelled. It is been repeating for some quite time.

So I´ve distanced myself little bit cuz I focused about myself improving my mind and my body.

After few weeks she told me I don´t give her attention I used to give her. She started complaining I don´t care about her and things like that. So I said to myself: I will give it a try. When I asked her if she would go out with me and do something fun. She told me: I would love to. So when I asked her out on proper day with proper plans I made (didn´t tell her what was the plan). She told me: She is going to visit her cousin. When I asked: when? she didn´t respond on it. Since I was sick of it all. I texted her one day really long text about things and in the end I asked if she likes me cuz I like her. At first she responed: I.. I don´t know what to say.

They don’t know I still see him because when they do they look at me in a weird way and I can feel the dislike and disappointment. 

Anyways, I had my brother and his ex fiancé and cousin over because she’s moving in with me from my brothers. None of them really know I’m still seeing him and my brother has a hard time controlling his temper and mouth. My guy came over unannounced, I choked and ignored him. I said I didn’t know who was at my door and ignored his calls because he was blowing up my phone. He then messaged my brothers ex fiancé about where I am. I texted him saying I have my family over and he said I had a guy over and he heard them. I told him that’s right my brother is here and he says he doesn’t know if he believes me because he only heard my voice and my brothers.

So he left for Texas for the next few days and has been texting me. I’m not sure how to prove to him I wasn’t is that really possible? I understand how he’s feeling and I can see where he got the idea but it’s not the case. He told me he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he got back too.. 

I tried to explain it to him that my family doesn’t agree with me seeing him (he was already aware) and that they didn’t know I was still seeing him. I was hoping he’d understand because he has hidden me from his family and friends this whole time. Once even throwing a jacket over the car window before he went into the house. He also pretended he didn’t know me when I called him until he got away from his family . This was current all the way up until this point and now has changed since he believes I’m cheating. Now he doesn’t care what they think and if they see me with him. Which in a way hurts a lot because I’ve been upset by being hidden from his family who already knows me. But I understood because he wanted to be private about his life he said.

I just don’t know what to do, we put so much work in together for each other. I’ve put aside so many things for him that made me believe he was cheating and had to put all of my trust in him. Despite situations being really unclear I still went with his word it was enough. Things were going so well the last few months now we are here.

I don’t know how to get him to trust me. I don’t know what to do. I’ve explained how much I love him and it would be a waste to cheat. I’ve been waiting by for him to be mine and that wasn’t enough.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,914602,public,self,My guy believes I’m cheating on him.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oq52j6/my_guy_believes_im_cheating_on_him/,all_ads,6,,

I was very pleased and said yes, because I was thinking about inviting her somewhere, so this was a great occasion to fulfill it, I think that we both feel that we want to meet each other. Date was very interesting to me, we talked a lot, she was also happy, she said that we should meet each other more often. One day after first date I asked her out and we met the next day. Everything was also fine, I was trying to invite her for a small trip to the another town and she said “why not”. Everything seems fine , however I have a question about the fact that we are having a great conversation in real life , but we rarely talk via Messenger. I mean real connection is great but conversation after dates is rather dead. She told me that she doesn’t like to talk via web and I shouldn’t be worried about that, since we are adults and we don’t have that much time to click on our phones and talk about nothing. Despite this I am thinking if I should write to her and ask “how is it going” or rather chill and text her after day or two. What’s more, I think how we should develop our relation, I mean how fast we should shorten the distance etc.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,914607,public,self,How to maintain connection without being insistent,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oq57l2/how_to_maintain_connection_without_being_insistent/,all_ads,6,,
