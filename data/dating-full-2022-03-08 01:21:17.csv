He’s 34 he works all the time which I completely understand. After I messed up and couldn’t meet him but texted him late and we were supposed to meet but he never told me a place he got mad at me. So I texted him because I feel like we’re both a little needy in that aspect and we don’t care about texting multiple times when we’re annoyed or whatever. 

And honestly really talked for like two weeks. But today I was apologizing because of not seeing him yesterday and he says no he’s over it because I am playing him. Which I didn’t think I was but I did apologize admit that I was wrong and so he said “be honest, what are you looking to do. I’m not looking for anything serious. I want someone to date, kiss, enjoy time, and good sex”. I told him I’ve never had sex. He said he hasn’t been with anyone who hasn’t and sex is important. He said it could never be something serious because that’s just how he is.

So I say that’s ok because I want someone who wants me and cares about me. We went back and forth which made me think he wanted me. I brought up I would need to be exclusively having sex with you and you only having sex with me. He agreed. But I don’t think I have that detachment style down that some girls have that I think is necessary for this setup. 

I was like what’s in it for me? He said he wants passion but like no emotions bc it can’t go further than what it is. Anyway, we end it with me saying “nah I’d be heartbroken when you leave me. I need someone who cares about me and not just having sex with me.” And he finally gives up and says, “that’s fine. Good luck.” I said good luck before but then he kept talking. 

Anyway… I have in my freaking bio I don’t want anything serious but I don’t want hookups. I feel like guys keep matching with me with the chance of hooking up with me. I just desperately want something real if I get into anything. It doesn’t have to last forever but I want something where we both choose each other and want to be together. Maybe I should market myself as wanting a relationship? 

Just frustrated because we talked on the phone a couple of times and I thought he was cute. But fuck me yet again because another guy wants nothing more than my body.

I understand that it’s a super well-meaning question. It just seems low-effort and it puts pressure on me to come up with something interesting to say (my life is good but I usually don’t have anything noteworthy to share after a weekday). 

I usually send a photo of something cool I’ve seen, or something fun that happened whenever something does come up. I find that it adds value to the conversation, tells the person about me, and also lets the other person know I’m thinking of them /putting thought into my message. You could mass text “hey how was your day?” but it’s hard to mass text an inside joke.

Is it reasonable to ask someone new to volunteer something fun about their day instead of asking “how was your day?” every day so I have something to respond to? It just feels like everyone asks “how was your day” and I could essentially copy paste my response across different days and different dates. I want to meet someone special, but I’m also on the introverted side and find vague open questions draining. I know I’m lucky that anyone is asking about my day.

I asked her out again, she was out of town and told me that we should catch up when she got back, fine I assumed there was an interest. So I asked her out a third time, she said she was busy again. Frankly, I should just not have asked her out again, not after the first time. Not my first rodeo, and I should have just moved on long ago. 

To start, I'm a liberally minded, tattooed loud mouth, atheist that likes to drink.  She's religious (not overly so), conservative,  traditionalist, way too into high society and overly concerned with her appearance. 

I didn't really care too much about those things, because we related a lot. She's an overachiever, so am I, she's likes to lead, so do I. She's a strong person that does everything possible to succeed, so do I. She comes from a high society family, so do I. 

But then I asked her what she thought of trans people in her home country, she said a lot of them were just looking for attention. Another friend of mine was also talking about a friend of ours who is nonbinary, apparently she seemed disgusted with them. If that is not enough, then at some point an American friend of mine was talking about how even if I am Latino, I just pass off as another white guy and that people generally don't give too much notice to me because of that. Apparently, she (Middle Eastern) didn't like this, and proceeded to tell me that I'm not white and that I'm Mexican (I'm not even from Mexico). She was very serious about it too., 

Anyway, it's clear that even had something started between us, I would have stepped in some conservative landmine that would have undoubtedly ended anything. Clearly, she also had an axe to grind with this white thing. 

The thing is, that I knew she was somewhat conservative, but I never expected this. She seemed charming, open and like she was a very nice person. I certainly never expected her to tell me that I'm not white. At first, I didn't think much of that, but there was this nagging thought in my head that kept coming up about and I think there's something wrong with her to say that, especially how she said which was almost as if she was lashing out at me because my American friend called me white. 

I guess I'm dumbfounded, shocked and confused. This would have never worked out, like ever, not in a million years. It's as I said, it was a matter of time until she blurted out one of these beliefs, and it exploded in my face. Still, I kind of feel disappointed that she rejected me this last time when I asked her out.

I've been dating him for over a year now and it's been amazing, obviously some bumps here and there, but he's a great guy. I'm on my university's cheer team and he plays for our basketball team. Yesterday we were out on a date at a cafe and he went to the bathroom. Curiosity got the better of me and I ended up looking at messages on his phone. To my shock - I found one of his teammates send a video of a drunk girl being assaulted in their group chat. Several players surrounding her. The absolute gut-punch is that I recognize her from campus, we've passed each other before.

Disgusted and broken I confronted my bf in the moment. He was FURIOUS that I looked through his phone, but was adamant that he **doesn't** know the girl and **wasn't** at the party. I noticed that that the message was about a week old, so I asked him on whether he confronted his teammates and he said no. My gut was already a hurricane, but hearing that truly broke me - my heart aching for the girl on campus not knowing what these players did to her. I told him that he needs to report this, but he's afraid that the players will turn on him, he'll have to drop off the team and lose scholarship. I told him that if he doesn't I will leave him and go to our equity office -pushing for an investigation. We left the shop both emotionally drained and frustrated, ended our date early.

about a month later, i went through a fairly traumatic rejection as well (was love bombed by a narcissist and then brutally rejected and humiliated in front of a lot of people). this is no excuse for my actions, but context still feels worth noting: i was at a personal low and have never felt so bad about myself / felt so alone as i did in the following weeks. 

i had started to notice that our friend, who my friend had liked, was starting to demonstrate feelings for me. he was far kinder and sweeter than any guy i’d ever really looked at in a romantic way. it was hard to resist the comfort of his presence, and it didn’t help that he actually moved into our house for the remainder of the first COVID summer (so would be one of the people i spent time with for the next 3 months).

i started developing feelings for him, and my friend had started getting over i her rejection, so she said. i knew it’d be wrong for me to start anything with him, so i kept him at an arms length for a few weeks and told myself i would never need to tell her because nothing would happen. please also note that this was a few weeks in the beginning of covid, so it felt like months. 

as time passed and we spent more time together, it became increasingly difficult to keep the distance. nothing happened in that time frame, but my friendship with him grew closer and his demonstrations of interest became harder to ignore. my anxiety reached new heights, as i knew i wouldn’t be leaving this living situation anytime soon. i even discussed the stress with friends and family, but also continued to insist that i had it under control. 

after a few drinks and a sort of emotional evening (unrelated to this situation), i found myself in a position where we were alone together and i was comforting him. as you’d expect, one thing led to another and we woke up in my bed together the next morning.

after about an hour of panicking, i told her everything and apologized. she was devastated, and revealed to me that she loved him and had been trying to hide it from herself and from others. she asked if we had feelings for each other and i told her it felt like we did.

over the next couple of days, i grappled with guilt and denial, and she grew angrier. i told her she was holding me accountable for information i didn’t know, and she told me we could no longer be friends if my relationship with him continued.

eventually, i apologized for my denial and took full accountability and she told me that she needed time but wouldn’t stand between us. 

he has now been my boyfriend for nearly years, and i love him very much. he’s taught me what treatment i deserve, and i’ve never been happier than i have been since we started dating. 

she is also still my best friend—we spent a lot of time working on healing our friendship. of course, things will never be entirely the same and she’s still reminded of my mistake as i am still haunted by the guilt. 

this imbalance has also created a strange power dynamic between us. i’ve spent the last couple years extremely conscious of my behavior around her, so that i don’t hurt her feelings again. at times when she is insecure, it’s clear that i am a trigger for her and she often takes her insecurity out on me. i wouldn’t accept this behavior from another friend, but seeing that i likely created this insecurity, i have opted to let it slide. 

that said, i don’t know how much longer i should let it slide (if ever) and i don’t know how much longer it should take for me to forgive myself (if ever). 

i’m not asking for forgiveness, but i don’t really think i should let this bother me forever, and there’s no rule book on how long it should take before the perpetrator moves on.

At no point did I intend to. I've been joking with my friends that once I hit a year, it's like your virginity resets, and it's so liberating to have gone this long and not have to deal with the BS of it all. To be honest, though, I think I feel awful about it, but I'm not really sure at this point. 
I've been, in some form or another, sexually active since I was 12, whether I was entirely aware of it or not. That's just shy of half of my fucking life of being mostly used by people. The last person I slept with was my ex of 3 years. The later half of that relationship was incredibly one-sided and survived mostly on SA. Last year, when I, for some reason, slept with him again, he was at that point married with a fucking baby on the way. He was, and still is a piece of shit. And that's the last person I've slept with in a year, which still kind of disgusts me. I'm not afraid to admit I fucked up there, and that sent me into a mild spiral after the fact, but I worked it out and tried to get back out there.
The issue at this point is that I don't want to just fuck someone. I've done that for too long. I just crave some type of emotional and physical intimacy, beyond the one night stand/friends with benefits culture that seems to be the norm now. I've tried dating apps on and off, and about 90% of the people on there are looking for a quick lay, while the other 10% is either socially inept or end up ghosting you. I try to set up dates within a week of soarking up converation with someone, but lif eand work make it difficult. The dating scene has become so fucking exhausting that I have no idea what to do at this point. I go out on a semi regular basis and pretty easily make friends, but aside from making new friends, I've had little luck there. My mutual friends have been an absolute bust as well.

A bit of a back story we originally met through my mother because she goes into the cosmetology school to get her nails and hair done. My mother and this girl’s coworkers ended up playing match maker and we have been talking for 5-6 weeks. 

We hadn’t met until because of schedules didn’t line up and she worked til late at night. We originally planned a date for the day after Valentine’s day because she had the day off. She ended up having to cancel because she had to go the hospital for reason I don’t want to specify. She said that she felt bad for canceling, but definitly wants to reschedule. We continued to talk fairly regularly. We finally came to a day that works which was this past Saturday. We also both agreed mexican would be good. We both had talked about margaritas and laughed at how I had never had one. We both decided to order a margarita and we both got carded because we both look young. Obviously my card passed, but her card didn’t because her card had expired so they refused to serve her a drink. Her and I both had a pretty good laugh at this. I did tease her a few times on this to try to ease the nervous tension. Through out the night we talked and learned more about each other and laughed a lot more. Over the whole night I had her laughing ton.

Eventually the bill came and before I could even think about she snagged up the bill and told me she was going to pay for dinner. Me being absolutely surprised by this, asked if she was sure and I said its a bit unconventional and was delighted by her offer, but I offered to pay. She said she really wanted to do this and gave me a bit of a smirk. Her and I went up to pay and left. I walked her to her car and continued the chit chat. She told me about her car and how she hit a deer a while back. We talked for a bit in the parking lot. 

I asked her if she wanted to go get a drink at a local bar that she told me about that she got drinks at with some of her friends a few night ago. She said she didn’t care where what place we went, but she was a bit tired since she had worked from 8am-8pm and she had to do it again tomorrow (by this time it is already 10:30). I told her I completely understand and she suggested that we should call it a night. I said I agree since it was getting late. After that she said she had fun and definitly wants to go out again sometime soon. I agree and she said she is a hugger and wants a hug before we part ways. I am not a hugger, but I went for the hug regardless. As she got into her car I asked if she could text me when she got home so I knew she got home safely and she asked the same of me.

Here is the part I’m confused on. She is a really slow texter. I don’t get text often but when I do she gives a lot into it and keeps it going. Also I tend to confuse myself. I was browsing reddit and a post popped up and it was about women buying the meal on the first date and most the women said that if they wanted to buy the meal they really didn’t like the guy that much which leaves me questioning myself. Also while my mother was getting her nails done she left to use the restroom; one of her coworkeers came by to tell my mother that she really likes me and doesn’t care if her bosses knew since it was a conflict of interest at work. I’m honestly just wondering if I messed things up by saying something dumb that turned her off.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163010,public,self,"I took this girl out on a date Saturday night, we had a good time and she also paid for dinner however I’m left a bit confused",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t98fzb/i_took_this_girl_out_on_a_date_saturday_night_we/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,,

There was a date a in the middle of that where I bought tickets to a concert and she flaked a few hours before (sign of what was to come I know, but looked past it and she gave me a reasonable excuse the next day).  After the fourth date it felt like she blew me off twice or I just wasn't a priority. Then she stopped responding to me after I sent two additional texts asking how she was doing and if she moved on, still no response. I ended up leaving a voicemail just saying I enjoyed our time together and about one thing she did  for me that meant a lot.

I remembered her birthday a few weeks after that and sent a happy birthday text, which she responded later with a thanks.

I peaked at her social media and based on her posts I'm pretty sure there was someone she was more interested at the time but he ended up ghosting her a week after she stopped talking to me.

It's been a couple more weeks now, a part of me feels I should leave it since she ghosted, but another part really wants to reach out just to see if she's interested in seeing each other again since I was falling so hard and I have nothing to lose.

Currently I'm in a relationship with a girl I live with but, our personalities don't quite click(she's bright, humorous and social i'm antisocial and an outsider) yet we still love each other so she says its ok if we do a poly thing as long as she's allowed to get another guy on the side so she isn't left out(she has no problem attracting other guys). Now, there is a girl that works at a gas station and she looks exactly like an ex of mine and she complemented my piercings and I awkwardly complemented her hair then immediately walked out.

Everytime I see her or even pass that gas station where she works at, my mind goes blank and I have to avoid looking in that direction when I'm with my current gf so she doesn't get uncomfortable. I can't even speak properly or make eye contact. So I want to ask her out I guess, but I'm not sure how to do it. I considered just passing her a note with my number next time i go to grab cigarettes that says something like ""Text me if you're single and want to hangout sometime"" but, maybe she will find that unattractive and possibly creepy if I don't have the ""balls"" to verbally invite her out. Beyond that, I'm not sure how I would balance her and my current gf. I'm not even sure if she'd be ok with poly or an open relationship, though I did just plan to hangout as friends. I'm also thinking I shouldn't bother because I'm not sure we would even have anything in common. I'm not sure she would even like me or find me attractive(I'm pretty boring and reclusive) and yet I probably shouldn't feel that way because I have seen fairly attractive girls dating not so attractive guys and yet I still feel like she wouldn't find me attractive. I also don't see a point because relationships never last long but also death would separate us so there is also that and I'm just one human out of billions so not really important. I would really just enjoy walking through or sitting in a cemetery or parking lot with her and smoking a cigarette

So yeah thoughts? Advice?

Probably doesn't help that I have never had friends or much of a social life due to a lack of having much in common with anyone. I have also never had luck with girls I actually find attractive or seemed to click well with. I've also never asked anyone out in person, only attempted online which only resulted in a few hook ups and then ghosting. I'm also black so I'm not sure there is a point since most girls only date black guys that have that thug or basketball persona and I'm basically introverted gothish. I don't even know what people find attractive since I haven't seen much consistency regarding beauty or dating standards.

So yeah I can't stop thinking about this girl to the point i can't concentrate on studying or enjoying myself but I'm not sure if I actually like her or just find her fleetingly attractive or not. And it seems intrusive and obnoxious to ask a girl out while she is working. Seems obnoxious to ask a girl out at all. But then again probably no point since we may not have anything in common and I can't logically think of a reason why she would find me attractive and even if she did, there would probably be no future since I'm not rich, have no degrees or a car or license yet still I see unattractive guys with no car, money or degrees and they still mange so then I shouldn't feel insecure. I'm unsure it would be nice to be friends just to spend time with her because, my god just seeing her feels like home or heaven on earth but also torture. But I don't even know how to make friends with her without seeming cringy or  creepyish....

And not a single feeling about her and better yet. We dont even spending time together is like very normal neighbors, a matter of fact we arent even classmates in school because we both have our different schools we normally go to. But what happens just  4 months ago when my father got a soup business we are litterally right next to a milktea stand that they sell some very sugary milkshakes added with tea in em. And the one who's selling it is my neighbour that im currently talking about. And my father said that i should help the soup business and thats what i did. I helped the soup business for a week. The first week of my father's soup business is going quite well and its doing great. And the second week started and it get weirder. Since im always at the soup business and im right next to my neighbour's milktea stand. She just randomly said to me that ""hey x i have a crush on you!"" Litterally in front of my face and i said that ""then what?"" (Because i dont really have the feelings for her and shes probably just joking around) she says ""nothing i just have a crush on you"" and the same day she said all of that, she doing some korean love signs in front of my freaking face which is getting weird and i dont really know all of that signs that she show in my face in the first place and she just said a love sign which i replied to ""you're weird you know?"" And i starting to ignore her to use my headphone. And she's trying to get my the attention she wants. Even im on a headphone although i still hear her calling my name while my headphones are on full blast volume and i keep ignoring her for the next 30 minutes or so and when she keeps calling. She finally get my attention that she wants for me and i said ""what do you really want from me"" and she just says ""nothing i just want to talk to you"" and yeah we did have a small conversation. She asked if i play some videogames that she probably played. Which is mostly of them i didnt play because im not interested in to some of her games she played in but she asked if i play call of duty which i reply is ""i used to and sometimes playing it"" and another very small conversation. And when the conversation ends, i just minded my own business and think that ""she can finally shut up because i give her the attetion she wants to"".. and days go by and she still trying to Fake flirting me which is getting out of hand but i still keep it quiet and already know she might fake flirting (or is it) and one day i became more open to her thinking that  ""she's probably just fake flirting me and yeah i just let myself go and be nice to her"" and showing some fake love signs that she always do when im there (but dont be fooled i dont have feelings for her)
And then near christmas maybe in december 20s i believe when .e and my fathers soup seller is cleaning up the stand after a long day of working. Before we leave my neighbour girl she said to me that ""Goodnight"" which is i simply reply ""Okay"" and leave to go home and sleep. And the 3rd week of helping the soup business, she always trying to give me to get her attention when im there, which is not suprising to me at all now. But i wont last long helping the soup business and help my father's girlfriend sell some bananas and im far away now from her milktea stand and im grateful because she wont bother me anymore because im away but the store we sell bananas dont have a bed so i regularly go though my house to sleep is where the same street that my neighbour is in a nearby house not far away from my home.. and she still fake flirting me when she see me and still to this day.. 

(Even today i still cant find the feelings for her) even though she trying so hard to penetrate her feelings through my heart which is didnt work. (I already got rejected 2 times and i wont fall for fake ass love she doing for me even though i dont have feelings for her)

About 180lbs to be precise. What people dont tell you is that while you change, people around you dont, and for me that affected how I viewed myself. Someone I had known for years, started to show interest in me. We went for drinks once, and it was a big old shit show. For starters, we went to a bar she knew her recent ex-bf was at to make him jealous. So immediately it was a bad situation to be in, and I wasn’t happy with her for putting me in that type of situation. It got a lot worse. To the point she started making overt comments about my weight, real nasty stuff like, “Do you have any loose skin?”. I dunno, Buffalo Bill, do I? I told her I was uncomfortable but she didn’t stop, she even started grabbing at my stomach in this weird groping / playful way. Eventually I had enough and drove her back to her work which happened to be another bar. One of my friends was there who I hadn’t seen in years. Like my best friend, I was best man at his wedding. So I stick around to catch up. Well, during this time, she gets mad at me because she over heard me say I didn’t like the music that was on. Apparently it was “her music” so she threw her phone at my head. When I wouldn’t give her phone back, she started grabbing me again, so I threw the phone across the room to get her off me. At that point, I had enough, said goodnight to my friend and left without saying goodbye to any one else. I genuinely tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was the alcohol talking or whatever, so i went back to the bar a few days later and tried to talk to her about it. She outright refused to acknowledge my concerns, saying I was being too sensitive, and even suggested I was being a bad friend because I didn’t say good bye. I brushed it off, but later in the night I got really upset about it and told her that I was dissolving the friendship and that I didn’t want to be around her anymore. I didn’t say it politely either. This was about a year ago, and still haven’t been back. During that time, I’ve found out that she’s been talking bad about me to anyone and everyone who would listen. I even had the pleasure of her friends contacting me on social media to threaten me if I didn’t apologize. So i cut ties with everyone. It really really really hurt. But the talking / insults didn’t stop. In fact, just recently I was talking with someone I really like, who works at a different bar. I know they dont really know each other that well, but they work in the same industry. That’s essentially to say that she “has heard some bad things about me”. To the point, I had asked her out, and she is genuinely interested in me, but is afraid I’m some wolf in sheeps clothing because my name has been drug through the mud so much. I can’t even ignore these people without them having this drastic impact on my life and building relationships with new people. What do I even do? For the life of me, I’m trying to move past this, and its had a drastic effect on my mental health, especially recently because of the issues its created in an entirely separate and potential relationship. I feel like I’m in between a rock and a hard place. I really want to try to make this new situation ship work, but I fear there’s little I can do to try and fix this. Why I even have to fix anything is beyond me.

Im in my early twenties so im young and that gives me time to not worry about it so much right now but damn. I’ve never dated someone primarily because I isolated myself from intimacy for most of my life bc of trauma but now I’m healed and I’m this wonderful person who has so much love to give and so much value. I want to fall in love one day but right now at this age talking to guys takes so much out of me and the failed talking stages etc are just so draining and disheartening. It’s only ever been me wanting to end things with a guy, but I just do not like these guys I am meeting enough to continue (or girls, I tried being with girls too and I think I am unfortunately straight). I’ve gotten so fucking great at being alone, I love myself and I love focusing on my own life and I genuinely never get bored because I have so many interests. So it’s not really something I feel will complete me or anything. However I do think it would be fun to find a partner I am really into, that’s just an area of life I haven’t experienced much and it seems so special. Has anyone felt out of place in their surroundings and out of place in their age group? If so, please leave dating advice! I do not want this to sound so egotistical but this is anonymous anyways I’d never say these things to anyone in real life,,, but I am not only extremely empathetic, self aware, intelligent, fun, and insightful but I take wonderful care of myself and I am extremely attractive as well. I don’t know, I feel like it’s gonna be hard for me to find someone that is compatible with me. I know there have to be great guys around my college but it’s just so hard to meet people nowadays and it’s just a southern school with lots of frat boys. I think with  older age dating may work better for me but I sometimes now feel like I’m missing out. I guess why I’m posting this is because I want to hear from the older more experienced in dating crowd about this, should I just enjoy this time with myself and let it come to me when it’s supposed to? Should I try to seek it out? Will dating ever get better? Am I missing out? Being alone feels so much easier, but I’ve avoided intimacy bc of fear for so long that I don’t know if continuing to do it will necessarily be helpful, and while I feel like I have healed enough to begin I know I have a lot to learn and explore in this area, which I want to do. However these boys I’m meeting feel immature, and I just can’t force it. Ok I can stop ranting now.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 4-5 months and it’s been going very well. We’re both divorced (pending) parents. She had been single for a year, I had been single for 3 years. It started out very slowly as we were both healing from emotional trauma from bad marriages. She was also not really sure what she was looking for as she had recently identified as bi, but had no female experiences ever and said she wanted to try dating women, and for that reason wasn’t ready for a commitment. This bummed me out and I expressed that, because I was looking for a serious relationship. A week after that conversation she told me she felt really sad after that and realized that she was falling for me pretty hard. I told her that I actually think I’m comfortable if she wanted to experiment with women while dating me, but that I wouldn’t be ok with other guys. She appreciated me saying that and we moved it on from that, both happy to continue seeing each other. Over the next month or two, we both fell hard for each other. We took our time as we navigated our feelings and past traumas and triggers and were only able to see each other once or twice a week due to conflicting parenting schedules. But over the last 5 months we have become best friends and each other’s safest place. We are both emotionally intelligent, and tell each other we love each other. It’s been really amazing and we’re both in awe of what a healthy relationship really is.

Fast forward to today:
I find out from my ex-wife, of all people, that my girlfriend has been active on dating apps in the last week.

This made me feel pretty shitty and I was worried she was seeing guys.  I confronted her about it, and she said that she had recently gone on two dates, each with a different woman. She said they were PG dates, and that she wanted to venture into the queer community and “exchange notes” with other queer women, and that’s all that happened. 

So a few things about this really bug me and I’m hoping for advice on. 

1. she didn’t tell me, and I had to find out through somebody else. Was she obligated to tell me, or no?
2. I feel like we “assumed” exclusivity from how close and open we’ve become, and the love we have for each other. Was that wrong of me to assume? Do I need to recalibrate my expectations of this relationship?
3. I know I told her I’m comfortable if she experiments with women while dating me, but now I’m not sure I am. Is it unfair of me to ask her to stop seeing women? It could end up an ultimatum scenario. 

She told me on the phone that she was so sorry. She was crying, and told me she hopes I know that her love for me is true. She said she intended to tell me on the weekend but that it didn’t feel like a good time (it was my birthday and we had a minor tiff), but she also said that she didn’t tell me because she didn’t think I’d want to know. And that was a really weird thing to hear. Like she just admitted she purposely hid it from me because she knew I wouldn’t like it.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Backstory\]**

We  meet in work and started to chat a lot and she doesn't avoid and honestly enjoys talking about sex related stuff, what we enjoy what are our  preferences.

First time we go hiking. She keeps her distance I am like ""Whatever this nature is beatifull."" Friends on a hike.

We  chat non-stop all days again, friends talk and sexs topics not avoided.  I am falling for her a bit from the neverending contact.

Second time we went for a walk around a city (bad weather for hike) she sent  mixed signals. And I didn't want to make move on someone who sees me as a friend. So at the end I just carefully and casually asked what is going  on. I didn't want to fall for a friend and if she sees me as a friend okay I enjoy time with her, let's be friends. And she started talking  about pros and cons of our possible relationship. We ended on friends maybe in future something more. I though okay friends it is.

We  chat more all day long. The chats are also about what we like in bed  and so on. She basically starts texting about something sexual every night becasue she finds it funny that ""I have trouble sleeping after our talks""

We go out third time. She invites me over for netflix afterwards. Bit confused with the shaded  lightning and she is sudenly touchy, getting her cats hair of me,  styling my hair cuz it looked weird. One of the mixed signals I saw on  second meetup was that she refused my hand to help her. I didn't know what to do. In confusion I just act like a good friend and go home after the netflix.

We chat, she sends me a nude in a weird context. Again sex topics very often. She sents me that she just masturbated for example.

We go out forth time. The plan is to go hiking on sunday and she suggest that I can come over the night before because her place is closer to the hiking destination. The day before comes and she is unsure if she can  invite me over because she is tired. I tell her it is alright I can be  at different places that night I will find myself a program (two friends each had a party meetup but I didn¨t tell her about that). Later at the end of the day she says ""So come over"". And I drive there in an hour.

We  talk a lot she takes a bath. We talk while she is taking a bath (I was  in different room). We get some snacks and watch a horor. She doesn't  hesitate to tell me that she took of her make up and put on her pyjamas  to make herself look worse so I don't get in the mood. I take it I  didn¨'t come over for sex or really anything (I hoped for second base max but would be happy with cuddling). At one point we sit shoulder to  shoulder holding and caressing our hands and we rest our heads againts each other. But she won't let me get into comfortable position to cuddle. I don't push it and I just enjoy what is happening. We wake up and she tells me that it is late and she definetly won't prepare the  couch for me. Lets get into her bed. We sleep nothing happens, I don't try anything. Next day she says her head hurts. And we take a lot of  time before we go for the hike. I repeatedly told her: ""It is really OK  If you don¨t want to go, we can just watch netflix or I can go. The  worst thing is to go hiking if we don't want to."" But we go hiking  anyway because I don't want to walk out on her. The hike is quite nice but nothing extra and at the end she is tired and her heads hurts. I  take her to her place.

We chat but sex topics are hard avoided. We chat less less and less to the point  when she answers me in three hours. And avoids going out in any way. Hikes or something else. And is trying to avoid me in work. I don't know  what I have done. Last time we went out was three weeks ago and then  the chat faded slowly to current state.

And he told me more about his life story: he’s been in relationship for 8.5 years and that after 5 years it got abusive. But more surprisingly, he said it was abusive coming from his ex. He said she could beat him. That it started with things he considered innocent like “slapping” on emotion. And then it turned into more with time.

Then he said it’s a lot about his culture, that it’s very often that you need to be with one person preferably and they had feelings so he hoped it coups be changed. So as he mentioned, he took this 4.5 years to heal and work on himself and now ready to date but he’s still taking it slow and physical intimacy is still a bit of an issue for him. We went out several times and he never ever tried doing anything physical together (except a hug). Once we went out and it was too far for me to go home (even on a taxi) and he never had tried anything either.

When we talk she gets extra close to me to the point where we are touching shoulders. We had a similar upbringing including losing our parents and being homeless at a young age. We also like disney movies and parks. I jokingly have suggested we get married because we get along so well and she went with it and brings it up from time to time asking where the wedding will be and who's coming etc. I mess with her sometimes and when her friends come in I ask if they're her boyfriends and she usually responds with something like ""no me and you are engaged"" Sometimes when we say goodbye she gives me abnormally long hugs with lines like ""what if i just never let go haha""

I compliment her in a genuine way often because she's super into fashion and great at putting outfits and hairstyles together. She seems to enjoy it but I dont think shes ever given me a compliment back or flat out said anything direct to me that could be conclusive evidence that she's ACTUALLY into me beyond banter.  I've given her rides home and never got a ""kiss me"" vibe on our drives so I've never tried to make a move or anything and just keep it friendly.

The other day at work a customer was being kind of crazy and I yelled at him because he was way out of line. A few minutes later she started holding my hand out of the blue and putting her head on my shoulder. I kind of just played it cool and went with it. We haven't had a drive home since the hand holding thing since our shifts haven't matched up. We've texted a little but her responses are usually a few words and long times in between replies but she does work a lot (2 shifts a day about 14+ hours) 

Today she asked for my snapchat so i messaged her on there but nothing happened beyond a hows your day thing. She only has one day off a week and ours don't match up so hanging out with her isn't exactly easy. 

From a third person perspective what is going on here? I guess I'm confused because usually girls will at least be like ""you're cute"" or SOMETHING to give you a clear idea they like you.

But, because reddit is anonymous, I'm telling you what's truly on my mind.  Legitimate advice is welcome.  

I'm a gentleman (27m), which is a principle that I live by and have obligated myself to for at least the last decade.  I struggle with women and possibly am too much of a gent.  I'm also a lawyer, take care of myself, exercise, eat healthy, dress with style, **treat people with respect**, and admittedly, I am a truly handsome dude.  Please do not take this the wrong way, but I humbly consider myself a very worthy mate in terms of marriage/dating.  

However, I am noticeably quiet.  I also find it very difficult to approach women.  The longest relationship I've been in (5 years) started because she came up to me at a party, I could tell that she liked me, I thought she was wonderful, we kissed, I asked her to get dinner, she said yes, we became very close . . . 5 years later it just wasn't right for us to be together, and that's okay.  It wasn't meant to be.  It's been 4 years since that relationship ended.

Dating apps, personally, are not my thing.  There are many many instances (in public or elsewhere) when I am attracted to someone and/or I know that a female has an eye for me (or she is flirting with me and it is obvious).  **However, in those situations, I literally do not know what to do or say**.  For some guys it is natural, but not for me.  

I have 3 older siblings, they all are married and have children.  I'm the youngest.  A common conversation is: ""So are you dating anyone? . . . At what age do you think you would want to get married? . . Maybe you should try dating apps . . . Why don't you . . . etc.""

Lastly, please do note that I have always had an unhealthy/no-comfort relationship with my mother.  My parents are still together (and my dad is the best person ever - I'm blessed).  However, when my mom was a child, her mother (my grandmother) killed herself.  As a result, my mom is a truly broken and disturbing person.  She grew up with an arguably abusive/alcoholic father and obviously without a mother.  She literally never knew/doesn't know how to be a mom (because she never had one).  My mom is negative, mean, unhappy, manipulative, unhealthy, etc.  I know that this weighs on me and somehow affects my ability to converse with women.  My mom has also been extremely rude to any female I've ever brought around and is consistently rude to even my sibling's spouses . . . you get the idea.

I want to muse on this topic and it’s sadly a sensitive one. Please be kind! I’m going to do my best to communicate my positive intent

I’m male 41 years old, and (in theory) I have done well for myself. I had a pretty adventurous 20s, and my 30s were supposed to be about finding the best place for myself to start settling down. It didn’t go to plan. I built 90% of a really great life for myself, but the one piece I couldn’t get find was a great partner. This was frustrating at first, but then started becoming traumatic when I started staring down the barrel of what my life would look like otherwise…

I’m in a transition period right now, and trying to work out what the hell to do. TLDR I built a great life for myself in a foreign city, but couldn’t find love there. In a panic of existential dread I moved back “home”. In theory it could be easier to settle down there, but it’s not the life I want, and i wonder if I can live with just throwing that away

It’s still an option to go back to my “old life” in the near future, but I want (need?!) to settle down, and urgently. I can’t continue on the same path of trying to meet people, trying to date, and having endless failure that destroys my self esteem and eats away my remaining time

So, I need another solution, and I started more seriously thinking about “international dating”, aka foreign brides. It makes me groan to think I might do this, but Jesus - I have a LOT to offer someone coming from a poorer country, it works legally, and other than the pride problem, I think it would be really wonderful to care for someone and help them build a life for us and also themselves…

To clarify a few points:

- I’m not thinking third world, probably second world. I’m in Europe (Let’s ignore the massive crisis right now)
- I’d just like to meet a nice, modestly attractive women in the right age group, who is serious about marriage and family. Where I was living trying to find this felt next to impossible 
- I could easily get her a visa, we wouldn’t need to marry for that initially 
- I would not want a slave! I would absolutely want to help her build her own independent social life, friends, hobbies etc. I feel like that would actually be really wonderful and fulfilling 
- All I’d want is for her to take me seriously, and be a good partner. If offering her a chance at a radically better life achieves that, SO BE IT
- Everything else I have: good job, high income, friends, hobbies, most stuff easily established, and I would look to buy an apartment for us asap 

The only problem is the weird feeling of being “reduced to this”. But on other hand, I have every intention of having a great, REAL relationship. I’m sick and tired of trying to date and meet women locally, and being treated like I’m substandard, and getting dumped before I even get a chance to show them who I am. I’m not a loser! But I’m sick of feeling that way, and I want to find a way to start living up to my potential

Please let’s not talk about my previous failures. The point is, I can’t repeat the same mistakes, I need to find another way

So the thing is - can this work? What should I be thinking about? I know I should at least be wary of scams, vet her like I would any date (I have modest requirements!) etc etc. I just want someone who appreciates me, and could this be a way?

I love the though of spending high quality time with someone, talking, laughing, sharing deep intimate moments. I have had many girlfriends but none of them have worked out for many reasons but I never once broke up with any girl or have ever been a bad guy. 

(not saying that to sound selfish but people who know me knows that I am a nice guy with a big heart but have been heartbroken many times so I have a hard time letting my true side show) 

I don't understand social cues of ""you should do this and that "" but instead just being a nice person. Being serious and supportive when I need to be and a funny and witty sometimes to lighten the mood. I am well aware that I have done some big face palm moments but I'm not perfect. I can also be pretty bad at talking via text due to my ADHD but I love talking, you know mouth to mouth. 

I can be a pretty big introvert when I meet new people but as I said before I can be very sweet when you get to know me. If you look at some of my other posts you know that I have big trust issues. 

It feels like I am never good enough for girls, I don't workout or am rich but I believe that being yourself is the best thing you can do. I really hope I can find the right person but I recently got my heart broken for the second time by the same girl. She was truly a good person but out nowhere we were done. I was never just wanting to understand. She and I never ever fought about anything so getting this kind of respones from her was shocking to say the least.

It's my belief that certain things in life are just not for certain people, regardless of how much they desire it 

For example, many people would love to be millionaires, and work to achieve that, but they never do. And some people are born millionaires, and some people are successful and make it happen. 

Liken so with love. I look around me, and family, friends, coworkers, roommate, acquaintances, and none of them struggle with dates, relationships and love the way I do. 
I know ""don't compare yourself to people around you"" but it's very hard not to when entering a relationship is as easy as going to the store for everyone around me. 

I'm tired of being unique. It's not as great as people want to believe it is. I want to be normal, not a misfit, not an acquired taste. 

I'm 25. I should have a few dates at a minimum, under my belt by now. I have cousins a decade younger than me with way more dating experience. And I don't care what people say, having dating experience matters. It makes you a better partner when you know what you want, and how to navigate a relationship. When you've never dated, you don't get that. I imagine being in a relationship at this age with someone with a decade of experience and it's daunting. They have 10 years of knowledge and experience on you. It would make me feel some type of way. Not to mention most women think there's definitely deeper issues going on with a man in his late mid-to-late 20s with no dating and relationship experience. It's a big red flag. And it shouldn't be. I'm just unlucky. 

All I've ever wanted was to meet a nice woman, fall in love, settle down and have a family, have a house big enough to invite friends and neighbors over for dinners, cookouts, football games, game nights, etc. And just live that dream. That's all. 

So simple. Yet so impossible for me. While everyone around me can achieve blindfolded with their hands tied behind their back, I have to watch everyone else fall in love, get married, and section off into their own family, while I'm left in the dust. 

So, that's it. The dream is dead. I have no one for me out there. No one's checking for me, no one's ever checked for me. I've never been someone's type. That dream was dead from the moment it was in my heart. I realize that now. I've achieved so many of my other dreams, but this one is impossible, merely because it requires someone to find me attractive and be interested enough to get to know me. That'll never happen. 

And I think, maybe with this dream dying, maybe I should too. Because life is awfully empty without hope for a better future, the one I dreamed about since I was 8.
