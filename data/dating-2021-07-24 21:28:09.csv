5,or3vjj,1627182662,I [17M] want to reconnect with a semi-ex [17F],"Title says it all. When we were both 15 I really liked her and I wanted to be in a relationship with her. Since we were only able to see each other once a week I decided to get to know her almost exclusively over text. This was adequate enough for when we were just friends, but after I told her how I felt and we got together it became crippling. We were able to talk for days and days through texting but when it came to face-to-face interactions we both were incapable of talking to each other. This saddened both of us out because we both really wanted it to work, but the only things that our ""relationship"" did for us was make me insecure 24/7 and cause her stress. Unsurprisingly she told me one day that she thinks of me more as a friend than a boyfriend (which was really true because I never acted romantic in person) but since I didn't want her as just a friend, I decided to cut contact altogether.

Thankfully since the pandemic started almost immediately as we broke up, I didn't have to deal with seeing her in person. But when regulations lessened in the fall, I had to deal with being near her on a weekly basis once again. Over the summer I had basically gotten over her, but when I started seeing her in person again the feelings immediately returned. However, because I didn't want to make the same mistake I made last time, I resolved to never text her and only build a relationship with her in person. Sadly this didn't really work because I never had an excuse to hang out with her outside of that once-a-week window and even when I did, it was still very awkward and difficult to talk to her. I made the stupid mistake of asking her out on a date via phone, and she of course declined.

Fast forward to this year. Over the summer once again my feelings had left me, but just like before as school is starting back the feelings have returned. However, over this summer I've undergone a serious period of growth and maturity and I am so much more confident now than I was two years ago. I now understand that in order to build a relationship with her I need to first build a solid, in-person friendship. The thing is... I have no idea how would I accomplish this. As stated before, in-person interactions between the both of us are really weird even to this day, and as said in the last paragraph I have no idea how I would even ask her to hang out without it sounding like I was trying to go on a date. 

Tldr: e-dated a girl when I was very immature, asked her out a year later and failed, then had a major glow up and want to try again properly this time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/or3vjj/i_17m_want_to_reconnect_with_a_semiex_17f/
6,or3wz7,1627182839,Being understanding or empathetic to a woman's experience has nothing to do with dating success for men in this type of thing needs to stop being pushed as advice," I'm a young black man from the hood who was raised by nothing but women.
I'm an artist so that should go even further in showing how empathetic and sensitive I can be

And even as I'm typing this I realize how hard it is as a man to prove this because the more you try to prove it the more you look like you don't have it but I'm going to try anyway

I have had a nice mixture of female friends and because of my artistic background of I was been interested in works of art made by women just as much as men so growing up and trying to understand women wasn't so hard but it does get confusing because there's so many conflicting ideas and narratives about what's proper conduct between men and women

But as a guy who has been told so many times that he's husband material and has had so many girls leave him for the guy they say they hated and abused them,

There is just no correlation between a man and his attitude towards women and their experience and how well he does

And as sad as it is to say I have found that men who act the opposite and do not care about women at all do way better which is our generation's greatest irony since we're supposed to be a generation raised by feminism but it shows in our daily conduct

So many girls love to say this and I don't want to be disrespectful but it just seems like a cop out answer because it's easy to tell this to a guy to win an argument

The idea is that if men somehow were supposed to understand women more than they would do better but as a man who has been just that and who used to be a feminist himself it just does not manifest this way

I went to high school with a girl who was excellent she was a cheerleader and she was preppy and she had straight A's and she was very respectful. She was the type of girl you knew who would make something of herself

There were so many other boys like her in the school but guess who was the boy she chose.

The neighborhood gang banger who ended up killing a guy before graduation.

There is no way in hell that this guy could just understand women more especially giving his conduct. But he was a classic bad boy. The type of guy who does not care at all about the women's experience and ironically that's why he does so much better.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/or3wz7/being_understanding_or_empathetic_to_a_womans/

12,or4f5k,1627185012,Why am I only attracted to heavier/plus size women?,"
Why am I only attracted to heavier/plus size women?

This is going to be half a question and half me venting. I get every person has a type but my type very much goes against what is considered conventionally attractive. My whole life I’ve only ever been attracted to thick, chubby, or fat girls. Honestly I’ve tried dating skinny women to see if I could change what I find attractive but it just doesn’t work out (especially in bed) to the point that now I’ve had to reject multiple skinny women that have shown interest in me. Every relationship I’ve had that went well has been with a large women, but it’s always a weird feeling when what your girlfriend is self conscious about is what you find physically attractive like a fat ass, belly or fat arms. My friends have poked fun at me for it and I’ve even heard I have poor taste in women but I don’t really care what they think. I do wonder, if men think this aspect of me is weird what do women think about it? I’m sure women want a man that finds them attractive right? I’m not oppressed like LGBT folk but In a way I relate to gay men/women in that what I find attractive isn’t what the average person does which can feel weird at times. For example many times I’ve been in a scenario where I flirt or confess feelings to a big lady and they find it hard to believe that I’m interested and I have to convince them I am, one time even after a couple months.
I’ve read online that some people consider this a fetish and I disagree. Being attracted to a plus size body isn’t fetishizing them it really is no different than a man saying he isn’t into fat chicks. But idk what do y’all think? Obviously personality matters too and shouldn’t be ignored but attractiveness is an important part of sex and any worth while relationship at least to me, so this shit is important
Ive sort of just had to accept this part of my personality and I think I’m on my way to making peace with it, but I definitely still wonder why am I like this? And is there any way to broaden my idea of what is attractive?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/or4f5k/why_am_i_only_attracted_to_heavierplus_size_women/

It was after 3 a.m when we said goodbye, so…
We stopped near my house, he jumped out of his car, leaned on it, and when i stood in front of him to say thanks for the ice cream he pulled me, murmured something and kissed me so lightly on my lips twice holding me as if i would break, and i got so excited from all the sexual tension that i licked his lips, put my tongue just a little in his mouth and bit him lightly on his lower lip. 
I got so embarrassed and pulled away right away, i felt how surprised he was.

15,or4ris,1627186452,First Date Change of Plans,"I (24m) made plans with a girl I recently met to cook dinner together and watch a movie at my place. We met through work (virtually, we don't work together directly), have texted a few times but haven't met in person yet. We didn't explicitly call it a date but to me at least this seems like more of a date activity than a friends only activity. Fast forward a week (still about a week before our dinner), she messaged me asking if I wanted to meet up that night at a bar. Context, this had been one of the two days she proposed for our dinner originally but I opted for the other one saying I had family in from out of town for this day. I responded politely saying I don't drink and further clarifying I wasn't free this day but offered to change up the plans if the original one didn't work for her for any reason. She then said she would prefer to meet up in a park or at a patio for COVID reasons. I was happy to oblige as I am pretty uptight about COVID too and we switched it up to meeting up in a park. I know the new plan is fine (and I am still very excited!) but I can't help but let part of this eat at me. It just seems like she already knew I was busy and presented this as an indirect way of changing our forthcoming plans. It also doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me because she proposed meeting at a bar on a day where it was pouring rain and then said we needed to change our plans to be outdoor for COVID reasons. I just feel like there's something happening in the background I'm not fully picking up on. Why couldn't she have just asked directly to maks a change if she was uncomfortable with the original plan? Is she getting cold feet? Am I overthinking this? Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR The girl I had a date planned with asked if I would meet her that day on a day she knew I wasn't free. What followed seems like an effort to change our original plans from cooking dinner together to meeting up in a park. Is this a bad sign? Why didn't she just ask to change the plans directly?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/or4ris/first_date_change_of_plans/

It feels so impersonal you and others are reduced to a bunch of pictures and you can't tell much about a person through their pictures. Do your values meet up? Do they know how to treat you right? Women are bombarded to the point of being overwhelmed and just propositioned for sex even when stating they are looking for a relationship and on the other end there are awesome guys with little matches you may not even get shown thanks to some poorly designed algorithm. 

Swipe left swipe right pay more to see all your matches we have become mere products on a digital  wasteland that dating apps have become😂. Ticking off a shopping list is about the least personal way to meet someone. 

I tried online dating for the first time 2.5 months ago and I'm not impressed can you tell? Yes it gives you access to a large pool of locally available people but its just about the most unappealing thing I've done voluntarily 😅 I did meet a couple of genuine people along the way looking for different things respectfully but my gosh the rest I am not sure If I will reinstall the apps again.

I’m covered in tattoos and am an accomplished kickboxer in my local scene. I used to get into a lot of trouble with the law before martial arts changed my perspective on life. 


Getting short term fwb’s or one night stands isn’t really a problem for me. I know how to play the game. I’m very good at it. The whole asshole bad boy thing is the easiest way to get into a girls pants if that last what you’re aiming for. 



Deep down though, I don’t want to be like this anymore. Not overbearingly smothering like the nice guys in the movies, I still want to hold respect for myself. But I want to be kind and attentive, and soft, that is who I truely am. No girl (besides my mom and my sister) has ever got to know who I really am. I always cut girls off before that happens. All girls know me as a cold asshole bad boy. They go crazy over it. Poor girls, they think they are in love when really they are just infatuated. They all say nice guys don’t turn them on. 


That’s why I’ve never been nice to a girl, out of fear of getting hurt. But that is who I really am. I’m not an evil fuckboy at heart. It’s just a facade that helps me get laid.

Before we met in person, he told me (for the first time in our year long friendship(?)) that he was wanted to pursue a serious relationship with me. We’ve both never been in relationships before, so I told him that we should meet in real life before deciding if we’re both interested. 

I definitely feel like I’ve gotten to know him online quite well and the in-person date went really well too! Problem is, because of school and stuff I won’t be able to see him again for months. 

Ideally, I think it would’ve been nice to go on more “dates” before saying yes to being exclusive. So, I’m not really sure how to proceed... neither of us are interested in meeting other people right now but I’m not sure about basically starting a relationship after one date, a long distance (ish) relationship at that (despite having talked every day online for over a year). I’m afraid it might not even feel like anything has changed from being friends, with not being able to meet again for some time and gradually becoming more physically comfortable with each other.

Although they can be a little crazy it is all done in good humour. (They’re very forward in telling people they’re dating they’re looking for a relationship long term).

So why is it that a guy will spend months talking on the phone/online, meet with them in person, have sex once and then call it off? 

This has happened a few times. The reason that they have spoken for months and not met in person is due to Covid/restrictions. When restrictions allowed they would meet with each other. 

They then had sex as it is long awaited and throughout those months of talking it was expected. 

So why then, has the guy called it off the next day?

Is this not a waste of time for them because it certainly is for my friend. My friend is asking me why this keeps happening to them and I can’t seem to work it out either.

I asked him if he minds me calling him some times and he said I can call him anytime but I’m not actually the kind of person who calls to check on people all the time and I’m not sure he’d want that.

Anyways, he told me that he misses me and he wants to have something real, like since we both are 22 with our money, we could take flights, spend days at each other houses etc. But he told me that he wants to do that by September, when he WOULD BREAK UP WITH HIS GIRL, he also says that he doesnt love her anymore and etc. I told him that I would like to give it a chance but until that I told him not to text me until he deals the stuff with his girl.  


We havent talked since then and now im having second thoughts about it, Im scared that one day he would leave me for his ex, but at the same time I think that this will work, because I know that he really likes me but idk, so thats why i want yall opinion!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ora808/long_distance_dating_cheating_etc/

77,orayvg,1627217378,Do I keep going or throw in the towel?,"So, brief outline on this, since I'm so bloody confused as to what's going on.  
I (29M) don't have a lot of success with dating recently, most people seem to talk for a week then disappear so, anyway.  
As brief as I can be:

Match on Tinder with 27F, and we have some meaningful conversation and we seem to get on well. As the days go on, this conversation becomes shorter and shorter, despite my attempts to try to keep it going, asking questions, etc. It pretty much dries up and I can't get much out of her. She explains its due to her parents being around helping her move into new place. Fair enough, I get that, she says she'll let me know when they're gone so she can talk more as her mother is 'judgemental' of her choices.

Next week comes around and it appears her friends have turned up, so she is still busy. Fair enough again, I try to have conversations now and then but get little, or a very broken up conversation with days between replies. At this point I'm trying not to be too pushy, Im suggesting dates, or at least ideas for dates, which she likes the idea of, but I can never get a date in the calendar nailed down with her.

Seems then she deleted her tinder profile, or unmatched me I'm not sure, but she hasn't blocked me on whatsapp so likely the former. She rematches me a week or so later. So despite the lack of conversation I get the impression she is interested, but yet conversation is lacking still. She's busy a lot of the time and I'm thinking ""Do you really have time to date, if you can't keep a conversation going"". She leaves my messages on read a lot of the time, which I find kinda rude but whatever. 

After a while I speak my mind and ask whats going on, from the leaving me on read, whether she is actually interested etc, and where I stand. She rolls off about being busy with her new job, which I appreciate, and how her ex keeps popping up, which I can understand. She says she is interested but isn't in a position to date right now. Fine, thanks for wasting my time I guess but she still talks every now and then, but this week she is either getting her house sorted or her friends are down. She said both in the same message, which is weird, is it one or the other? Call me persistent but I'm still interested, and considering I don't get matches on Tinder for weeks, I'd rather try to make the most of what I get.   
Do I just give in at this point and say fuck it, enough is enough, or do I try to wait it out?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orayvg/do_i_keep_going_or_throw_in_the_towel/

I have been with my boyfriend for 5+ months and for some context, I am not a virgin while he is. We are both each other’s first serious relationship. As young adults with a high libido, we have very frequent make out sessions that often end with me satisfying him with a BJ/HJ, while he doesn’t even finger me (because he doesn’t know how to, and idk how to teach him). He is not ready for sex yet because he feels we are not stable/not long term yet... which I totally understand. But it’s hard because I’m always left super sexually frustrated and even masturbation doesn’t help since I know how PIV sex feels like. I have suggested dry humping as well, but he rejected it on the basis of it being an open temptation to sex, which I also understand. Hence, I’m hoping to get some suggestions on what I can do... or what are some reasonable boundaries to set with my SO that will not influence his morals and values? I love him enough to respect his wishes, but I’m always left super horny and unsatisfied :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orazpq/boyfriend_24m_doesnt_want_to_have_sex_with_me_21f/
79,orbaxq,1627218705,Am I too needy or is he just not that into me?,"About three months ago, I (29F) started dating this guy (28M) that I met on Hinge. By far, he is the most unexpressive and stern type of guy I've ever dated. I was all smitten about him and I really like him, but now I'm starting to think if I should call it quits now because it's going to be crash and burn at the end. 

He is a master's student who also works a quasi full-time job, so his schedule is quite hectic. But he will always find time to meet me and I see him at least once a week. But at the same time, he never lets me get in the way of his personal schedule. 

He works some weekends, and he came over to my place this Friday. And right after having sex (it was around 9), he says he has to leave because he has to get up early tomorrow for work...even after I told him I hate it when guys leave right after sex, 10 minutes later he was gone. I really felt like crap. 

(I know he has very strict personal boundaries. For example, he once told me how he wouldn't mind another lockdown because that way he would be free from social obligations and could focus more on his studies and personal schedule.) 

Also another issue is his inexpressiveness. I am a very expressive person, and I'm not hesitant to let him know how I feel about him, both verbally and physically. He would reciprocate (e.g. saying ""I like you""s back) and he's been getting better, but he never initiates them, which sometimes makes me feel unwanted. I once told him  I sometimes can't figure how he feels towards me, and he goes: ""How can you not know?"" 

One of my friends who met him said that she could just tell he was into me, just from the way he looks at me. But if he never expresses his feelings, how am I supposed to know??? Sometimes I'm not even sure if he likes me or not. 

Him not prioritizing my emotional needs really hurts my feelings, but I sometimes wonder if I am just too needy and should respect his boundaries or if he is just simply not that into me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orbaxq/am_i_too_needy_or_is_he_just_not_that_into_me/

In this world there are so many beautiful women married to lucky men, but some of the times not so much the beautiful women is married to a man who is continually working sparing no time or affection for his wife or children by doing so the wife gets lonely and lonelyer untill they started to argue at the smallest things. By doing this the wife steady looks for some one or something to fill in the lonely void that she has build up which leads to cheating and more cheating. And when the husband finds out they get divorced and the marriage is broken this can lead to both partners being pulled down into depression and more mental health problems. What I am saying is MEN please respect your wife and show that you care and give her the affection she needs. AND this is not pointed at just men it's for WOMEN as well both partners need to take care of each others happiness and pain. So MEN the next time you come home from work give your loving wife a complement and take them out for dinner or for a nice walk she will be happy 😊 to spend some time with you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orbpry/married_men_give_your_loving_wife_partner_the/

87,orbvk5,1627220898,Child abuse/trauma affecting adult relationships?,"On surface it seems I have it all. Nice house, financially stable, fit and good looking. Deep down however I feel like a mess. Throughout my life I held a dark secret that's prevented me from being able to connect with anyone and not be able to maintain healthy relationships. I only realised later on into my adulthood that these are the remaining symptoms after extreme child abuse and trauma. 

 I stay away from relationships and became emotionally detached for a reason. I rarely ever find anyone attractive or connect to them but the very few times I do it's always to trainwrecks, emotionally unavailable or just damaged people. I literally don't know what else to do and how to stop being attracted to them and it scares and saddens me because attraction is out of my control. It is almost like I barely feel drawn to normal people. It's not like I am getting any younger and I feel the years are ticking away. I'd love to find a life long companion and partner one day but sincerely don't understand how to get out of this hurdle. 

I have read hundreds to thousands of self help articles and spoke with other people who could relate. I've even wrote some uplifting articles myself which has helped people but it is of no use. Cognitively understanding it doesn't erase this problem and it doesn't fix my internal wiring. I feel like I just carry out motions and I'm really good at being polite and civil with people. However everyone I meet I always feel a barrier and I don't feel anything for them. They all seem like acquaintances like the wind that come and go. If I sense someone is in pain and hold trauma, I feel I subconsciously relate to them and react to that more strongly. It is the only time I actually feel much of anything when most of the time I feel really empty. 

I was just curious if anyone else could relate to this because I don't know anyone in real life who understands this torment. How has child abuse or trauma affected your adult relationships? What did you do to overcome this or did you remain chronically single or friendless for life ? What did you do to fix this ?

90,orcbmh,1627222488,The nice guy stereotype is just that. And internet stereotype and rarely exist in real life,"A man can identify as a nice guy and it should not have any negative connotations.

Before anybody starts jumping down my throat and telling me what my problems are I have had three girlfriends. Ironically I shouldn't use the number of women I've had to measure anything but everyone seems to think that if you are a guy you complain about this type of thing then you're hopeless.

Not every girl acts like this but it has been a cliche thing since time immemorial that young women seem to date men that are not really in their best interests

All my life I've seen it with my mom and her friends and the women in my group. The girl starts dating someone that we all know is not good for her but since he looks flashy then she goes for that type of guy and there's nothing inherently wrong with that at first glance

But it starts to becoming a problem when girls like this continuously date men like this but then come to the conclusion that all men must be evil or horrible based off of the few that they've dated

It does make men like me a little frustrated especially growing up in the female dominated home and hearing this type of thing all the time.

It does get insulting knowing that as a man that if I were to act more rough and treat a woman more aggressively than I could have had more women in the past and that's not something that is making me proud or eager.

Men of this generation have grown up with conflicting messages on what is proper conduct when being around women. But the irony is every woman is different.

A lot of people both men and women included seem to think that it is disrespectful for a man to approach a woman at a grocery store. Yet I've done it before to get a girlfriend and I've been on the opposite end to wear a woman came to me in my own store.

It's not a matter of respect but pragmatism. And I know a lot of guys like me probably missed out on a lot of chances trying so hard to be respectful and non-threatening because you can best believe that girl is probably seeing you in a different light And losing attraction for you.

I am at way too many women including my own ex tell me that they have never been treated well before and I find it crazy because a man's treating a woman normally should not be seen as something to unique  but it happens

And it also does get a little bit insulting especially if you are of man who was raised in this environment where every woman in the family is telling you one thing but then you go out into the wild and something else is revealed entirely

I'm from the hood. I tried my best to be professional and get out of the hood and so far I have had some great successes but something that has stayed constant is that so many hood girls seem to go after the wrong men. Whether it be because environment or that's what they saw growing up doesn't matter but that is the phenomenon that I grew up with seeing in high school and college and beyond

Of course it's not every girl but it is a sizable portion to wear this phenomenon is visible. Something about criminality is very attractive and a lot of kids who grew up in poverty or in environments like this usually end up going this type of way. 

I was on a date with a girl and me she had a boyfriend but her boyfriend was in jail because they're both gangbangers.

I come from a family of gang affiliated people and it tears me apart knowing that if I went a different path and became a gang banger then I probably would have had much better respect and even romantic opportunities in my own environment right now.

I know this isn't all the time and I know this is not every man and woman but once again and this phenomenon seems so visual but we all get so angry pointing it out because we would rather not make it seem like women are the problem in choosing bad men.

It is a problem from both men and women and yet I find it crazy to so many women seem to ignore this type of thing especially since they are the party that is doing the choosing.

If any bad men ever hurt anybody we should not be blaming men and we shouldn't really even been blaming all women but we should be blaming the small percentage of women who actively choose these type of men over and over again.

I was in an abusive relationship myself and what she says still haunt me and I do understand that that most people don't plan on getting in these types of relationships but as a man who grew up scene both his stepfather and mother abusing each other it tears me apart knowing that if I exceed at the same traits I probably would have been looked at in a better life and that tears me up inside",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orcbmh/the_nice_guy_stereotype_is_just_that_and_internet/

I won’t even begin to discuss the dumpster fire that is online dating. My hobbies aren’t something that women also enjoy, if there are women there they aren’t single. Just approaching a woman I find attractive in public isn’t acceptable anymore and many women have stated they don’t want to be approached, you won’t know if she does or doesn’t until it’s too late so I just don’t do it at all.

A consistent friend with benefits situation would be great as random hookups were never my thing, but I feel like that’s just as difficult as finding someone who wants a relationship. My life has been devoid of any kind of intimacy for two years now. I’m not blaming the pandemic either because it’s not like I was doing well with dating/finding what I wanted before.

I have a decent amount of female friends who are my age and who seem to be normal smart and well adjusted. Whenever I hear them talk about their dating lives it is always just crazy. Like if I was in their shoes I don’t see how I couldn’t dump them, or how I could even start dating them to begin with.

Like I have one friend that’s “dating” this one guy she’s really into but he only ever talks to her when he wants to fuck her and ignores her the rest of the time. This girl is literally getting played and she’s still head over heels for them. There’s a mother girl who has been with her boyfriend for 3 months but can’t bring him anywhere because he’s super jealous and has a habit of fighting other guys at every party they go to. Like why the hell would you be with this person.

There’s other stories like this and they vent and complain about their guys constantly and I’m just left wondering what I’m doing that’s so wrong that the guys they’re seeing are successful with women and I’m not. I mean I know people never believe guys when they say this, but I think I have a pretty good personality. If not, it’s at least better than a guy that just keeps girls around solely for sex when I know they want something more. How are guys that are that shitty of people getting attention from girls and I just can’t.

This is just so frustrating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ord78c/hearing_the_way_my_girl_friends_talk_about_the/
96,ord937,1627225719,He broke up with me,"I’m so caught off guard. We became best friends. We were smitten with each other. We talked all the time. We talked about our future. 
He has some things going on in his family but I’ve been understanding, I’ve been there for him. I met his friends, his family. He buys me flowers and a teddy bear. Tells me he loves me. And he just breaks up with out of no where. What the fuck


Why the fuck does this happen to me 
I’m a good person I’m a good woman why fucking me this makes me not want to trust a single man again. I thought it was different with him. Fuck this modern day love bullshit",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ord937/he_broke_up_with_me/
97,ordi6r,1627226581,I don’t think I ever want to date again,"I (25F) have been dating around 2 years and honestly does it ever get any easier? I can fully comprehend that it takes a while to find someone who you really click with. I enjoyed it at first as I had met some really interesting people. But now I think it’s becoming a bit of a joke. I rarely like someone, and when I do it takes a few weeks for me to develop any sort of feelings at all so I always talk to the person and get to know them. 

I stopped going after those guys that just seemed to want fun and I actually went for nice guys. Recently I started speaking to this guy who seemed so amazing I was asking myself what’s the catch? I didn’t have to ask for effort or time he just did it, he made me feel so important and I finally felt safe enough to open up to him about some things as he had done with me. Well that was the last straw for me, he literally fucked me off like I was absolutely nothing. So I think I’m really done. 

I’m more pissed off at the fact as a person, I don’t open up to many people because there’s too many people who are self absorbed who don’t really care, so I’ve always kept my shit to myself. People don’t realise how difficult it is to learn to trust people again, and when you do, it gets ripped away from you again  and again like seriously what is the point?? 

Dunno why I even posted this not asking a question I suppose just on a rant. I couldn’t care that he’s done a 360 on me, I’m bothered at the fact he literally wore me down to like him and to open up and did that?? He’s not a loss but he’s now left me with negative thoughts and trust issues. Chime in if you want and please be respectful",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ordi6r/i_dont_think_i_ever_want_to_date_again/
98,ordkhb,1627226809,long time friends VS girlfriend,I have been with this girl for just about 3 months. She's super nice but is really awkward at times. My friends who are basically my family (5+ years of seeing each other every weekend and building cars) and the only people I have around me in my life absolutely love her. I think she's really awesome but I really enjoy her but more of a way of  friends way than I do in a relationship I've realized. I don't know how to bring it up in conversation or what is the correct way of moving forward. Anyone with advice would greatly be appreciated.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ordkhb/long_time_friends_vs_girlfriend/
