**Introduction: The Future of Online Dating**

Like it or not, online dating is here to stay. It is what the trend shows, the digitalisation of every aspect of human life, starting with books, music and now human activities, including social and sexual interactions with each other. The world is no longer the same. The dating market has never been more different. What we see today is partly the consequence of the rise of social media and dating apps which has transformed the lives of each and every human being for good. So instead of turning a blind eye against the inevitable, instead of being ignorant and get taken advantage of or getting left behind, why not explore it, understand it, and utilize it to our benefit in maximizing our dating potential and sexual capacity within a technological driven and ever-changing world.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Argument for Not Using Dating Apps**

In truth, there have been myriads of evidence showing why online dating is bad, especially for the men of the world. The two biggest issues that exist through the usage of dating apps are first, agreed by the majority of men, that ""It does not work"", and second, it can negatively affect the confidence and mental health of men. There is no deny in these two observations, which can be tributed to a combination of both the flaws that exist within the current dating market and the addictive and judgemental nature of digital media.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Online Dating May Sucks For Men**

Understand that with online dating, the primary attraction cue is through the visual, which limits the way women selects sexual mate and because of women tendency to operate hypergamously, female users have become much more harsh and selective in the mating process that the online world offers. The opposite is true for men due to their polygamous nature, hence, this creates a grossly skewed distribution of matches received between men and women. Paired with the increase in accessibility and availability of sexual candidates as a functionality of every dating apps, the supply of men available simply does not meet the demands from women but concentrated on the top 10% of men. Simply put, average women do not want average men anymore and this put the majority of men at an incredible disadvantageous place within the globalized online dating world.

This is an uphill battle for most men to fight and compete. In real life, this disadvantage could be counteracted with a display of high value, or some sort of attractive traits and personality to create that sexual attraction between him and the woman. However, this opportunity to shows more of himself is rarely available through online dating and so the average men often suffer from the lack of results that can potentially damage his inner belief and self-confidence. Hence, it is often advised within the manosphere to avoid social media and online dating altogether and strive towards a natural dating life that is seen as more effective and satisfying to live by.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Deeper Issue Of The Current Dating Market Place**

While all these observations and sentiments are real, such advocate is far from the whole truth. Understand that most average men are neglected, rated as unattractive and received little attention nor results no matter if they are on the dating apps or not. Of course, the degree of rejection is much worse for these men when dating online rather than in real life, yet the observed problems associated with online dating can not be simply equated to a simple solution of ""avoiding it"". The matter of fact is we are living in a globalized sexual marketplace, if the current climate of dating does not favour you, and you are not doing anything about it, you are guarantee to find a lot more failure and frustration than success regardless of what form of dating that you may implement in your life. This is the deeper, harsher truth that most average men must confront and accept.

*To Win In The Current Dating Market Place, You Must Improve Yourself No Matter What.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Understanding and Utilizing Online Dating**

With online dating, it is not who you are as a person that holds the values for attraction but the presentation of yourselves that dictate whether or not you are a sexually desirable candidate. This does not only include physical look, but your lifestyle, your personality, your interests which all need to be incorporated and portrayed in the form of visualized images and texts. As you can see, the nature of digital media has enabled us to be judgmental and somewhat shallow creatures, and that can be a disadvantage if you do not have a good profile and good game, which is, unfortunately, the case for the majority of men. Yet the opposite is also true if you know how to leverage this functionality of social media and dating apps to then create an attractive image of yourself and be separated from the rest of the competition.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion: How To Incorporate Dating Apps In Your Dating Life**

At the end of the day, online dating is only a tool, but a tool that will continue to exist and be developed and grow far extends into the future of the dating market. It certainly has its own place with its own sets of disadvantages and advantages and its ability to deliver is likely dependent on the skills and experience of the user itself. It might not be your taste, but at least try to understand the ins and outs of it and the effects it has on the present and the future of the dating scenes. And if you decide to use it, do not treat it as the end all be all, because it can never replace real-life dating, just like how no technology can ever replace your natural desire to act and live like a functional, social and sexual human being.

Figure out if online dating is worth it for you, and see if you can grasp what it has to offer to your dating life from now and beyond. As the world evolves with politics and technology, so comes the dating marketplace, hence, it is crucial to put yourself ahead of the game, whether directly or indirectly using dating apps to then achieve what you want in your life as a man of value.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,56068,public,self,,,Why Online Dating Does Not Work For You,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p9dquj/why_online_dating_does_not_work_for_you/,,some_ads,7,,,,

I’m in my mid-forties (f) which is important because I have the current libido of a 3-dicked monkey. Between that, and the existential crisis induced by the last shit-show of a year, I have recently rejoined the online dating slog after giving up several years ago. I’ve gone in with fairly low expectations—meet people, have fun, see what happens, yadda yadda. 

I’ve met someone local and the sexual chemistry is absolute fire. We’ve hooked up a few times and it’s been amazing. He’s super sweet, interesting, really critically minded, does good in the world and is incredibly sexy. I’m fairly kinky and, well, let’s just say we’re compatible. He’s got a somewhat messy life that I’m not super interested in being a part of, particularly because my kids are off to college and he’s got two under five, plus he’s got a messy divorce underway. I’m fairly certain he doesn’t have the bandwidth to be more deeply involved and what we’ve got now works for me. Same page, pal. 

I’ve also met someone who lives far enough away that it’s long distance. We fucking click and click hard. He’s easily one of the funniest, most intelligent people I’ve met and we’ve talked for hours. He’s planning on visiting next month and I’m so psyched to hang out with him. We’ve had sexy time over the phone and he’s fairly vanilla. I’m totally down for talking openly about my preferences and learning about his and have told him I’m pretty freaky. 

The rub: I’m starting to feel pretty duplicitous, especially with the long-distance guy. He hasn’t asked and I haven’t offered but we connect so deeply it’s feeling unethical to not bring it up. I’m worried I’m going to cause harm if I don’t tell him on the soonish side but I also am so not ready to end it with the local guy. 

What’s the right thing to do here?

I've met someone I really like.  We've been out on 6 dates so far and seem super compatible with a lot in common.  My issue is that she put her status on her OLD profile as Separated and on our first date she told me her divorce was almost complete, she was just waiting to get the final paperwork to finalize things, and it was due ""any day now"".

While talking the other night, she mentioned a conversation with her STBx she'd had where he said that he was still hoping for reconciliation and I asked her some questions about what paperwork she'd received back from the court.  Unfortunately, in comparing notes I learned she hasn't received anything back from the court in several months and that the ex had told her that he'd handle the divorce filing for them, as he had gone through a divorce previously.  She said she'd paid him money for the filing fees and had filled out the initial paperwork to get the ball rolling, but it looks like he never filed it and has been stringing her along and lying to her for the last several months, and he has now gone silent when she asked him about it.  Note: they split up 6 months ago and haven't been cohabitating during this time.

Since finding this out I have told her that I am very uncomfortable dating someone that is still married and isn't even in the divorce ""process"" as of now.  We also reside in an at-fault divorce state and I do not want to have a relationship with her potentially used against us by an angry spouse.  I have told her that I want to put our relationship on pause until this issue is cleared up.  She was unsurprisingly upset about this and is talking about how angry she is at her ex.  Did I handle this correctly?  I have no intention of using this as an excuse to see anyone else, but I feel like it was the only sensible and responsible thing to do given the situation?  Any advice on how I could've or should've handled this?

Weekend just gone I had a work social event to attend. So I put the offer around my friends both male and female ...

"" Got a thing to go to, beautiful hotel suite, nice meal booked in a restaurant with the big boss and 2 colleagues with their plus 1s, all on expenses a  free weekend away, will be taking the 2+2 and the day after dropping into a car museum for lunch and a wander round on the way home, will need to share a bed, but we have all done that before at parties and tenting etc so it won't be over weird for us lot haha ... Anyone up for it?"" 
So a female friend was first to stick her hand up...

 "" sounds great, will dump the kids with their grandparents, how posh is the restaurant?"" 

So we had a great weekend, fed, entertained, museum and a good sing along in the car while driving, just a fun weekend with a friend. 

Then today I had a couple of site visits to do, as I was driving along the south of London I went past Greenwich Royal Observatory and Maritime Museum, last time I visited I was a school kid, thought to myself I would like to revisit there some time soon. Wonder if anyone else would like to go?

Which got me thinking would it work for dating as well as friends? I don't use OLD as it's just not for me the current popular format, too many bad dates and bad conversation put me off it, people just weren't who they said they were it seemed. Yes I do have a history of attracting hot crazy messes which has been a lifelong issue, OLD amplified that problem.

 But I think that any woman who fancies a walk around Greenwich maritime museum and observatory must be somewhere on my radar of agreeable personality. So perhaps we need site where we can do the above. So many threads about people not coming up with original date ideas, or not making moves to arrange a date. Chuck your idea out there, nail your colours to the mast pardon the pun, and see who likes the activity idea. This way the date and activity is right there in the open from the outset.

I replied, ah don't be that way, I like you..

I just replied. I disagree.

a bit drunk so bear with this long ass weird ass story and post.

&amp;#x200B;

About 10 months ago I, 40F,  started talking with a guy 42M (SCEM, a jovial loving tease to him being a stupid crayon eating marine which i respect him a shit ton for) I met him in one of my Facebook groups.  He was really nice, not creepy and super interesting. Has been all over the world as a marine, works in the same industry as me, laid back raver hippie kinda of guy, just a mega cool dude. very respectful and genuinely curious about my life and my thoughts, feelings, projects.  After a week or so of texting a few times a day he asked me for a date.  He lived over an hour and a half away and I had recently gotten out of an on again off again abuse situation and was not at all looking to date. I also could tell he was from a much higher economic status than me and was embarrassed.  at the time i lived on a 56 acre farm and was a total bumpkin. im cute and smart and awesome, pretty creatively talented, with a killer rack  but im so so stupid innocent naive and bumpkiny.  its the one flaw about me i hate the most and gets exploited to fuck and back.

&amp;#x200B;

I was honest and open about this and he still continued to keep in touch with me everyday or every couple of days, not pressuring me just being kind and genuinely interested.  My Mom was extremely sick with breast cancer at the time and my home life was a MESS. I was having a quite difficult time. SCEM kept in contact with me daily and we bonded over music, art, politics, our mutual profession and soooo much more.  About 2 months later he again asked for a date and I told him I would enjoy that very much but the logistics were bad.  Somehow he and I became a part of each others daily lives regardles still not yet meeting face to face.  It's worth mentioning he has messaged me every single day since January 2021 before 8am to tell me good morning and check in with each other on how we feel about life in general.

 4 months into us now talking everyday, I ended up moving to the to the city where SCEM works tob restart my life.  My BFF since middle school lives here, she is literally my heart and soul and biggest champion and that was my reason, not him for chosing this city.  It's still an hour commute from his home to the city.  When I finally met SCEM I was blown away.  He is so successful and strong and inspiring to me.  We started to see each other on the weekends and once or twice a week after work he would stop by.  I'm only 2 miles away from his work.  

He would take me to expensive hotels on the weekends and we would drink beer or eat mushrooms and talk about amazing things. I felt so bonded and close to him.  He would send me packages and gifts addressed to ""Beautiful Horse\_Apple"" (using my real name).  Still texting me all day everyday usually as soon as he woke up which could be as early as 4:30 or 5am.

This man would seriously text me before he got 2 blocks away from dropping me off after a date to tell me how pretty I looked or how much I inspired his mind.  We made so many plans for the future and our goals aligned very well.  Several times he told me he loved me.  I even got to meet his teenage son a few times and his son asked me if I was his dad's girlfriend and SCEM confirmed this right in front of me.  We were intimate many times and it was always out of the park banging hot good times.

So about 4 weeks ago he started to flake on all of our plans.  He stopped texting me as much and it was nearly ghost level. i totally get it that he is very busy with work, being a single dad, operating several side hustles (work we want to do together eventually i thought, in short ecommerce industry).  i also want him to take down time for fun.  but at some point he could have made some time for me and just has NOT.  but yet -  He just signed a year lease on a home near my neighborhood and we have plans to work on a budding business. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Then last week I caught him texting another girl on Facebook he had never even met about taking her for dinner and telling her he was single.  I called him out.  He told me he thought it was me setting him up (like for real dude, we're 40, people don't do that) so he played along.  I stopped answering his texts and eventually after a few days he apologized and said once he moves up here we can talk.  I responded finally and told him I truly felt like after 10 months we had a real emotional connection and the fun together in person was unreal and I absolutely accepted him without conditions as he is.  I told him if he could go forward with me being 100% honest then if he lived in a cardboard box with 100 other girl friends I would still be fascinated by everything he had to say and listen to all his hopes, dreams, thoughts and problems with an open heart.  He replied ""on fleek"" as a 42 year old man.  Fucking seriously, wtf does that even mean in that context like what a crayon eater.

I can not figure out why someone would put all of that effort, time, cash and emotion into another person just to drop them like that.  nearly 10 months of daily contact literally from sun up to sun down is a big emotional investment in my eyes.  We never had any arguments and were vocal about how we respected each other a lot.  I feel like this is a lot my issue being perhaps codependent on narcissistic people but I also feel like he probably met someone he was more into and I should let it go and be happy someone I care so much for found something that makes them feel fulfilled.  Its hard.  he moves in two weeks.  i almost want to wait it out and see what he says but I kinda think at this point if I respect myself I would suck it up and work on moving on.

After a breakup your ex is to you essentially heroin, cocaine , This person is a like highly addictive drug and you are a junkie and you’ll do anything to get your fix even though you know it’s terrible for you to do so 

All you want to do is , kiss them , hug them and tell them your sorry and can we get back  together every thing is going to be alright 

Your ex can give you a your “fix” through many means- calls, texts, face time, snapchats, tweets , phone calls and even meeting for coffee and even meeting then for some loving in the bedroom department 

Just like any junkie, you need to detox in order to recover. And the best way to detox is to quit cold turkey. 

You will never move on with this person right there in front of you. 

Including in this is you may also ruin your chances of getting back together and making it last this time, but do you seriously want than when you analyse your relationship and potentially starting from scratch with another 

When a relationship ends, all the reasons it ended are still there that’s fact 

The issues didn’t magically repair themselves. If you get back together because you miss each other nothing will be different and you’ll just go through the same cycle of breaking up and making up… and this can go on for years!

I’ve seen a few posts from others having the same issue I am so apologies if you’re tired of reading. 😆 I’m at a bit of a loss and hoping this doesn’t turn into a ramble session, so here goes. 

I’m 44, never been married, no kids. I consider myself to be a very social, honest and just a good person to have around…and I’m certain the people in my life would say the same.  I’ve been single for about 6 years now, lost my dad 5 years ago and I’ve only been on a few dates since then for a few reasons. Part of that being the grief process and feeling as though I need to have myself together before I can really be in a relationship, but then a lot of it is not really knowing how to “put myself out there,” which is what my friends have told me I should do. I started doing OLD initially in the late 90s and realized a few years back that that arena has changed *immensely* in the way of expectations and general dishonesty. However, I have tried to give it a chance. I’ve met a few people, but things were less than ideal. From married people to catfish to one who stood me up (literally left me sitting in a restaurant after we’d been talking for about a week over text and the phone), my experience hasn’t been great.

So all that to say I’m pretty gun shy now and not sure which direction to take. I don’t really meet people the “traditional” way for any other purpose than platonic (which the pandemic obviously made worse), part of that has to do with me being a military brat in Alabama and having different views than a lot of people think I should  have (which is another show in itself😂). I get the “Why are you single? You’re such a catch!” all the time, but here I am talking to strangers on the internet about being single. 

TL;DR At this stage in my life, being a very social and open and outgoing person, I feel like a hamster on a wheel who may soon become a spinster. Anybody have any advice and/or in the same situation and want to talk about it?

I matched/have been talking with someone. We have kept the talking to pretty surface level, but a little back and forth each each. That’s what we both prefer until meeting. We were supposed to meet last week for a quick drink but had to cancel due to weather. We are back on for this week. He has been extremely polite and kind, certainly made an effort to initiate, though I also do too.

But the thing is, he’s incredibly fit and I…am not. I’m talking borderline bodybuilder/fitness/gym/running guy. Very good looking facially too and tall. Like I said, he is kind, polite and has good job.

Me - what most would say a very beautiful face, never had any complaints there. I am certainly curvy in a womanly way - large chest and thighs, shaped appropriately overall but just…also a bit fat to be completely honest. I also have a good job and he has shown some interest in that. I am also very active, healthy and I spend lots of my free time outdoors.

Soon after exchanging numbers, he said the two other times he met women from an app, they did not match their pictures and could I send some recent ones. All of mine were recent, but I understood his concern and honestly, why not be fully honest. So I walked right into my bathroom, took a full body shot (clothed!) and a face selfie. He replied “you’re beautiful”. That is the only thing he has said in reference to my looks. I’ve sent a couple more “fun” current pics that showed my entire body.

I can’t help but be worried he will be turned off in person, that I’m fatter than he’s expecting. I’ve been fully honest but I can’t help but think he’s drawn in by my face and will be turned off by my body.

I know, I know.. I won’t know until I meet him and be confident. Normally, I am very confident. I am beautiful and plenty are into my body, but am I being unreasonable in my fear? Any woman who has been rejected because of her size can understand and I hope others reading this can try to sympathize/shed some honest light for me. Oh and one last detail, I saw a pic that showed part of his ex and and is literally the opposite body type from me (very thin, small chest -very beautiful).

He was adopted; making his best friend his ‘brother’.  It’s very apparent he still feels he owes them and imo has formed an unhealthy co-dependent relationship with his ‘brother’. For example he (his brother) doesn’t drive or work; relying solely on my SO to pay his way in life. I’ve only been invited to sleep over a couple of times (they both still live at home).  I realize there’s only one bed, immediately a red flag, so I ask questions. No we don’t share a bed he sleeps on the couch in the tv room. My SO explained.  But something just wasn’t sitting right- add that with him always coming over to my house but never the other way around. Back to the topic, I went out of tow recently,  leaving my SO to look after my pets, even had movie night and slept over to keep them company.   Completely assuming (although not 100%) his brother was with him, i asked if I had left the spare bed made up or if I had forgotten?  He replied, it was made but he (his brother) slept with him in my bed …immediately it felt like someone punched me in the stomach.   Why?  Let me add that because of his ongoing inability to include me in his life I’ve been less inclined to allow him in mine; just weeks ago telling him I didn’t trust him. Don’t get me wrong I knew he wouldn’t steal or damage property but I didn’t trust he wasn’t going to hurt me. . I feel like just having his brother with him for the night, should have been something he brought up to me prior to it taking place. . If you knew your girlfriend didn’t trust you yet she allowed you the opportunity to have access to her house while she was away - wtf wouldn’t you communicate your comings and going’s rather than risk losing her???? !!!!  I still don’t understand why he didn’t just get up after the movie and go to the other room where a bed of his own was waiting???.. Even went so far as to tell him I felt sort of betrayed, if you will. I don’t even Understand what these feelings are that I’m having but i do know they aren’t good. To top it off his grand response was “he isn’t going to explain himself or argue over his brother”. Wow!  Okay. Meanwhile he slipped having said “I believe that was the first time he slept in your bed”.   When I asked for clarification not once but three times- he ignored me every time. He also tried using a story I told him about my son when he was an adolescent; having shared a bed with his best friend. Mind you his example was of my son and when he was like 11yo.  IMO not a comparison. Am I over reacting?

So I have been following dating groups here on Reddit and thought of sharing a situation my friend is in. He gathered a lot of courage to open up to me. So I will maintain the confidentiality. 

He is 30 years old, married with a 4 years old kid. He belongs to typical Indian family where marriage are arranged and people are still not open to acceptance about other things.  He is well educated and forward thinking person who like to connect intellectually with people and considers himself sapiosexual. Unfortunately his wife is typical homely Indian girl and doesn't have the intellect in the areas my friend craves. 

Anyways, he had to move to US for work and there was this gap for a year before his family could be with him. During that time he met with a woman who is 50 years old. They started taking and according to him, her independent, thoughtful nature and intellectual levels made him fall for her. Apparently, the lady is divorced and has 3 kids and she has fallen in love with him as well. The lady was made aware that he is married and has no intention of getting divorced. But she was already exploring the non monogomy when they met and since she met him, she again went exclusive with him. 

Now here is where things get interesting. My friend has no intention of getting divorced. ( The social norms and family tradition and respects along with his love for his kid being the reason ). But on the other hand he has never felt so strong about the lady whom he is seeing and had relationship with for past few months. However, he is sure that he can't open up about these things to his wife or anyone else in family as they are very orthodox. 

Given the situation whats the best advice one can give for my friend. His idea is to keep things going as they are but he feels guilty of cheating in a marriage. It's a messy situation and I really couldn't give any firm advice on this.

About my situation:
Wife and I are living in separate rooms and have been for two years with no physical intimacy but we are good friends and okay with seeing other people now and we open with each other about it. 
We have two young boys (7 &amp; 4). Despite living together, we try to split parenting time for boundaries.
We plan on moving out into separate homes but slowly since we want to live near each so the kids can walk over. 
We will get a divorce once we feel we need to (taxes, loving apart, significant other wishes) but not rushing it- we don't want any fighting and have done remarkable well so far.
She has a long distance boyfriend whom I text with (primarily to reassure him about our situation)

About me: I just started OLD. How much and when should I bring this up when dating? Profile, texting or in person? Id prefer to date someone divorced with kids b/c it seems like a lot for someone that hasn't gone through this at some point.

Interested in thoughts on either side of us
