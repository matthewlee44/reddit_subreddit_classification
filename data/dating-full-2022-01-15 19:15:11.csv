I know asking “What should I do?” when it comes to stuff like this is not the best, but i’d really appreciate if you gave my your opinion and advice on what’s going on. Thanks in advance! 😄

This is the thing. I’ve been crushing on a girl from school for the last 4 months. We met at the music assembly the school provided and we got along pretty quickly. I’ve been to her house twice and we’ve been to a small concert here at our area. I would love to tell her how i feel but here’s when things get a little complicated (In advance, i’m an over thinker, so if you think i’m just complicating things, no harm done). Apart from taking in school and those “dates” that we had she doesn’t text very much, and when I do, she always takes time in replying back or her answer just doesn’t spark any more conversation. For the past two weeks i haven’t texted her much because we are on summer holidays, but last Thursday I realised we’re vacationing in the same city so I asked her if she’d like to meet up and do something . She hasn’t seen it yet and it’s making me crazy, what’s worse, she’s seen the instagram stories i’ve posted but doesn’t take the time to reply back to my text. 
What do you think I should do? From the one hand, I believe she’s not interested at all and it makes me really sad, but from the other one, as everything else she’s done shows me she is interested, I find myself at a crossroads. I just don’t want to stop trying because i’m really happy when i’m around her, but i don’t want to keep trying if she isn’t interested at all.

I know this might be too much but i’d really appreciate your thoughts on it. Thanks!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1152520,public,self,Should I keep trying or give up on her?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s4s7c2/should_i_keep_trying_or_give_up_on_her/,no_ads,0.0,,

Overall it went well and I got set up for another to get together in a few days but I'm having a bit of trouble deciding on what to do next.

\~sidenote: I'm not sure whether or not what happened today is considered a date or just a get-together not to her because we never clarified it. I'm sure it was a date but I'm not sure whether or not she thought it was? I'm also wondering if I should ask if this is considered going out with her or not.

On the date, we got to know each other a bit more, talked about trips we went on, etc. One of the things that stood out the most about her is that she actually didn't have any hobbies. (she said she mainly does homework and sleeps all the time) Because of this, it has been a bit hard to find common ground and I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to maybe do some activities together to see if she enjoys a hobby that I enjoy also.

The below is my personal reflections on a 1.5 yr relationship that ended back in August 2021. 

.... 


I conditioned myself to become disconnected from myself because I was giving into emotion/heart/serving the other in the name of living from your heart &amp; being ""present"". This approach, while seemingly lovely &amp; sweet, can detach you from your rational, logical, wise self. It can also disconnect you from your future self. 

You may even delude yourself into thinking that it's your self-sabotaging running the show when really it's plain old discernment &amp; authentic you needing your attention. You rationalise the over-giving &amp; self-neglect using spiritual concepts &amp; philosophies - you use this to justify your behaviour &amp; reality. In doing this, you're in effect ""spiritually bypassing"" - you teach yourself to not really fully trust yourself because you've overlooked the validity of your feelings &amp; quieted your intuition. You've overshadowed your core, authentic self by perspectives that cause you to self-abandon &amp; lose yourself ultimately.  

That doubt &amp; cautiousness is real. It's not your insecurities talking, your past wounds festering or you sabotaging. It's not you living in ""the past"" &amp; not being present. Oftentimes the present is just too painful but you condition yourself to believe you're just reacting to the past so you can justify a current reality that's actually difficult to accept. Accepting it may mean needing to change it because it's not feeling right for you. 

Trust your feelings. Know you have discernment and wisdom that you can access. Tap into it. Trust it. Trust yourself more. Know that you have agency &amp; can make your own choices, even if the outcome will result in pain, in the long-run you will be avoiding needless suffering. Don't be afraid to be willing to pull back, invest less or walk away.  

~ 

Your rational mind needs to be a given in certain contexts. Stop underplaying the importance of it by getting carried away with away-with-the-fairies, wear-your-heart-on-your-sleeve, lead-by-the-heart kind of delusional approach. You're only gunna end up hurting yourself if you're choosing people &amp; situations that are not on your vibrational level. It's okay to not always be so emotional or allow this part of you to dominate. Some people can &amp; will use this vulnerability against you especially if they only seek to serve themselves. You do not always need to surrender everything or give all yourself away like that.  

Keep your rational mind in tune. Keep being connected to reality. Control &amp; keep your emotions in check when you can. It works better for you in the long-run. ",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1152537,public,self,"Were you just deluding yourself?

Peter has told me he is uncomfortable with me spending one on one time with David. I wanted to have an honest conversation with him and I asked why.

I think it’s important to say that they have met. We three went out for a drink and it all seemed completely fine.

I told him i was moving on because at the time i thought he was just done with me or playing me, but then he told me that he didn’t reply because he wants to explain things in a way i’ll understand because he doesn’t know what he thinks.

I texted him on new years and said “i hope everything is going well and i’m wishing you the best” and he replied “same for you (nickname he gave me), happy new year, un abrazo (a hug) ❤️” and i just liked the message.

And after going through a divorce 5 years ago where my ex would always call me crazy, for thinking there was something going on with the guy I had suspected. So this definitely made me think something was going on.

Quick background about this ex. She would constantly tell me that he was obsessed with her, and she almost had to get a restraining order. This was when we first started dating, and I never asked her to block anyone. Obviously this really hurt me, and she said she was only reaching out to get a number she needed. But they continued to text from about 2:00pm til about 8:30 when I saw his text reply to her. (Who knows what this could of lead too if I didn’t see this) She offered to let me go through her phone, and even though I’m 100% against that, I took her up and only read what they talked about.  It was all about Covid and how sick she had been and how me and her got it at the same time, so she included me in the conversation. But I still am upset that she said she blocked him, continued to text w him after he gave her the number she said she needed (which was the only reason she had to text him) Then not to mention and I think most importantly, she’s giving this apparent ex stalker a reason to go back to his ways, where he would purchase her expensive things all day. Including breakfast lunch and dinner that he would have delivered and also bought her a ring to propose to her right before we started dating. She chose me and told me she blocked him. 
Oh and when we started taking she had recently been divorced for about 6 months and told me she hadn’t slept with anyone since her divorce, but she admitted that she lied about that as well and had slept with him before we were together (I’m trying to not let this bother me, because I could see how she just didn’t want me to think she slept around a lot, but I don’t care about that)

Anyways, she said she would message him and apologize for texting him and it was inappropriate for her to text an ex bf while she’s in a happy relationship w me. 

But I told her to just block him again on everything because he’s an ex in the past that should mean nothing to her and she should have no reason to ever speak to him again. 

I’m just really overwhelmed, and we do love each other but this has me questioning everything. 

What do you guys think? Oh I forgot to add that she said she unblocked him about a week after she told me she blocked him, because she always does that with ex’s and unblocks after they stop calling and texting. So it wasn’t like she went out of her way to unblock him to text him a couple days ago.

He and I have a class together and we sat next to each other and hit it off really well. He asked for my number and then a date. He and I have been talking in person after our class and texting back and forth. 

He is very sweet and just really not what I was expecting. He and I were talking and the conversation shifted towards s*x (because I guess we are horny young adults) and he confided that he is a virgin and BELIEVED  in the philosophy so saving himself for marriage. (There is no shame in that sentiment, what works for some does not work for others). But he no longer wants to be one because he's afraid of the stigma of being a virgi. (What stigma? That I did not understand). I on the other hand am not a virgin. Which that doesn't bother him.

And he is nervous about Thursday. Like REALLY nervous. He's nervous about the intimate stuff that could potentially happen. Like it being a disappointment or something like that. I really like him. I was planning on giving him a hug and maybe even a kiss Thursday. But then I asked the question of ""Would you want to have s*x Thursday?"" Now, with him I've been nothing but understanding, or understanding to the best of my ability, and nice. I know sex is a two way street. He did say sure. I told him mull it over, because it's s*x, and he was raised to have a sacred view of s*x. After several hours (I fell asleep so I would like to think) of him mulling it over, he was okay with it.

Now I still live at home to attend my college classes. He rents a room that the land lord does not allow girls. If Thursday leads to sex, great, if it doesn't great. But I don't want the experience for him to be awkward or just bad. My first time was SOOO incredibly bad I just get red thinking about. I just want him to be comfortable and ideally not awkward (but I'm awkward by genetics, so there's that 😅). Anyways, I booked an AirBNB. I am pretty discreet, I'm not having s*x in my car or in a car in general. Public displays of indecency are gross and not my style.

I should clarify we never kissed or hugged but that is down to my own personal reasons and instead we both showed lots of affection in different ways like how we talk to each other and how we got each other very personal gifts at Christmas (They made most of the presents they got me by hand while I made one and bought the other one) and generally you could tell that there was a deep and meaningful connection. I even met their mum and they've met mine so the introduction to the parents part is all done. There were moments of silence where we just sort of looked at each other with those lovey dove eyes but it never lead to the age old traditional lean in kiss because again I have personal reasons for taking things slow and I believe they have realised this and yet they stuck along this far still with the same energy which has further lead me to believe that there is definitely something more than just good friends here.

So my issue is just before Christmas they got a job offer that is almost half way across the country which kind of threw me through a loop since I was just getting comfortable enough to start hugging and getting more what you class as physically romantic (hand holding, snuggling on the couch etc.) with them. Where they moved to has bad coverage so its made it rather difficult to keep in touch so I decided maybe I should just move on and just go back on the dating apps. But my issue is I really like this person and it was kind of hard to find someone like this who clicks with me on so many levels and due to how few people on any of the dating apps I actually like, I always end up running out of people before I even see someone I remotely like. I have also tried meeting people through other methods in the past but it always ended up just being one thing we'd have in common and then there was nothing to talk about. So then I'm stuck thinking maybe I should just wait until they next come up to visit their mum to have a talk with them and just lay it all out on the table to see if they would want to try a Long Distance Relationship but I don't want them to then be in a situation where they feel pressured to try a LDR and worry about maintaining a healthy relationship online with dodgy internet because at the end of the day to me it's their happiness that is most important in this situation. I'm not in a position where if they just wanted to be friends only that it would devastate me because I've reached a point where I wouldn't see that as the loss of a partner more so the gain of an amazing friend (Not that I don't have friends).

For context we're both in our mid 20's and neither of us drive so the only option for visiting is the train. We met on Tinder and they have always had an issue messaging online but with the move it's gotten harder on them. Also I know I'm young and that this could just be a passing relationship type thing but I at least want to clarify things with them and at least try.

So basically my question is, is it a stupid idea to talk to them about the situation, like should I ask if they want to try a LDR?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1152592,public,self,Howdy I am in a sticky situation.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s4xavw/howdy_i_am_in_a_sticky_situation/,no_ads,0.0,,

The first week she said she was deleting the apps, told me she wanted something serious, kept telling me about how she was growing feelings. We slept together, started to really grow feelings myself, and a week later she ghosted for three days, in which she slept with someone else before coming back to me (""I thought of you the entire time I was with him""). I reluctantly gave her another chance (I'd already effectively gotten over her emotionally), slept with her again, and before long she slowly stopped being active. 

Confronted her about it - she told me she was rethinking what she wanted her life to be like, and that she wants to get married soon, leave the state, and have a ""traditional life"" and that I wouldn't fit into that. So, over the course of ten days she went from having casual sex with multiple guys to wanting a ""traditional married lifestyle"". At twenty years old. *Okay girl, you do you.*

Why did I even *give* her another chance? Because the apps drilled into me that I didn't have a choice. After two months on Bumble and Hinge, this was the first person to meet up with me IRL, and the second person who would talk to me for an extended period of time.

I put a good amount of effort in my messages to people (on Hinge commenting/complementing/joking on something specific; on Bumble actually sounding like a real person in those initial messages). I'm at least an average looking dude - I believe my female friend when they say I'm hot (*this* girl said I was the hottest guy she'd ever been with but I don't really trust *her* on that). I've always been good at conversation, too. On Hinge, I'll barely get a few matches per week, and on Bumble I'll get a few more - either way, nobody wants to have a conversation that lasts more than a few messages. Nobody is interested.

Putting dating aside, I'm really happy with where I am in my life. I'm at the best physique I've ever been at, and I'm continuing the last stretch of my weight loss journey. I'm at a great company where people value what I say and my contributions matter. I've got hobbies I enjoy and great friends that I really love. But I have a lot of love to give and honestly I'm fucking lonely sometimes - er, ""I have emotional needs that aren't met."" (I have a sexual disability which means I can't really have penetrative sex or ""get off"" in a typical way, so it's mainly about emotional stuff for me. Always enjoy pleasing, though.)

And so I'm *drawn* to these apps, over and over. Whatever taste of romantic human connection they give me brings me back. I tell myself, ""if it can happen once, it can happen again,"" so someone is bound to come along on these apps who will meet up with me, and maybe they'll be healthier. But the intense frequency of rejections make me feel worse and worse about myself. And after my last experience, I realized that the lack of supply means that *whatever comes along, I'm conditioned to take it.* 

These apps make it clear as day that there are very few women out there who would be interested in me, so I'd better take whatever I can get. And frankly, I know I'm worth more than that. So I'm done. I don't know if there's a good way for me to date in person, at my age and during this level of Covid. But the least I can do is stop the toxicity. If I think reflectively, I'd rather take a bit of loneliness than this massive hit in self esteem. And boy do I feel like shit.

I have been single for almost 5 years. I have dated here and there during that time, but nothing super serious or concrete.

I’m finally at a place mentally and emotionally where I feel like I am ready to date again and would love for a relationship.

However, my weight is holding me back and I don’t know if I’m being overly hard on myself. I am 5’4” and 200 lbs. So I’m definitely “fat.” 

Is it silly to try to lose 50 lbs before dating or is it better to just accept this and realize that a real genuine person can love me for who I am?

We texted shortly the day after but I sent the last text and I haven't heard from her since. Which makes sense because it was just a hookup/casual thing so it's really just a one time thing. And now I just feel like shit because I know I'm really searching for a relationship, and that I get attached too easily/quickly to people.

2 years ago I was on bumble/tinder. I get a decent amount of matches, but nothing crazy. Some girls stood out to me more than others, and almost all of them lived far enough that I'd have to 

So, 2 years ago I matched with this really cute girl that was totally my type. We talked for 2 whole months (all online) and we really wanted to meet each other. She didn't live too far, but in order to get to where she was, I needed to drive because there wasn't any public transportation to get to her area. Because none of us drove, we just stopped talking. We still have each other on Snapchat and Instagram. She likes all of my posts, and I like all of her posts. Even though we talked 2 years ago, we still occasionally talk. Sometimes I DM her and sometimes she DMs me. Im really attracted to her and we have a lot in common, but I'm not obsessing over her and still go on dates with other people. Though recently, I've been thinking about her and wanted to DM her if she wanted to hangout (I forgot she doesn't drive). I didnt DM her though just because it was something I was thinking about doing, but wasn't sure if I should. Anyways, literally just yesterday, I posted something on Snapchat. Her and I haven't talked since summer, but she swiped up on my story and told me I looked cute and asked me what I was up to.

After some small talk, I decided to ask her. I was disappointed because I was reminded that none of us drive haha. She told me if there was a way if I could drive, then she would be totally down to hangout.

I decided to work on my license and getting a car. I know this sounds super cringy, but I'm doing it so I could hangout with her or go on a date with her. If things don't workout, at least I'll have a license and a new car, so this doesn't seem like a bad idea, just a cringy one.

He did this by saying we needed a break and said he'd check up on me. After not texting me at all, I got the memo that this was most likely permanent. I didn't hold any grudges or get angry at him about this as I mean, there's nothing I can do about his choice. A week after initiating the break, we talked again, and he told me he did mean to break up.

The reason he broke up with me was because we were having some personal issues in our relationship for a while, involving huge differences in how we process our emotions (me being the fiery, overdramatic one), trouble with impulsiveness (from my end), and me being impatient with how distant and introverted he was.

The first time we talked since the weeklong break, I did lose my patience a little bit and ask him why he was never responsive to me, even while we were together, and ranted a little bit about how I thought taking things slowly and always ""needing space"" just jeopardizes relationships and doesn't allow for people to be close. He got angry and we almost cut each other out of our lives completely in that moment, until I told him I couldn't end things this way, and that ending things with somebody while being on bad terms is extremely uncomfortable for me. He agreed, we cooled down and kept talking. 

Since then, I gave him a few days before I came to my senses and wrote him an apology, apologizing for my emotional outbursts, impatience, and intensity. I told him though, that I didn't think either of us were dealing with the dilemma properly. I was always overreacting and not being able to wait things out, and he was being very detached and hard to communicate with. I said we both need to improve on our communication in different ways.

He was cool about this and sent me a long text explaining to me why he chose to break up, to which I responded with (another) long text explaining some more things from my end and apologizing for other mistakes.

He said he still loves me and would wanna wait until we're both ready to get back together, but that it might be a long time. He said if not, he still wants to be my friend and can't kick me out of his life forever.

I was conflicted, since during this time, he's being extremely formal and acting like he's in a job interview, being very very distant (which was one thing that initially annoyed me and to all these issues), even as friends. He said we should only talk once every few days or so and not for a long time, and refuses to even talk about casual matters like what we did that day, refuses to crack jokes and be more lighthearted. He said he would like to do those things, but it just ""doesn't feel right.""

I'm not sure, but I think he might be taking this whole thing a little too seriously.

I've never really dated, and have not had much luck on OLD. I've been in 2 LTR, but I met those people through Uni and Work, and they just ended naturally, no drama. 

Bit of a long story, but in 2020 I finally met someone through Tinder. Someone who I thought was genuine and wanted the same things as me. We spoke every day for around 6 months until our first date. Turns out it was just an absolute headfuck. She broke things off with me 3 times. Twice we agreed to remain friends, and we still met up, but pretty much always ended up getting back together.

She had commitment issues due to past experiences, so naturally I always wanted to take things slow, just to ensure that she was comfortable with everything.

Anyway, the third time we got back together, we ended up meeting up for dinner. She initiated the ""us"" chat, as she usually would, asking how I felt etc. Asked if I was back on Tinder, and I wasn't. She was and was speaking to someone, told me his name (weird). Fair enough. The next thing she said was that she felt as though we hadn't finished, and yet again we were back to square one.

2 weeks later she broke things off. Stating she didn't have time for a relationship due to work and studies and was going to take a break from dating. Said we can't be friends because ""I wanted more"". Blocked me, and removed me from all socials.

I ended up finding out she started seeing the person she was talking to on Tinder previously around a week after she broke things off.

This pretty much crushed me. I was so confused with everything, it felt so sudden and abrupt. I admit, I didn't really handle everything in the best way with her. Trying to reason with her, going back and forth rather than respecting her initial decision of breaking it off due to being too busy with work and uni and not having time for a relationship. I wasn't surprised at that point why she blocked me. But I thought there was something there between us. After finding out she's seeing someone else, it all clicked. (I will note, the 2nd time we got back together we agreed to be exclusive. I thought the third time after what she said about feeling we hadn't finished I assumed we were exclusive again. Bad mistake.)

This person wasn't honest with me about what happened, and ultimately why she wanted to break things off. I atleast deserved a call to talk things through but it was through text. While I understand it's easy to just be dishonest, and send a text, it doesn't really help with closure from my side. And finding that she just lied fucked with me. I think if she told me she had met someone else and wants to give it a go, while ultimately shit for me, I think I would have handled it better.

Ultimately, I feel as though the whole experience is going to affect me in the future with dating. Worrying about if the person is genuine, and not just leading me on. I will take a break considering most of this happened last month, and to be honest I feel as though I need a little bit of therapy. I'm just at that point in life where I'm 30, quite lonely, and all my friends are getting married/having kids. As I said, I've not had much luck with OLD, so I think my confidence will be shot too.

For some context, almost 2 years ago my nearly 4 year relationship ended. Before that, I had some what dated in high school, but I was fairly inexperienced (as was my partner). Everyone I have ever dated was previously my friend and asked me out. 


I took some time for myself and I believe I am in the best mental head space I have been in, perhaps ever. 


I know the advice is usually get in shape, find hobbies, and talk to people. I'm happy to say, I am thriving doing this. 


I figure skate and dance, I'm at a healthy weight, and I went from being silent in public to being friendly. 


Besides one time being hit on and several times being catcalled (I really don't count these as genuine interest), no one has approached me as being interested. To be honest, I am also terrible at telling when people are flirting with me and I've never really learned how to flirt with people I'm not in a relationship with. It's so strange-- I'm very perceptive to everything else except when it comes to me. 


Before coming to reddit, I've asked my friends and family for advice and unfortunately no one had any. Everyone I know has either 1. Met someone in high school or their freshman year of college or 2. Is having no luck dating and have no idea how. The most common advice I keep getting is ""you won't find someone if you're looking."" I understand this to an extent-- not to focus on a relationship, but I also have had no luck with this approach. 


I know I have a lot of positive qualities. 


My friends would describe me as: kind, sarcastic, driven, and silly. I know when to be serious and when to have fun. I love adventuring, going to museums/planetariums, or just playing games or watching shows at home. I also value communication. 


I do have some fears or concerns when dating. 


1. I want to foster or adopt but I can't have biological children. I needed to have a partial hysterectomy due to health issues (obviously they wouldn't do it if it wasn't 100% necessary). When do I bring this up? 

2. When I enter a relationship (when it's official, not getting to know someone), I only do so if I want to be with that person longterm. I don't casually date.

3. I am only attracted to people I get to know at a personal level. I really can't do dating apps. I had tinder for 30 minutes before deleting it. 

4. I've only been with my last partner... intimately, in all aspects of intimacy besides kissing. I'm very open to trying new things and receptive to constructive criticism in that realm, but will this bother people? 

5. This may be a silly concern, but I don't really like bars or clubs and I don't drink. I am perfectly fine with people that do and have had fun with my friends while they were drinking. Will me not drinking while being this young be seen as an issue? I just don't like the feeling of being drunk or the taste of alcohol. It's not for any religious or deeply personal reasons. I just never got into it. 

6. I look...super super young. It does not matter how I dress. The ages I regularly get clocked as by strangers is 14-16. Even in tailored business professional clothes. 


And if it's relevant, I am 24 (NB), but still present very feminine and use female pronouns in public. I also don't have a gender preference when dating. 


Oh and just in case: everyone in my hobbies are either way too young, seriously dating, or straight/ gay the wrong direction to be interested in me. Which is totally okay, just a little tricky. ",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1152619,public,self,How do I go about dating in my 20s?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s4zq88/how_do_i_go_about_dating_in_my_20s/,no_ads,0.0,,
