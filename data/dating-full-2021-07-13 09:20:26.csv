Long post.

TLDR: Had only one partner for 8 years, got cheated on, covid happened, 1.5 years later first tinder date, first casual sex, was bad at first but then fun and eye opening 

Some background:  I'm a bicurious demi, have been bordering on asexual for a long time. To say I wasn't ever big on porn and masturbation as a teen is an understatement, and that certainly played a role in my development.

Anyway, I got into a relationship with my HS sweetheart at 17. We grew together, stayed together, had various phases, moved in together and eventually grew apart, she cheated on me and we split badly.

I learned a lot in the following 1.5 years of covid restrictions and two half assed situationships with friends.
I began noticing how many insecure, codependent and desperate tendencies I had been left with, and for how depressing and painful those times were, they were eye opening and somewhat regenerating. 

I finally started questioning my prejudice about friendships supposedly leading to better relationships, and other prejudices I didn't realize I had against dating apps, and, god forbid, *casual sex*.  

I didn't just want to ""get laid"" for the sake of it as I can please myself quite satisfyingly in single player, I just wanted new experiences with new people without the added emotional burden and frustration which I had had enough of.  

So I finally got on Tinder and landed some matches, one of which clicked more than the others circa a month ago. 
This girl is not only my type, she's much more experienced than me, more extroverted and slightly intimidating. 

Intimacy starts happening fast, and shit I almost feel like a virgin all over again.  

We cross the threshold on the 3rd date, and it's my first time after 1.5 years. It's not a good time. I feel detached from all of it, which is sort of what I was looking for, but also slow, awkward and *too fucking gentle*. Textbook demisexual, right?

It seemed like we just weren't sexually compatible and I was ready for her to call it quits but she was way more understanding and non judgemental than I thought, despite her experience and overall persona. 

That's where I realized that, as obvious as it sounds, *feelings and depth can be found in casual sex*. Yes, even through dating apps. No, they don't have to take over the situation. Yes, people can give you a second chance even if they have other options. 

We met again yesterday as I really wanted to please her and find out what she wanted to do to me. I got out of my head, had fun, gave head, she came.  

The awkwardness came back when she got to my D then she just lost the drive halfway through. Despite the will to keep the mood light and fun, this fucked with our heads a bit and we just said goodbye shortly after.  

Don't know if I will be seeing her again but honestly? I would have cared much more one year or even six months ago. I would have texted, chased, felt insecure AF, jealous about other people she's seeing, I would have questioned my sexuality and sabotaged my self esteem. 

Instead, I've realized I'm learning not to read too much into people's actions, their words, or even my own thoughts.  

Your partners have feelings and insecurities too even if they have a higher ""body count"", if they have never been romantically involved, if they have kinks you don't see yourself into that they fulfill with other people.

If they are in bed with you, they probably like you.  

Be open to change while keeping some distance. Be into it, get out of your head, but don't ever try to get into someone else's. Connection and communication can and should happen even without feelings, or at least before them.  

For anyone who could be in a similar situation, take the leap. Worst that can happen, provided you're both decent humans, is you will have a new experience under your belt.

I guess if anything were to be what's bad it'd be me, considering what people, life, experiences and whatnot have told me.

I'll tell myself it some more just so it sinks in well though.

Basically this post is some/all of my experiences so far, and I was wondering how I could have it so women prefer knowing me, not hurting me. I don't know how to have it be that way, I'm probably just not the type.

Anyways...

This first girl was very attractive, honestly one of the people I've been most attracted to. I wasn't exactly certain, but she declared her interest in me so that I wouldn't worry. which was pretty nice.

What wasn't so nice was how the day before my birthday she abruptly starts talking to me, sends me some pictures, and before I can even respond and as I get ready to look nice for a picture for her she says that she doesn't like the vibe between us and that we have nothing in common. (I'm wondering how a person can decide that when they offer none of their interests or likes, personally, but oh well)

So be that I guess.

\----

This second one is a bit more fun; for you all maybe. A bit after that first woman I start talking to another, and this person was quite a bit more forward than. Advances were made by her, and I reciprocated.

Plans were made to actually get together, and we traded intimate photos in addition to words and a few others things. We spoke and interacted so much, I don't think I've spent as much time on anyone within a day.

However, as with the last, a day came and all came to ruin again. Turns out she was still in love with another and didn't actually like me at all.

In fact, she said everything was only because she was bored.

...So be that too I guess...

\----

This final one... sucks. Let's just say that about it. (There were three parts/strings to it)

So a bit after that second girl I start speaking to another, not for long I'll admit, but it's about the closest I've been to a proper relationship. Last night we made plans to hang out for a portion of today. whihc honestly gave me sincere happiness, I've been in a city for quite a few years and haven't been able to make any friends or anything. So I guess it gave me some hope, you know?

However, here comes the first of those stings I was talking about; I wasn't the only perosn she invited over that day. She actually had another person over at her place for the morning. which I can't say made me feel the greatest.

How ever, supposedly this guy was so creepy that it made her not want to meet me today. This was the second sting, and it was understandable I'll give it that, I don't hold the ""not wanting to meet"" against her, the reason is sound. (I will say thought that I'm not appreciative of another's actions ruining plans of mine)

So Instead of meeting we just text for a good portion of the day.

But then comes the third and final sting, she spoke about still being interest in some person in a different town and that she wants to date them, not I.

...

...

***Sigh***

So be this too....

\---

TL;DR

Clearly women only like hurting me instead of liking me, how can I make that change? (My Mother's Mother liked hurting me too, intimately once upon a time)

&amp;Where is the wrong I'm doing? I can see the wrong others are, but not I. Could it be because I do none?

(Side wonder) I'm not the only one who missed when a rejection was when you got a ""No"" or ""Why would I"" when you asked if people liked you or wanted anything to do with you.

Aren't these one's games? they make me miss my first rejection, didn't hurt as much as these...

(Update)

Here's more following experiences, shortened.

You know that one girl who didn't want anyhting to do with me anymore because of that creep? (supposedly?) well I tried again with her considering that there was the want to meet up once.

However, now, all of a sudden, she's moving away and doesn't want anyhting to do with me at all now. &amp; She likes to say this bullshit about Tinder not letting her delete it lol...

Oh well, anyways...

This next one's simple. some girl I was speaking with basically said that she liked me enough where she wanted to speak more than just texting.

...this was some weeks ago though and she hasn't said anyhting since. \^\_\^

Fun.... this is what this is not, right?

\---

Now, my life's made me miss out on enough already. Being denied Sisters, my Mother, a Father and given only a life with being bodily-assailed as a kid and one as a inadequately sized smaller dude that's socially and mentally slower could've been quite better, I can see a few way where it would've went great.

I can't have that though, so how do I have a life that actually has women liking me, at all? I hear you kind of have to go through rejection (if you're unlucky) but I figured you'd eventually get a date or something at some point with the effort? When does that happen?

Honestly, at this rate, it looks like I may one day have someone I'm ""with""... but they'd likely cheat before even doing anything with me. :) (Is this all meant to make me see good or be positive? lol...)

Those people who are never rejected and are only ever asked out have me jealous right now; it's likely nice.

A bit nicer than being rejected by everyone, even the people who supposedly ""like"" me \^\_\^

(So, let me list it just in case.

I'm allowed to be raped, as a kid.

allowed to be the child of a Rpaist.

Allowed no Mother or Sisters because they all died together

allowed a small penis

allowed social and mental slowness

allowed skin conditions, especially a mean face one

...I'm allowed all of these, but I'm not allowed to date or anything.

And I do not think even in arrange marriage anyone would like me by their own choice (except for my degree). Coz I am that horrible appearance, features, accents and all such other features that make a male attractive to a female. Also, I read EVERYWHERE about how Indian men are look the ugliest and are the worst, written by a lot of people but most of all by Indian women. I am deeply hurt by reading all this and I want to get over this once and for all by becoming asexual by getting a castration. Coz if I get a castration, then the natural need for female companionship will go away and it wouldn't matter anymore than I am too bad looking and that women consider men from here as so bad. As it will not matter anymore if women like me or not if I become asexual through castration.

So I am asking about whether I should consider getting a castration? Or what about surgery to change my skin color into something more fair? Would women like me then, and at least want to befriend me?

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
I have never directly been told by a woman/girl that I am ugly and no one would want me and all that. But that is likely because I have never tried talking casually to a girl. If I tried talking to girls, it is very likely I would be shunned away for being ugly, dark skinned, awful round face, very ""uncool western"" accent etc. Also, no girl has EVER tried to talk to me and befriend me, unlike lot of other guys who have tons of female friends and girls come to talk to them themselves. But that's never happened with me, that suggests something about how girls must be finding me awfully unattractive.

Life is bad for Men. Dating is rigged to the core against us. Women are the employers, Men are the job seekers. We either go over the top to end up with someone who slept around and now wants a guy to care for her now that she is 30+; someone who makes way less; or both. Love and equal partnership is dead. I wish people actually believed in love from 20s till death the way they used to. Being with someone who slept around in her 20s while you kept pure is not love.

I was rejected by my dream girl 3  years ago. Everything I ever wanted in a parnter. Smart, Ambitious, kind, caring, wait till marriage, good with kids - all stuff I brought as well. We got along really well. But she rejected me. Now I respect her right to do so but I cannot find anyone nearly as amazing as she is. Also, while I am expected to accept her grounds, I am not allowed to have standards. I've been attacked for wanting someone who hasn't slept around w/ a bunch of frat guys and now wants a stable guy to settle down with. I've been attacked for not wanting to be with someone significantly less successful, despite me having a tough childhood and overcoming a lot to be where I am. Women still seem to see Men as providers and Men are just expected to be ATMs. (Despite me being good with kids so really I should be the one to marry up).

My undergrad was the only place I made meaningful connections with people. It is where I met my dream girl. School was full of ambitious, smart, 18-22 year olds who enjoy discussing public affairs. It's collegial environment promoted meeting people. Many people find their match there - many of my friends and acquaintances have. Outside there though, hook up culture has just destroyed love and made things hell for men.

And the pressure to enter into a loveless arranged marriage comes hanging from my parents.

Now I really want to have kids. If I was a Woman, it would be easy. Just hook up, have a kid, and extract child support. But since I am a Man. I cannot even do that. I would need to find someone to be with and hope they don't divorce and take the kid. Or someone who let me have a kid with her and will waive all parental claim. Being a Man really makes me screwed.

I am vaccinated, my whole family is vaccinated.  My sister is pregnant, she's been vaccinated.  Both my sister and I have science degrees, and my family is mostly in STEM.  We live in California in Silicon Valley and the attitude here is very pro-vaccination.

However, I feel like I won't be able to introduce him to my family when the time comes.  

There are other issues too, like I have bipolar disorder and need to take medication for that and he is sort of anti-medication unless absolutely necessary, more into natural healing.  I haven't talked to him about my bipolar yet.

I rushed into things and took down my online dating profile, and we agreed to be monogamous, and now I feel like I was jumping into things too soon.  We have some pretty fundamental differences.  Also, I am a democrat/liberal and I vote and he doesn't vote.

There are some things we agree on though, like he doesn't want kids (I don't want kids either)  and he doesn't want to move in together which I don't want either.  

I am thinking maybe I can just keep this casual, and work on improving myself in the meantime.  I'd like to improve my health and grow as a person.  As long as I can keep improving my health and becoming a better person and he doesn't get in the way of that, I feel like maybe I can continue to have sex with him like once a week.  

The only issue is that it is going to get in the way of me meeting a man who might be more compatible with me.

Things have been going well but I can’t help but feel there’s a few things that seem off. This guy told me that he was abused in his last relationship and was scared to say no to his ex and stuff but I am unaware if it was physical as he didn’t say and I didn’t wanna pry. I understood and told him a few things I had experienced. 

Yesterday I mentioned I was going food shopping and he said he’d make it fun if he was with me and I asked how. He then said he’d slap me with items of food and I couldn’t help but think that was a bit odd, I know partners joke about and play fight and stuff but something about it just seemed weird but I joked back with him and said I’d push him into some toilet roll for a laugh then he said he’d push me into anything then I said well not too hard it might hurt and he then said yeah it might. 

Lastnight we were talking and even though I hadn’t brought up anything sexual, he kept making the conversation sexual and i told him I wasn’t comfortable with it and that he should respect that he agreed and said he would respect it and apologised. I get the feeling this guy is also a little clingy as he asked if I was going to ignore him as I told him I was gonna play Xbox for a bit on Sunday night even though I had literally spoke to him all day. I then told him that I like to do my own thing and I like my own space and that if he doesn’t like that then that’s fine but he’s also got to respect that and he said he would. No issues regarding that so far.

This one is gonna sound stupid but he’s literally just told me like 20 minutes ago that his dog randomly bit a delivery driver that came to his house and had apparently never bit anyone before. I don’t believe him because dogs don’t just bite for no reason, and they always give a warning before hand, he thinks it’s because the delivery guy was pushing the dog down when it was trying to play, just doesn’t make sense and seems odd. He then told me that he sorted the guy out with a plaster and got him a drink and stuff I just felt like the getting him a drink part was totally irrelevant?? Like why would he even mention that? We are still talking about his dog and I didn’t reply for like 5 mins and he sent me another message saying don’t let this affect us please? Like wtf lol 

I’m freaking out a little now because all of these little things but as the reader and an outsider what do you think? Am I overreacting??

Hello r/dating, 

At the beginning of the year, I decided to stream on r/distantsocializing . I was just talking about some life changes and a new job I had started. Another Redditor commented on my stream and began engaging in some witty banter back and forth with me. We continued to chat via messenger and eventually moved on to talking/texting everyday. Rapidly things got more and more serious. Neither of us were actively seeking ANYTHING with ANYONE and she just crashed into my life and absolutely changed everything for me. She has become my best friend, my rock, my everything in the last year. After meeting in person we’ve decided we’re going to be moving in with one another and taking our relationship to the next steps. I never thought I would get another crack at love (I went through a divorce in 2019) and she had taught me so much on what love means and continues to amaze me everyday.

First of all, there is no fucking definition for ugly. Social media and television and whatnot have created ridiculous standards regarding physical appearance.

But I can’t commit because of something that I haven’t told her. I don’t know how she will react to it if I would tell her this and if she would still want to be in a relationship with me.

So I called her and I assured her that the feelings are real but I told her that there is something that is holding me back to fully commit to her I didn’t got in details because just alone telling her that there’s something holding me back was really hard. I even was nearly about to stutter the whole time. She said that she found that good that I told her that but she really want to know what is and that I shouldn’t prepare myself because she will get back to that when the moment is right for her. So I don’t know if I will have the guts to tell her but I really don’t wanna lose her because just by entering in my life last year her I really began to know what it means to be in love with someone but that’s also a whooooole ‘nother story. I’ts not that I could get another girl tough because I would say that I am handsome and  that other people (women) are also saying it to me but yeah I really love her. At first she was really reserved and shit and while dating she managed to open herself and share with me some secrets And she also revealed to me that she is very sensitive like sensitive af but I noticed it before she even revealed it to me. That’s one of the reason why I love her because she began to open herself to me which she couldn’t even do to her bf which i highly appreciate from her.

We finished the night walking around the lake together, and made plans for a second date Thursday. We went for lunch together today, and we're looking to fit another lunch date alter this week, and a proper evening next week.

She has mentionned to me that she took a while to get attached and that she was a little shy, and since she said she wanted something serious, I haven't been pushing much. So far we've only held hands and hugged a couple times. But this being the first time I'm embarking in something serious, I'm a little worried I'm not/won't push enough by giving her too much time and that she'll lose interest.

The last few days though, I get the feeling the conversation isn’t the same. She’s not continuing the conversation, more acknowledging what I’ve said rather than responding if that makes sense? We have since we met agreed the times and place of another date in 5 days, which is obviously a good thing, though.

I’m wondering whether she’s not feeling it anymore but doesn’t know how to say it maybe? Maybe she’s the opposite and she’s scared because I’m still around after she told me some big stuff? Maybe I’m acting differently because I’m overthinking? I just don’t know.

What’s best to do here? Part of me doesn’t want to guess and just ask her if she’s still interested, but if she is, I don’t want want to come across as needy (which I realise I do sound. Probably because I am a bit).

She's funny, sexy and intelligent. Here's the kicker.. She has a boyfriend and i have a girlfriend.

The funny thing is, i din't go looking for this. The first time we met, i remember thinking oh shit. I have to be careful here. Next thing you know we were talking, laughing and just generally having a good time. Nothing much happened that night and i thought i had put my feelings to rest, until two nights ago.

We met up again for drinks after she finished her shift. Again everything started out innocent but over the course of he night, i started to feel like maybe she was into me. The way she looked at me.. Damn it turns me on just thinking about it. We spent a lot of time talking yet again and at the end of the night i walked her to the train station and that was it.

The thing is, i'm sure she's thinking the same thing i am, we shouldn't pursue this. I wish i could forget about her but i find her dominating my head space. I texted her a few hours ago and she didn't reply and now i feel like shit. It's the first time i've tried to reach out via text and so far looks like i've been ghosted.

Anyway.. my question is WHAT DO I DO? These feelings are strong and all i can think about is her. I feel guilty because i have always been loyal and something like this has never happened to me.

Also feeling a bit confused as i thought the feeling was mutual but her lack of response says otherwise?

A man today goes into society and is surrounded by many attractive women and his sexual desires naturally prompt him to approach them, or, at any rate, he goes on the online mediums and tries to find a woman there. 

But the disciplined man neither submits to women nor does he have a great amount of desire to seek women for pleasure online. He says to himself ""I must do what is good for both my present and my future"" and so he knows that by devoting his time constantly to women, he is focusing more on obtaining pleasure for the present than for preparing himself for the future. 

This is why intelligent women tend to find such men unattractive because they can easily see that he is undisciplined and is interested in them for their bodies. Hence, they draw away from such men and label them as ""creeps"", ""perverts"", ""weirdos"", etc... They say this because they know the truth, which is that the busy disciplined man is the attractive man. 

The undisciplined man, when he goes to a party, immediately starts making himself comfortable and starts looking for a woman to chatter with. He treats everything like it's his living room.  

But the firm and disciplined man doesn't do this. If there is a woman he finds attractive in his company, he doesn't attempt to lavish her or start toying with her brain, as eager men are wont to do, but rather he behaves like himself and only speaks when he feels that what he will say is better than saying nothing at all. This is what makes him mysterious in her eyes and they sometimes become more interested in knowing more about him. 

But sometimes people say that the disciplined man is a prude because he doesn't dance or act silly. This is not true, the disciplined is capable of dancing, but he does so in a moderate way and not in an obscene manner as is common in the vulgar establishments of large cities. 

When people are drinking, he only takes the amount he's comfortable with, when a pretty woman says starts trying to ""pick his brain"" or ""test him"", he responds as if she were just anybody and then informs her that he has to attend to his clients or projects soon.

When it comes to taste in women, the disciplined man would only go for a likewise disciplined woman. He looks for this trait just as much as he does beauty and when people ask him why he does this, he responds that he must be with someone with who he can harmonize and that going for a woman solely for her physical beauty is the sign of the undisciplined man.
