Anyway, we had a somewhat heated talk, and point my GF made is, she doesn't like how I treat her, she likes how other real man used to treat her before me.

 Let me explain: she says she used to man inititating everything , for example on weekends, she expect to fully pick places for us to go, restaurants, and then just tell her post factum what I chose and if she agrees to all this. However, the way I used to do, is I suggest few options, like movie, at home, restaurant, museum, she picks one, I offer option from that choice, and etc,aka I always make her make a choice, and she doesn't like that. It became a problem in one week where we didn't have a plans for weekends because it was hell of a busy week for me, and  I forgot to make plans with her except the fact we spend both days together. So when in the late evening I started asking what she would prefer, she just said I must suggest everything , and basically stopped communicating with me until next day(we live separately). It kinda stinged a bit, because in my eyes, both partners have fucked up if no plans were proposed by anyone. 

Another thing she said is, she wants a man who wakes up and his first thought is how to make happier. Now , in my defense, I believe I do a lot for her. For example, whenever we meet , I usually either buy food for her (we both love food, and it's usually something good like variety of fruits, and something tasty), or I cook it myself , because I love cooking. I also usually gift her flowers once per month-two, and occasional gifts. We don't have any problems in any other area, aka support, encouraging, communication etc., however all this makes me feel underappreciated when she says stuff like this, especially when she really doesn't do anything like this for me. So it all feels to me a bit one sided, and I tried talking to her, but she says it's normal to have gendered roles in relationship, and is used to being treated like that. 

Because my point is obviously biased, I don't know if I am reasonable to judge what she said. Because I kinda demand somewhat same energy from people in relationship, and she obviously isn't used to it. So my question is : am I reasonable for thinking she is too selfish for all that, or is it really me not willing to do my role in relationship?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164444,public,self,Am i in the wrong for thinking what my GF said is too selfish,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tnl3lw/am_i_in_the_wrong_for_thinking_what_my_gf_said_is/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Should I tell her this or should I stay passive?
This cute girl that started at my work a few months back and I started chatting ever since she started. We always give each other hugs, she's always flirting with me and checking up on me while at work and always trying to make sure I notice her. --‐------------------------------------ Well we recently started texting. She doesn't respond much due to her having 2 jobs, due to not having much money.

Understandable- a co-worker/my employee that I manage has also been chatting with her and I overheard a conversation that they plan on meeting over the weekend and hanging out. She mentioned to me she wants to grab dinner but when I set up a time and day she says she will text me and let me know. She never texted me. She did mention to me that she is wanting to take it slow since she has been married and divorced twice now.

So far this week I've been keeping it very short, only speaking to her if we cross paths at work and keeping it very minimal just to test the waters. She has been looking at me and smiling but hasn't really came up to me to talk. Not even that she forgot to let me know about meeting. Just has been giving me the eye like wtf, why haven't you said anything to me. Yesterday she gave me a hug and asked me how I've been. 

Should I ask her why she didn't text me about letting me know if we were going to hang out and tell her how I feel about her and that I'm not interested in a ""love triangle"" type situation with other coworkers? Or should I still play the game and just keep it short?

I know what I'm gonna get mainly about like focus on yourself and move on, but I PROMISE you this one is different. I (23M) has been crushing on my now ex-girlfriend (24F) since the 11th grade. I've known her for 7 years and have been in a very serious committed relationship for close to 5.

 I'll spare you the details but long story short our relationship got to a point where I was personally sick of it, and I initiated the breakup. I guess her being on board with it was unexpected? but it kinda hit me that it was really over and I've been feeling sick all week. 

I made an effort to not talk to her, but I also made the personal decision to not keep any close friends so now I have no one to really go to for help. I caved and we talked for a bit, we had initially agreed that we wanted it to be a break, but after a week she is seeming to be okay with it not being a break. 

My plan is to be her friend for long enough that we can just try again, completely detached from our first attempt at a relationship. I've been in several relationships that have lasted, and so has she, but it was very evident to us and those around us that our relationship was very different in a special way. I truly think we are made for each other, but meeting so young made for us planting bad seeds that flourished into us breaking up. 

Once again I know that some of you will say to just move on or focus on myself, and I do plan on focusing on myself for a bit, but I would really just like some support or advice on what to do to get her back at some point, this was my shot at love and I don't wanna be the person who has a ""one that got away"" later in life.

Basically since I started high school I’ve liked this girl… Lemme start by saying that I’ve virtually never spoken to her for a proper convo at all, out of circumstance and shyness ig.

year 7 started the catch feeling.. it was pretty mild, and I moved countries so it faded.. I came back to the country a year later same school and my brother became friends with hers which made me think of her again and feeing came up again.. for the rest of that year it was there.. Covid then came and feelings existed but we’re forgotten again.. Covid ended and every time I see her sometimes I think about the feelings but not super deeply, I try to forget it because I’m focused on studying..

Around 3 days ago I had surgery on my wrist as I got a fishing hook stuck in my wrist.. after the surgery in the recovery room her mum was legit the nurse.. I’d never met the mum but she knew my parents and brother…. I want to be a surgeon one day so I had a quick chat with her about working at the hospital before she got moved by her boss.

Obviously talking to the mum brought up these feelings for her daughter again..
VERY uncharacteristicly I messaged the girl, Let’s call her (V).
Told her to thank he mum for me ect, we talked for around 45mins over text that night before she said she had to sleep. We then talked again the next day pretty broken convo 30-40min response times from both of us.. same thing today.. eventually today we hit a point where the convo just wasn’t going anywhere..

Keeping in mind I was high as hell I must have grown a pair of massive kahonas cause I asked a dude from her friend group if she was dating someone and had psyched myself up to ask her out!..
Anyway she has a boyfriend and at this point idk what to do… all I think about is her, and I know if I try to forget it’ll just come back up later.

I honestly have no clue what to do.. tbh I have 0 clue if she likes me.. I’m thinking No tbh. I mean other than the fact she doesn’t like white fish we even seem like a perfect match, she speaks like me when texting.. legit identically it’s shocking, she even wants to become a nurse for little children.

What should I do? HELP…

I’ve gone through some personal change lately, much more confident and outspoken.. which explains the kahonas growth lol",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164445,public,self,I am honestly so lost and don’t know what to do!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tnlreb/i_am_honestly_so_lost_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,no_ads,0.0,,,

We are both 25 and both STDs free.
We both talked and agreed about having kids but not in the near future.
The issue comes because she is very anxious about not wearing a condom. I'm a medical professional so I'm fully aware of how does the contraceptive pill work and when its efficacy might be jeopardized (antibiotics, alcohol, vomiting, etc - in this cases, obviously we would use a condom), but even then she won't even listen to me.
I told her that this is a big deal for me, but I also told her that I wanted to support her and to not let her feeling under pressure. When I ask like ""in a couple of years you think you'd be ready to ditch the condom"" she would always reply as ""don't know"".
Again, I would reafirm that it's her body and her choice, but that would be very meaningful to me.
The thing is, over a bigger time frame, it would become an absolute deal-breaker for me.
How can I deal with this? Nowadays everytime I touch this issue it always starts an argument...

And it’s not like I don’t want to! (Well I have a lot of anxiety sabotaging me rn but it wasn’t this bad honestly, I think it’s the fact I’m old now that makes me scared to be judged). When I was younger I was in an all girls school which was already quite hard to meet a guy, I wasn’t friends with the popular kids and was shy so I didn’t really meet with any of the guys of the neighbouring schools either.

When I went to university I was very determined to do my best! However it didn’t… for the first time I had a few (not a lot mind you, like 2-3) run ins with unsavoury guys (one even followed me onto the train and just stared at me..) and the guys I was interested in I did my best to chat and talk and get to know them… and then I got to know their long term girlfriend, wife or the fact they had a kid (look, they don’t always where rings especially with my degree ok I’m not dumb… I’m a little dumb but fr some of them married straight out of highschool like why 😭). Literally every guy I was interested in was already committed and the last year of uni was all work no play anyway.

And once I graduated I thought, hey, I’m going to be better, I’ll go out and force myself to socialize and even try go clubbing (I’m very introverted)… then Covid came. 

I got a job but it’s a 50 minute drive all the way to the farms and it’s 5 days a week so by the time the weekend comes I’m ready sleep the weekend away. Before I realised it I’m turning 25, and I’m full of anxiety. I’m not bad looking, I’m not hot but I’m kinda cute. I think…

Online dating I text a bit with someone but now when they ask to meet I get very anxious and stressed, which I feel like shouldn’t be the correct response ahaha. Idk I’m definitely self sabotaging here I can see that I just don’t know what to do. I want to date but I also want to couch potato. At least being a potato won’t hurt me (short term).

This is gonna be more of a rant, but I’m sick of the commitment-phobic people on dating apps. It seems like most people on dating apps want to do anything but date. The purpose of the app is to DATE. But everyone seems so emotionally-unavailable for whatever reason. If you’re still hung up on your ex, have baggage from past relationships, then you should be using that time to HEAL rather than being on a dating app. 

Even on Bumble and Hinge, where they’re known to be apps for people looking for something serious, it’s become a cesspool of people with commitment issues looking for one night stands. I’ve even tried expanding my age settings, because naturally I’d assume that men in their early to mid 30’s would finally be ready to settle down. But it’s still 35 year old men with “Don’t know yet?” Or “Looking for something casual.” In their Bumble bios! At what age will people STOP having commitment issues? I cant imagine being 35 and still looking for hook ups on dating apps for the rest of my life and being happy with the idea of growing old with nobody by my side. 

I realize that not everybody thinks like this, and some people are genuinely satisfied with the idea of not settling down for their entire lives. But it that’s the case, then those people need their own hook up app. Meeting people organically has been a struggle for me, so the concept of online dating gives me an outlet to meet new people. It’s just very disheartening to see so many people within my age range not interested in settling down when I am 100% emotionally available and ready.

My family that I have been taking care of for the past 3 years are mentally ill and require a good bit of attention, I have a big heart I just don't have the means of showing it to anyone and I don't think my state lines up well with my interests. I work 2 jobs, 3 seasonally all around the graveyard shift. I come home, and further have to take care of my parents once they get up, I have rather terrible insomnia and I've been feeling really unstable for a while. I always smothered it with love best I could and my girlfriend of 5 years has left me and I don't even know the full reason, I always tried to make an environment we could talk about anything but she didn't talk to me about issues that we're plaguing her, My family moved us again and I tried to work my ass off to get into a spot to resume the relationship normally but as soon as I got in that spot, she dumped me, the entire month sending me baby pictures and marriage photos and saying she missed me so I feel a bit betrayed to say the least. 

My online friends tell me i'm being abused by my parents but I don't know. They withhold money away from even important things like rent, electricity etc. and even refuse to talk about things sometimes. They throw things at me and call me names. That's on top of trying to navigate their episodes and making sure they get their medicine.   I have no irl friends and I'm not physically or emotionally close to my extended family anymore because over the years we've done nothing but move constantly, and I've had to work so I just didn't have time to keep up with anyone.

We don't normally go out since we are both busy (at least I am) with school and work. So now all I think about is her and well recently she said she wants to live life and not be stressed from work and school and wants to travel around and make a youtube channel. She had a guy bestfriend who stopped talking to her but now she mentioned that they started talking again and he seems busy ( I'm guessing she talked to him to get him to go travel around) anyway I had really been crushing and wanted to ask her out but in person and not over the phone. It seems now that I won't be able to in person for a while since we've been busy and I don't want the guy bestfriend to make a move (i think hes into guys but idk). She doesn't plan on traveling yet more like in a few months when school is over. Should I do ask her on a date over the phone or is it too late or the wrong time?

Yes I'll ruin our friendship if she doesn't say yes but I am willing to risk everything.

So I’m a lesbian, 25 y/o. So I went on a couple dates with a girl who is a single mom. I went into it not thinking I would be as attracted to her as I was, and after 2 dates and a week of texting, we both have admitted to some strong feelings happening between us. 

Her son is 2 so practically a baby and we hangout late in the evenings after 9pm when he is sleeping (this is late for my bedtime schedule but worth it). The relationship with her child’s father and her is great which is nice. She is still in the closet (which I totally respect) but is absolutely %100 a lesbian. 

I’ve been in a relationship with a woman who had a 2 year old before, but it was unexpected &amp; really bad timing in life for me, I was also younger (21) at that time. 

Now that I’m 25, I’m having a lot of strong and mixed feelings about possibly dating this girl. The absolute only thing I worry about at this point on her end is the fact that she is busy as heck, and I can be needy for attention (working on it…lol). And the possibility of future things, like watching her kid I feel extremely anxious about. Will this get better in spent time? 

Otherwise, I worry that I am not in a realistic position in my own life currently to be taking on more than just hookups, but this girl really came unexpectedly and caught me off guard in my little shell of figuring out life. There are many paths I could go on, could this be the one calling me? 

I really like this girl and can see potential in the future of this really working out. I feel young and free right now, but I also feel that her attention is so undivided on me when I’m with her.  I’m scared I’ll never meet someone like her again. Is it right person, wrong timing? I feel like I could just become extra work for her which is the last thing I want to do; I want to be able to help her. 

Should I pursue things further or leave her be (as I am too much of a risk for her)? I want to express these feelings and thoughts to her but we’ve only known each other for a couple weeks so I worry it would sound too forward and overthinky, plus I haven’t had a chance to get together with her in person in a while (busy week) so I’ve had too much time to overanalyze things.

Before I met her, I didn't want a relationship of any kind, not even a casual date, and she completely changed that. After a couple of times hanging out with our friend groups we started going out on dates, spending the night at each others places and spending time creating and enjoying art together. Every time we have hung out has been a 10/10 experience.

A couple of weeks ago though, she let me know that she is not ready for any kind of serious relationship and doesn't want to rush into anything, but also that she is has so much fun with me and wants to keep seeing me. She tells me that I inspire her, that she feels a real connection with me that she almost never does, and that she has never met someone like me ever. But she said she  needs to work through a lot because she has not had a lot of time to herself due to her last relationship which seems like it was controlling and manipulative. She then mentioned that she would love it if we still went out on dates and kept getting to know each other, but have things be ""casual"" so that she can be with herself for awhile. I told her that I totally understand, I've been in my fair share of abusive relationships. I said that I'm not trying to speed into anything serious either and that I just want to build this connection in a healthy way, which she was thrilled about.

Since then, we have been out on a few dates and even had sex for the first time together. The quality of our time together hasn't diminished at all and our chemistry is still rock solid; even better honestly. But I have noticed that since we had that conversation she doesn't text me as much and isn't as available; sometimes I don't hear from her for days and sometimes she won't respond to hangout requests at all. She says she hates having a phone, which I believe because she never even checks the time on it when we're together, sometimes she even leaves it at the house. Her friend who I'm close with says she has the same problem with her, she can hardly get a response. But I can't help but still feel anxious when I don't hear from her because she texted me a ton in the very beginning. It makes me think she's with someone she likes more, which I recognize is my own insecurity to tackle. My feelings for her are deepening, and while I still want to move things at a healthy pace and not burn too hot, I'm starting to realize that I actually do want something serious with her in the near-ish future.

He initiated the conversation of if I was looking for more. I initially said it depends on the guy, but that I would like to start dating somebody. After a few more meetups, I felt more connected, so decided to go out on an actual, non-sexual date. 

We had a blast. I laughed the whole time, we played pool and grabbed dinner/drinks. We both agreed we wanted to start dating instead of just fucking. We both agreed that it wasn’t anything exclusive yet, but we did set up a plan to see a concert when he got back. At the time, he genuinely seemed excited, and looking back I still am under that same impression. 

He was leaving to go out of the country for a few weeks the day following our date. I texted him a thank you and let him know I will be buying the tickets for the show when they went on sale, and also wished him safe travels. He replied immediately and said it sounded great, sent a couple emojis. At this point I’m convinced we’re cool. 

While he’s out of the country, I didn’t hear from him. I do take some fault as I didn’t text him first, but I didn’t want to run up a bill for texting overseas while he’s seeing family. I don’t hear from him for weeks. When he’s back he texted me that he had “changed his mind” whilst abroad and that he started having anxiety about dating somebody, but despite all this he still said I was a really great person. He asked if we could still be fwb, but I declined as I was … a little hurt. 

I’m confused. And I’m wondering what I did wrong. Why would somebody say all this just to change their minds? I didn’t see any of this anxiety or doubt while we were out, we had what I felt was a pretty magical night. When I asked if I did something wrong he stated no and reiterated that I was a really great person. 

This is actually the second time this had happened to me. I’m looking for advice on how to prevent this from happening a third time.

He’s autistic, but he’s also college educated, funny as hell and a great human being.  We are trying to figure out a way for him to meet someone to have a long-term relationship.

While his personality quirks keep him from being a high earner, he is employed and has insurance and a pension plan. It takes a little time to get used to his eccentricities, but once you understand him, he’s super easy to get along with. An example would be that it seems like he’s ignoring you, but his mind is just focused on something else, so you have to give him a verbal nudge to get him to pay attention. Also, he’ll sometimes chuckle out loud because he’s thinking of something funny. That scares people off if you don’t know him. 

He’s super sweet and would be kind to anyone. Loves movies, pets, walks and looking at memes on the internet.  He’s in good shape and a good-looking kid. A person’s looks wouldn’t be that important to him. What would be important (to him and to us) is that they are a kind person who is comfortable with themselves and could overlook traits that others would not.

What we need from you guys is where the heck do we start looking for someone? 

I don’t want to put him on some dating apps where they will eat him alive or make fun of him. I’m trying to find the best place to go to find people who are seriously looking for long term relationships for people in his age group, or even a little older. I’m not afraid of paying for a service, I just have no idea what the best service would be.

Any advice would be appreciated. As you can tell by me reaching out to random people on the internet our friends haven’t been much help. We’re all too old.
