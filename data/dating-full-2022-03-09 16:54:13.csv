Met him on a dating app - first date was really good and he talked so many times about ‚Äúsecond date‚Äù. When I wanted to pay for my share he even cheekily teased me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre offering to pay because you‚Äôre going to ghost me after this am I right‚Äù. 

Felt like he did enjoy himself a lot, he texted me right after that and then the conversation just ran over to the next day and so on. 

And then we were texting for one week. He didn‚Äôt ask me out - He mentioned about bringing me to this new dessert place but that‚Äôs it. No concrete plan. Yet he was texting me A LOT - like double texts, questions, and even wanting to call.

And yes I know! Women can ask men out too. Thing is - unluckily I was gonna be stuck at home for the week because of a medical issue hence I didn‚Äôt do it. Admittedly I also assumed that if he were interested he would definitely ask me out again.

Eventually I did ‚Äúcasually‚Äù slide it in that I just went to the doctor and hence I am can‚Äôt be out for the one week, he didn‚Äôt react / mention anything about us, simply just asked if I was feeling okay and so on.

Conversations slowly died off, and here comes the slower and shorter replies, mutually on both our side.  When he started sending one liners I thought forget it, I‚Äôd just move on. So I didn‚Äôt reply him and that was 2 days ago. 

Earlier today, I thought hey what‚Äôs wrong with a little bit of leap of faith, no harm trying / what if he was waiting for me? Right? 

So I reached out and told him that I am free to go out next week and we should do it, and he just replied saying he is out of town next week.

That‚Äôs all, nothing else, he didn‚Äôt even suggest an alternative. I said have fun! And he didn‚Äôt reply anymore.

So yes I assume it is safe to say that we are done here and I won‚Äôt be seeing him again - which is really okay, given that I only met him once.

I just really didn‚Äôt want to blame myself (for not replying for 2 days? Mixed signal?) nor do I want to blame my health or bad luck here (for not being able to go out).

Can i just attribute to something else out of my control? Like, perhaps even if I am free this week, he wasn‚Äôt gonna ask me out as well.
Or maybe he‚Äôs had a few dates lined up and found someone in that one week - kind of explains the one week of continuous texting?

Imagine I get rejected by a woman and say, ‚ÄúShe must be intimidated by guys with big muscles‚Äù. In reality, there‚Äôs an infinite amount of reasons she could‚Äôve rejected me.

But I will ask anyway.

I am just curious if anyone has ever achieved (IMO) the impossible and has dated a female cop or detective? The way I see it, it is very difficult to do so as a non-cop. I have never ever heard any man (friend or not friend) that has ever dated/been in a relationship/has had sex with a female police officer and or detective.

From what I have seen and heard, police officers don't get hit on anyone except their own colleagues. I have once approached two female police officers in uniform and told her that I found her very attractive. But I quickly left afterwards because they both seemed very focused and serious, so I did not want to say or do anything that will bite me in the ass. She thanked me after with a straight face and then I walked away.

I mean police officers are humans like anyone else, but it seems to me that unless you are not a cop yourself, you have little to no chance of dating a police officer. But I gotta be honest, if I was a police officer or a detective, I would not hit on my colleagues. Because:

1) I don't shit where I eat.

2) If I do anything wrong, I am basically screwed and would have to see that person for the rest of my career.

Truth be told, I have never even met a female police officer when they were not on duty. Might just be my bad luck, but I think the chance of that is pretty low because:

A) They don't walk around with a big sign on them saying ""I am a Cop"". 

B) They 99% of the time, drive to their station using their personal car and drive back home the same way. I highly doubt that they would use public transport and or that none of them DON'T have a drivers license.

Also just me being biased, but I feel like normal women dating male cops is much easier as police officers (especially men) tend to be more friendly and less hostile towards them.

TL;DR: Have you ever dated a female cop or detective? Or know anyone that did? If yes, how did you meet her and get her to go out with you?

Most of which have been people I found that I connect with only sexually. During 2020, I had asked out a coworker as a joke and it evolved into a real date. At first I thought nothing of it and that we just get along really well. We began fully dating but it's been three months. She's kind, she's got the same type of humor as me, she lets me be myself, and she's ambitious for her future.  She genuinely made me feel like there was more to dating then just attempting to get into the other person's pants. The only thing that really screwed with me when we first started dating was how little contact we had over text/calls and that it was merely a vehicle for asking to hangout this particular day. Also she didn't have any social media.

As time passed she had told me she had been struggling with student loans on her medical degree, and that she would need to get a second job to carve a path to getting her masters so that she could work in the field she wanted. I affirmed it heavily, telling her that she could do anything and that I believed in her. She remained at the 2nd job for at most two weeks, mentioning how it was awful and that she didn't feel right doing that job. So I supported her decision on that.

Fast forward perhaps 2 weeks and it's the middle of January, and she mentions something about joining the Air force so that she could have her college paid. I thought to myself, well if it's what needs to be done then so be it right? I thought she'd just be gone for the initial 8 and a half weeks. Then she would be training in the US, so I wouldn't mind following her to where she was going to be stationed. 

Fast forward to the end of February she had her tests and physical coming up, I didn't want her to fail, but a small part of me wanted her to. I'm a terrible person for this, but I kept it to myself. After getting results back from her exam and physical, she texts me to ask to sit down to talk to me. At this point I was a nervous wreck, in my heart I was anxious to the point of gaging at reoccurring intervals. 

As she sat me down to talk, she told me how her contract would involve 4 years of active duty, and 4 years of on call duty. She would be gone for training one weekend a month. Then it would be another contract after the 8 years she's suppose to sign up for, in order to become a PA for the Airforce. I thought okay okay, we can make this work I'd do anything for her. I was panicking mentally as I sat there listening to her. I tried to say that I understood and that I'd be fine with long distance if it was just for her. She quickly responded by telling me that Long distance wouldn't work, and that she knows that we both are people who need quality time spent together for relationships to work. I genuinely loved her, and she made every girl I've ever been with pale in comparison to her.

I'm completely distraught. I don't want to stand in the way of her future, and yet I don't think I'll ever meet someone like her again. I've accepted that she'll be gone, but some part of me even though it knows it's hopeless has a small amount of hope that we'll see each other again someday.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163086,public,self,I'm losing the love of my life.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/taf2jq/im_losing_the_love_of_my_life/,no_ads,0.0,

I love giving out relationship advice but when it comes to my own, I get stuck. Please listen.

Before my ex and I started dating (let's call him, bobby), we were very good friends for about 2 years of knowing each other. We told each other EVERYTHING and there was never a bland conversation. So we did that stupid thing that guy x girl best friends do and got into a relationship.

It started out very fun (figured) and then there became a point where I became distant from him and didn't know what I wanted, I would like to blame it on my depression and not loving myself. He started to realize and we argued a lot during the last few days. We finally broke up. In the nastiest way. It was painful for both of us, we had both lost the one person we could trust with anything. He was the only person who knew my life and cared about my stories. But I was okay with throwing it all away.

As soon as Bobby and I broke up, I was still a little upset but I moved on. I started talking to some guy, let's call him ""Ricky"". He understood me, but he took things way too seriously and was very emotional. We didn't have that sarcastic and goofy connection like Bobby and I did. I didn't get into a relationship with ""Ricky"" because along the way of him and I talking, one of my good friends (let's call him ""Dominick"") admits his literal LOVE for me. Dominick and I had a thing in the past and it didn't work out because he was always aloof and I don't like that. However, I ended up choosing Dominick over Ricky. Ultimately hurting Ricky.

So here's the twist. Dominick and Bobby are really good friends. They weren't besties, but they came from the same friend group. Also, ""Bobby"" never liked ""Dominick"". After all, Dominick was my guy best friend during Bobby and I's relationship. When I started dating Dominick a few weeks after Bobby, they stopped becoming friends. Dominick was the one to end the friendship between the two of them, I kinda felt bad. Bobby would see Dominick and I around a lot, and I found it entertaining (not anymore, I feel horrible).

So my relationship with Dominick. We barely joked around because he was a romantic. He was always trying to do lovey dovey things and say romantic shit. Straight out of the movies. Which is why I was never comfortable around him. It was barely fun. Sure we had a connection, but it wasn't goofy like my past relationship. I tried to stop comparing my relationships and just keep loving Dominick. But during the end of Dominick and I's relationship, he admitted he didn't trust me. That did it for me. I am nothing but loyal, so I let him end the relationship. I think he was in shock I actually let him break up with me, because he's tried before and I usually begged for him back. As soon as we broke up, I added Bobby back on all socials. Dont ask why, I literally don't know. I wanted to apologize for ending things toxicly and then getting with his good friend. Dominick was very pissed when he somehow found out I was on good terms with Bobby again.

So I added Bobby back into my socials. We had some conversations. He said he never moved onto another girl, and he just took time to himself. But weird enough, a day or two later, I found out he had a fling with some girl, and I do not mean to say this with a big ego, but she was much less pretty than me. On the inside she wasn't pretty either. She was known for the wrong reasons. She was known and proven to be racist, homophobic, and straight up disrespectful. I was confused when I saw them together because I know Bobby would never truly be happy with a girl like that. A few days later I asked him if he was dating this girl, and he said ""no"". I told him ""good, don't."" Kind of bold of me, but that would be embarrassing for him.

His one friend told me Bobby did not look happy with this girl, he was only with her for one thing (if you know, you know). His friend also said when I added Bobby back into my socials, he was cautious and a little mad at me. Mad at me for coming back into his life when he was finally starting to ""move on"". That's why its so easy for me to believe he loved me and still does. It sounds like he wants to move on but me being back, makes him want me to stay for good. Part of me believes when he looks at her, he tries to imagine its me. But I can't assume that I was the best he's had, but I literally was. LOL! I know this because when I added Bobby back, he seemed a little too okay with talking to me again. And because when he was with this girl (literally laying with her) he was talking to me on snapchat, and sending photos of him (did not look happy with this girl). I asked him if he was happy, he replied ""yep"". He never talks like that, he is not happy with her.

We ended up having a conversation about how I apologize for leaving him behind and we both agreed we miss having such a tight bond, and we miss the memories.

Bobby also parks next to me every single day for school, so I had to and still have to see him everyday. We had one final conversation last night about a lot of things. About his family, a hot tub, funny stories, vacation. There was a point where I told him if he was ever bored, to call me because I am always down for a little adventure. We were having a good time talking, but then he didn't reply. I am now on delivered for about 14 hours. He just randomly stopped. After such good conversation, like the old days.

So here's where I need your help. I don't usually think dreams mean anything, but I had 3 dreams last night. THREE. And in each one, was Bobby. Mind you, I haven't ever had him in my dreams. Even when I dated him. I'm not saying how I felt about the dreams but I will say when I woke up, I was sad they weren't a reality. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?? I don't know what to do. He has me on open now, and his location is off. I can't even be mad, I did kinda get in a relationship with his friend right after. He's probably deciding if he wants to cut me off or not. Being just friends may not work for him. There's also another guy trying to hit my line currently and take me on dates, but I'm not fully invested since this whole dream thing. Bobby has been on my mind TOO MUCH.

(FOR MY ASTROLOGY PEOPLE ONLY): idk if this can help u guys or not, but here's the zodiac signs if u wanted them ;P

Me: Virgo Sun, Aquarius Moon, Sagittarius Rising, Leo Mercury, Cancer Venus, Virgo Mars.

Bobby: Taurus Sun, Leo Moon, Cancer Rising, Taurus Mercury, Taurus Venus, Gemini Mars.

 I come back in the room and he ambushes me with kisses tells me to sit down and he went in the bathroom right after I did and i know the smell lingered I think he got a whiff of it and he came back and just acted so differently from before and i was just too embarrassed to say anything right thenü•¥

So I (26f)started dating this guy (42m) at the beginning of February. We went out twice and it was really nice, and then he had to leave the country for about a week. When he got back, he texted me to meet up. We met on a Friday night, had a wonderful time and eventually had sex that night. He then wanted to see me again, so...we met up about 5 times in eight days (last time was this past Friday). I was really happy about this whole thing because we really hit it off and everything was going so well, I thought that maybe I finally found someone who wanted to stick. Our chemistry is magic.

Earlier today I went to see my gynecologist because I've been having some weird symptoms for a few days. I had some tests done and the doc noticed I had one genital wart (which I've had before I started dating this guy but thought it's no big deal) and said I should get tested for HPV (i will get this done next week). I was absolutely floored, but I knew I had to tell the guy that I'm seeing.

Before I got in the doctor's office, we were texting and making plans for the weekend and meeting up. I couldn't find the power to text him back after my doc talked about the HPV thing....I felt guilty and ashamed.

So, when I got home, I texted him that I need to be honest and clear: I haven't been feeling well, went to the medic, got some tests done and will have some more, and I might have HPV. And I also told him that if he doesn't want to see me anymore, I would understand. We texted for a bit, he asked me a few more questions about my symptoms etc. and when I told him I feel awful he asked: ""Do you want me to call?"". I left him on read, I felt horrible. He then called me and I couldn't bring myself to answer. He then called again and I picked up. He was very sweet about it, told me I will be fine, that there are treatments for these things and surely there's nothing too bad. I was half-crying on the phone, told him that he doesn't need this and I started to apologise (for possibly passing something on to him)....And he told me I should stop saying sorry, that there's no reason for it and that of course he still wants to see me on Friday, and we can just ""chill and lay back and watch a movie and there's no need to stress"" etc etc.

He seemed very cool with it, but I'm very nervous. He's really an amazing man and I feel very lucky to have found him but I'm afraid I might lose this one good potential relationship because of a possible diagnosis...

What do you guys think about this?

Like seriously all is lost on me when it comes to broken people wanting to jump into dating as if it‚Äôs going to fix their issues. 

Anyways. I met this girl and she is amazing. She listens well, has a job, and doesn‚Äôt do meth. All good check marks in the right boxes. She isn‚Äôt much of a text person as she is a phone call person. Anyways we met off of Fb dating and seemed to hit it off right away. She passed me her number and I passed her mine and I of course initiate the texting. She doesn‚Äôt respond for 2 days and hits me with a hey. I being a salty ass decide to make her wait until the end of the day and ask her what‚Äôs up. I explain I only put in energy towards people that reciprocate and explain that I initiated a lot of the startups and she understands this and starts stepping it up. She offers to meet me for breakfast and I go and we have an amazing time talking in person. She wants to come back to my place but says nothing will happen and so I respect her choice and don‚Äôt make any uncomfortable advances. She then changes her mind  when she‚Äôs over and I say that I need her consent as a sign of respect. We go at it for hours. She tells me she likes me and I‚Äôm all on board. She says she might delete her dating app later I tell her that I would be so cool with being exclusive with her but she should be all for it and to take some time to analyze what we are like together but I‚Äôm very clear that I would enjoy being exclusive with her. Later that day she goes and deletes all her pics off her dating app profile and I‚Äôm like dang I‚Äôm in. 

Now though it seems like she‚Äôs busy or doesn‚Äôt respond as frequently and when she does it‚Äôs not very deep. I even asked her about her culture and heritage because I am actively taking an interest in her as a person and I made sure to articulate this was my purpose for asking, but it seems like she‚Äôs just not as interested in me in the way we barely text and she doesn‚Äôt call me as she would. She was still actively engaged 2 days after we had sex but now it‚Äôs like barely anything there. I‚Äôm rather confused by this entire situation. I want to bother her and text her all day but I feel like for some reason that me actively encouraging and vocalizing that I‚Äôm into her is going to push her away which I don‚Äôt want. 

I want more than she‚Äôs giving and I‚Äôm one of those people who feels like being ignored makes me go crazy because I‚Äôm all into that person. I‚Äôm fighting every urge to text her a lot and just keep chill but I feel like I‚Äôm trying desperately to keep on the fine line of showing interest but not trying to seem too emotionally involved to the point it scares her away. 

What do I do fellow daters?

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 8 months. He seems pretty happy around me, but he never really plans dates (he‚Äôs new to the uk, moved from USA in may last year). He just goes with what I have planned and he seems pretty clueless when I ask him what he wants to do

Anyway, I sent him a Valentine‚Äôs Day card and little present. He wished me happy Valentine‚Äôs and seemed grateful. I didn‚Äôt see him until a week later, but he didn‚Äôt get me a card. He gave me a few gifts from his trip abroad (that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt see him on valentines.) I was grateful however....

I asked him ‚Äòis this my Valentine‚Äôs present?‚Äô And he replied ‚Äòuhhh, I guess haha.‚Äô 

He didn‚Äôt book a restaurant or anything. And now I‚Äôm worried he just doesn‚Äôt care about me because technically he didn‚Äôt get me anything for Valentine‚Äôs day. 

I look at his old Instagram posts from 2 years ago and I could see he got his ex flowers and made a lovey dovey Valentine‚Äôs post.

We live in Russia and for more than a week now we've been going to the antiwar protests. Last Sunday I got arrested, spent the night at the police station. She was very worried about me and I spent the entire night thinking about her (obviously, can't tell her that). This Sunday I stayed home to not get a repeated offence, but she went to the protest. Spent the entire day worried sick. She did get arrested. I went to the police station with food, water and a sleeping bag just in case. Luckily, was able to get her home around midnight. Realized how much she truly means to me.

She's one of the smartest, kindest, most amazing people I know. I care for her tremendously, and I really appreciate her friendship.

It was a shocking breakup, as we had no issues, but he felt with school and our physical distance (1 hour drive for me into the city) that he didn‚Äôt have enough time ‚Äúto be a boyfriend‚Äù and was only getting busier with things coming up in school. So we decided we wanted to be friends, and he even said he never wanted to stop talking to me. He reminded me that he loved me, and said that will never change. He also said ‚Äúwho knows what will happen in the future‚Äù. I feel like this is genuine. He‚Äôs never lied before and we had a very trusting relationship, I don‚Äôt think he would say this to make me feel better. 
Anyways, after we both cried in the car, I went home and he sent a very heart-throbbing message.


On Valentine‚Äôs Day, I had already bought a bunch of things, so I just stopped by and gave them to him anyways. He hugged me tight and looked me in the eyes‚Ä¶ not in a way a friend would look at you. Anyways, he said how appreciative he was, and told me to talk to him more (even though we‚Äôd been texting the entire time, albeit not as much as before). He later sent pictures of the gifts and told me how much he loved them, and that he feels horrible and is sorry.


Well those weeks were really thought for me, and so the Tuesday after Valentine‚Äôs Day I stopped reaching out to him. He hasn‚Äôt reached out to me either, but we‚Äôre still doing streaks and he still has me on his private. He also hasn‚Äôt deleted any nudes on Snapchat. The only thing that‚Äôs really changed is he disabled tracking.


Anyways, I guess I just want an outside perspective. I still wish we didn‚Äôt breakup, and in the back of my mind still love him and want it to work out in the future. Some of his snapchats / posts have also had ‚Äúhidden‚Äù messages in them which I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôre meant for me to see.

Further, today we had one of those projects, she immediately asked me to be her partner, took me to the back of the classroom and we started it.

Nowadays, online dating is black box. People might look good in pictures but when you meet them, they are completely different. Their personality may also be completely different from what you expected.

For a lot of men and women, this has created an endless strings of dates, trial and repeat.

The problem is, men are often expected to cover for the first date. I know some girls are okay with splitting the bill but the vast majority of the girls I have gone out with just look at me with a blank stare when the bills come through. Worse, some girls will automatically label you as cheap if you propose something simple, like a chat at a coffee shop or a walk in the park. They don't understand that everytime you go on failed date is literally throwing money away. 

Some of them even take advantage of the situation, going on dates with no intention of actually dating. They just go for the fancy dinner or the experience you're offering. 

It'd be okay if you only had to go in one date to meet Mrs right. But nowadays, expect to go to at least a couple dozens before you meet anyone close to what you're lookin for.

*He got frustrated at the resturant because their kitchen was closing early

*He was agitated the whole time we were together at the table, not giving eye contact, jittery.

* I asked him what he was looking for in a relationship and he said nothing too serious, I was on the same page but still wanted to chat to him and get to know him a bit more.

* Our food come, he then checks his Facebook and his family were abusing him over message and he just put his hands on his head at the table, infront of everyone. 

*I was just sitting, not knowing what to do. So I went to comfort him and he said to me 'don't!, I'm fine!'

*As we were leaving I was pretty upset. He leaned to kiss me and I wasn't having it, I just left.
