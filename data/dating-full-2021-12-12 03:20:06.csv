I was obsessed with sex, was admittedly insecure and got a lot of my validation from women. I strung a few girls along and used them for sex. One girl really love me for me and I dated her for a year and a half and refused to commit. I kept cheating on her by having sex with other girls that I met online or at bars with my friends. I didn’t even really view women as people and I was always after the hottest one. I’ve grown up a lot since then and I realize how fucked up some of the stuff I did was. Most of my friends married in their late 20s/around 30 and even then I would give them shit for settling down. As time has gone on I’ve realize that I really want a children, and a wife. My dating pool is a lot smaller now and I’m having trouble finding women in their 30s who want children. It seems like a lot of the women that I’ve dated recently around my age (30+) are either still single because they don’t want children or would have been open to children when they were younger but The guy wasn’t ready to settle down and so they focus on their career and changed their mind. I’m starting to feel like I waited too long to settle down.

Looking back, I’m realizing that that one girl in my 20s was probably the girl that I should’ve settle down with. I think that was my wife and I was just too immature to realize what a rare connection we had.

Most of my guy friends have created a stable life with a partner, own their homes, are financially stable, and have begun the journey into fatherhood. I’m happy for them but it’s hard for me to watch. I feel like less of a man.

I have always fantasized about women 30-40 years older than me whom I don't know I met a woman in a Zumba class at the gym. She was probably in her sixties, 40 years my senior. I basically didn't know her at all. I thought about her everyday for almost two years.

I fell in love with this woman. There was something about her that attracted me and she had a vibe that I liked. I liked how her body looked, the way she dressed, she had a nice face, and also the fact that since she is much older, I thought she has so much wisdom and maturity.

I never had a conversation with her, except the one time when I approached her and said hello and asked her name. I told her I did not see her for a few days since the last time I saw her. I wondered if she felt flattered that I noticed something that was so insignificant. We also had some physical contact at one point in class when we all got in line behind each other and she was behind me and her hands were on my waist. I liked her touch.

I created these fantasies in my head and I started to fantasize about her. I kept on replaying scenes in my head, like the times when we would turn our heads and make eye contact and smile, the time when I felt her slightest touch on my waist. I imagined us having a relationship, playing out different situations that would never happen in real life, like me going to her house. I imagined us kissing and having sex. As much as I imagined how I looked to her, and she me. And in my waking dreams, I kissed those lips one thousand times.

I convinced myself that she loved me. I jumped into conclusions and thought that just because she often looked at me in and smiled, that she loved me. I read so much into her intentions then there was. She occupied every space in my mind. I could not think of anything but her. I used up a lot of energy thinking about her and I even refused to go out sometimes or do activites because all I wanted was to daydream about her. I wanted her all to myself. I wondered if she had a husband and kids, and I couldn't bare the thought of her with someone else, in the arms of another.

I longed for her. I yearned to feel her touch again. My life revolved around her so much so that every time I went to the gym, she was the only thing I looked forward to. I did not pay attention to anything else. And if I went there and she was not there, I was sad. I would never do anything to her in person.

She was a really great person, I just think we met too young. If instead of meeting our sophomore year in college instead of high school, I'd likely be writing posts about my wife.

We dated for almost all of high school together and with that comes being together for each other's most memorable moments/events in adolescence. 

It probably sounds strange, but I not only deeply loved her but also her family. They were like a second set of parents to me and while I would have much preferred to call them in-laws than my ex's parents, that wasn't on the cards and that is OK.

We had a really nasty breakup and a lot of things happened that prevented us from having any sort of relationship. Unfortunately, the breakup wasn't a single solitary event, it was like 3-5 months of hell afterward and there were many learning experiences from that.

The details are now irrelevant, but I never got any closure from it and I could never understand why I was pushed away so easily and never acknowledged again. I know men are not supposed to talk about their feelings, but this really, really bothered me and diminished my self-worth for a long time.

I actually made an effort a year or two after to speak with the parents and I did find closure and solace in that. It didn't really resolve anything because nothing needed to be resolved with them. But, as I said before, I really loved them as if they were my own. They are great people.

I haven't had any contact with my ex for years. I had hoped that we could one day be amicable but that just simply hasn't played out. Outside of what I've seen on social media over the years, I really know nothing about her. I cut ties with mutual friends shortly after it was all over.

I did see her at church this past week and for the first time since we were together, I had no real emotions. She was just another human being in a crowded place. I guess I just want to share this because I've finally been able to bury a ghost that has long haunted me.

I graduated college with zero debt, have an amazing and fulfilling career and live on my own. I wish I could go back to that 18-year-old me and tell him that it's going to be OK.

I’m 28m. Have never had a “relationship” that lasted more than a couple to months. A few ONS and fwbs here and there. 

All of my hobbies are solo activities. 

I go to the gym 4x per week alone and put in my AirPods and listen to a podcast or audiobook. Even though I’m fit I don’t play or watch any sports. I’m self-employed. No boss. No employees. 

It may sound like I’m a loner but really I have a very active social life. I’m going to bars or dinner with my friends like 3-4 times a week and my social circle is large so perhaps hanging out with friends is my only non-solo “hobby”.

The point is I’m wondering if this is something I need to fix? Is this something women can sense either subconsciously or consciously? Like should I go join a beach volleyball team or something? 

Or is this just who I am and I need to find a woman that’s okay with it?

I[30M] met this woman[27F] on a dating app. We've been talking for ~10 days now. The conversation is going good, she laughs and responds immediately. However, she never asks any questions about me.

We spoke on phone twice and she was talking a lot, but she never asked any questions about me. I felt I had to talk about myself just after she finishes talking. 

I'm having a hard time keeping the conversation going. Just bringing out some random topic to talk about out of nowhere looks odd to me.

It could be because I lack something, which I'm happy to work on. Any guidance would be really appreciated.

My question is: what do I do when she never really asks anything about me, just laughs and answers my question. What do I do to bring the best of her so that she also contribute and initiates the conversation.

Also, how often you do you text during early stages? We have plans to meet later this month.

Behaviour wise he treated me sooo well. For eg we were sitting with the view and he suddenly shifted opposite me and and when I asked he said he wanted a better view... straight looking at my face (my face which didn't have any makeup and just woke up and went for breakfast face)

He constantly complimented me for how pretty I look workout makeup and you guys get the point..

The sex was great... We had difficulties sure but we did it with music shadows, dancing and everything.. 

I was/am still afraid to be happy..

And what I thought happened... we reached back home and he texted me how he is worried skit hurting me...and I asked if he wants to end it .. He said no at that point


But the talks have been less but everything same....and he hasn't talked to me how 4-5 days now spare for sending me memes.. I know he has been to a wedding of his colleague... But he posted pics and all so he has time...I haven't said anything to him because well.. expression..

They all do. I'm a serial monogamist in my twenties. I was with a woman for five years and then another for 2 and then another for three. They all individually feel like they ""fucked up"". It's so romantic and such self glamorizing bullshit but you have to respect that although it's not true mostly its true for some people. 

In the past two months I've had three ex girlfriends contact me and I'm not even joking or giving an opportunity for falsified stuff. One I dated since we were thirteen and stayed together until we were 18 and she self admitted that she didn't wanna continue dating because I was the only one she'd known. She went on a date with someone else and didn't like it and immediately texted me back.

The second was a chick who knew I was the real deal about relationships- she knew that I wanted one until death. But at 18 there were so many fucking options it wasn't possible for her to commit. Not to mention she was an incredibly hot piece of ass.

The thing I'm talking about is like, girls literally have something they want like or love. They already have it. But there'd this delusional fomo shit they do where like, I've literally been asked to take ""breaks"" so they could explore other people and what they're like. 

I'm not even kidding without fail these girls I've been with go out of their way to ""follow their heart"" and go for people they think they'd like and then are upset after learning their dick or personality isn't shit.

Laura Gina and gyleasa. The literal women I've lived with for years. They thought like I was immature I was wrong and there's definitely better guys - and they were all wrong. They insisted on breaks and went on dates with guys they don't like or don't fuck them how they like. 

They're literally betraying me. They always come back. They always come home. They're always fucking wrong in their suppositions but still feel.right and entitled to being right. There's a girl as we speak messaging me how she's miserable and upset like she's fucked up everything - and she did. She did that and I'm not attracted to her anymore.

Why the fuck do women constantly pretend they'd be happier somewhere else and the moment they're not happier somewhere else act like I guys should respect them the same? We don't. You lost everything because you were too cowardly, and you pretend it's guys that have to tolerate your shortcomings. 

Why the fuck do women pretend they get this chance of oh I'm gonna go on a date with somebody and you don't get to respect me different? It's not pulp culture shit. I literally dated three different girls who all came back when the grass wasn't greener. Why the fuck are you given the right to be garbage and still expect to be allowed home

Dude if you break up with a guy and go out with someone else you know you were always literally wrong right the moment you come back 

I'm getting vibes from young women that they think they're right about everything while any empirical evidence should show them they're wrong. You should literally hold yourself accountable. You should recognize you've been wrong the entire time and should shut the fuck up.

Like women. You need to recognize you aren't a victim sometimes and are actually in the wrong. There's three women asking me to be a part of their life and they were right about keeping me out months ago.

If the person you like is enough be happy.

Women your wandering eyes and falling imaginations keep you from loving who you're with.

It was probably a guy willing to spend his life on you but you didn't have the same courtesy.

Despite probably not being ready, I hopped right back into trying to get more dates. I recovered for the most part by may, after getting some closure from Casper. Went on what I thought was a date with a former coworker around the same time, but things remained quiet until September otherwise. 

Since then I’ve gone on 3 first dates (a big milestone for me to get that many in a year). None have landed though. First one was very interested but I was simply not attracted to her. I wanted to give it a chance because we had similar interests and she was really cool, but it just wasn’t going to work for me after date 2 with her. Second one was a wash and neither of us were interested. Third one was great and both of us were interested (she had some hiccups that delayed the first date for over a week, but persisted and assured me she definitely wanted to see me). I asked her for a second date for tonight, she excitedly agreed, and then canceled on me this morning citing her lack of availability on multiple fronts. 

I’m done for the rest of the year. Another break is definitely required. I’ve been more exhausted by this all at other points in the year for sure, but this is more preemptive so that I can focus on family for the holidays. 

I’ve learned this year that: I’m smoother than I thought in person, I’m worse than I thought through text, I have a much better idea at what I want and don’t want in a relationship, I’m not ugly, I do love myself, and I have a lot to offer.

Not advertising, just giving background. I'm on okcupid, bumble, and was on POF and tinder. I have 12 photos up, and I've gotten feedback that I'm cute, attractive, handsome, the photos are taken well etc. I've shown them off to women on the internet and IRL. Always told its good.

I've swapped my bio out I don't know how many times. Short ones, long ones, humble ones, clever ones, funny ones. I never get matches. 

I got like 20 on bumble initially, but not a single message, so they all expired. OK cupid I get nothing. Literally just nothing. Tinder expanded my area, age range (to creepy limits) and then finally just decided I was bisexuality, because I'm not gonna manage it with women apparently. 

I'm 6'1"". Jogger build, long curly brown hair that makes women jealous, 2 photos have me and my dogs (I have 3). A couple airport photos, one of me on stage with a guitar.

I'm either being lied to with the pics (totally possible), buried in the algorithm, or my bios are garbage. Is 3 dogs intimidating? How long am I aiming for? Do I mention I own my house? Or does that seem like I'm being an asshole? I almost always mention I fix things, because I fix appliances, cars, electronics and furniture. Some of it professionally. I run a business on the side as well, but have never mentioned it in a bio. 

Sorry if I sound just mad. I'm not. I know it's something I'm doing or not doing. Also open to alternatives to apps. I don't know how to meet women IRL. They normally seem genuinely upset if I express interest, even though I normally have long meaningful conversations leading up to it. At least I find meaning in them.

I go on all other social medias n I see tht im either removed or block. So I’m panicking n I try to text her n call her I’m blocked. Getting sent straight to voicemail. So ofc I do the text now app n im blowing up her phone… 

It was 3am when she called me on my regular line n tells me she coming to my house. She comes n has a big bag of my stuff n pushes out the car. I’m asking her baby what wrong, what going on, please talk to me. She telling me she just can’t do this relationship anymore she doesn’t want to communicate her feelings anymore she tired of us hanging out . All in all I was very blindsided by this. I’m asking everything I could , did ur friends put something in ur head ,is there someone else, r u having a panic attack. What happen. She told me she wants us to b friends n thts it. 
Two week goes by n I let her know I have Covid. She comes gives me with a get well basket n the week after tht she comes by again saying she wants her stuff from my house . She ends up staying the night for three days n in the morning starts going off again saying she can’t stand me n she wants me out of her life. I say baby what’s wrong. We had a great weekend together Why r u always doing this. What is ur problem with me. N she started to grow angry with me saying we see each other to much, I always wanna hang out . (Knowing it was her idea to stay at my house for 3 days.) I told her I don’t have any problems, u are the one with problem. When u need ur space I give it to u, when u want to hang I make time. I don’t understand where all this childish behavior is coming from. Then she just Shuts down n doesn’t answer my question just dead quiet , starring at me as if I didn’t say anything. So finally we went out separate ways. It was 4 days later when she texted me asking a question n tht was it. Why do u guys think my girl acting wishy washy. 
She the first relationship I ever have tht doesn’t give me no problems no worries n now she acting crazy. I’m a pretty laid back guy n I don’t like the back n fourth.

I am in need of some dating advice that might lead me in the direction of meeting new people. I have tried dating apps, but they haven’t resulted in the greatest experiences and I find they end up making me feel a bit down. I also recognize that it is tough to go out and meet people because a lot of things are not running because of the pandemic.

I am a little bit concerned that maybe I am the problem or that maybe I am just not what people are looking for. For some background information about myself, I am a full-time student in business school working towards law school, I have a job, I created a small business of my own as a side hustle to make some extra money to help pay for tuition, I am pursuing my dreams of becoming a musician, and I have a good variety of interests aside from academics and music. I am personable, but am also a bit of an introvert until you get to know me. I really value consideration and honesty, so I always try my best to act accordingly.

I was in a relationship for about three years, and finally feel, after a long period of healing, ready to step back into the world of dating. But, I guess because I was so sheltered from what dating is actually like, I had no idea how discouraging it actually is. I have been on so many dates with people I met on dating apps, and I probably have some of the greatest dating horror stories you could imagine - like a guy getting drunk at our morning coffee date, bragging about having his license permanently suspended because of his multiple DUIs and then asking me to drive him 45 minutes into town to his next Tinder date (yup, that happened! Haha.). And, for the few times where I thought I found someone who I would really like to get to know, they ended up ghosting me after expressing they would love to see me again.

I know that I do not need a boyfriend and that I am perfectly fine doing my own thing, but it is just starting to get to me that it seems everyone around me has no problem finding someone, and being uninvited to events because I don’t have someone to bring along is starting to bring me down. I understand that it is awkward to have one single at a table of couples and I don't want to make my friends uncomfortable, but it is still hurtful.

So I guess my question is this: Reddit users, have you ever felt discouraged like this and how did you get out of it?

We matched on Tinder literally 4 days ago and omg I’m so glad she agreed to go on a date with me.

First of all, whoever said don’t date your sign fuckin LIED. We have SO much in common it’s crazy. 

We started our date at a sushi spot in town. It was a bit nerve wrecking to meet up so soon but it was 100% worth it. Her pictures don’t do her justice in person, she is SO SO SO beautiful and girly.. I love it! She didn’t go OD with the date attire, just kept it casual so that put me at ease bc I don’t own a whole lot of clothing myself. I was a bit embarrassed that I didn’t know how to use chopsticks but she didn’t either so we both go a kick out of trying to eat with them lol

After that, I booked an escape room session for us and let me tell you… if it were a life or death situation, we’d be fucked lmao we had an hour and only got 2/3 of the way through before time was up but it showed me that we could work as a team, and very clear who would take lead in the relationship. 10/10 definitely recommend an escape room date for the first date. You learn a lot about a person.

Then after that we went to my favorite bar and had a couple drinks. By then nerves were pretty much gone but I can’t hold my liquor like that and got way more drunk than I needed to be lmao I’m just glad I sobered up enough to drive home. I walked her to her car and we ended up making out lmfao she kept saying she liked me and all I could do was smile hard af.

After she left I invited her to my place and we ended up watching Harry Potter since she’s never seen it before. She ended up getting tired and falling asleep but either way I’d say the date was 100% a success.

I forgot to mention we don't live close to each other so we haven't met yet. The last time we met was when we were like 13 yrs old.
So , back to the story , after we admitted that we loved each other everything went great for a couple of months.. But after sometime the texts became slow sometimes i even felt she ignored me and i asked her if it's because of something that I've done then she said it's not your fault etc etc. I'm like this and sometimes i do jt and for the time being accepted that answer and was fine with it but now its been 2 weeks she hasn't texted me once and haven't replied to my texts. I don't know what to do next I've been asking for like past 5-6 days constantly if she's okay but no reply and now I'm thinking maybe she doesn't want me to her ? Or something or maybe she wants me to try more harder ?

We don’t have sex that often and he’s said he’s not that sexual of a person but has also admitted we’d be having “crazy good” and frequent sex if I lost weight. I feel like he is not interested in my body at all when we have sex and the lack of attraction is pretty obvious to me. It’s also complicated because he said it is my general attitude toward diet and fitness that is also a turn off? He doesn’t like my consumption of carbs or sugar at my current weight and said that in the past my diet has bothered him a lot but it’s less so now. He also thinks that telling me all of this should motivate me to become hot because if someone told him a way to become more hot he would jump at the chance and feel very motivated.

He doesn’t seem to understand that these comments and judgements are incredibly hurtful to me and I don’t know how to frame it so he’ll understand. He says other aspects of me supersede these physical issues (this is kind of hard for me to believe) but I want someone who feels romantic &amp; turned on by me.

For more context I’ve struggled with weight and mental health my whole life. I’m 5’5” and in 2012 got down to 115 lbs where my doctor was asking me to put on weight. I was severely restricting my diet and consuming only pepto bismol some days to soothe my stomach and lose weight. I’ve been hospitalized for suicide attempts and been through years of counseling/therapy/meds to get better &amp; work on my self image. I felt like I’ve been in a good place mentally but these comments have crushed me. I am happy with my body weight. I have no medical issues at all and have a very physical tree service job where I’m basically working out all day &amp; he said that’s not enough without going on a diet. I get compliments on my looks &amp; outfits all the time and I don’t feel like I’m a fat person at my current weight and am not according to medical standards &amp; a physical I had last week. I don’t feel particularly unhealthy and get a lot of satisfaction out of eating treats with white flour, carbs, etc. I think it also bothers him that I put honey in my coffee because he said that’s something he’d never do if he wanted to lose weight.

I’ve never had someone be so brutally honest about their preferences without breaking up with me or something like that. I understand body weight preferences but he truly doesn’t understand that what he is saying makes me feel terrible. He also says in response to me being upset by these statements that I should just practice self love &amp; not worry about what others think but these thoughts are contingent on me receiving physical intimacy and love. 

I love this person a lot and we live together but I don’t want to just feel like I’m living with a roommate. I feel insecure about initiating anything physically because the whole time I’m worried about how he feels about my body, what my stomach might be looking like, etc. I don’t know how to move forward with this and at age 33 I’m not ready to accept a near sexless and romance-less relationship where my partner literally never comes on to me. I also haven’t gained weight since we started dating. Is there any way to repair?

I am 26F living with a 33M, and we have another 30F roommate, but she’s always out of town. So it’s mostly just us two in the house since we moved in 5 months ago. Here are the weird behaviors from this past week…

He came home and yelled, “honey, I’m home.” I heard this and cringed 

He told me he saw a psychic last year that told him he would find love, and she was in her mid-twenties. 

We talked about our living situation next year, and if we can’t renew where we’re living, he and I will search for a new place. I told him I was down. If we get a 3rd Roomie, I want another female. And he agreed…. Because he doesn’t want a male to “try to get in my pants.”

He confessed he heard me have sex with a guy and kept on talking about it even though we came to a new “spoken agreement” about our shared space. I felt bad. But now, I think he just wanted to talk about sex with me. 

He focuses on me WAY TOO much. I feel like he interrupts my “me time” in the house very often and observes me too much. For example...I’m working extra hours during the evening, so there’s me and my laptop in the living room. I told him I was busy working, and after half an hour of him talking and me responding“mhmm” while still staring at the computer, he finally got it. He changed his tone and said, “sorry I talk too much,” and walked upstairs all sad. I felt guilty for hurting his feelings, and I have a hard time being assertive 

I’m frustrated. I’m scared the reason he has been such a great roommate is that he has a crush. And I’m worried when he realizes it’s not reciprocated, he will change the way he treats me. He doesn’t get along with the other female Roomie. 

More about him: I view him as a clingy puppy. “Nice guy” vibes, really wanting a relationship. He’s an only child. So At first thought he might have been used to getting so much attention he was trying to receive that from somewhere. 

More about me: I’m a caring person.. I smile a lot. I have a pretty face. An insecurity I have is getting my friendly personality confused with flirting. I love my “me time,” and I’m an introvert by heart.

The first few months we've only had a very short conversation everyday as he is always busy (as he claims to be) 

By very short, it is always just Good Morning/Night, How are you. No deep conversations. And he would even leave me on delivered for hours. And sometimes would not text for 2 days. Im also the type of person who never double text. I would always wait for a reply first before I text again. So I endured those days without conversation. 

I was totally fine by it as Im not that interested on him yet. 
But as time passes by, I got annoyed at him because he told me at the very beginning that he is interested in me. But i dont feel it. He rarely text me and doesnt really ask something about me. So I confronted him about it.  He told me that he is just super busy and can barely rest.

Fast forward.. After a few months, I got interested. I want to know him better. So we had a serious talk about us. He told me that he really is interested but is afraid that I might just disappear; and thought I never share personal stuff about me. (but how would I share when he doesnt ask questions about me? 😭)

He also explained that he is super busy and finishes his work very late. 

After our talk, I saw some progression. He always text back immediately whenever he can. And he now share random stuff about him. And he's planning to meet me soon. (Yuh, its LDR. He's in abroad)

Now my question is, should I really believe this guy? I like him and would like to know him more. But the thing is, he is still a stranger to me. We never had a videocall yet but soon we'll have one (as he say).

Im single since birth so I really have no idea how to deal with this one. Also, Im an overthinker and hates to text first even though Im dying to have a conversation with him. 💀

When I ask if he is joking he says of course and backtracks. But it just feels so weird to joke about these things, none of my other male friends are behaving like this. Why joke about it?
