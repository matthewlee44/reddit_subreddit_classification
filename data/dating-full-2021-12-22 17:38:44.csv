I (F29) recently found out that my partner (M32) cheated on me for a couple months with his coworker (F20) who has a boyfriend of her own. It started with them making out a couple times at work, stopped for awhile because they felt bad then had sex once on her last day. He knew that I was uncomfortable with her and I always had a feeling something was up. Every time I brought her up he would get mad defensive and shift the conversation to how I don’t trust him or any of that jazz, even bursting when I went through his phone. 

I found out and at the very last resort he still hid it from me to “spare my feelings” and he felt guilty. I asked him why he cheated, and he said it’s not justified but it was because for awhile we’ve been having the same problems again and again and it seemed like there was no solution. That I was having so many crises and he became my punching bag or would pick on everything he did. He couldn’t rant to anyone else because they were pretty close people to me too, and so he felt that he could trust her because she was having difficulties with her own relationship too, but she said she’s never really loved her boyfriend, and even admitted that she was flirty with my boyfriend from the beginning and she confessed feelings for him and that she thinks of him when she’s with her boyfriend — all while when we were on a break. From that they had a “connection” because they could rant to each other about their SOs, but with her mostly digging and asking a lot about my relationship. 

He gave me his location and passcode and said that he would do anything and give me whatever it is I need from him. He said that he’s truly sorry and that he has never ever in his life done something like this before, and that this is the biggest fuck up he’s ever done. He said that if I give him another chance that he promises things will be different, we can redo everything and will never ever do something like this again. 

Classic. But there’s a reason why the saying “once a cheater, always a cheater” exists.

Confidence comes from 3 things: 1: Your appearance (it's really hard to be not confident when you put efforts into your looks) 2: A sense of accomplishment from your actions. This means having hobbies, exercising or putting effort into other things that yield a result. 3: Experience with dating. The first times are always scary, if you feel your primary fear is your lack of experience then dating IS self improvement, even if you get rejected. 

2. Put effort into your appearance. I know we all think that nerdy guys aren't interested in looking good and that it is superficial or something. It is the biggest load of hogwash ever. It isn't just hygiene (which I always maintained). Put in actual effort. Buy new clothes, visit a good barber instead of the $10 one, try out new hair styling products, put on cologne so you smell nice, exercise, don't wear hoodies after highschool, always shave properly (or grow a beard). Don't just put in effort when you have a date, also put in effort when meeting friends. You might of course already know this, but subconsciously many people still aren't putting in actual effort into their appearance. 

3. Dating apps suck but might still get you what you want. Let's face it, the ratio of men to women on dating app is abysmal. Keep this in mind and don't get frustrated. Tinder sucks, Bumble and Hinge are ok, paid sites also suck because a really selective audience uses them nowadays. Take good pictures, step one: put in effort into your appearance (again), step 2 get a decent camera, step 3 read up on fotography a bit, step 4 get a friend or a tripod and spend an afternoon making nice pictures. Put them on photofeeler and pick the ones that get the best response. Also take pictures when you are out with friends, this is one of the reasons why you should also put in effort into your appearance then. 

4. Dating is a lot easier when you are happy. Ok I don't really like the crowd that gives a vibe that you have to be perfect before you even think about dating, but it does really help. I would not have minded if dates said no, I actually become friends with a couple of rejected dates. Don't be desperate 

5. Adjust your attitude in certain ways. Don't think in absolutes or that things exclusive. Appearance or personallity? both. dating IRL or apps? both. date or improve yourself? both. Don't reject ways of improvement because you feel ""you don't need them"". You don't NEED to exercise to find someone, but it helps, so why wouldn't you. You don't NEED that new haircut, but it helps, so why wouldn't you. you do need SOME collection of positive traits that makes someone interested in you.

Then they broke up and we carried on as normal until he met his current gf and he stopped talking to me for 2 years. Then they broke up and we slept with each other a few times until they got back together and then he didn’t speak to me for another 2 years.

But I don’t feel like I took it too far at all. We literally used to sleep with eachother for years on and off until he got with his current gf so I know what he’s like and know what he’s doing.

I don’t know what I should do at this point. Everyone keeps telling me to move on but me and him are definitely drawn to each other. But its not like I’m obsessed with him. 

Our relationship history is as follows:

We started sleeping with each other when I was like 14/15 and he said he wasn’t getting in a relationship. Then out of nowhere he gets a girlfriend and stops talking to me for a few months but then he started sleeping with me even though he was with her.

Then they broke up and we carried on as normal until he met his current gf and he stopped talking to me for 2 years. Then they broke up and we slept with each other a few times until they got back together and then he didn’t speak to me for another 2 years.

One cool thing about knowing the dances as a guy is that many women love to dance. 

Let me tell you a predictable scenario that plays out anytime I’m at a dance club, house party, or just with colleagues at a staff celebration that has music -

-There are women who wish to dance. 

-They dance with me and enjoy the experience of having me as the person guiding the steps. 

-They feel motivated to return to that experience.  

The fact that I myself have studied, practiced, and continue to work hard to create a great dance floor experience for any lady I dance with - that’s something that makes me a certain type of dance partner… *it does *not*, however, make every lady I dance with a delight as a dance partner. 

With each different woman - maybe dancing with her ends up striking me very well, maybe it doesn’t. But I treat all ladies the same while performing my role as the guy smiling, leading, and hosting them for a dance. 

And the truth is that, it does not happen very often that I run across someone who feels like “home” as a dance partner. 

Dating - and specifically sex in dating - may be like that too for people today. 

If you’ve ever had a wonderful time on a date, as well as in the bedroom afterwards… but the dating partner later felt no motivation to return for another meetup - it may be that he was skilled &amp; effective at creating quite a nice experience for you… but that ability is something that makes *him* a certain type of partner… it does not guarantee that he will find *you* to be a delight to partner with.

Whenever we’ve caught up, the meetings have been cordial interactions about the work and stuff we need to work on. Whenever there’s personal stuff being shared (I’m not the sort of person who talks or asks about personal lives unless asked), my senior colleague is the one that has done so - for example, she dropped into the conversation that she’s going through divorce and separated from husband. We also don’t have a relationship or interaction outside the workplace.

Hello, I am a 19 year old genderless creature. I've recently had surgery that compleatly removed my genitals, so I really just have smooth skin and a hole for urine (and a whole lot of scar tissue) downstairs now. It's the body I've alwasy wanted, and it feels so wonderful living every day without genitals.

However, there is an issue of sexual pleasure no longer being as easy as it was when I had a hole and a fully expsoed clit (gosh, it makes me feel so good just to think that *i don't really have a cervix anymore*). While perviously touching myself would make me feel ashamed to have genitals, now that I don't have them masturbation is no longer sad but it rarely produces any pleasurable sensations.

However, most of my clit is still below my skin, as are most of the other nerves from my old parts. Because of it I can still feel pleasure it's just a lot harder. (ANd honestly, never feeling pleasure again is better then what masturbating was like with genitals, which felt like sexually assaulting myself).

Luckily, I got a chance to feel sexual pleasure for the first time this morning. My girlfreind woke up and was kind of just petting me (which is something I really enjoy). She hasn't really ever wnated to touch my crotch before (she's very heterosexual, and I am not male bodied), but today she asked if she could do so now that I'm semi-recovered.

It was amazing. She was just sort of petting it, and tocuhing the skin. It felt really weird to have my new anatomy played with, because it's so diffrent to what I've had my entire lfie, like it's just so weird to have fingers touching a peice of skin that wasn't always there. But it also felt so wonderfu, like this is how I was always meant to be loved, and my gf is so gentle yet so powerful like a scalpel or a rapier. It just all felt so right. The actual feeling seperated from the gender euphoria wasn't much more pleasurable then having one of my breasts rubbed, but thje emotions made it feel so amazing.

Idk if this was weird to right about. I feel like I just need to tell someone. I havn't really felt fully human recently. Idk, I often feel like some sort of andriod, or a creation of the bene tleilax. I just keep thinking about how strange and inhuman my feelings about my body are,  and how diffrent they are from how the rest of the world feels.

She had read receipts on and never read it. She was posting stuff on her snap story and when the time came, I'm glad I didn't go because she flaked.

 After a few hours go by, I call her out on snapchat nicely about flaking. She said she simply forgot and she was sorry (yeah, right). I did my best to address any concerns she had like whether she was nervous, etc. She said she didn't like wine. Afterwards, I reached out to set up a hiking date, she agreed because it's something she likes.

If looks did not matter so much, then why are men with blonde hair dying out in the US? This pattern is so eminent. It is clear that women have a very strong preference for dark hair in men. But where did this originate. The media has portrayed blonde hair with youthfulness and femininity. Throughout our life, hair often turns darker with age. Darker hair is associated with maturity and masculinity. These attributes are what most women look for in a mate. They need maturity and a sense of security. The outer appearance adds validation.

Let's define male A and male B and give them the same personality. Suppose male A is very attractive to subject X whereas male B is very unattractive. Assume subject X has a past history of dating masculine looking men with dark hair. She does not prefer men with feminine features. Thus, let male B look very feminine and defective. 

Now, suppose these two males get a blind date. They both get a chance to put on a show for a set amount of time. To remove any influence of one event onto the other, assume her memory is erased after the first encounter (with male A). 

After these two events, it will be clear who will succeed and gain her infatuation. It will be clear that she will receive more reward and validation per unit time when in the presence of male A relative to male B. Thus, her interest level will be pushed in the + direction to a heightened degree.

Let's say I go out on a date with a woman and she seems like she likes me. There's a flame there (A very small one since we were total strangers until 30 minutes ago), but there's a giddy small flame.
My goal is to get that flame into a bigger one, and then into a fire and then into a roaring blaze.

If I shove my tongue down her throat, boom I just smothered the flame with a wooden log and now it's dead and she's getting tf out.
But let's say I end the date with a kiss on the cheek. That flame is now slightly bigger.

On the 2nd date, I put my arm around her while walking and playfully pull her into me. I then let go letting my hand brushing / holding the back of her neck. I playfully slap her hand a few times and say ""hold hands? For I don't feel like your 3rd brother.""
Now that flame is a tiny bit bigger.

At the end of the 2nd date, if she's lingering by my car, I gently pull her in and gently put my hand on the side of her neck and face and slowly go in for a wet smooch. We kiss a bit. Then before she goes I say ""Wait I bought you something. You're going to think I'm stuck in the 1950s, but here."" Then I open my car door giving her flowers.
That flame is now a fire.

Now on the next date there's making out. There's my hand on her knee and then her inner thigh. There's kissing on the neck. If we're somewhere private, it may lead to sex.

That fire is becoming a roaring blaze.

We're out of the city for Christmas and will be back for new years day. I mentioned to her that I'd like to take her for a walk to this beautiful spot, it's a hill that looks over the whole city, stunning. She was super excited about this when we were together, but hasn't mentioned anything since.

Once we're back, I plan to set a day for this and ask her to join. Hopefully she will. There's some uncertainty whether she likes me, so as long as this ""date"" goes well, I'd like to balls up and tell her. I feel like if she does like me, it could be super romantic to tell her on this hill, maybe we'll have our first kiss.

However, there I worry if this comes with pressure. First, if she doesn't like me, it might be super uncomfortable for her as we're on the top of a hill in the middle of nowhere. Second, if she responds that she doesn't like me, it would be a rather awkward 30 minute walk back to my car and dropping her home. I can deal with the awkwardness, and I realize it's a risk, but more than anything I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable.

I've went on several dates so far and I met a phd student who seems really cool. I went on two dates with her so far and am waiting for the third one. She said she would text today to let me know if she is available for another date tmmr, but I'm still waiting. She is super busy because of her schedule btw. Which brings me to my biggest struggle in dating. I get super anxious during the time between dates. I am fine in person confident, happy, but I feel like I text a lot after dates. Often I check in on a girl (if I really like her) twice a day to see how she is doing. This phd student already knows how I feel about her, I told her I like her and miss hanging out. I told her I miss her even though it's only been two dates in less than a week... She laughed during our texts and was seemed genuinely flattered after I told her I miss hanging out, but I think this kind of behavior of mine might be overbearing on women. I've had long term relationships, but I think I'm kinda weird because of how my anxiety manifests, because it makes me text a lot. I started doing Tai Chi classes to help with anxiety and already take meds for my anxiety. I'm an engineer, I like logic, rules, etc, but I can't find any rule to dictate how often to text somebody or contact them. The only rule I follow is not to double text if you don't get a response, but if somebody replies to my texts I will be judicious in talking with them throughout the day even if they're at work. This might be more of a vent than an advice post, but I'm curious to see how other people deal with this kind of anxiety if they are similar to me. I just want to stop scaring people off, but also want to show I'm interested!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1139868,public,self,Dating When You Have An Anxiety Disorder,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmh86c/dating_when_you_have_an_anxiety_disorder/,no_ads,0.0,,

So i asked him if it meant anything to him or if it was out of the blue and he said there definitely is something between us, but the moment felt right and natural as well. Long story short, he said he wants to take things slow between us and keep talking/hanging out like we have been since he never takes things slow and because of that, they never last. He also said he’s in no rush to date again, and wants to play things out and when things feel right and natural, have things slowly progress. Which i can respect and i appreciate the honesty obviously, and I’ve alwyas emphasized that i want to be friends with someone first before dating. We already have a really good foundation built as friends, based on tons of mutual respect and good communication.

Reddit what do you think about this? Am i reading too much into it?

I worry a lot because I’ve never really had a girl take interest in me and I don’t know why. Like I said I think I have a good personality and I’m fun to be around. I think I’d be a good partner and I have attractive qualities. I do however understand that my physical appearance is a limiting factor for me. 

I try to do the best I can, but honestly I’m just a mess genetically and I have been bullied and made fun for my physical appearance since I was like 4. I workout, take care of my skin, groom and all that and dress well. I think I put it more care into my appearance than most guys my age but still I’ve never had any form of positive attention from any girls.

The issue is I don’t know why. I don’t know what I need to fix to make myself eye catching. Honestly it’s really been fucking with my self esteem. I feel so ugly and unattractive all the time because I haven’t had a girl even have a crush on me. It’s pretty depressing and I worry that if I can’t get a girl to like me now when I’m in a place we’re everyone else is hooking up and dating, I’ll have no chance after I graduate and get a job and actual responsibilities and don’t have time to just have fun.

Hello,

I have a huge insecurity about having no experience. I want to be able to come to terms that every girl I meet will have a past and that I will never have that.

For example, I met a girl who I really like who has had a ton of hookups and ex boyfriends. I think she likes me but I have an insecurity where I feel like I don’t want to be with her because she has more experience that me. I know this is ridiculous and I want to get past this. 

The way I see it is that I feel really bad about myself because I don’t have a past where as she fell in love with other people and had “fun” with others while I had absolutely no one.

I’ve always thought that I could meet a girl and we could be each other’s “first everything” but I want to come to terms that chances of this very unlikely. I’ve gotten too old now for this to happen. 

I want to be able to accept this and not feel guilty about it.

So I finally did something I didn’t want to do and I asked someone I know in my personal advice for help with dating. I asked my older sister. She’s 26 and I’m 20.

I in better terms told her I was really struggling getting girls to notice me and like me and she told me, “right now you’re wasting your time trying to date. Focus on other things”, I asked her why and she said,

“Girls aren’t looking for guys like you right now, but they are going to be when they’re more serious and want a stable long term relationship. Give it until you’re my age and they’ll start wanting guys that have more substance. You’ll be irresistible by that point.”

I appreciated the advice but it kinda made me feel like shit. I don’t want to be. KHHV until I’m in my mid 20s. I don’t want to be lonely until then.

I’m like what?? It was only 10 minutes of sex.

I'm sure there's a lot of these posts so I'm sorry lol.
Matched him 3 weeks ago. 
He was very flirty from the start. He started being quite pushy for sexy pics, not in a rude way but just, kinda desperately after I added his number. I shut him down and said I'm looking for something serious, involving deeper emotion and that I don't really do nudes. I did send him one photo of me that wasn't on my profile wearing a more revealing top and told him that it was the limit and if he wanted more he had to give more (Not in those exact words but you know...) He asked to see more of my lower figure but I said no. 
After I stopped responding with that he finally said that it's fine, he prefers to take it slow and apologised if he made me feel devalued and uncomfortable. 
Next morning I texted him back (since I actually fell asleep before reading his apology) and the following conversation revealed that we both live incredibly close and work in similar fields. We also share similar religious backgrounds despite it being quite specific, and chatted a bit about that and more. He wanted to meet for a chat at a park near us but unfortunately I was busy for most of that week. We kept it going for a day or two until he suddenly stopped, so I casually asked if he was uninterested. 
He said - no, but he was worried about our age gap, to which I called out as weird since he knew my age throughout. Then he spilled that he needed to get over his ex and wasn't ready for a relationship even though he was curious and had a good feeling about me. I felt super sad since I am not stupid and knew what that meant. But I really was hopeful about him so I told him that we'll see what happens - it's a shame to never meet, not even once even though it seemed we had a connection. Relationships also don't happen in a flash anyway so we could just get to know each other more as people. Something to that effect.
He agreed. Soon we met up somewhere between our workplaces on an afternoon when we both happened to be free at the same time. I intuitively felt attraction between us and had a great time - I noticed he was so much more chatty and expressive in person than over text, where he is quite blunt and minimal. The pointers in text conversation that I thought he had previously dismissed, he brought back in-person, and he said he wanted to save those for a real chat. (He's a bit of a hippie and doesn't like online technology, which I don't mind since I also don't really like constant texting. He only really replies on average 2-4 hours after I text, usually on lunchtimes, afternoon break-ish times, or night time, though it's a bit irregular since he is self-employed) The conversation got much deeper than before and it was really nice.
As we were both going home he said he wanted to keep in touch and meet again, though again he reiterated that he will need to get over his ex because he still feels angry about it but he will soon. I think he also mentioned that there's something he feels angry about surrounding his ex and Christmas, hence his increased emotions around it at this time in particular.
He texted me to ask if I was home and said I was amazing... that I felt right, blah blah, bursts of short sweet messages. At this point I'm already kind of heartbroken and annoyed with his behaviour. I do honestly believe that he is /actually/ trying to get over his ex right now and not just using it as code even though it might be wishful thinking. 
Since then it's mostly been me initiating conversation, usually because 3 days or so pass with no contact and I feel the need to keep the connection. One time he has contacted me out of the blue was to send me a link to something we talked about that one time we met at like 6 AM. It was literally just the link and my anxious mind was popping OFF at whether this was a good message or a bad message lol. I've hinted a few times that he needs to tell me if he's not interested and he clarifies that he is. But again. He just... doesn't text. 
I asked if he wanted to meet again after another week or so to go to a casual drink-y type event (my main motive is that I would like to speak more in depth about the ex situation, though I have not mentioned that to him and haven't really pried about it thus far) but he said that he's probably not going to be available for the coming weeks. He had mentioned that he was setting 2 new big projects up work-related, not to mention it being holiday time (the ""coming weeks"" being Christmas and New year's) so I assumed the best and said OK.
I'm planning to contact him again after all these holidays pass if he doesn't say anything, but do I even bother? Is he trying to just let this fizzle if I don't stick around conveniently?

A bit of background. We spoke a little bit at university but not a lot. We haven’t kept in touch since university so this message would be out of the blue . It’s been about 6 years since I spoke to her 

My main questions are; do you think I should do it? Is it inappropriate to send her a message pretty much out of the blue asking to go on a date? If you think I should do it, how should I approach it?

This is the message I was thinking of sending her 

“Hi , sorry for message completely out of the blue. I’m not sure if you’ll remember me ; we were in halls together at university.

Mind you, I had never met this person, nor had any interaction. All I knew about her was what he'd tell me about their friendship, and then sometimes the messages he'd send him when I was with him.
It got to a point where some of the messages were a bit inappropriate, saying she missed him and wanted cuddles. I found those messages by going through his phone because after awhile I just got super paranoid something else was happening. I did find stuff. But he forgave me for going through his phone.
He apologised for engaging and enabling her, and for not shutting those messages down earlier. He asked her for some time of no contact so they could both focus on their new relationships and explore a friendship later.

She messages like a month after no contact expressing unresolved feelings. That's when I find out she had actually been calling me crazy from the beginning and never wanting him to date me. Again, her and I had never met.
I got upset and he apologized for never calling her out on that behaviour in the beginning.
He made it clear that at present he doesn't want contact and maybe in the future (unspecified time) they could explore friendship but right now he needs to focus on me.

I have told him that because of her bullying ways I don't want her to be part of my life. In due time I can forgive and forget what she did and how she behaved, but that doesn't mean I want to get to know her or start a friendship.
He is quite a forgiving person and feels my attitude is rigid and doesn't understand how I wouldn't be open to forgiving someone and letting them back in my life.

She's not reached out again but I do anticipate it will happen, and I do still feel I wouldn't be comfortable having her in my life. I wish her well but doesn't mean I feel a need to get to know her.
Am I truly a bad person for feeling this way?
I gave her chances to be a proper chances when I felt uncomfortable with their initial friendship. Even after when her messages became a bit intense I was a bit iffy but knew his friendship with her was important.

since then she would talk to me every time we worked together and offer her help. At first I just thought that she was just being nice to me and that she didn’t like me in a romantic way but lately I’ve been second-guessing that.

It meant a lot that she said that but I get thrown off because she calls me dude a lot so it makes me think she just sees me as friend.
