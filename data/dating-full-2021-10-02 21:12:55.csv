Anywyas I need some advice on a perwon that I'm seeing. Here's the story, I meet this guy(18M) on tinder, we chatted and we clicked. So, I proposed to him to go on a date to meet each other at my house to chill which I know is totally wrong but at the same time I was scared to be with him alone since I'm only 18 (girl) and my parents are overprotective. So a week pass, the day comes he's at my house and meet my parents ( I lied to them that I met him by via a friend and that I know him for a while) everything goes well my mok leaves to do some errands and my stays in the basement to do some work. While, we go upstairs to watch a movie. When seeing the movie, he asks to me cuddle I'm like sure, then he asks for a kiss and I'm mhm sure but only on the check. So, he does the same but I'm not feeling anything and not comfortable, afterwards, he leaves to meet up with his friends. We chatted for days after and he brings up that we should call have nicknames for each othwr I'm like sure ... He calls me bb...When we were talking he told me how his countries hated Jews and he showed me some comedies  or jokes made about them but in a lighthearted, I was like okay....and he also insisted to take for a ride which parents don't want too cuz they don't know the guy the same goes for me. But he still asked me multiples times I was like no and asked me what happened if he would to ask my mom. I said she sould would refuse, he was like okay. He also stated beforw we meet up a second time that how my mom would react if he told her we were bf and gf..I'm like umm idk. He also brought up his past about being a fuck boy and that he broke with his last girlfriend last year and it been a year he was in a relationship. After that we decided to meet up a second time for the second week at the mall, he meets parents everything goes go fine and I go with him alone to eat and we eat outside the mall, which purposely brought up about the contest who would win the bet for the first time which Idk how to respond to on his text. So, he won the contest and start kissing me which I thought would be a simple kiss which turn into making out and Idk how to react so I followed along. Afterwards he stops after doing it to times, he says it was good but I was to fast and that I should let him guide me I was like no i just want a simple kiss or one on the cheek but he insisted and I just give a simple kiss and we leave after to shop more. We are at a store qnd he says mention while we were lining up to pay our stuff at the cashier that we look good togheter , I'm like yea.. He also while we were sitting didnt stop keeping me closer or hugging me which I'm like im fine with it but he did stop sometimes when I was trying to see some stuff and while we walking I would hold his hand and if I wasnt near him he would pull me multiplrd back to him. Anyways after that he asks if he could go to my houses sobwe could have more private time, I'm like sureee.... He comes at my house  where my mom was upstairs and my dad downstairs. So, we decided to continue to watch the movie we didnt finish last week. While watching it, he would cuddle none stop and kissing me. When he would kiss me he would want to make out I was like avoiding hima nd telling him instead to kiss me on the cheek ( I really didn't comfortable) He would go on with this for another 2 hours were he would tell me I know you like this , let me do it I will guide you and I would avoid it He would get sad cuz I didn't make out with him. He would say thats the way I show my affection. I told him like 2 times that I don't want to kiss cuz im not in the mood, im really tired and I felt it was too rushed. So, then it was like 12 am I told hik it was for him to leave cuz I needed tomorrow to wake up early cuz I was busy, he would tell him he won't unless I would kiss him which for him wws making out and when I did it fast he would get sad and say your teasing me huh and to do it go real. So, I went him to the front door he told me to kiss him if not he won't leave until I did. I was getting mote and mote uncomfortable.  So, I did it and he left. Then, I went upstairs to see my mom and she told me she felt anxious in a moment , so she went downstairs to check us cuz she heard alot of moving around and when she went she told me I looked weird cuz my hair was all over the place and the guy was acting weird. I told what happened qnd she said she wanted to about it with me tmrrow but ended up talking about it with me all night. Which, I told her I didn't fell ok and that I was disgusted which she consoled me and told next time he comes she would stay in the same room and I need to tell him nicely that I dont to rush which I told I already told him and he wasn't listening , she was like sad and told that if I wanted to continue seeing him. I was not really but at the same time , I don't to ghost him suddenly cuz he knows where I live. She got sadder cuz it was my first going on a date with someone. I told her also thatbhe mention that It's his first serious relationship and that he previous relationship weren't serious cuz he had his fuck boy phase. He told me also he felt insecured. Afterwards, I stated with her a little bit and I felt really uncomfortable,  a numbed feeling and my body was shaking a little bit. Afterwards,  I go to sleep, and woke up to a text which he told me yesterday was nice hehe and that he liked the kiss, I was like not french kiss tho and that I felt that things are going to fast. It's been 5 hours and he didn't he resond yet.

I forgot to mention also that I mad eplans with him for third week also before even going to the second date. Idk , at the moment I fell like a made the biggest mistake of my life cuz I don't like him alot and wanted to see hownit would go if I would like it. He told me he likes me alot and he also send me pictures of him wothout a shirt of hik working out and asking me if I wanted to touch his ans which I was like wtf no....HELP!

I'm a 22 year old guy in college. When I was 11, I met a girl and we became ""special friends."" We were inseperatable. When we began maturing, we developed real romantic feelings and became girlfriend and boyfriend. It wasn't our hormones rushing, we genuinely loved each other. Even on school nights, we would be at each others houses helping with our homework and chores so we could cuddle and watch a movie. We were voted prom queen and king at our 8th grade dance.

When we were 16, she died suddenly. Her and some friends had been drinking, and one of them crashed a car they were in and she died. I had a rotten feeling that I couldn't explain, then her uncle called me and told me what happened. I felt like a part of me was buried with her.

6 years later, I'm ready to start dating again, but I can't seem to bring myself to it. I can't take the framed picture of us at our middle school prom off my desk. I just got into a relationship last July with a girl I liked, and after had what was supposedly ""the best S3x I \[my at the time new gf\] have ever had"" she has not pleased with the locket that used to belong to her, framed picture of us, her peppa pig toy, etc, the marinating attraction for her flipped off and the relationship ended soon after.

She‚Äôs got a boyfriend. He‚Äôs one year younger than us, and they got to know at the sea. I got to admit she‚Äôs very good looking. But I know I‚Äôm good looking too.

Ofc, I don‚Äôt look like a model. But I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3 and I‚Äôve been working out for years, in order to feel better with my physique. I‚Äôm always been pretty sporty tho, so I‚Äôve never had physical insecurities.

I know she had a crush on me for about 3 years, but i didn‚Äôt like her back. She never told me about it, but it was kinda noticeable. She then got to know a guy and they got together. But she‚Äôs started to show a more intense physical contact with me and she‚Äôs kind of jealous when she hears about other girls i talk about ( not romantically ).

So, I‚Äôve always been his close friend. But I don‚Äôt know if she feels something for me. 

Yesterday, I went to a party of a classmate of us. But she couldn‚Äôt come because her boyfriend was coming to visit her. Eventually, they argued and she got mad at him. She told me about this but didn‚Äôt want me to tell about it to my classmates ofc. 

i don‚Äôt want to wish them bad luck, but I got to admit I‚Äôd really like to. We usually go out together ( during school afternoons ) but i don‚Äôt know if it might become something more than a simple friendship.

\- Attractive (to me.) 

With ALL that being said, I have determined that there are no men like that out there anymore... that is single! Like okay MAYYYBBBBEEEEE I'm asking for too much but like we are all entitled to a ""type"". Regardless! 

I have decided to be the man I guess I will never meet... NOT gonna get a sex change but hey! I can be all tough and tactically.. too. I'm definitely more feminine and soft spoken, but I am so sick of waiting for a MAN to appear. 

So I am officially giving up and here's what I'm going to do:

\- Get my gun license and practice until I'm really good at it! (I think it'll be pretty cool)

\- I'm going to study to be a paramedic! (I'm in pre-nursing now)

\- I am going to enlist and serve my country (I'm asian... but I was born and raised here...)

\- I'm gonna start working out and MAYBE i can be a Firefighter/Paramedic

\- I will continue working on my faith to be a woman of God and not just a christian! 

\- Will continue wearing my sundresses and skinny jeans... I'm not trashing my femininity

\- I might as well stay single too.

So I‚Äôm currently in only a 4 month relationship but at the start of it she talked a lot about her past sexual relationships (one night stand, FWB‚Äôs and her ex) as if I was comfortable with it. I should of brought up how upset it made me when she talked about that stuff sooner but Instead I acted like I didn‚Äôt care. 

Now I randomly think about her with other guys and it makes me sad, like this morning I woke up and the first thing I thought of was her with another guy. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm scarred by her past and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. It‚Äôs unhealthy because when I get sad I go quite and in a bad mood which then affects our relationship.

I think at first I‚Äôm going to just ask if he‚Äôs like to get lunch with me. I‚Äôd like to get a feeling of whether or not he‚Äôs interested in me as more than a friend.

Here‚Äôs our deal. I‚Äôve known him now for almost two years. The first time I met him was ad a New Years party on New Year‚Äôs Eve of 2019. He happens to be my sister‚Äôs best friend‚Äôs brother. We were introduced, he was funny and I thought he was an attractive guy but at the time we both were dating other people.

I‚Äôve seen him a few times over the course of the last couple years. Usually at a party or a night out with a group of people. He‚Äôs always been pretty laid back. I think he might be a little shy and maybe awkward in large groups but he‚Äôs pretty funny when he gets to know you.

A few times I‚Äôve actually hung out with him when it‚Äôs only a small group and he‚Äôs seems way more comfortable. He‚Äôs more talkative and I got to know him just a bit better. He seems really like a good guy but until last November I was in a relationship. 

Then in July of this year I started to see him fairly regularly at my job. He‚Äôs a mail carrier and he happened to get assigned to the route that delivers to my job. I work at a veterinary clinic. So I‚Äôve seen him maybe a couple times a week since then. A few of the other girls at work have commented that they think he‚Äôs really cute. And I have to admit he looks good in his uniform! He always wears a polo shirt and he has these big shoulders and is stocky but not muscular and he‚Äôs got the sexiest sleeve tattoos on his arms.

So Friday when I saw him and he smiled and said hi I just realized that I‚Äôm a dummy for not asking him out already! I talked to my sister today and found out that he is single my sister of course knew right away that I was asking for myself so she texted her friend. Who then texted me and said go for it! She said her brother is a sweet guy and he once told her that he thought I was really pretty.

So the first day I actually get to see him this week I‚Äôm going to ask him if he‚Äôd like to go to lunch my treat some time. I‚Äôm going to say  ‚ÄúHey I think you‚Äôre pretty great and I‚Äôd like to get to know you better. Would you like to maybe grab lunch some day? I‚Äôm buying.‚Äù

What does everyone think of this plan? I feel like even if he‚Äôs not interested and he lets me down it still won‚Äôt be awkward because I can always make sure I‚Äôm not at the front desk when he comes to deliver the mail. Plus it‚Äôs not like we see each other all that much outside of work so if it does t work out it‚Äôs not like a close friendship will be messed up.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1040714,public,self,I (25 f) think I‚Äôm going to ask this guy (25 m) that I‚Äôve known for a while out.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q08r1m/i_25_f_think_im_going_to_ask_this_guy_25_m_that/,all_ads,6,,,

This is going to be a lot of inference based off of eye contact, so feel free to tell me I‚Äôm in fantasy land. This is all extremely embarrassing.

So, there‚Äôs this absolute facemelter at my gym- I see her a couple of times a week at lunch-ish. I *think (pretty confident)* we‚Äôve been playing eye-footsies for a few months. I‚Äôm a little shy about approaching girls in the first place, but especially so at the gym‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to corner someone who isn‚Äôt interested. But- I really dig her vibe, and she seems to be consistently holding eye contact for a couple extra beats. Had she not been doing so, I would have stopped looking her way. 

She sometimes seems to end up in my corner of the gym‚Ä¶. maybe more than chance would indicate, but her eyes always find a wall when I‚Äôm walking by‚Ä¶ so, that‚Äôs either ‚Äònot interested‚Äô or nervous, but she's not actively avoiding me... I guess that's something. Wasn‚Äôt going to push it, even though I was starting to get a crush. As I said- really like her vibe.

Anyway, I started seeing her less frequently‚Ä¶ but there she was, one day this week- I‚Äôm a bit out of breath from whatever I was doing, and not expecting to see her: then, we‚Äôre walking towards/past each other, and there‚Äôs a total eye-lock (accidentally on my part, jaw half-way to the floor) and we both just sort of hold it‚Ä¶ long hold. Both making the same slightly surprised (read: stupid) face. Then, a second and a half later, I come to my senses and realize I should probably smile, but of course at that point it‚Äôs too late. Fine.

So- I think to myself, ‚Äòthat seemed‚Ä¶. auspicious.‚Äô A few minutes later I‚Äôm by the ‚Äòpaper towels and disinfectant-spray‚Äô station, and I throw a look her way, and what I got back was‚Ä¶ more than eye-footsies. I would have bet a month‚Äôs salary it was an ‚ÄòI‚Äôm interested‚Äô look. This is about a full ‚Äòone-one thousand‚Äô of eye contact from 10-15 feet, and if I were to add any qualitative modifiers to that last part, they would have to involve sex. If those weren‚Äôt sexy eyes, I may have completely lost my touch at reading faces. Which could very well be the case. Should have smiled, should have walked over, but I was just kind of stunned. Haven't had a girl look at me like that in... a while. \*The other reading of this would be she was trying to mean-mug me, and doing a very sexy, very bad job of it. She does have fierce eyes, but even in retrospect, with the full weight of subsequent events upon me, it doesn‚Äôt seem all that likely. 

Anyway, she‚Äôs there again the other day- made a little eye contact when I come in. I think I'm not deluding myself when I say that she looks up from across the gym and looks right at me. She walks toward the dumbbell area and I turn toward her and try to smile- she‚Äôs already moving across, but she would‚Äôve been able to tell I was making a (weak) attempt. I think. I'm really, really bad at this. 

I'm a bit discouraged, having thought that this was going to be a cake-walk after that last thing. Decide to go ahead and wing it- put my stuff at the bench next to her- of course my backpack dislodges my music player, which goes flying, so I look like a clumsy asshole‚Ä¶ I go capering around to recover it. As this is happening, she *immediately* bounces. Gets right-the-fuck out of there. I play it off like I was actually there to do some exercise, fooling absolutely nobody.

So whatever I thought up until that moment, my read is: this is ‚Äòall she wrote.‚Äô There‚Äôs no misreading taking off as-fast-as-possible when I try to come talk to her. I feel really gross that I was maybe making  (modestly aggressive) eye contact which *I* thought was affectionate, but was actually making her uncomfortable. But, like, I don‚Äôt hold eye contact with people I‚Äôm not interested in‚Ä¶ and girls that aren‚Äôt interested in me don‚Äôt hold eye contact either. I feel like that‚Äôs just a natural response.

Boyfriend's best friend of 20 years thinks I'm TOO FAT for him

I'm size 8/10. I am partially disabled but pretty, young looking, and also eat a low sugar diet and work out 3 times a week. 

Boyfriend  also works out but is 15 pounds overweight and is sensitive about it. I  find him sexy as heck, but now he is acting oddly distant since his  friend relayed this opinion to him

I am so disgusted and irate that I don't even know how to handle it.

I  also feel beaten down because I know that bf's brother (who is  overweight himself) asked my bf WHY he was dating me since all his  previous girlfriends were size 2s....

I've never had any other boyfriend or their friends insult my curves. If anything they were super nice and flattering.

Is my boyfriend just surrounded by awful people? (They all grew up in a very superficial area near D/C)

Or this his way of telling me I'm too heavy for him? Seems cowardly if that's the case

We've been dating several months and this makes me want to run away. I dread the idea of going back on the apps.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1040973,public,self,Boyfriend's best friend of 25 years thinks I'm TOO FAT for him,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0bg9d/boyfriends_best_friend_of_25_years_thinks_im_too/,all_ads,6,,,

I don't want to be loved. I want people to be infatuated with me. I want my partner to never see my flaws. Or at least, to never acknowledge them as flaws. I want to just see my partner's flaws as cute.

But infatuation doesnt last. Even if I can keep mine up, they'll always transition into love. I can't do that, so we're never on the same wavelength.
