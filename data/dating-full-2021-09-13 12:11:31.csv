I've been their occasionally over the years, but lately I've been going over there a lot more often because there's a new girl (19) working at the counter, and I like her.

She just moved into town about month and a half ago, and I met her about a month ago. We hit it off pretty well, and every time I go there now, I always end up chatting with her. She's fun to talk to, easy on the eyes, and super sweet. After about a week, I managed to get her number, and we've texted a lot.

There's a white rose bush outside the ranch store, and one day I decided to pick one when I was about to go inside, and give it to her, just as a nice gesture. She happily accepted it, and when I was outside I could see her through the window holding the rose and looking at it with a smile. Now, every time I come I make sure to pick a rose.

Last weekend he texted me that he’s coming to this work party and maybe we could get a drink there to which I said yes sure. I knew that he’ll be there with his girlfriend and it didn’t feel like he was hitting up on me (although I’m a bit attracted to him but not willing to make any move since I know he currently has a girlfriend even though their relationship doesn’t seem so serious). I met him accidentally and we only had a small talk for about 2 minutes or even less, no drink was mentioned. He was the one that ended the conversation. After a couple of hours I received a voucher for free drinks and I didn’t want to drink anymore (and my work friends were kinda waisted) so I texted him if he wants that voucher. I assumed he’ll use it with his girlfriend anyway and it was definitely not an invite.
He opened the message 3 days later and didn’t even bother to reply something like “sorry I didn’t see your message” or anything.

We were supposed to meet at 9:15. I get there at 9:15, text her I’m there, no response. I call her and it rings but I can’t reach her. I wait till 10:00 and didn’t hear from her so I unmatched her.

4. Met on hinge on Friday and she says she can’t meet till Sunday because she’s on a shift. We agree to meet on Sunday at 7pm and text through Saturday. On Sunday, I text her asking how she was doing and if she was still down to meet. No response. Text her at 7 asking her what happened. She responds at 7:30 saying that she “forgot she had dinner plans with friends and maybe tomorrow will be better”.

This kind of behavior completely baffles me. If I ever agree to meet someone I try my best to make it and if I can’t, I let them know ASAP. I do this because I value my word, don’t want to waste anyone’s time and certainly don’t want to hurt them by thinking I flaked on them because they’re so low on my list of priorities.

I don’t understand a couple of things:
1. why do people agree to meet up if they’re not going to commit the time
2. If for whatever reason they can’t make it or change their mind, why don’t they have the basic decency to let the other person know ahead of time?

Hello all, first sorry if this is in the wrong place, the other subs I've tried have all rejected me for being too new.

Second a little tldr, I'm a male virgin who can't seem to get attractive women to even notice I exist. 

The detailed version, this may take a while, sorry. I'm a 40year old male virgin who seems invisible to the opposite sex if they are any more attractive than ""cute"". I have tried many times over the years but I cannot even get a woman to acknowledge my existence if there is not some kind of business going on (I don't mean sex workers, I'm not quite that desperate, yet). I've tried approaching women in bars and clubs, when I was in college, when I was active duty military, when I'm in bookstores, when I'm out doing my one big hobby (wargaming), when I take my cat to the vet or outside so she can play in grass, I've even tried dating websites. Big old goose egg each time. If I find a woman attractive she doesn't even notice my existence. Now ones I want to avoid, some of them seem to respond to my presence (not in a good way either). I've been told that I'm not a bad looking guy, and female coworkers say I'm a great guy to be around, but single women, (nerd alert)well let's just say Tie Fighters in Star Wars have more success than I do with women. I would not be posting here if I had not felt close to rock bottom. I truly don't know what to do at this point. I've heard all the cliche statements, be more confident, be patient, there is someone for everyone, God has a plan, ECT. I need some real advice here. I don't want to hit my 41st birthday and not even have a girlfriend.

 As for what I'm looking for in a woman, nice personality, good sense of humor, height weight proportionate, have some kind of faith grounding, and not have kids ( I want kids of my own, not to raise another man's children). I don't really care she's more experienced in bed than I am. I fully expect that the last of those will cause people to say I'm being unreasonable, I get it, but I need to have some minimal standards, even if that makes me seem shallow. 

Thanks if anyone actually read this to the end. Double thanks if anyone actually has a clue what is so wrong with me that I can't even get a hello from a pretty woman.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1005055,public,self,"Please help, I need usable advice",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnh3wo/please_help_i_need_usable_advice/,all_ads,6,,,,

We had lots of common ground and it went on for 2.5 hours. All good, no red flags. During our date, she asked about dating history, so I told her i had an ex-girlfriend and that we broke up in 2018 as we werent on the same page etc. 

Today I ask her for a second date and she says to me ""I feel you havent healed from your last relationship, or something is still upsetting you. You're a great person, I would genuinely love to be friends"". Normally, girls would either not reply or say that she didnt feel a connection or we didnt have much in common - which is fair enough.

Now, I found her comment very bizarre as I told her I was over my ex, and i was super happy/positive on the date (and in life generally). Her comments seem very very specific, if that makes sense. And I've never received a rejection with such a rationale. 

My only theories are, that shes hiding something in her personal life (e.g. shes still talking to her ex) or she generated a random bullshit excuse to cover it up, which evidently is a very crappy excuse.

I (34M) met a woman (31F) through Match back in mid-August. We hit it off pretty quickly and were messaging back and forth quite a bit since we had so much in common. Due to a busy travel schedule for her and a busy work schedule for me, we only managed to get together for 2 dates, one a couple weeks ago and the second this past Thursday.

We were messaging regularly between the dates, and the dates themselves were absolutely wonderful, with Thursday's date ending in a long goodnight kiss and tentative plans for a 3rd date (she had to coordinate some things in her schedule, so nothing formal was set).

Then, yesterday, she texted me in the morning to tell me she couldn't see me again. She had met a guy shortly before me, and they decided on Saturday that they were going to be exclusive. I let her know that, while it bummed me out personally, I understood and wished them well.

The thing that gets me is how upset I find myself. We had only been on 2 dates and been messaging for less than a month. We hadn't hit any big milestones or anything and were still just getting to know one another, but my heart sank when I got that text.

Now, for those that aren't on Match, it has an icon next to a match's name that says how recently they've been on. Since she is one of my most recent matches I messaged with, her name is still towards the top of my list and I can see that she has been logging in since then. Odds are she's just informing other matches of the situation as they message her, but for some reason I feel hurt and lied to. The reality is that regardless of the reason, she's not interested in pursuing a relationship with me, and I should just let it go. I plan to unmatch her so that she's no longer showing up, and I've already deleted her contact and text chain from my phone, but this just sucks.

I know I'm overreacting to all of this. She's a wonderful person and so much fun to be around, and I truly wish her the best.

I'm also fairly sure she's tried to kiss me, but the situation hasn't felt quite 'right' for it so far - she settled for a kiss on the cheek the last time.

She's expressed insecurities about things moving a bit too fast emotionally, so we agreed to take it one day at a time and see how things go. Nonetheless, we spent pretty much the entire weekend together and agreed to take a short break from hanging out just to catch our breath a little.

Today (Monday) she asked me if I'd be fine if she went on a date with a guy who has apparently been very persistent recently and she wouldn't want to stay wondering what he's like. I said that it was up to her, but I can't help but feel sort of jealous. 

In some ways I feel like the best thing I could do is nothing, but it's definitely got me feeling a little uneasy because I could definitely see us as a couple in the future.

Long story short I was the dumper, did the no contact thing for 3 months. I knew I wanted her back right away, but I also needed to work on myself a bit and get a few things in order.

I contacted her and apologized, and we have been talking again. FaceTime, calls, texts for the past couple weeks. She is def the type of person that is receptive when you lay it on the line, “I still have feelings” “I still love you”. All that stuff kinda got her to at least respond more, she hasn’t said much back yet. I assume she’s still a bit guarded.

We love 2 hours away from each other and used to spend weekends together. So I’m having a bit of trouble with a first date, plus I also have to bring my dog (he can’t go to daycare yet and I have absolutely no one to watch him. She likes him anyway)



Anyway, I’m thinking of asking her to go:

Apple picking for a little and then maybe have a small picnic in the bed of my truck at a lake down the street. A couple blankets, lights. Just hangout a bit after, not hookup. (She had sent me the truck picnic idea before we broke up). 

Then just talk as friends, avoid the serious talk. But I want to wow her, I think she’s that type, she likes those romantic things.

I’ve known the guy I’m with for some time now, we’ve been friends for about three years now.

I notice there are still times when I can get a bit toxic or am on the fence of doing that. For example, I loose trust really easily and start questioning how supportive they really are. This isn’t just a relationship thing, I do this with everyone anyways. Anyhow, it can lead to the other person feeling pretty upset if I get standoffish about it. It hurts them and sometimes, I run my mouth during moments when I should be supporting them. I’m in therapy right now and am medicated for ADHD. I guess I’m wondering what else I can do to sustain the relationship? I’ve never experienced anything this stable before.

Sorry for the mistakes, English is not my primary language.

&amp;#x200B;

Since i'm a child, i always dreamed of the ""generic life"" (as some would say) of having a family, so, yeah, i would like to find someone who will want a serious story and with whom it will work well. My parents always told me to work hard in school, find a good job and have a good life situation and that all those things would help me get what i whish in life.

&amp;#x200B;

After i was done with school (I did two banchelor degrees at the same time (Maths and Programming)), i decided to move away from where my family was living. I've lived my entire life in suborban areas, and needed some change. Also, i wanted to try living in a city since there is more people, so more chances to meet someone. I found a great job which i love, but after one year (at age 24) living in the city, i decided to buy my first (small) house in suborban of this city since urban life wasn't for me. I'm not saying that i thought that what i have or did would ""impress"" girls, i just thought i would mean  that i'm kinda responsible and smart.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, i'm still not able to find someone who both like me and want the same serious thing. Don't get me wrong, I had some dates and girlfriends in the past, but it never last because either we were not at the same ""stage"" in life (even if we are the same age, still live like a student and party almost every night) or they just don't want anything serious (fwb or one night stands). I think i'm at least an average looking guy, but lately (for a year) i didn't get much matches on dating apps, and some women called me ""ugly"" and/or ""boring"". I was not completely unhappy in life, but those words and reality did hurt me.

&amp;#x200B;

I got really lucky last week, and landed a date with two great women. I've gone on two dates with each now, and like them both.

&amp;#x200B;

One of them has had bad luck in her life: father passed away last year. Good friend passed away last year. Her family is abusive and toxic, and she is distancing herself from that situation. Somehow, she has turned out pretty normal. Small group of friends. University educated, but dropped out after 3rd year when dad passed away, does not plan on finishing. We both love riding motorcycles (went for a ride on our first date, and that was a huge rush of excitement), both like working out, and we both had the same favorite band and as teenagers (which was a great topic of convo for a night). She doesn't like her job, but is looking to go to community college to pursue a new career. She's 12 years younger than me. I'm very attracted to her in all aspects, except I really find it a burden to listen to all of the shitty things her family has put her through. It seems that has taken up all of the space in her life, and she's focused on it.

&amp;#x200B;

The other woman has a successful business, as I do, is very active outdoors, as I am, and seems to have a large social circle and a good family. University educated. Very full calendar (trains 6 days a week in long distance trail running and weight lifting). I don't have the same fitness goals as she does, so we won't be training together much. Has just moved 1 hr away from the big city, but commutes to her business twice a week. I find her equally attractive. Yet I feel intimidated by all of her successes, large social circle, full calendar, and 1 hr distance. I'm nowhere near the superstar she is, yet very impressed and find it all great.

&amp;#x200B;

The first one needs help, which I'm not opposed to doing. There's something noble in helping people out. I do realize that a person who needs help has to put in the initial effort, has to make change, can't be ""rescued"". But I do believe some people just need a boost in life. The second just shines in all kinds of ways, doesn't seem to need anything except a partner, yet I don't know if I can ""keep up"" or if I'll actually be able to spend much time with her. I wonder if she'll lose interest in me because I'm not the superstar she is, and because we won't be spending much time together during the week.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1005157,public,self,"Met two great women, need advice.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnj4by/met_two_great_women_need_advice/,all_ads,6,,,,

I am a single GENUINE 39-year-old man who is looking for the love of my life. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A ONE-NIGHT STAND, AND I AM NOT THE KIND PERSON THAT ONLY WANTS SEX.  To tell you the truth, people who are just looking for sex are bawdy, indecent, pornographic, underprivileged flunkees who do not have any respect for the opposite sex.  Also, they can never be trusted!  Our society needs to stop treating people as sex objects and start treating them as REAL HUMANS WHO HAVE FEELINGS!  

I have cerebral palsy, and I'm on a walker for short distances and in a wheelchair for long distances. I hope that does not deter you beautiful women in any way. I have a huge heart that makes up for my flaws. Humans are not perfect. Don't we all have a few flaws about ourselves? I am in Missouri City, TX, a suburb just outside of Houston. I am very outgoing, adventurous, and loving. I like to go out to eat, go to movies, go camping, traveling, go to the beach, shop, and just being out in nature. I do try to workout a couple of times a week, if not more. It depends on how by body is feeling that day!  I want someone funny, smart, adventurous, loving, and caring, like I am. I do not smoke. I do not do drugs. I do seldomly drink(a glass of wine at Thanksgiving and Christmas)! I have tried my best by searching for love on dating sites, but I have gotten scammed terribly on those! I am also willing to do whatever my mate wants to do. I guess that's categorized as adventurous, though, huh?

There was definitely a lot of flirting and we have a lot of friends in common, and a lot in common as well so I definitely wanted to pursue it. I went as far as sending a friend request on Facebook, sending a sweet message on how nice it was to meet him and asking him out. He responded with how he likes me too and wants to have a zoom date. I texted saying I was up for the zoom date and asking what times worked for him. 
I think I’ve been left on read because it’s been 2 days. 
Around the same time as I met him, I’d been texting someone online (we also have a lot in common). After the wedding, we went on one date and then he texted me saying he was going to be MIA because of a deadline. I was happy that he let me know of that and once the deadline was over, we went on a second date and it was awesome!!! 
Honestly, after meeting this person and an amazing second date, I have very little interest to pursue this person at the wedding. I still don’t know him well and I’m sensing either his lack of interest or desire to play games and I’m not up for that!
If it was him playing games, he lost someone who genuinely wanted to connect, get to know him and be intimate. 
So word of advice, if you don’t like someone please be honest. If you do like someone don’t play games. 

If something did genuinely keep him off his phone the last 2 days and he texts back about it and asking for the zoom date, I will admit I was wrong and go on that zoom date (provided it isn’t too late and the guy I’m currently seeing and I move forward).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1005207,public,self,Seriously ... don’t play games,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnjltc/seriously_dont_play_games/,all_ads,6,,,,

I feel bad, because I feel like this kind of behavior might be what’s holding him back. He’s cute and smart otherwise and that’s why I swiped on him.

I 22M recently had a 2nd date with 19F about a day and a half ago that went extremely well. It was night picnic at beach with wine and some food. The 1st date was a bit of physical contact. This 2nd one Is e made out multiple times and talked about personal stuff and laid down cuddling with each other and I was playing with her hair giving her kisses on the sand till like 4 am the next day. The only thing that idk if it was mood killer or what was that at some point she asked me what I was looking for at the moment. I said I was looking for a relationship and she answered with she had no idea yet. She also mentioned she has never been in relationship before. She is a bit sheltered socially. Will say we were buzzed as we almost drank the whole bottle of wine at that point. Anyhow she dropped me off home made out with her a bit before I got home and told her she sets up next date. I don’t remember if she said yes or no. We texted a bit the next day was thinking about calling her that night but I went out drinking with friends. Today at the point of writing this is the morning for me and thinking about calling her at the end of the day if she hasn’t set up the 3rd date to talk about setting up. Today’s my brother  bday so I will be preoccupied with that so I won’t have to overly think about it during the day. Do you guys/girls think it comes off as too needy calling her later if she hasn’t setup the date yet? I do like this girl and just want to kiss her again.

I tried making out with her and it first maybe it was too much and she didn’t open her lips that much, and maybe I smelled like vodka and tequila bc she gave some gum lol. We danced a bit more, I just get extremely touchy and was grabbing on her waist, her butt, but never obnoxiously (I hope), and once we started getting better with the dancing, we started kissing a bit more, and she danced with her head into my chest and it felt like a good time.

I had to leave bc it’s as getting late, I helped her find her friends bc they went to chill in some other room, and I dropped her off snd kissed her goodbye. Usually I’m used to girls not meaning anything and they just want to have fun in the moment, but she’s been pretty responsive over text and so I asked her out.

I’m sort of afraid that it’s gonna be awkward and maybe we had beer goggles and it ends up being like weird, but at the same time I’m just curious to see how she actually is in person. I said we could do a picnic date and I’m probably going to bring wine just to ease the nerves, but still it almost feels like a blind date (at least for me) bc I remember her being really cute but I can’t exactly remember her face.

Later that evening a text followed where she explained, that she thought I was kind and cute but that her gut feeling just wasn't right. Fair enough so far.

Okay so we know that the biggest thing here is, “just be confident” or “have good hygiene”.

So first I really think the idea that if you’re struggling with dating you’re some smelly obese basement dwelling neckbeard is a really fucked stereotype which reaffirms the idea that if you’re single you must be terrible. Second, confidence with nothing to back it up is arrogance and it like bad.

Like I’ve been with my girl friends when a fellow ugly guy approaches them and they will complain about gore confident he is because he’s “too ugly to be that confident” or they’ll say he’s creepy for talking to them at a party. When an ugly guy has confidence it’s off putting to women. When an attractive guy does, he’s hot.

I feel similarly with the advice to “just live your life and meet people naturally”. This is really only something that works for women and hot guys. No average looking or less guy is going to have a woman just attracted him by him existing. That’s a massive load of bullcrap. Ugly and average men have to ask out women they have to find women that like them. They don’t just get women by existing.

Lastly “looks don’t matter it’s really your personality that’s hurting you” anyone that has ever said this is an attractive person. They just are too blind to the fact that they get special treatment by the world for being good looking, but since that’s all they’ve known it must be normal and how everyone else lives. It’s the same as white Americans denying any existence of white privilege.

What would you do???

I met with a woman I was chatting to on tinder. When we spoke online she said she was just curvy and her pictures suggested she was.

We agreed to meet at a local bar on a saturday afternoon. When she turned up she must have been 300 pounds and 5 feet 8. She was wearing a tight white dress and high heels, which made her look even larger.

We had a couple of drinks at this bar and saw that down the road there was a football (soccer) game taking place. The team was a tier three team so barely professional.

We agreed to go and watch the match. Outside the game we purchased tickets and a ticket to the half time match lottery.

She could barely fit in her seat and ended up taking up most of mine. We were getting stared at due to how tight her clothing was.

When the half time lottery draw was announced, to our suprise she has won, a minor prize of a around £360.

She walked out onto the center of the soccer pitched to collect her prize when all of a sudden loads of the fans started shouting ''who ate all the pies'' ''you fat bastard''

She waddled back her seat before sitting down next to me and explaining that some of the fans were jealous of her curves.

We left the stadium after the match and we have not spoke since.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1005323,public,self,Crowd reacts to my date,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnlkmg/crowd_reacts_to_my_date/,all_ads,6,,,,

No, I'm not a multi-million dollar worthy YouTuber, but I'm famous enough to be known in multiple countries across the world, and I'm able to make a decent income out of my online footing without relying on a separate job. My channel is focused on DIY projects. I think I'll leave it at that.

The girl followed me on my Facebook page last month. She's gorgeous but more importantly, she seems to have a similarly niche channel to mine, albeit with little to no subscribers. We interact here and there a few times; a comment here, a story reply there, you know the drill. Those story replies eventually turn into real conversations and before you know it, I had developed a crush on her. Every day or two, she sends me a random picture she thought was funny and we'd talk for a bit. Over the course of a couple of weeks, I find out that we have a lot in common; we're interested in the same genres of movies, the same TV shows. At this point I have a suspicion that she likes me back and as I'm building up the courage to ask her out, she asks me out one day.

""You came across my mind today so I made you this keychain. It's not much, it looks awful, wanna go for a cup of coffee some day?""

I suddenly feel like the happiest I'd ever been. I clean myself up, shave my beard, cut my hair and get a new pair of shoes.

We go out and... it's the worst date I've ever been on.

We meet up at a local coffee shop, we exchange greetings and we start talking about each other. Well, she does. For 10 minutes straight, she just talks about herself. When it's my turn to talk, before even a minute has passed, she cuts me off mid sentence and changes the subject.

""So, how'd you get your channel so big?""

I'm taken aback but I answer her. More questions follow. ""What tips did you follow? How long did it take you to reach your first milestone? How much do you make off of it?"" She takes out her phone and shows me a couple of videos she was editing and asks me for advice on who the hell even knows what at this point. Then she asks me if I can help her grow her channel, if I can be her go to guy for questions and future advises. 

I swear, the moment she cut me off and brought up my channel, even though I couldn't see my face, I could picture a warm smile turning into an expression of pure loss. Confusion. All of that, was for *this*? 

At the end of our date, she hands me the keychain she made. It's fucking beautiful, which makes this even more painful. I fake the hardest smile as I accept it. The bill comes and I reluctantly take my wallet out, forcing that same broken smile before she pushes my wallet down and insists on paying. In any different scenario, I would not have let the woman pay but I was just out of energy at that point. I put my wallet back in my pocket as I watch her pay. 

As the waiter leaves, I sip on my iced coffee that's now watered down and tasteless as she texts someone on her phone. A car stops near the entrance, she puts her phone down and tells me her boyfriend's here. She tells me she'd had a wonderful time and would love for us to meet again. I fake another smile as I watch her walk out the door. 

I sit there by myself for 2 minutes. I fake-scroll on my phone to look busy, take another sip of the now desaturated iced coffee, and I let out a silent little laugh.

""What the fuck, man.""

Look, she wasn't malicious with her intentions. She was actually extremely nice, the keychain she gave me was tailor-made for me, and it's clear how much effort she put into it. I actually hate how much I love it, lol. It's just, something was lost in translation. What I thought was interest in *me* as a human being, was nothing more than interest in *my influence* and what I can offer. I guess, looking back, her paying the bill for the both of us was her way of paying me for my troubles.

We had just been dating for a month and starting dating over the summer. We met last year in college and hung out a lot during the summer, despite living an hour and a half away from each other. I had never been in a serious relationship before this one and I asked her to be my girlfriend relatively soon. She was ecstatic and we started dating, having a great time. We then moved back to college and have had a lot of fun. 

We both come from very different backgrounds. My family is very open and lets me have a lot of free reign. She has a great relationship with her parents, but they are much more conservative and she is super innocent. Earlier on in the relationship I tried to initiate having sex, but she said she wasn’t comfortable doing this yet so I stopped and apologized. She told me that she had previously been in a 4 year relationship that she ended because he was pressuring her to have sex. I completely ok with waiting until we get to know each other better, but don’t want to wait until marriage. She said she didn’t want to wait until marriage, but wasn’t ready yet and I am completely ok with this. 

I also smoke a lot of weed. I started smoking my sophomore year of high school and smoked daily until this past summer.  Since then I have stopped smoking daily and maybe smoke once or twice a week. Because of this, weed has been something that seems pretty casual to me. I had brought up the idea of her smoking with me a few times (she has never smoked), I even tried convincing her to smoke with me. I did not realize how uncomfortable all of this made her feel until later. She didn’t say no the first time I asked, so I waited a week or so to broach the topic again. Wednesday, the day before the last time we talked, I brought out my dab rig and was planning on smoking when it was just the two of us. I realized how uncomfortable she seemed and decided not to smoke and put it up. She thought I was bringing it out to get a reaction from her, but I genuinely did not mean to and was just going about my day as usual. 

After this night we had a talk Thursday night. I had just gotten sick that day and was really tired. But basically we talked about how we are really different people and have different values, which I agree with, but I said I really enjoyed spending time with and want to continue. After our conversation she left. I sent her a Snapchat later that night apologizing for my actions and making her feel uncomfortable. She opened it the next morning and didn’t reply so I decided to let her have some space. It was Friday morning when she odr me and I haven’t talked to her since (today is Monday). I’ve been sick this weekend so I’ve had a lot of time to reflect and I really do want to keep hanging out with her, but I’m not sure how I should go about it. 

Other than all of this I really enjoy spending time with her. She is one of the nicest people I have ever met and she is super genuine and driven. I’m not ready for our relationship to end, but I’m not sure what actions to take.

This was our first time seeing each other in close to 9 years. Unfortunately, i had to go back but have been working towards closing the gap since and looking to permanently move to where he is in December.

It started out him buy a cake for her son on her birthday and  have hanged out together with another couple some time. Last night he spoke about him wanting to hang out with her together with his best friend whom i assume has never met her before. I confronted him about how his relationship with girl is making me uncomfortable but he got really angry.

And then he told me he is like that with all his gfs. He stays with them for a while and then he just looses feelings over time. I asked him does he tell the women he dates beforehead and he said yes, but they still want to date him anyway.

And then he said even his in the relationship he said he never fell in love or get butterflies, but he does treat them nice and do romantic things, but its because hes feeling lovey dovey and gushy, but because its the right thing to do.

So he does romantic things because hes trying to the right thing not because hes feelings feelings of infatuation.

He also says he knows how to act when women show other emotions like crying and he said he feels awkward when that happens.

So I asked him how did he even get relationships in the first place and he said all his exes are the ones who pursued him.

So yet questions is he the type that needs to pursue the women first to fall in love? Should I take a step back and let him pursue me and make effort for me instead?
