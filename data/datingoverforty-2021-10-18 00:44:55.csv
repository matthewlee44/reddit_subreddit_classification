1,qalya5,1634561074,Was I being a creep?,"The other day I ran into this lady I met back in 2017 (I was married to my ex wife at the time and we were just acquaintances) we had a lovely conversation and she told me about her podcast and asked me to follow her social medias etc. We started texting on weekends for a few weeks (mostly about her pet dog, politics and general topics). And we formed somewhat of a friendship and I started to kind of like her and I thought since we‚Äôre both single I‚Äôd ask her out. I thought I‚Äôd test the waters first so I asked her if she‚Äôd be open to date someone a few years younger than her (she‚Äôs 9 years older than me) and she said age doesn‚Äôt matter as long as he‚Äôs 40+. So I took that as a green light and I asked her out. At first she gave me the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm flattered‚Äù and ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù but a few minutes later she told me she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship. Ever‚Äù. 
Instead of moving on I made the stupid decision to ask her why she isn‚Äôt interested, and she stopped replying. 
Yesterday on her podcast she briefly talked about ‚Äúcreepy men‚Äù and her wanting to be single and child-free for the rest of her life. And obviously I felt like she was talking about me since I have kids and I asked her out... so I sent her another text saying ‚ÄúI apologise if my question was a bit personal.

7,qb0ume,1634606822,What if I'm pretty sure I don't know what I want?,"Prompted by a thread a few days ago which suggested that we be more upfront about what we want.

As a divorced mom for 20 years who dated rarely, and now for the last 7 as a ""single adult"" occasionally having first dates, I'm still not sure what I would want in a guy. I \_do\_ know that in an LTR, I want to build a life and grow a relationship. That means working through my weirdnesses and his quirks. The relationship I am in now ticks about 3 boxes that I though I had, but on paper is a hard pass on about 6 boxes, yet IRL is developing wonderfully as we work through issues and discoveries as they arise. THAT (as suggested in the other post) is more like an arranged marriage.

""Not My EX"" is a terrible, terrible metric... especially as there were naturally things about the EXes which attracted me. ""Into my hobbies"" -- this could be great, this could mean he takes over every space in my life. ""Has his own life"" -- do we get time together? It seems that I want a ton of initial attention and contact, but once I know that he is genuinely serious about developing a relationship with me, we can take a step back because I feel secure. Unfortunately, cultivating that barrage of intensity and then wanting to setting into a more livable pace seems to indicate that I have stopped liking him -- when in actuality, I like him and trust him more.

Last note: OLD never works for me. I overshare and over describe and write super long responses in my initial profile, which seemingly are never read.

Our adult children all approve, and it's been a very easy relationship for the past year. It was a casual friendship for two years while we both finished raising our youngest children. 
In the past year, it has evolved to an understanding that I stay every weekend at his home, which he shares with a 19 year old daughter. 
I really love her and she has been welcoming and kind, and she is genuinely a great person.  Her and her father are two of the kindest people I've ever known. 
Here's where I turn into a potential asshole. I'm done raising kids. Two of my kids have finished college and my youngest is working and self supporting, although she's a year younger than my boyfriend's daughter. 
His daughter assumes she is invited on every trip or outing we take. We have altered plans to wait for her to get home from work, to ""not hurt her feelings"". She has few friends and works very part time and most of her classes are online. She has recently begun giving her opinion on what ""we"" should all do instead. She never leaves me out, and he's aware it's getting weird. 
I don't really want to deal with this at all. I don't want to be patient for the process of ""weaning"" her. I told him that she seems to be very needy again, and that he's going to have to be understanding that I am going to do the things we plan by myself if I have to.  I'm not in a position where I am willing to spend my precious days off waiting for a young adult to decide if she's joining us on our outings when she gets home from work. 
We don't live together, live an hour apart, and are both available to our adult children all week long. 
If she is not explicitly invited, she will pout and then in private sob about how lonely she is. I sympathize with them both, but I also spent my entire adult life up to this point raising children. I'm considering ending things because I'm not going to decide what is right for another person and their child. He's going to be really sad. He's been very good to me, and So will I. I'm just afraid my resentment will grow if I spend even a couple more years planning around a young adult and feeling guilty for reducing her access to her father. I also worry that I'm being incredibly dumb.

17,qblq0x,1634679705,Getting feelings towards 'casual' relationship partner.,"Hello. First time posting here. 39F, soon to be 40 so maybe I qualify here? 

I was finally able to start dating after painful divorce... After being with same person for all of my life, it was very difficult to put myself in a dating scene with another person, but that's another story.. I've met 2 men around the same time, let's call them A and B. A wasn't quite the person I dreamed of being with.. very outgoing, loud-spoken, little goofy and little rude (he'll speak whatever that's in his mind). B is little more in line with what I thought was an ideal person.. more attractive appearance, articulate, polite/kind, etc.

When we first started dating, A made it clear that he wanted a 'casual' relationship. I asked what that means and he said we may date another person while seeing each other. He didn't want a committed relationship. With B, he was looking for more serious, long term relationship. They don't know about each other, and if I wanted to get more serious with B, I was going to stop seeing A. A lives closer to me than B, so naturally I got to meet A more.. But things were going ok with B as well.

Few weeks ago I moved to a new place. They both knew I was going to move. A asked me if I needed help but B never asked anything. I was using a mover so I told A I didn't need help. But he wanted to help anyway.. He came over and he helped A LOT. From cleaning the old apt to filling holes on the wall with putty.. to position furnitures at new place. It would have been very difficult by myself. Last week, he helped me assemble some stuff I bought from Ikea. After seeing him help me so much, now I'm getting emotionally drawn to him. B never asked to help. Also I found A to be more responsive with texts and messages.

I am not sure if I should tell A my feelings towards him. Or should I let go and continue with our current relationship and see what happens with B. Another thing to consider is that A is great in bed and after this emotional connection towards him, things got better.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qblq0x/getting_feelings_towards_casual_relationship/

25,qbpfj3,1634691732,Dating is Hard - But Only Sometimes. An Update...,"I so appreciate all of you so much. We could use some more positivity in this sub, I think... And I love a good update, &lt;insert popcorn emoji here&gt; so here's mine. (See previous installment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oo5z8c/even_good_dating_is_hard_i_need_a_hug/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if you're so inclined)

tldr; Met a guy, who was so great but going through a divorce. He processed on me too much, so I broke up with him.  It sucked and then I cried (and posted).

SO...like a week after breaking up with Surfer Boy, and us both trying not to text each other but still doing it...  I finally just facetimed him (he lives 1.5 hrs away) and laid it all out. He listened to me ramble about all my worries and a fair amount of the things you guys brought up actually.  Then he goes, "".... can I tell you my interpretation now?""

He said he was not surprised I broke up with him because he processed on me too much. Actually, he was expecting it bc ""something had to give"" he said. ""Obviously we like each other a lot, what if we try just practicing better boundaries?"" We've always had these, from the very beginning, but they are relatively new-ish to both of us.  So we came up with a sort of processing / talking safe word. We started with ""I need to tap out"" as a way to say hey, I need a subject change, I can't hear what you're talking about anymore. It works great I think bc there's a balance. Sometimes I don't mind processing with him. Often, actually. But sometimes I'm just done hearing about her - or whatever.  So I tap out and he texts one of his lovely, supportive friends instead. Its SO GREAT.  We practice, we're not perfect, we talk about it and whatever other things come up that we need to as well. 

(Side note: It's morphed into ""uhh ok NEXT SONG"", which just makes me giggle. This is a nod to Tenacious D and ""One Note Song"" on their self titled album.  On our second date we ended up cuddling on the couch, that album came on and we both sang ""Fuck Her Gently"" in unison laughing our asses off the whole time, in part because we both knew all the lyrics. Adorable rom-com magic moment ensued... now we use it as a loving communication of boundaries. Neat.)

SO! Mostly the update is, we're back together, its still hard but also SO. FUCKING. AWESOME. He's stopped saying he's a bachelor, and now says things like ""my girlfriend"" and ""wow I got so fucking lucky, even though the timing was weird.""  He bought me a wetsuit as an early birthday present, and is teaching me how to surf. We have friends over for dinners, I met his men's - and intermural - softball team (yes he's on two lol).   Have I mentioned he's a hyper active husky surfer ball of energy?  We've gone to sports ball games as he's big on sports ball.  I'm not as much, but I love me a good day in the sun with beer, garlic fries, and yelling.  He's met my mom, sister and step dad - and LOVES them lol. Shit's aDORable.  

Meanwhile, my parents are taking bets on how long it will be until I move to his town. smh. 'Rents I tell you.

We far as the serious stuff, we're trying to take it slow and enjoy each other. We don't have any plans to move in together any time soon. He's still a bit of a mess. Honestly, I am too, for things in my own life.  He jokes ""you met me at a very interesting time in my life, Marla.""  lol I mean... Same.  He has to sell his condo, is a mess about it, is still in the middle (hopefully towards the end? Who knows) of his divorce. He also lost his job, which is stressful af. He's financially fine for a while, fortunately.  Is actively looking for a place and a new job. So I just... live my life, work on my own things, give him lots of hugs and the amount of support I can give without over doing it. We see each other about every weekend, switching off who goes where. One day at a time, but its.... a relationship. And its ours. And so far, its just so damn good.  I may be dating his potential, but it honestly?  It feels like potential that has an expiry date. Unknown maybe, but still HAS ONE. 

I hope that's enough real but also positive. Like I said, its not perfect. I try really hard to not stick too many expectations on it. Fantasies? Sure. Hopes and desires? Of course. But if it all actually falls to shit tomorrow, I say what I've continued to say: I've been through the fire a few times now, and I'm still not burned. So fuck it. Life is for living.

So after all the meaningless chats on OLD platforms, seems like on dating sites, people are only looking for pen pals, and most of em doesn't even know how to carry a conversation. 
 I matched with one particular younger women then me.13yrs difference. 45/32. At first I was off with the age for I never dated younger. But this is online and most likely,  she will fall under the category of pen pals or scam . Why not ..
We texted for a bit. Off n on. Found out she has a crazy working schedule.  Ok, I can dig it. It's life. We exchanged #s. She called me the next morning while she was on route to work.  Thought holy shit.. an actual call??!?! Things can be looking up. We talked about us... likes, future, what we wanted...
But after this first call, she keeps calling which I'm thrilled.  ( I'm I her thoughts!!!) 
But she only talks to me complaining about her job and certain employees. Once again,  maybe she has no one to Talk To.  I can be that guy.  That's what relationships are for.  But then our phone calls are mostly when she working, and I'm constantly just listening to her talk to her employees,  then back to me for a sec then back to her job. Thought it was weird just to call me just to have me basically on hold? 
I feel like I'm the only one expressing myself.. asked her to see her she said yes then last minute she said she was still stuck at work. Which that night she calls me while still working.  So ok not lying.
Just actually stuck If she just wants me to vent and saying whatever to keep my ears. Or if she is genuinely interested with the hectic schedule. 
My main thing is she says she is interested in me in the long run...  but  words are just words.

I'm a 40-something formerly single mom with two teen daughters and I'm in the process of taking a certification course to become a transformational life coach. This type of coach is a trained professional who helps guide people into their ideal life and most authentic self, particularly when navigating moments of change. I'm especially interested in helping people navigate the choppy waters of dating as I was successful at my attempt and learned a lot throughout the process üôÇ

Coaching isn't offering advice, it's partnering to help you make progress in your life, helping you breakthrough to realize your own inner potentials. It would be a weekly discussion first to get to know each other and then to work on some goals you may have around dating.

I'm offering to talk with you, for free, for as long as we need to reach a goal that you might have (or need to discover you have). If we develop the connection I would only ask that you be a reference for future opportunities. I sincerely want to help others and strongly believe in my capacity to do so. I can speak with you on the phone, via video chat or in person if you are in the vicinity of Brampton Ontario Canada.

If you are interested in helping me out, please send me a DM/PM and we'll figure out a time to discuss more and if it would be something right for us üôÇ",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qc4p7j/free_dating_coaching_help_me_and_help_you/

Anyway I thought it gone be right move if I pretended that I asked her this way I can figure out if he really like her , so I did it I told him that I asked her and she said no bc she have crush on someone else. Forget to mention he asked for her Instagram and Snapchat before I told him that she doesn‚Äôt want have 3some with us . So he start talking with her and she called me in the same exact min telling me that he start texting her. 4 months later she texted me : she said I should be honest with her and if I want smth from her to tell her in the face not to tell someone else. 
I was shocked I didn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about so I asked her and she said that my bf was talking with her for the last 5 months asking her for 3some with us and telling her that I‚Äôm shy to ask her . 
At this point I was a bit mad , I was about to talk with him when she said no stop let me talk with him first and she told him that she agreed about the 3some shit . they start talking and she asked him wdu like about me he said I‚Äôm wondering how your butt looks like?!!! That‚Äôs what she told me so I got so mad I start talking with him and he was acting like he doesn‚Äôt know shit and he just ask her once 5monthes ago and she agreed today he called me dramatic and he texted her : i see you‚Äôre starting the drama . 
2 days after everything was okay we opened a new page he didn‚Äôt admit anything but I thought that everyone deserve second chance. Everything was perfect until I met her yesterday and she told me that he texted her agin : are you mad at my gf? And after that he told her : I want tell  smth when i see you next time.

I was mad and I asked him to stop talking to her bc it‚Äôs so weird. His reaction was wtf ? What are you talking about.(I ignored him)
And after 2h he replied to an old text it was 3days ago .
I was so mad so I told him that we should talk. We start talking and he told me that my friend is jealous and she just want ruin our relationship and I should choose him or her. And he be like you choose her even thought I‚Äôm the one who care about you and she‚Äôs the one who make fun of you and she always control you she even tell you how to dress and wt to eat .

66,qcymfp,1634842229,Realistic Expectations in our 40s and the age of COVID,"I'm 49M, divorced twice (married 10 years and 8 years), been with my 44F GF for almost 6 years. We don't live together, her ex husband and father of her 2 kids passed away a decade ago. Her mom passed about the same time so she has little family support. I have have one daughter who's 12. We live about 45 minutes apart and work stressful professional jobs (but I have way more flexibility on when and where I am) so don't see each other a lot but she's also really bad at planning and putting forth effort to get together and has high anxiety (she'll avoid taking action on something) so we don't see each other very often anymore. Pre-COVID we saw each other 2-3x a week and we've traveled extensively together domestically/internationally but not been anywhere together in more than 2 years or actually even spent the night together in that time - her youngest is young enough that she needs a babysitter and COVID has been a challenge here. We have a 3 day road trip planned next month that I'm already anticipating will get cancelled by her because she didn't make arrangements in advance and she also just accepted a new role within her company.

If we didn't have to work/pay bills and could spend our time how we like it, she would be my person (I adore everything about her) but in our current situation the relationship brings me down. I've talked to her about it and she said its not personal. It's not as if she's out with friends or other people often and is shunning me specifically. We both agreed early on that we'd never get married/live together and subject our children to step-parents. When the kids move away we've talked about sharing a place but that's 8-10 years away probably.

I kind of feel like we're nearing the end of our relationship because I feel like a hassle to her - being the one to initiate seeing each other kind of breaks my heart a little and its one more thing she has to manage in her life. Also getting together about once a month makes me sadder than being alone. I think I've leaned into her more since the pandemic and she's just doing what she can to keep her head above water with her work, kids, life. She's talked about getting therapy but hasn't pulled the trigger except for her youngest who has some behavioral issues. 

**Am I being unrealistic in my expectations? Anyone else feel like with all the responsibilities in our 40s that this is as good as it gets and I should be happy with what I have?** I don't want to break off a great connection because I am pining for the good old days that have yet to return. 

Any advice/thoughts are appreciated. Note: I posted here because I think there are unique circumstances specifically to being in our 40s that u/Relationships and u/Relationshipadvice don't really take into consideration. 

Also, I really don't want to even think about going back out into the dating world at my age and I think I would have a hard time meeting someone that I vibe with like I do with her.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qcymfp/realistic_expectations_in_our_40s_and_the_age_of/

68,qd1lvo,1634850868,Need a Reality Check,"This isn't specific to being over 40, but this is my dating cohort, so I'm posting here...

Not that long ago, I met someone through a mutual friend who lives rather far away. We were all traveling at the time and met on that trip. I live in Vermont and she lives in North Carolina, so it's a plane ride to get to each other. 

We sort of hit it off when we met and we exchanged numbers. Lots of texting ensued and she asked if I would have any interest in coming down to see her. I said that I definitely would. I am not overflowing with money to burn, but I do OK and can afford to travel if there is value added to the experience. Based on our conversations, we had a lot in common and were really getting along well so I definitely felt like this was worth it even though it was difficult to find the time to get away from work but I made the time to go down for two days. 

So, I bought the ticket, got the hotel, rental car, etc. and went down to see her. The first day, everything went great. We got along really well, had a wonderful day together, and went back to our respective sleeping arrangements. She had some things to do with her family the next morning, but we had plans to meet up in the afternoon. We went on a hike, took a long scenic drive, everything was still great. We went to dinner together and right in the middle of our first drink she got a text from someone she used to work with. (I know this wasn't made up as any excuse to leave as she wasn't hiding her phone and I could see that the conversation was actually happening.) 

She very abruptly said she needed to go pick this person up at the airport and needed to leave. I asked why and she said that the person who was supposed to pick up her former coworker had been drinking and couldn't drive to get them anymore. I asked why this person couldn't get a cab or an Uber/Lyft and she said that there was a shortage of them and there was often a long wait. So, she said she had to go to pick up this person.

At this point, I was visibly disappointed and she got very angry with me. While I will communicate my feelings, I don't really like outright confrontation and I tend to shut down a little when someone gets angry with me. I asked her to drive me back to my hotel. I told her that if she had gone through the effort to come fly to see me and we only had two days together that the only thing that would get me to cut our dinner together short would be either if my kids needed me (she also has kids and I would have had zero issue if it was one of her kids calling) or it was an absolute emergency. I didn't consider a friend needing a ride from the airport when we live in the age of rental cars, cabs, and Ubers to be an emergency and I felt suddenly very undervalued. I expressed this in a calm but disappointed tone. She again got very angry and went on a rant about, ""what did you expect? Did you come down here expecting I'd just jump in bed with you?"" I replied that my disappointment had nothing to do with sex, that I didn't need to fly to NC to find someone to have sex with, and that I had zero expectations or assumptions about where the night was heading and didn't assume in any way that we would be having sex and that I was completely fine with us not (which was all 100 percent true; I had completely assumed we would *not* be having sext that night). I said that the only thing I expected from her that night was her time and attention and I was really disappointed to not be able to continue to spend the time we had expected together to continue to get to know her. 

I won't get into the details of her behavior after this as my point in this isn't to criticize this anonymous woman but to get some sense of a reality check from others out there. How would you have responded in a similar situation? Was I being overly demanding?

I've met his parents and regularly spend time with his adult boys. But he doesn't want me to go to his cousins wedding because ""a wedding date means more"". Then he didn't like my response after...

Me: I see. It's your choice to make, whether I'm good enough. Guess I failed. Idk why it's different, but ok

Him: It's not about ""good enough"" or ""failed"". To me, a wedding date means a high probability of getting married.  You're introducing that person as part of your family. I just think it's a bit soon. Honestly the reaction bothers me a bit.

Me: What about me saying I see and okay is bothersome?

Him: If you can't see why that's concerning, I don't know what to say

Me: It's a family event that you don't want me at which means I have failed at something. That's concerning to me, yes.

 Two months ago I met a man and it's been going great. We've been doing a lot of stuff together and seems like we fancy each other a lot. Please tell me, what are the common sense rules of introducing the new person in your life to your kids. Like I said, it's been two months, seems like  a bit too early yet, or maybe not?? The thing is, my ex husband introduced his new gf to our son first thing after the divorce and son's not been too excited about it. However, in my case he seems to be curious about my bf but I feel like I should take it slow. Or am I thinking wrong?

I needed legal advice from my older brothers lawyer friend and well our conversation evolved into a first date on his birthday.

We had a lot in common, but having not been sexual with anyone for 10 years I Really wanted to take it slow. Date number 2 was a casino night followed by him begging me to stay at a room in the casino after my 5th no he said ok I respect that...as if no #1,2,3,4 didn't count. It was frustrating. Date #3 came around and I finally relented and slept with him. Did I feel obligated...yes I did. Was it consensual yes, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. Then next day he calls to say he had the worst nightmare that I was pregnant. I laughed and then said wow I'm already your worst nightmare. It a rubbed me the wrong way like wow if your so worried wear a rubber orrrrr don't push sex on someone so hard. Anyways I canceled the 4th date and let him know I just wasn't interested. He went on a tangent about how he was going to stop being my brothers friend, and how I was a mean person. I regret having sex with someone I was only mildly attracted too but most of all I feel like I was not going to sleep with him but he was so fucken persistent.

I have four kids and she is coming over to my house tonight with her son. I‚Äôd rather break up with her at her house but I feel like I need to end things sooner rather than later.
