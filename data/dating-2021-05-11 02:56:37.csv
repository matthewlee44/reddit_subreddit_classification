I met this girl 2 months ago at a friend's house and I really liked her and the next day my friend went to her house with some other friends and he told me that she was talking about me constantly to her friends and that she realy wanted to hangout again together. Let me tell you here that I was joining the army in 1 week and I would be on and of my city for the next couple of months so the next time we hangout there was realy good vibes between us and a little bit of flirting and a lot of signs tha she likes me but nothing happened. After that I joined the army and after 2 weeks I sent her  a dm and we started talking fore the next month. The thing is that I wasn't the only one texting first she was sometimes and she wanted to keep the conversation going .i kept it kinda friendly but sometimes we were sending  heart emojis and kisses etc. and I   I was very confused to if she liked me or not . SoI learned that in 1 week I was going home for 10 days and I asked her out but she answered like she meant to hangout with my other friend to and I understood that and I asked my friend to talk with her and she said that she didn't want to go out with me bacause it would be awkward and she told him to lie that she likes someone else that she is talking to which isn't true what is going on can someone explain",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9s35n/i_need_advice_and_help/
1,n9s990,1620721966,Breaking Up is Like the Death of a Loved One,"I was dating a girl for about 6 weeks. She was kinda all over the place. Kept saying I was not godly enough to be her husband. She just would never believe I was a Christian or that she thought she was a better Christian than me. She broke it off a good 5 or 6 times then would come apologizing later that day or the next day and we'd be back to normal (mostly normal).   


Anyhow, now she won't talk to me at all. I gave up trying to get in touch with her. But, it occurred to me when someone breaks things off then disappears from your life, blocks your access to even call them, it's like they died. It's sort of like dealing with the death of a loved one, no? I feel sorta the same way I did when my mom died. That person might as well be dead to you since you have no way to talk to them, it's all gone, etc. Just snatched out of your hand suddenly like death often happens.   


Anyone else feel this way sometimes about a really epic love that goes south then the person kinda disappears? Feels like a death in a big way to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9s990/breaking_up_is_like_the_death_of_a_loved_one/
2,n9scny,1620722387,Mistakenly Seeking Solitude IRL?,"Have you heard about the study from Epley and Schroeder?  
In a nutshell, we all tend to think we are going to bother strangers if we approach them, and they will bother us if they do, for whatever conversation. But we could not be more wrong! It has been proven over and over. And it is equally wrong for introverts and extroverts. (getting that excuse out of the way)  
In fact ""weak ties"", so meeting a stranger, can be as a strong positive during your day as an interaction with a ""strong tie"" (best friend, close family member).

So if you're thinking about your dating life through apps and screens, have you considered talking to strangers, even just to make conversation? If not, what's your excuse?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9scny/mistakenly_seeking_solitude_irl/

4,n9t2ca,1620725400,Do women lie about dick size? I saw a recent post on female dating strategy and it breaks my heart,"I'm young, inexperienced, and very insecure about my dick size, but after I made a few posts and some women responded I sort of got better. To be honest I continued to look at different places to get different opinions and I stumbled upon a female dating strategy. That place is like hell, women there seem so jaded and I can get why. The thing is they seem honest and don't really care about other's opinions. There was a really recent post about big dicks and makes me feel worthless, all of the women there confirmed my suspicion. All of them praised big dicks, talked about how inadequate even average dick's are and how good 8 and 9 inches are and I'm sitting here with my 6.2 in length and 3.7 in girth thin penis. Honestly, everything said to me so far seems like a feel better lie. If only 3-4 inches of the vagina have nerve endings why are big dicks preferable. Why does r/ smalldickproblems exist and why is it so miserable there? I've been hearing about body positivity for a while now, but there is nothing positive about a small dick. It is inferior to a big dick in every way, making you an inferior, lesser male. The only reason women would date a guy with a small dicks seems to be either money or she doesn't have other options for some reason. All women are size queens off the internet. And yes you can compensate, but so can the big guy. You literally can't compete. I can work out, but my dick will never grow. Im thinking about surgery at this point, it won't be big, but it will be average at least. Honestly, women that prefer small or average dicks seems like some mythical creature at this point. If you can pick big, you take big. I'd rather be alone than having my partner lust after some big guy behind my back. Don't get me wrong I'm not blaming women for not wanting a small dick, I understand it doesn't feel good or satisfying. I just wanted to vent and I don't really have someone to talk to.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9t2ca/do_women_lie_about_dick_size_i_saw_a_recent_post/

12,n9tnw6,1620727990,"3 years of going solid, and undoing a bad idea","I met this girl in 2018, and we were just casually hanging out. Things started moving, but it took her some time to reciprocate (she had recently ended a very bad relationship).

I always felt like I was the one taking initiative and I had to make a lot of effort to be around her and I did it because I can be a little 'intense'.

She finally started reciprocating and I felt we were in a good place, regardless of the drama of our own lives. I had wanted to leave my country (India lmaoo) to study in Berlin, and I never thought that the relationship would sustain, I was confused. This was my first real relationship (at 23).

So I went and I thought that we could try an open relationship. I felt I was going to explore other people and she could too. But I have a lot of baggage with this girl. And she found someone else. I couldn't cope. I got hooked to weed and I had anxiety all day for about two months. It got pretty bad. I left Berlin and went back home. Pretty close to where she lives.

We met two weeks ago and we both decided to try things out again. Her rebound was too insecure of me. We have been happily living together since then, until two days ago when she started talking to the other guy and now she wants to go back to him. She's still living at my home, and with the pandemic in India, everything feels unsafe.

I'm feeling much better about my anxiety but in the middle of classes and adulting and finding a job, everything seems like a lot. Which is why I thought I'd share here.

I still have a lot of hope for a future together. Our lives are very closely tied together. We both have family in the same city. We've been very close all through the relationship. We had both thought about marriage for a while. And she doesn't even have big plans with this guy.

16,n9v9zm,1620734079,Staying dating a guy who is about to have heart surgery and lives 5 hours away,"Ive posted here about this story before I think or somewhere. Trying to make this short:

I 22f met guy (j) on tinder 27m almost 2 months ago now. Hit it off well, met 3x first week, after that he had news he needed heart surgery in the next month, so moved home 5 hr drive away to spend time with family and he will recover afterwards there. Our connection was strong enough we had a talk i expressed worry about carrying on dating, he said to me 'dont worry we will be fine'

From that point until now: I managed to visit him at week 3, he told his mum about me and she kindly let me stay over 2 nights. It went really well, he showed me around town, he lives in a small town by the beach, we walked past a few people he knew and he would introduce me and wouldn’t be afraid of affection infront of these people. I even met his little nephews who introduced themselves very sweet as they woke us up from our nap 🥺. Sat in the lounge with his mum and stepdad and all had a laugh and chat, and as i said bye they said they hope to see me again, they were pretty awesome people

He has also told his friends about me, his dad who I didn’t meet yet and shown his dad me playing guitar as they’re both rock fans, and said yesterday ‘the guy we bumped into at the pub said to my mum J’s girlfriend is really pretty’, it made me happy and emotional as ive realised how proud he sounds to have me, which my ex was never like this as he even hid me from parents.

We have said we are exclusive, so all of these things pretty much indicate we’re heading in a good direction, i mean especially the girlfriend comment?. When I show him things like travelling, he says let’s do it, and now we have made a ‘post operation to do list’. Despite the situation and distance he’s been pretty great with everything, communication, even talking about serious stuff, and his positive attitude towards the surgery idk how he does it!. tbh i have no doubt in this guy considering the situation and distance, ive had more trouble with guys who are just around the corner. i see the positives of this situation more than anything

But man the only tough bit is not being able to be there for him properly during recovery. I plan to visit him after surgery, stay for a couple of days, im able to message his mum and ask to stay over as i think its polite and also we have eachother on socials hahaha thats pretty good right? i plan on keeping him company and helping him a bit with recovery. im about to graduate and have a summer off with a part time job for now as i want to enjoy my last 'summer vacation' before going full time, so i reckon i will do a couple of trips to him over summer.

i guess im venting as today has hit me how tough it is going to be, his op is next week and he does say the sooner the op the sooner the recovery! even though he has expressed he doesnt want me to feel like im waiting for him since he's 'ill', i actually know id regret not even giving this a shot as our feelings towards eachother seem to be growing a lot. it's just also tough as its at a weird stage of dating but i think with surgery it's given him the 'life is too short' attitude and thats why things have panned out this way even though some may think it is fast, to me it isnt and does genuinely feel right. i haven't told him yet as i think it's sort of selfish as hes the one going through it, but i think ill just express in a way thats just saying 'i miss you' type of thing, not to make him feel bad of course. Typing this out makes me realise that he's pretty much worth waiting around for, so i hope the operation goes well!

anyone ever been in this situation, or even been through it in a relationship ? any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9v9zm/staying_dating_a_guy_who_is_about_to_have_heart/
17,n9vcnz,1620734349,So I Need Some Advice And Some Answers,"I'm going to try relate this as a story.  
If it's boring, I'm sorry.  
There was a girl I went out with when I was 18.   
She was the first girl I kissed and it meant something.   
Before her, every time I got physical it was a chore.   
Like when all your friends tell you pot's awesome   
and you try it but pot's like ""okay, whatever.""  
Then, we lost touch.   
We ended whatever we had because our schedules were not compatible.  


Eight years are gone.   
She's moved out of DXB.   
I've been through a five year relationship.  
But two weeks ago, I notice she's back in town.   
I strike up a conversation on facebook.  
We agree to meet.   
I'm 26 now, and she's 26.   
I'm not the same boy.  
I have less hair and ten kilos.   
She's lost her slenderness and become more irresistible.  


I pull out all the stops.   
I get new trousers. And a new shirt.  
I get a nice expensive haircut.   
I borrow my friend's unaffordable perfume.   
I've been loyal to the gym.   


We go out and it's a disaster.   
She hates my driving.   
She's put off by my needing google for navigation.  
She's put off that I can't reverse park.  
We sit down and she's critical of the restaurant I booked.   
Not of the place but of the service.  


She tells me she's divorced.  
She tells me she's got a two year old.  
And I'm so attracted, it doesn't matter.  
She's chain smoking on her vape.  
I quit over a year ago.  
She's talking to me in a way I know the self involved talk.  
And I don't care. I want to try and be a good listener.   


She tells me she's had too much in her life.  
Now she just wants to be on her own.   
I'm a little crushed.   
I did hope   
that the kiss we shared   
was something special.  


We drive back to her place.   
Well, she drives. She asks me if she can drive my car.  
Because she didn't want to sit through how poorly I'd drive her.  
Before we say goodbye she tells me,   
""I truly believe the universe listens.   
I believe that the thoughts you have before you go to bed,   
the universe listens to them.""  
We say good night and we hug.   
It's covid. I'm not used to hugging people.   
So I've mistakenly stepped on her toe.   


What should I do?  
Hope the universe listens to my desire for her,   
When I'm lying in bed thinking,   
about what it would be like to take care of her.

19,n9vncf,1620735335,Am I a creep for doing this?,"SO basically, I matched a girl on tinder and she gave me her snapchat so that we could talk on there We had been sending daily messages and sometimes snaps (photos of our faces) to each other for almost 4 weeks. In all honesty it seemed like she was pretty keen, she kept keeping the convo going and when I didnt reply to a message she followed up with a question mark - trying to get me to reply. 

I thought things were going well, nothing serious of course as we hadnt met up but we had agreed to meet at some point when Covid restrictions were reduced. Then the other morning I go onto my snap and I see that she has unfriended me... I was confused... I messaged her on instagram asking why she unfriended me and she didnt reply and blocked me.

At this point I was so confused and also quite angry... I messaged her on my 2nd insta account saying "" I dont care if you dont want to speak to me again, but can you at least give me a reason why""? I know we werent dating but I think its pretty standard behaviour to message someone telling them they dont want to talk anymore, instead of just blocking them on everything? To people not understand the effect that can have on someone? 

She responded to me on my second account saying that I am being a creep and a weirdo because I messaged her on a 2nd account. In my opinion she is the weird one for messaging me constantly on snap for 4 weeks, agreeing to meet and then blocking me without reason.

A day later now and I just feel ashamed of myself. I wish I didnt message her, but at the time I was angry/upset and just wanted a reason/explanation. I also realise that 4 weeks isnt a long time to be speaking and that she owes me nothing, but was it really unreasonable for me to try and get an explanation?

2-3 years ago we started working together. We had a lot in common and seemed to be interested in each other in some way, shape or form. She had been going between the US and Argentina and ended up moving back to Argentina a couple months after we met. Flash forward to last summer, I snap chatted her out of nowhere to find out she’s back in the US and is staying for some time. So we began hanging out and she over at her house a couple times and I met her parents and siblings and everything seemed great. Until, she told me she’d been sexually assaulted after she went home to Argentina and was still recovering from the whole thing. So when I asked her to be my girlfriend she agreed but then said she’d been getting assault PTSD and wanted 2-3 weeks to clear her head from everything. I was confused but went with it, until fast forward she claimed to be too stressed out to do anything between the ptsd, her mom possibly getting deported and school. Said she was having panic attacks and all kinds of illness. 

Now she wants to hang out again despite not seeing each other since January and I get this feeling she’s leading me on but also don’t know if she’s being genuine about everything and I’m up in my head.

24,n9w32q,1620736813,I (29m) confessed my feelings to a friend (24f),"Some backstory:

I got to know her through a not-so-close friend of mine, she was his girlfriend at the time. Since August 2020 we meet regularly and get along really well.
Earlier this year, they broke up and I was one of the first people she told. Our conversations got even deeper and personal after that and we also started cuddling a little bit. However, she occasionally brought up the fact that she still missed her ex-bf to some degree, but that it would be very unlikely for them to come back together. One time, after admitting that we find each other attractive, I tried to initiate a kiss and she refused it, telling me she wasn't ready yet.

Well, yesterday I called her and told her that I developed feelings for her. Her reaction was actually quite good. She was really impressed by the way I told her and it meant a lot to her, but she had to think about all this.
Later that day we chatted and she told me that it would not be possible for her to have a relationship at the moment.

Now, I don't really know what to do next.
How long will she let me wait?
Should we meet regularly like we did before?
I think I won't be able to break all contact with her, because this girl is really exceptional to me.

32,n9wjsz,1620738275,Is it too late to apologize?,"Ok I'm being very vulnerable here and it's hard to admit but I used to be a very very toxic person. I broke up with my ex boyfriend of 5+ months in Jan 2020 over text with no explanation or warning and literally just ended things right there (among many other things I did that weren't his fault but I blamed him). We said at the end that one day we could talk again, but right now just wasn't the right time. After that, I kind of went off the rocker and messed up a bunch of other things in my life. I started going to therapy and I'm really proud of the progress I've made and I'm now able to realize I was literally a terrible girlfriend and so so toxic to him and other people in my life. I've been thinking about him a lot lately and find myself crying up to 10 times a day thinking about how dirty I did him and how I ruined a relationship with a boy who really did care for me.

I know it's been so long since then but I really want to apologize to him. Not to get back together and not to clear my conscience, but I owe him an apology and I have for a very long time. I don't care if he accepts it or not, or if he even responds, but I guess I'm wondering...if you were him and I were to apologize to you, how would you feel? Is it pointless since it's been so long? I still really care about him and it breaks my heart that he loved me and I hurt him so badly. I go to therapy tomorrow so I will talk with my therapist about this but I'm coming to terms with the fact I am a toxic person in many of my relationships, especially this one. I would obviously love if he did still feel the same and we tried to work something out, but I also know its been so long and I really hurt him and he might just be over it honestly. Idk I'd love some advice on this.

Also, back when we were dating I told him to park his car in my apartment parking lot and said it would be fine and not get towed, well it got towed and I didn't have the money to pay for it, so he had to pay $200 to get his car back when I told him it would be ok. I promised I'd pay him back and I never did. Well now I have the money and I'd love to give him a check for $200 and just say: if you want to keep it please do but if you want to rip it up that's fine too.

Although the title sounds douchy and controlling it's not. I met this girl a couple of months ago, and we have been hanging out every weekend for the past couple of months. We met on a dating app and hit it off immediately. 2 weeks after meeting her and hanging out I told her that we should be friends as I was in a bad point in my life, great grandmother passed, school was depressing, other things, and I didn't want to jump in something, a relationship with her, until I knew I could commit the time, energy, and love. She understood this and was ok with it and I took her out for lunch afterwards as sort of an I'm sorry. 

We've been hanging out(no sex) ever since and I still have feelings for her, in fact they've grown even more as we been hanging out as friends. Over the weekend we both got really really drunk after doing homework and as we were about to go to sleep we made out a couple of times(she made the move every time). I wanted to tell her how much I like her and how much I want to be with her. 

She stopped herself, ""I can't, I'm sorry, you said let's be friends"". Something along those lines. She then went on saying that ""you said you wanted to be friends so I got back into dating apps and have a date coming up this Friday(the 14th)"". And I kind of apologized and said ""go ahead on your date it's whatever, I said let's be friends and I chose that decision"". I was drunk and my head was not there. The next morning I left her place and later in the day, Sunday, I sent a long text saying I've had feelings for her and stuff that built up over the last month for her and really like her and apologized for kissing her. 

I do want to be with her. I'm at a better place mentally right now and last week, wanted to tell her that I want to date her, but forgot to tbh as we got more and more drunk. Now her date is coming up this Friday. I'm pretty sure she still has some feelings for me. Every time we've hung out as ""friends"" we always cuddled and slept in the same bed. How do I backtrack and tell her I want to be with her. I'm not sure if I can see her in person before her date but I want to get it out there to her and see what she says.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9wsvo/get_back_girl_i_friend_zoned/

40,n9xwo0,1620742312,Break Ups (M19),"I knew this girl, let's say Grace as a name this case, since freshman year of high school. We knew each other and we're friends but I wouldn't say as close as me and some other male friends. I got close to her during covid due to discord and games. I was dumped by an ex last year around March. I talked to Grace about me getting dumped and other relationship things. I remember talking to her about my rebound but I didn't put an effort to try to be with my rebound because I was sure it was a rebound. She talked to me about a potential rebound too. In the end, we were close friends. I started feeling comfortable around her and I wanted to see if she was willing to take a step forward and date. She agreed and wanted to try something serious. 

The relationship lasted barely under 3 months. It is during the time of covid and we have classes. She is usually busy with classes and homework so I didn't know what to do. During the free time other than Thursdays, because she doesn't have classes on Thursday, we play games together. The only time we can hang out are on Thursdays. She said things got boring over time. I agree things did get boring but I didn't end up loving her less. She didn't want to have sex because of past trauma. I was fine with that. She told me her past traumas that she never told her previous 2 ex's. We cuddled on Thursdays in bed or watch Netflix on the sofa while cuddling. I see her stressed about school and life, so I want to make it relaxing for her. I was planning to get my driver's license before covid but due to covid I wasn't able to. Now I am trying to get my license so I can take her to interesting places. 

In the end, she said that she still loves me and cares about me but was not infatuated with me. I feel like these are lies that girls say to give comfort when they break up with someone. My previous ex said the same thing and just dubbed me and completely cut me out of her life. It's hard for me to move on. She still wants to be friends. She gave me the option to be friends still or if I want her completely out of me life. I chose to be friends still because I don't want her to be alone because I know her past traumas and everything. I want her to still be in my friend group so she still can have people to talk and play with. I'm happy that she was happy during the relationship because she wrote me documents about how I make her happy about things unlike her previous ex's that often treat her poorly. But I just feel sad about this whole thing ending. She said the relationship got boring and she already friend zoned me in her head since we were friends for so long. For me, I want to be friends with a girl before dating her. I want to get to know them well enough to see if I want to date them or not. She said that if we both regret breaking up, we can always get back together but I don't believe in that. Now I don't have the girl I love but I have to carry the burden of knowing her past traumas and continue to worry about her. 

I'm sorry for the vent everyone who is seeing this. I know that it is dumb that a lot of my happiness depends on being in a relationship and how I continue to worry for her. I wish I wasn't like this and be able to move on easier or be able to make the relationship more interesting or anything for her to stay.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9xwo0/break_ups_m19/

To be honest, I’m not sure I really want to date at all right now. I’m really just curious where all of this attention would come from.

31 female seeking for a relationship 🥺❤️

I'm so bored I could cry.

I just want to meet someone. I'm so sick of the dating scene, especially with this pandemic.

I'm a straight F(31), and not a bad looking gal. I stay in shape, dress well and mind myself, I get plenty of compliments and attention from the opposite sex. I've been single for 1.5 years but dating has been a nightmare for me this past year. 

Every time it's the same thing. We match on a dating app, chat for a bit, guy talks about how pretty he thinks I am, and how much he likes my personality etc etc. We date for a bit, sometimes friends are introduced and just when I think it's going great, boom the dude falls off the face of the earth. I have no faith left. 

I want to point out that I'm not upset by the rejection, that's a part of life. It's the sudden disappearance/ghosting. It's so disrespectful, hurts everytime and makes me think there's just no point anymore.

I'm so bored of it. I'm not out here looking for serious, I don't aspire to marriage and don't want kids. Why is it so hard to just find a casual dating experience that doesn't end in ghosting or disrespect?

Like 10:30ish. 

He has mentioned getting together for drinks before. Then I didn’t hear from him for a long time. I said we should still get together. 

Then he started texting me a ton the next day. Like every few hours. Then he texted me kinda late asking what I was doing that night. 

I immediately took this as a booty call when I saw it this morning. I felt so bad like I had made him think I wanted a hookup buddy. 

I wanted to be honest so I sent him a thought-out text saying I hope I didn’t give mixed signals, I’d love to grab lunch and catch up, I’m not dating right now (blah blah). All of it was true. 

His response was sort of like “I don’t wanna date either, you texted me late so I thought it was normal.”

I was super self-deprecating and told him that’s why I figured I gave mixed signals and I just want to get out and socialize. 

He was nice but I think I confused him.

After 3 months I realized I wanted more but he was not showing any signs of feeling the same(taking forever to reply to texts, hanging out at his place was the only plan he would suggest). So I broke it off explaining I didnt want for things to get complicated and would rather stop seeing each other. We met up one last time and he said he did have feelings and wanted to give it a try. The first month was wonderful,  I felt a real connection and loved being with him. After some time i felt stronger for him and more comfortable, but he grew noticably colder and the plans he suggested we would never actually do. Technically we were dating exclusively but we never did anything outside the house and I always felt like he was putting up a wall when it came to communicating. I took care of his house and dog while he was away a month and was planning to talk about what I thought were fixable communication issues. I missed him a lot and was clear on how i felt and wanted to work on the relationship. When he came back he was very distant, while usually he is a very touchy and affectionate person. I brought it up after a few days as I didnt want to stress him while he was still jetlagged. He told he wasnt in love, that being with me made him excited for a time but not anymore. He said he was always very romantic with his exes, doing surprises and gestures and he just couldnt bring himself to do it for me. He also said that he has tried to feel something but there just werent butterflies,even though I fit so many “checks” he looks for in a girl. I couldnt really process it well at the moment and the things he said hurt a lot, so I broke down and left. The first time We broke it off he changed his mind later.

55,n9zvnn,1620747552,"Struggling with casual dating, help?","So long story short I've been seeing this amazing girl, we have really great sex, she's super interesting and super affectionate. Every time we see eachother its so simple, healthy, light and tender. This has been going for about a month.

But...

I've been in and out of relationships since I was 16, this is the first time Im ""single"" since and I also have this issue where Im very dependent on affection from others. SO I'm extremely reticent, taking things slow, even if Im already pretty into deep to be honest.

We havent spoken of exclusivity and I feel like that's not too much of an issue, however she wanted to know if I was sleeping around with other people (she used the medical angle, because we do not use condoms), I told her the truth (that I hadnt), she said the same and seemed SO happy with that notion.

Yesterday I spent most of thr day with tgis girl, in bed cuddling until 14h00, then taking a bath together, cooking and having lunch. After that she went to have dinner with her sisters and I met my lads.  

Long story short I ended up at this party and a few of the girls there were hitting on me, one of them way more obviously than the others. 

I wasnt looking for anything to happen since my needs of affection (specially physical affection) were already met. 

On the other hand hooking up with someone else may have helped build a certain distance in my mind, from me and this girl, and prevent me from getting too emotionally invested and fucking up this process of learning how to do things in a healthier way.

So I ended up making put with her, Im 100% sure that she expected sex but I left before that. She seemed kind of pissed, insisted in me taking her phone number,which I did.

Now Im aware that technically I did nothing wrong but I feel guilty. I do not know how to proceed, should I call this other girl and have sex with her? Should I talk to the girl that Im having such an amazing time with and tell her what happened yesterday? Should I just keep it to myself and not call the party girl? 

To be honest Im pretty lost.

57,n9zzqj,1620747864,"Being the backup plan, and why I shouldn't get frustrated","I (26M) had a date three planned as an out of town day trip with a girl (29F) that's super active and up front. Trip was her idea. On dates one and two, we just enjoyed each other's company with conversation and a creative spin on a dinner date I came up with. We got along well, though neither of us really escalated (much owing to me still not being forward, as I only recently started dating again).

Just now, a bit less than a week before the trip, got a courtesy text saying she's going on a date the night before with someone she's really compatible with. She doesn't know how it will go, but out of respect wants to let me know she might cancel on our trip at the last minute--ball's in my court if I wanna keep the now unreliable plans.

Now, I get the dating multiple people thing. I'm going on different dates myself, so don't see that as an issue. I even appreciate this level of communication.

But then there's knowing I'm the backup plan. No one likes being the backup plan. Grr.

Now, this can be for any number of reasons, no need to feel self-conscious. Maybe the timing of us meeting was not right. Maybe her date is literally Brad Pitt or the Most Interesting Man In The World. Maybe he's got strong pickup game. Point being, there are many totally unactionable reasons I'm here. More so, it's also not good to keep double standards: if life gave me lemons, I'd just the same as her try to make lemonade. That's why people date in the first place. And finally, it all may be recoverable. Realistically, we just don't know each other yet in many ways. I know I'm no second string prospect.

So, no logical reason to waste mental energy here. Going to reply saying thanks for letting me know, we should skip the trip, that she should let me know where things stand later, and that I hope the best for everyone either way.

But still. I don't like being a backup. In spite the logic, it rubs me wrong. Being a reasonable person can be frustrating at times. Grr.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9zzqj/being_the_backup_plan_and_why_i_shouldnt_get/
58,na0dmx,1620748892,Third date...,"So, I (30F) had a great first date with this guy (25M). We had tons in common, lots of synchronicities. The date lasted 4 hours - I was slightly distant emotionally because A. I’m shy, but also because B. I was feeling him out, but other than that it was great. I got home and thought more about him so I decided to take initiative and ask him on the second date. I texted “so when can I see you again? :)” and he replied with “well that depends doesn’t it! Going off our last conversation it sounds like it’s your turn to plan something” - we chatted about men and women both being responsible for planning out dates. So I joked “I guess I left out the part where I like you taking the lead ;) buuttt fair” and he replied “well I guess you should’ve said that then ;)” anyway, I arranged the date and we had a drink at a bar then the second part, I had made a playlist of songs (we have very similar taste in music) to slow dance to, in a parking lot. We also picked up a bottle of wine. 

Needless to say, the date was incredible. He told me he was surprised I asked him out because I seemed a little closed off and it was confusing cause we had a lot of chemistry and things in common. I told him I take a little time to open up and he said he feels like he got to really see ‘me’ on this date. We kissed, made out, slow danced. 
Yesterday we texted a little throughout the day but here’s the thing. 

I feel like I’m the one who is initiating the contact at this point and even though it’s only been one day since the last date, he hasn’t asked me on a third yet. Feel free to tell me I’m overthinking and being a little nuts. I’m just really into him and hoping he feels the same. Should I back off a little and let him come to me?

That felt like a blow tbh 😂, anyway I have bad aniexty so asked my mate and his girlfriend if they fancied coming out for a few drinks with me and her. To which they said aye and I informed her. She texted me on Saturday night past to say two of our other mutal friends were coming.

I’m not a nun, and it’s not super intentional that I haven’t. It just hasn’t happened yet. I have had some sexual trauma, so I guess that’s part of why I’m not eager to hop straight into bed. I’m also demisexual and need to trust and care about a partner before being interested in sex with them, which I guess is incongruous with what’s expected on most dating apps (and that’s all I’ve got while the pandemic rages on). 

The people I am interested in are older (like, mid-30s, typically) and have a lot of experience. But I have none, and I feel super self-conscious about that fact. Like, I don’t want my partner to laugh or treat me like a teenager. I have toys and know what I like, I just haven’t yet done any of those things with a living human. 

I want to be normal and able to say I’ve had at least one sexual partner, but I don’t just want to indiscriminately bang someone just for the sake of saying I did it. The older I get, the weirder it feels bc as I approach 30, I’m starting to think about marriage and kids and all that very seriously. I want to settle down. But, like, it’d be weird and maybe unhealthy if my first partner was my only partner for my entire life. 

I have no idea what I’m on about. I’m just sexually frustrated and not sure what to do.

The date went well, (in my opinion), and after that date she messaged to say that she had a great time. I said we should do it again next week and she replied “Yes!” 

Anyway fast forward to about three days ago. I saw her at work and approached her. She was flirty with me and gave me a hug and put her head on my shoulder a couple of times, but when I asked if she was free for a date on Sunday. She said, “My friend may be hosting a get together on Sunday so I might not be free but I’ll let you know!” Later on that night I texted her to say hey and we had a small 3 or 4 text conversation about our hobbies, but she read and didn’t reply to my last message. 

From my past experiences, when a girl says “I’ll let you know” or doesn’t reply to a message there’s no point in pursuing because there’s no interest there.

I’ve (22m) been dating my current Girlfriend for around 3 months now. She’s my first real relationship and everything is so new. I didn’t know how much time and energy went into this. I like her but I’m not head over heals. I kinda lost my romantic side a long time ago and from years of rejection, so I don’t necessarily have that “head over heals” feeling for her. She’s so sweet, caring, and amazing and our relationship is everything I’ve thought I wanted in a relationship, but I find myself every once and awhile wondering what it would be like to be with other women. I have a very high sex drive but hers is higher so I don’t necessarily fantasize about sex with other women, but I think about relationships with other women.

Okay, so I want to preface this by saying that I understand women get a different user experience than men on the apps and that there are lots of men who harrass you etc.


However, I can't prove I'm not one of these men if you don't even take the time to engage with me. The number of read deletes and unread deletes I get is insane. It's like shouting into the void. Their profile specifically asks me to send them a message and I do, but they don't even read the message I send before it's deleted. They don't even look at my profile.

And before anyone says that I'm not following rules 1 and 2 I really don't think that im ugly enough to warrant the response I get. I get told im attractive, that im eloquent and polite. Im successful and funny, I put effort into the women I'm interested in speaking with but it's like that effort is never matched. Women don't try ever and it's incredibly discouraging.

73,na1ptm,1620752310,Found everything I wanted...and then lost it,"Met a girl 6 months ago on a dating app. Hit it off and met in person, and had the best first date of my life. Kept seeing each other. Started off intending it to be something casual (she was moving to a new state the next summer and I was prioritizing career opportunities), but it seemed to progress into more than that - became officially bf/gf, met each others friends, were hanging 3 times a week, took a trip together, etc. Really seemed like she had strong feelings for me and cared about me a lot. I realized she had pretty much everything I wanted in a partner, so I figured even if the timing wasn't ideal, I'd be dumb to let it slip away just because of distance.

I told her that I would now be open to doing distance, and she tearfully told me that while I was a great guy who had all the qualities she wanted, she felt she knew herself well enough that she'd know if I was the one and she didn't feel I was... So it ended. I was shocked because while I wasn't sure if she would be on board with distance yet, I certainly didn't expect it to end yet. She still had three months before she was going to move.

I was crushed. I didn't get how she thought she'd just be able to know after only 4 months - two of which we weren't even official for, and all of which we didn't fully treat it like a serious relationship. There was such an insane level of compatibility - more than I ever expected to find - that I didn't get how she could just let that go without even giving it a fair shot. 

I reached out to her two months later in one last attempt to get some closure and understanding so I could finally start to heal (also wrote a letter a few weeks after it happened, to which she basically told me to find my own closure). She was totally cold and almost mean to me, and made me feel like I was delusional and needy for wanting closure. It felt so completely opposite of everything I had ever seen in my previous interactions with her. 

She basically told me she never had deeper feelings for me, and that I had been like a friend to her. That made me feel like either she was gaslighting me or I was disturbingly off in my perception of our relationship, which seems unlikely because I'm fairly emotionally perceptive. It hurt so damn much to feel like something that really meant something to me, according to her now, meant comparatively very little to her. 

She didn't get how I felt blindsided by the breakup since ""we had agreed to be casual"". Newsflash: if you really want to keep it casual, don't say yes when I ask you to officially be my girlfriend, don't introduce me to your friends, don't hang with me three times a week, don't plan a cute Valentine's day date, and don't fucking ask to join me on a trip. 

And the worst part is she told me that her takeaway from the relationship was that I was a great guy who had the qualities she wanted, but I wasn't the one, but I showed her what she wanted in her future relationships. It felt like her saying ""I want everything you could give me, but from someone else"". I don't know what she expects to find, but I just wish I could have been enough for her.

Its incredibly disheartening and painful to have something go so mind-blowingly well, with someone who I just clicked so insanely well with, and then have it blow up suddenly in such a painful way. Makes me afraid to date again since even if I find what I'm looking for and don't make any mistakes, it can still leave me crushed and hurt. Now not only will it be really hard for me to settle for anything less than the degree of compatibility I had with her, but its going to be really hard to find the motivation to even try to find someone and then to allow myself to be vulnerable again.

74,na1xzv,1620752865,Yes Means No,"I've (19M) vented here before, and now I feel like venting again. Last time I talked about some of the mistreatment myself and my friends went through during the dating phase, but this time, I'm venting about something I didn't use to consider a problem, and only minorly alluded to in my previous vent. 

Girls don't say no to me, yet I've still never had a proper first date.

It's become a meme among my group of friends, I can go up to any girl roughly my age, ask her out, she'll say yes and give me her real phone number. The only time I've heard the word ""no"" was the first time I've asked a girl out in 9th Grade High School, I'm finishing my first year in Uni now.

We'll sort out the logistics through the phone, and either during the sorting out phase of the logistics, or on the day of the intended date, she'll cancel. 

If this happened once, twice, thrice... sure. But this has happened 6 times in a row in this semester, not including the dates in which I reschuduled with the same girl to a day and time she accepted only to cancel/delay again. 

I don't know what's going on. None of my friends have this problem, in fact, one has the reverse, girls will not just reject him outright but publicly humiliate him for trying. 

It's causing so much confusion for me. When I'm asking a girl out now I don't hope for a ""yes"" I hope for a ""no"", because at least that way I'm not having my time wasted. I know, it's backwards, that's why I'm considering it a problem now, my mentality about dating is completely has been screwed up. 

I've talked to some platonic female friends about this, they asked me if I had any type of weird social media, I don't have any social media. They asked me to show them how I approach girls I'm interested in (because they thought I could be scaring them into saying yes), but said I seemed perfectly normal, and that the scared theory doesn't work because they'll still talk and flirt with me over their real phone numbers with discussing the logistics. They asked me to show our conversations in between to see if I texted anything that put them off, but my texts are typically just the logistics, with minor flirting if the girl does it too. 

My family thinks the reason I don't have a girlfriend is because they think I'm shy. I'm not shy at all. Anytime I notice an interesting girl in a socially acceptable circumstance I'll try to talk to her, unless I'm already talking to another.  

Is there some online social media game going on? Say yes to all guys but cancel if you're not interested? Because I couldn't find anything like that. 

A friend guessed that maybe in the time it takes to go actually go to the date (this only applies to those that have cancelled on the day of the date, so 2-3 of them), they've found another guy they see as more interesting. I mean, maybe? But that doesn't explain why this doesn't happen to the rest of my friends, for them yes means yes, they usually get Nos, but when they get a yes, it's a real yes.

Unless you want to radicalize yourself by getting alienated lol,"Unfortunately a lot of guys in this situation have next to 0 supportive places to vent about their struggles. It’s easy to tell someone to “seek therapy” and shit but therapy takes time and costs money. And it can be a frustrating journey because a lot of therapists will simply not be a good fit for you. 10 years ago I was extremely depressed, hit rock bottom, and was working a SHIT job making barely enough money to make it work living paycheck to paycheck while diving further into debt. I wanted to die so bad. I knew it was bad so I went to a psychiatrist once a month and a therapist once a week. I stopped going to the therapist after a while though and the psychiatrist got frustrated because the medication wasn’t working optimally and I probably needed effective therapy and she asked why I stopped going. I couldn’t afford that shit lol. The numbers weren’t working. There are lots of real barriers out there unfortunately. And plenty of times I’ve personally gone in for therapy it didn’t do jack shit and the therapist seemed to be making weird assumptions. I’ll never forget one gave me an assignment to try to get me to start talking to people more and told me when I got home to just talk to my roommate for a while. I had an extended conversation with my roommate before I left for therapy that day. We talked all the time actually. But I did it. And her other assignments.

86,na32a2,1620755629,I keep having these two experiences again and again,"I (32F) keep having these same experiences again and again.

Situation 1: I match with a guy who seems sweet. We have the same interests and the getting to know each other part is pleasant. There is hardly any flirting. I tell myself he’s shy. He looks the part but he’s cute in a way. We keep texting. It remains shallow and polite. He doesn’t asks me out but he does say something along the lines of “maybe perhaps if it wouldn’t be to forward someday we could perchance..” You get the jist. I am attracted to people who are confident, spontaneous and take initiative so the more we text and the more he DOESN’t ask me out I lose more and more attraction. We fade out and I just lost 6 weeks of my life texting some guy that I will never see.

Situation 2: almost the same except I tell myself this is 2021 (or 2018 or 2015 or 2014) girls can take initiative as well and maybe he’s also someone who wants a partner who is confident, spontaneous and takes initiative and wants the other to prove themselves first before doing all that himself. I ask the guy out, arrange an amazing and fun date, pay for half because I was the one that invited HIM (won’t go as far as to pay for both). The date itself will be somewhere between fun and fine. He tells me he has had a great time. Afterwards, we start texting again. Again he’s sweet, texts me right back, keeps asking me questions and sounds interested. No flirting though. He never asks me on a second date. I stop replying. Now I have wasted six weeks of my time texting some dude AND a week looking forward to this amazing date that will make *it* happen.

This has happened to me about.. 10/15 times over the last years. I am in a rut. What do I do? Do I weed out these guys earlier? Do I tell them I need them to show initiative? Do they just don’t like me that much? I can handle anything, just give it to me straight!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/na32a2/i_keep_having_these_two_experiences_again_and/
87,na356j,1620755832,Weird girl ive developed a crush on,"
So i met this girl at work about 5 or 6 months ago. I thought she was real cute and i finally got up the nerve to introduce myself. I asked her what her name was and how long shed been working there. 
She started sitting across from me on my lunch breaks. Once i figured that she may be doing this intentionally i started to talk to her. We started having really great convos about life, family, school, future goals, etc. i felt like i could talk to her about pretty much anything and she would ask me questions and remember small details about things i told her. Every time she would talk to me she would light up and couldnt stop smiling. 

I figured she must be a really friendly person and do this with everyone, but i have never seen her talk to anyone else at work more than just answering a question. My friends would say that when i was off of work she would go out to lunch or sit byherself on her phone. After 5 or 6 months of talking just about everyday we worked together, i finally asked her for her phone number. She gave happily gave it to me and i texted her the next day. We talked for a few days until i asked her on a date. 

She told me she couldnt because of covid and a household family member has health issues. Assuming rejection, i told her it was ok and i would stop speaking to her. She told me i didnt have to do that as she really liked our relationship. I told her id have to think about it and she insisted so i agreed to keep talking to her. The next time i saw her at work she was all dressed up with hair and makeup done and we talked like normal for 15 or so minutes over our break. Realizing i couldn’t get over my feelings for her i texted her that night and told her i needed space to get over my feelings for her. She said she understood. When i went back to talk to her she told me she did not wish to speak to me anymore. This hurt because she was my best friend at work and i really enjoyed talking to her. Was she interested and i really hurt her? Or was she just not interested? 

Its been 2 months since this happened and ive been going out of my way to avoid her(we work at a large Outdoor Store Chain so not hard). Ive been thinking of a way to talk to her again. Should i apologize or start with small talk?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/na356j/weird_girl_ive_developed_a_crush_on/

97,na42bi,1620758113,I just broke things off with a girl who had BPD and I feel like the biggest asshole in the world,"She was so different in the beginning. She adored me, wanted my attention, reciprocated the energy I gave her and made me feel so happy. We talked and talked, caught feelings for each other, then told each other we loved one another. She told me about her BPD in a FaceTime but I didn’t mind it because she told she had it under control and was visiting a therapist to help cope with her emotions. I was so in love that I pressed on and didn’t mind it

Then we reached the lows of her emotions. She eventually revealed to me that we should stop telling each other that we love one another. Thay we were moving too fast and that she still needed to recover from the trauma of her ex, that she still wants to date but that eventually she’ll jump into a relationship with me.  

Then I went on my first vacation with my friends. A trip that I have been waiting for the longest. I would send her pictures, and videos of my trip, expecting her to be happy for me and ask about my day. Instead she’d be really dry and would complain that she was feeling depressed. So the conversations would always turn into me comforting her, trying help her get through the lows of her emotions.

   Then what eventually made me decide it was over, was the day I went to my first waterfall. I was high on adrenaline, the happiest I ever been. I sent her all the pictures and videos I took.  She took hours to respond, told me she had taken a nap, then started to feel sad because she doesn’t want to work all the time and wants to do something meaningful. Everything I did that day was pushed into the background and it was just me comforting her again   

So the next day I went for a walk, thought about things, and sent her the message of wanting to end things. I now feel terrible because I told this girl that I was going to be around forever. Now I’ve left her....and I know I’ve hurt her",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/na42bi/i_just_broke_things_off_with_a_girl_who_had_bpd/

99,na4bzf,1620758778,"I feel like I always need to be the empathetic one, and it hurts.","I (22M) understand that the dating world is hard for all genders and that it's hard in very different ways. I empathize that women need to sort through a lot of dangerous men to find someone good. I can't understand it from experience but I try to empathize with their struggle nonetheless. But I feel like I'm not offered the same empathy, at least when I bring up my struggles with my friends. 

I don't think it's controversial to say that women have an easier time getting dates and sex. They struggle with a lot of other, different things when it comes to dating, of course. But for just getting the opportunity to date or fuck, it's easy. For men, it's the opposite. You work hard on your profiles, improve your flirting, work on yourself, build your skills, and put yourself out there. But it's to no avail. Frankly, it's really freakin' frustrating! There's always going to be something new to work on, but it sucks to see no results from your previous improvements! 

But I don't feel like women even try to empathize with that, while I at least put in the effort to empathize with their situation. I talk to friends of all genders about dating sometimes, and my women friends are always very quick to point out their struggles instead of even trying to understand my point of view. It's not like it's a constant thing, either. I'd understand if I was constantly bringing it up and whining about my ""lack of options"" or whatever. But  I don't do that. I discuss dating with them very rarely, and when I do I consider it a pretty dang vulnerable thing. So when they almost immediately try to invalidate my experience, it hurts. 

None of what I just said invalidates the struggles women face when dating, not at all. But I just want the same courtesy I show for once, man. Empathy is supposed to go both ways.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/na4bzf/i_feel_like_i_always_need_to_be_the_empathetic/
