1,rp8nzj,1640561049,I can't keep interest once I begin dating someone,"I've realized this for a long time but everytime someone wants to date me I want to try again and hopefully not mess it up. I can really like someone at first but then a few weeks after we've been dating I get this feeling that I need to break up with my partner. I don't know what it is and it pisses me off because I want a relationship but it's like I can't make myself stay with anyone. I also don't want marriage or kids later on and I know a lot of guys will want this at some point in a relationship. 

I believe my longest relationship I've had lasted for about 6 months. I hate this so to keep from doing it I have kept myself from dating anyone for nearly four years now. 

Now, there's a guy and he keeps wanting to hang out and flirt. I reciprocate. I'm so fucking lost as what to do at this point. If I make myself stay with someone I'm ridden with guilt the entire time because I know the feeling is just going to come back and I'll end it.

4,rp91fm,1640562105,Dealing with loneliness and not getting discouraged,"So I've (25m) I've never been in a relationship before. I've never kissed, had sex or even something intimate. I wouldn't say I'm bad looking either. I've been working on finishing a post grad in architecture, I work out and have healthy hobbies.

I have been online dating for a year. I matched with lots of girls, and only met two or three in real life. And those fizzled out. Most of them end up ghosting me. I recently went one three dates with a girl I really liked had a great connection, and got ignored at the start of the holiday season.

This loneliness is absolutely painful, like physical pain if not worse. It's even worse when younger people, especially those in your family, are in relationships. It's feels soul-crushing. Although my life at the moment feels mostly satisfactory and I'm grateful for it, I dearly need having someone special to share it with.

I don't know what do anymore. Or rather, what I'm doing wrong. Why is it so difficult? Last year, I suffered mild depressive episodes but this year I was on the road to recovery. I felt better and happier and more confident than ever and especially after seeing a couple girls for the first time in my life, I was having some of my needs met.

I think I'm on the verge of a relapse.

9,rp994x,1640562769,Why do people lie about their intentions even when you aren’t looking for something serious???,"So I wanna preface this by saying I got out of a long term relationship a few months ago so I’m not necessarily looking to jump into a new one (although I’m not opposed). So I’ve been dating. Usually I’ll go on a first date and am not really into the person so I just decline the second date. I’ve been on a ton of first dates but there have only been like 3 of those that i was interested in pursuing further. Usually I’m kind of looking for a fling or like a long term FWB situation. 

One of those situations didn’t work out because the guys moving - that’s pretty straight forward. 

The next guy we ended up going on two dates and then hooking up. The turnaround between the first and second dates were pretty quick so I knew they were interested after the first. After we hooked up, he continued to text me and then when I said I was interested in doing that again, he made up a story about how he started seeing someone but that he really did like me, just can’t keep seeing me.  Okay fine, maybe he did meet someone right after it’s fine. 

The third situation the guy and I were completely up front about only wanting to be friends and hook up occasionally. We did that and it was fun. He reassured me the entire time that he was interested and mentioned during that he wanted to do it again. Right before he left my apartment he mentioned several times again that he would like to see me again and mentioned several days to do so and I agreed. Again, we both were very clear about not wanting something serious. Immediately after he leaves my apartment I’m unmatched on the app we met on and don’t hear from him. 

It’s confusing because why tell me you liked me and want to meet up again when you don’t want to? I get lying to get into your pants but I’m letting you into my pants no lies necessary! What’s the point in lying or asking me to see me if that’s not the intention?

10,rp99c6,1640562788,Not sure whether to keep messaging her. She’s interested in person but I can’t tell over text…,"Not sure what to think. So there’s this girl [F21] I’ve [M21] been talking to and hanging out with recently. It started out a couple months ago when we met through a mutual friend, we slept together that night and the next two times we saw each other on nights out ended up doing the same - each time I’d end up spending most of the next day at hers. Eventually after sleeping with her three times, I asked her out and we went out for drinks which went well. A few days later I asked her out again and before we were about to leave decided to just hang out at hers - I ended up staying two nights. A day later she messaged me to come out with her and a friend so I did and went back to hers. This was about two weeks ago and ever since have messaged each day. We have plans to see each other but that is in about a week. So in short it has and will be texting each other for three weeks since we are away from each other. At this point I’m not even sure what to think. Not sure if we’re dating or bf/gf without the label etc. 

- When together we are very intimate and when thinking about it act as though we are in a relationship. She has me a toothbrush at hers, she jokes about stealing my clothes and asking me when I’ll next see her - each time I’m about to leave hers she tells me not to leave. When texting though it seems very different. I’m a pretty bad texter and so don’t know if i’m embarrassing myself and she’s just keeping up with it to be kind. It was easier when we texted a few times and didn’t say anything till the date. Now i’m not sure whether she wants me to text or not.

- I’m not great at texting so usually take a few hours to reply so can think of what to say. She usually matches the time I take to text and so we talk every few hours, but this has been the case for two weeks. It almost feels as though it’s one long conversation about different things. How was your day, seen/listened to anything good recently, got any fun plans etc. At this point I can’t really tell or not whether she wants to continue the conversation or not and don’t really want to end the conversation by airing her. When I feel like the conversations coming to an end I’ve tried stoping with questions, shorter responses but sometimes she’ll ask another question - sometimes not, which is when I’m not sure whether to ask her another question or just end it.

- Also does using ahah and lol in messages mean she’s disinterested. Neither of us use emojis with each other.

- Recently she also started using X’s which wasn’t the case when we first texted. We now send them at the end of each text.

I know I have definitely over thought this but would really appreciate thoughts and what to do next.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rp99c6/not_sure_whether_to_keep_messaging_her_shes/

We hooked up within the first couple of times hanging out. It went well but I just didn’t seem into it and I felt bad because she was so into me. In fact, she seemed like she liked me too much early on. After three months, things fizzled out as I didn’t want to make things serious. I kinda stopped asking her to hang out and she stopped hitting me up. It was like a game of chicken.

Three more months went by and I decide to reach out and we started hanging out again. Same shit as before, she was all over me constantly blowing me up late at night to hang out. Once again I felt guilty anytime saying no. One night we discussed dating and she practically asked me out. She knew about how fucked up my ex was and how I had trouble trusting people. We agreed to try it out and see how we felt in a month. 

All of a sudden, she was less available to hang out. It was like we never had that conversation. I asked her to just let me know when plans change instead of just ignoring me. 

The last time we hung out was 2 weeks into us dating. She told me how how she hoped I wasn’t mad at her and how she’s in a certain place in life and always busy. I said no worries. 

After that night, she suddenly just starting leaving me on open. Not picking up calls, etc. Like are we not dating? I’m not even worth an answer? Weeks go by and no contact. 

What’s even worse? She doesn’t even block me. Just leaves me on open and moves on. The ghosting started about five weeks ago. Last week she posted a video of herself on a date with another guy. 

It fucking sucks. She spent all that time buttering me up and gaining my trust just to leave me the second I agreed to be serious. It’s worst case scenario because my ex did the same thing where I got blocked, ignored and left for someone else. Life for fucks sake just tell me you don’t want to date. Why ghost and ignore? (And no I’m not the type of guy to threaten or stalk so that’s not the reason I’d be ghosted).

Any words of encouragement or perspective? I don’t want to feel bad for myself too much anymore but I don’t get how I keep getting fucked over. I try my hardest to be open, understanding and respectful and would never force anyone into being in my life so why am I being ghosted and ignored with no closure.

I'm a 5'10 guy and recently got rejected by a few women that were 5'2 and under because I'm not tall.

Also telling me that they dont want short kids (as if that's a bad thing). So I tried an experiment and put in 2 inch shoe lifts in boots that are also 2 inches on the bottom for a combined 4 inches to make me 6'2. I went out and noticed majority of women looking at me and smiling to show interest. I went to clubs and bars with then, and women including tiny ones would come to me and start flirting with me and the first thing they ask is ""how tall I am"" to test and see if I'm tall. I obviously don't lie and at that point I walk out cause I know how it would turn out. So the outcome is basically I get noticed by way more women who flirt with me by using this experimentation than I would without. 

If you really want to test a woman, you can wear shoe lifts with boots, but not mention your height to women if they never ask because sometimes they don't mention height requirements right away.

So I’ve (F25) been with my boyfriend (M26) since 2015. At the very beginning of our relationship, he was talking with a girl he never met on Playstation and she asked him if they could hook up. He said yes. He deleted his text but forgot or thought he deleted the girl’s text. I asked him about it and he swore he said no. He blocked her right after that. Anyway, life went on and we separated three years ago. I was very hurt and sad so I hooked up with a guy right after our break up. 
Now, we started talking again a few months ago and we’re starting to talk about getting back together. We had a looong talk last time and he admitted he said yes to the girl who asked him to hook up even though he swore he refused. I thanked him for being honest and because it was just a text, I forgave him. 
He asked me if I had any sexual relationship with anyone and I told him about my one and only hook up right after we broke up. Since then, he always talk about how I cheated on him and HE stayed loyal even though we weren’t together anymore. I tried telling him that it was absolutely nothing and we were separated so it wasn’t cheating but nope. He got mad about it once again today and silence treatment since 4pm (it’s currently 9pm) despite my messages and calls.

I’m a woman as well if this makes any difference. 

I’ve gotten out of a relationship a while ago (about 3 months ago) and so right now am only looking for something casual and I make that VERY clear. It’s the first thing mentioned on my dating profile and a thing I always bring up when we first meet up to make sure we are absolutely on the same page because I’d hate to be the asshole by leading somebody on and not showing them my true intentions. In every single case, the woman has agreed and cited that she too is looking for something non serious, no strings attached, just casual etc.... Only to bring up getting serious/exclusive/wanting more 2 weeks or so afterwards. At this point I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, I keep feeling like an asshole for « letting them down » but also frustrated because this is not what I want and also what they said they didn’t want.

This how it usually goes: We meet up the first time to grab drinks, see if we vibe and talk about our expectations and make sure we are on the same page. Then every meeting after that is either at my place or theirs, we have sex and talk a bit or watch a movie/play a video game.

When you're on a first date with a hetero cis man and they mention going on subsequent dates together like ""oh, we should go see that movie together"" or ""next time, I'll take you to that restaurant,"" does it make you uncomfortable at all?

49,rpca96,1640571899,I'm (35M) too afraid to ask a girl (31F) out because I don't want to scare her away.,"Quick back story:

In Jan 2019, i had just got dumped and was a mess. I started talking to this girl who had shared interests through a FB group. We messaged a lot, mostly about life and interests. I think she could tell I was a little needy and said she would rather date someone closer (We live a few hours apart). I'm so glad nothing happened then because I was in no fit state.

We've been friends ever since. We share news of our interests on Insta and reply to Insta stories every month or so.

My favourite band were touring in December and she was dying to see them live in London, so finally we were going to meet as friends, have some drinks and watch the band. The show was a week before Christmas, it was perfect! We really click and I felt things would move a long more positively if we actually met.

So the Covid cases went through the roof the week of the show and we had to cancel all the plans.

Since about the 12th, we now talk every day on Insta message. Long, long replies, multiple messages a day - but there is no flirting, no sexual chat etc. I feel like I'm in the friend zone (which stems back to 2019) but I also don't want to push to find out if it's the case because I love talking to her. I live alone so it has been great company for me over the holidays. We have endless things to talk about and I'm just happy and content, but I would love to date her. I was miserable when we had to cancel through Covid, I felt like it was a perfect opportunity that I will struggle to replicate.

I drop hints all the time rather than being upfront that I'm interested in her. I think she knows, but she has given no direct indication that she feels the same. Except that we talk every day, she sometimes replies instantly at length, we did a movie watchalong before Christmas too - she clearly likes me in some capacity. But, even I don't reply to a 'friend' this much.

We've talked about meeting again for something else but no real plans have been made. I just don't know what to do besides carry this on day by day until I get a breakthrough.

61,rpd5zn,1640574628,Is it even possible to get lucky on dating apps?,"Okay so if you’ve seen my previous posts, you should know that I hate dating apps.

Here is a list of reasons.

1. Seems like a lot of girls/women on there just want attention

2. Almost none of the girls on there share the same interests that I do(I’m into stuff including video games, action movies, Kaiju, etc).

3. Seems like a lot of girls/women on dating apps/sites are very extroverted and outgoing whereas I’m an introvert and so I’m not quite sure if I would be compatible with most of these girls/women.

4. Based on reviews, seems like a lot of girls lie about themselves including their looks.

5. I overall just feel like I shouldn’t be finding a girlfriend on dating apps/sites because for most men/boys including me, it just feels like a chore to not only get matches, but to know if your match is the right person for you.

But maybe I can get some luck, maybe if I actually put the work into my pics and my bio I would actually get some matches but when I do get matches, how would I know that my match would be compatible and also not lying about themselves?

Also the only site/app that I’ve tried is Tinder, I have tried signing up for bumble too but then I said f\*ck it when I found out that girls/women only make the first move but in my opinion I think guys should do it despite them not knowing how to do it very often lol, but hey maybe I will try both Tinder and Bumble again because if I actually put the effort into my bio and pics, I might get lucky.

But here are my questions though.

1. How do I get really good attractive pics of me?(I use an IPhone SE)

2. As someone who is a geek who loves Super Heroes, Video Games, Kaijus aka Giant Monsters including Godzilla, etc. How do I CORRECTLY put that into my bio without making it boring?

3. How to I find girls/women who are my type not only when it comes to personality but also looks who would also be compatible with me?

4. If I do get any matches, how would I make sure that the girl/women stays in the conversation? Because based on what I’ve heard, a lot of girls/women would just match with guys and not even say a damn word to them and would leave.

5. What are some good dating apps/sites that I can use other than Bumble and Tinder that may actually work very well for me without paying any money?

6. When I get a conversation going, how should I talk and keep her interested?

7. Are there any dating apps/sites that will notify me for free if I get any matches?

8. How do I get matches but good matches? 

9. How do I start the conversation?

10. Lastly, are dating apps/sites actually worth the time and in some cases the money?

Anyway I know that’s a lot to ask but for those of you that see this post, please answer all of my questions and overall please give me your best reply, it would be very helpful, thanks.

Also maybe instead of me finding the girls/women online, maybe they can instead find me😏.

I had a pretty girl laying against my shoulder and my arm around her shoulders. She fell asleep. Me and my friends just chatting. It was nice. Then I woke up. I could still feel her weight on my shoulder, the contentment of being with people i cared about and the smell of something delicious being cooked in the next room over. And then I realized where I actually was as I woke up and i nearly started to cry and tried to go back to sleep to get more of that feeling. Go back to a place where I had friends and a partner who really, truly cared for me. But I couldnt. And all day i have have had this enormous weight on my chest because of it. Something broke in me this morning when I woke up from that dream and I realized just how alone I was.

65,rpdcac,1640575163,Is he uninterested or just passive?,"I (23F) went on a date with a guy (27M) and it seemed to go really well, we got drinks and stayed for 5 hours until the place was closing and we realized how late it was and that we had to go home . There was lots of laughing and no awkwardness and I had a really nice time. But then as we were parting ways he was quite abrupt. As we got outside we said ""okay I have to go this way"" and when I had to go the other way i said ""well it was nice meeting you, and nice talking to you"" and waited for him to say something but he just said ""yeah..."" and looked at me. I felt a bit rejected so i left really quickly without even giving him a hug. 

When I got home I messaged him about smt and we were texting back and forth and he seemed engaged but over the next couple of days he got less responsive. After a day and a half of not hearing back I texted and said I had had a nice time and was open to meeting again, but no worries if he wasn't interested. I was surprised when he said he was down and we made a plan for a few days from then. 

The night before he texted me but was being really short/disengaged and then never replied to something I said. The next day (the day of the date) he still hadn't replied to my last texts, or messaged to confirm we were meeting later. 30 mins before we were supposed to meet I messaged again to see if we were still on. He said yes, and I went but at this point I felt like he wasn't interested. When we got there he seemed to be having a nice time but then asked for the bill really early and we paid before I had gotten very far into my first drink, so again I thought he wasn't into being there. I was visibly thrown off and kind of went into small talk mode and then asked if he was ready to leave, but he said no, he wanted to finish his drink, and then he made a point of sitting there for another 1.5 hours just drinking water once our drinks were done. At this point I was super exhausted and confused by all the mixed messages. At the end of the night as we were leaving he lingered and just looked at me for a minute but said nothing. I was so tired and confused at this point so I didnt know what to do or say so I just said ""alright have a good night"" and turned to leave and he said ""okay cool!"" and seemed a little offended and left. 

I spent the next couple of days really confused about it, and a few days later I texted to apologize if I had been rude, and say I would be down to try to meet up again if he wanted. He said dating is very stressful for him, and that when we met up he had been in a very stressful period with work and having trouble focusing. He said that it was nice I wanted to meet again and that it might be nice to do. We decided to talk in a few days when we were both less busy and make a plan then. From there he did make an effort to text me a little more over the next few days, but then he didn't respond to something I said and we never talked again. 

It's been a while since then and I normally wouldn't dwell for this long, but I really liked this person and I cant tell if he was uninterested, or just passive/nervous and thought I was playing games or smt. I know there isn't a lot to go off of here, but I would really appreciate anyone's insights!! I'm not good at initiating anything physical, so its crossed my mind that maybe he had been waiting for something to happen and when it didn't he thought I was uninterested, but i felt so confused about it all I didn't feel comfortable trying to do anything. I feel like maybe he was just stressed out/passive, but I was also the one initiating everything and it didn't feel reciprocated.  ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rpdcac/is_he_uninterested_or_just_passive/

68,rpdgtr,1640575549,Just tried to respond to the topic of women and squirting and when I hit post it said comments locked. I'm not wasting this comment.,"It's the Skene's gland. Two small holes on each side of the urethra.  Several factors contribute as to how it tastes. Dehydration, poor diet, rough sex, muscle tone.... mental state.  Sometimes a leaky bladder is mistaken for squirt. I've squirted so much sometimes that it feels supernatural as to where the F it comes from.  I've also used the bathroom directly after sex and released a bladder full of urine. If all conditions are right mine has no smell. I'd say about 15% of the time it has a smell and usually do to several days of consecutive rough sex.  My former partner bought waterproof sex sheets off amazon. We would put that on top of the bedspread, then another thin blanket on top of waterproof sheet. So the nights we just want to go to sleep after sex, ball up the waterproof sheet and top blanket and a nice dry bed awaits underneath. Deal with laundry next day.
Having said that, only 2 men in my entire life made me squirt. I've been doing it to myself for decades though. I don't squirt every time either. I suppose it would be awkward to tell a potential partner you are a squirter and then you don't squirt with him.
Sometimes it's a bane, such as when camping.

71,rpdvs6,1640576847,Men breaking the “touch barrier” too early and too often,"I (29F) have been running into this a lot. 

Recently, I have gone on relatively good dates with seemingly nice men. Convos flowed well and I could feel some connection. However, almost all of them touched me a lot…and these are first/second dates. They didn’t grope, but there was a LOT of arm rubbing, knee rubbing, pulling me in for hugs, hand holding, cheek kissing, or just straight up kissing. And this is all in public and I loathe PDA honestly. When this happens, I tend to act awkward, not reciprocate, but ultimately just let it happen if it continues.

It takes me a little while to warm up to people intimately. I’m not even that touchy with my close friends. So, I get uncomfortable and turned off very quickly when this happens. And I’m not even talking like, it’ll take months or years to have sex. I’d say like 4th/5th date is around when I’d feel comfortable and somewhat safe with the right person. It depends really.

I see on this sub and others that some guys feel the need to break the “touch barrier” ASAP to avoid being friend zoned. I see that point, and I can see that being a strategy that works for others. It doesn’t work for me when overdone. It makes me feel a lot of pressure to feel comfortable and escalate things physically quickly before I am ready. It gives me a lot of anxiety. 

I acknowledge I need to work on communicating my boundaries. I’m learning, but I’m finding it to be a tiresome exercise. I feel like I’m having to constantly put up these boundaries with men. I just wish I didn’t have to do this so often. It’s draining. I’ve been met with a lot of hostility or guys taking things way too personally when I ask to slow things down or when I say I don’t feel comfortable. I get the sense some of these guys are a little touch starved and I feel kinda bad.

I’m a bit of a shy and gentle person. I hate hurting peoples’ feelings. I’m struggling with this part of dating.

In the beginning it was not clear that she has a bf because she wouldn’t talk about him or mention him. There would be light flirting here and there but nothing crazy. Then she transferred to my department and that’s when things changed. There was lots of teasing, banter and other things. The flirting from her has increased and I have to admit I did respond and also flirted. It would even get to touchy things like suddenly her giggling and holding my hand to put candy into it or her pinning things on me putting objects on me. Another time she would start to playfully fight me and try to take things away. 

I noticed she gets very envious when I interact with single girls. She usually tends to stand near me and another girl coworker and listen or try to intervene and push me out of convo. She once sat and stared at a blank computer screen while I was talking to a new girl. 

When I have bad days and don’t interact with her, she starts to chase. She starts approaching me a lot, teasing me a lot, picks comments at me and even messages me custom text memes related to only us.

84,rpenci,1640579245,"I look incredibly young for my age (23), and it’s ruining any romantic prospects with girls who are age appropriate for me","
So the other night I was in a club and this girl approached me out of nowhere and we got dancing with each other. This literally never happens to me so I was kind of caught up in the novelty of it. We danced for like 20 minutes and had a laugh with each other, but I thought she looked on the young side, I judged her to be around 18 or 19, so I didn’t make any sort of move and just kind of danced with her in a goofy as shit way. I was having a pretty good time. I asked her eventually how old she is and she was upfront and told me she was 17. I was instantly taken aback; I laughed and told her that I was sorry but I was actually 23, and I didn’t want there to be any wrong ideas here. She looked kind of stunned and instantly apologised and said she was sure I couldn’t have been more than 18 or 19. It was no real harm done, but we obviously went our separate ways after that. She probably shouldn’t have been in a club underage, which is what some people would fault there, but I was in her position at one time too, and it wasn’t like she lied about her age when asked, which I respected. 

Anyway, the problem here is that I clearly look really young for my age, and it fucks me up in dating and romance so much. I’ve had zero romantic luck my entire life because I’ve always looked so much younger than everyone my age; I’m short, have a baby face, people say I have a bit of an innocent aura about me, etc., girls my age find all that cute and approachable and comfortable but not really very attractive. When me and my guy friends meet a group of girls, I’ll be the one they talk to at first because I seem like the open and unintimidating one, until they get the courage to talk to my friends. It’s always been this way.

Now that I’m at the stage where I look around 18/19 clearly, I’ve noticed that I have started to get a bit of attention from girls, but they’re always around 18 or 19, 20 at a push, and in this case, she was 17, which is obviously not good at all. 20 is probably my personal lower limit for dating just because of the maturity difference at this age, so I’m in a situation where I’ve waited my entire life for girls to notice me, and when they do while it’s a nice confidence boost, I don’t really want to act on it. In the case above, it can actually be dangerous if I’m not careful.

Can anyone else relate to this? And if so, does anybody who’s struggled with it have any answers on how I can be more attractive to girls that are actually age appropriate? I feel like some kind of fucking man child; I wish I could be 18 and look how I do now, I probably would have had a far better time and not had the crazy confidence issues I do now. I can’t think of a single girl around my age who’s ever treated me as a serious romantic prospect, and it’s just fucking depressing.

These comments honestly made me disconnect from him romantically in anyway. As much as I didn’t want it to have an effect on me. I also had a girl I worked with that used to be good friends with him and she said he had a lot of issues and wasn’t a great guy to her friend (his ex). 

It’s been about 2 years of him attempting to reconnect with me trying to get us to interact again and every time I see him I have a great time with him but I think everyone’s opinions have just completely distorted my connection to him. I just can’t seem to feel romantically towards him. Or I just can’t seem to put a wall down. Even he has said it feels like I am keeping him at arms length. 
He is like my best friend. I have told him it just feels like it’s always the wrong timing for us both and he has agreed but he has continued to say he wants to try build a good foundation. I just don’t know how to look past these comments made from other people? He’s not my usual physical type but I do want to give him a chance seeming we have a great friendship and there is sexual chemistry there. 

I know I felt something towards him at the beginning but I don’t know if that was the feeling of lust and wanting what I couldn’t have or if it was romantic. 

Is this a red flag for me to listen that I may never feel romantically towards him?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rpf9uk/how_can_i_stop_being_worried_about_what_other/
93,rpfa4u,1640581277,Did I scare him away for good? Will he come around with space. Is there anything I can do to fix this?,"


I (F26) Met guy(M26) about 3 months ago the beginning he was perfect. Pursuing me hard core. If anything he was moving a little fast; he was mentioning me meeting his family in the first week. He lets me stay at his house and sleep in even when he is at work, he has offered to give me money if I’m running low, I’ve met all his friends, met his boss etc. So a lot a “couple” type things. 
I was surprised when in week two I brought up exclusivity and he hit me with the “I’m not ready for a relationship” thing. I was OK with it because I realize that we’ve only known each other for two weeks. He also went on to talk about how he just got out of a relationship that lasted a year 5 months ago. I told him it takes me a while to decide on a relationship and I also got out of a relationship recently. 
So he continues pursuing me after that conversation but then I noticed he would do this thing where he would invite me to come spend the night with him but then last minute cancel because he was too tired. But then randomly he will contact me to go on these very “couple-like” dates. For example I went to meet his boss one evening. Then we go another few weeks of him being flakey with meeting up and then he invites me to come to dinner to meet his parents. 
So after I meet his parents I try to make plans with him the following weekend and he basically wouldn’t hold down any committed plans. But then last minute on a Friday night I run into him at a pub and he ends up taking me out to this super nice restaurant where we have a super romantic evening and he probably spent over $200 on me. It was nice but just out of nowhere. 

Then where the drama starts is the following week I try to make plans with him again and he basically did the same thing where he wouldn’t commit to a plan. I was upset with him and told him that I would like a little more time with him and he replies that he “isn’t ready for a relationship” I tell him that I am not asking for a relationship I would just like to spend more time together. Then a week later I ran into him at a party. The whole time we are getting along great and he is introducing me to a lot of his friends and then towards the end of the party I get really drunk and clingy. When I could tell he was getting annoyed with me I told him that I don’t wanna relationship and that we are both free to hang out with whoever we want and that I am going on dates with other guys myself and this whole time I’ve been seeing other guys. That is definitely not true and I don’t know why  said that.
The next morning I apologize to him and told him that we are both free to hang out with whoever we want but that he is the only guy  I’ve been hooking up with. He said it was OK. I tried to be casual and fun again and asked if he wanted to meet up with some friends of mine and he declined. I know he just started a new job so he’s busy with that but I would’ve thought he would’ve reached out to me by now as I haven’t heard from him in a week which is the longest we have gone.

94,rpfbgj,1640581390,Are there any good books on dating?,"Well hey! Dude here. So, I've always just accepted the attention and relationships that came my way, which has turned out really well sometimes and other times, not so much. I'm working towards being more deliberate in my life, and that includes being less passive.  


problem: i feel guilty whenever I want to be closer to someone! I'm programmed to be so polite. It's more than that, it's ethical - I think it's important for the folks I date to feel comfortable. but 100%, I take it too far, even when there's a moderately clear signal that the other person is into me, I just play it completely safe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any books on dating that don't feel manipulative? or resources, points of reference? I would love a blueprint for these kind of interactions.

95,rpfbhb,1640581393,my friend made a bumble account of me to catfish her boyfriend and it is ruining mine,"This sounds completely insane, trust me, i’m feeling it as i’m typing it. My (18F) friend (21F) made a bumble account of me to see if her boyfriend would cheat on her again which he did a week before the incident. She downloaded it three days ago and used my pictures, my name, my age, everything and did not tell me about this. Then shit hit the fan. My boyfriend’s (22M) friend found it and told him and now i’m fucked. I showed him verification that i didn’t even have an account and after getting my friend to explain what happened, I showed him screenshots. He still believes i’m lying. I don’t really know what to do here. He’s insisting we break up, but i don’t want to lose him to something that never happened.

I usually end up getting so anxious that I delete the app or make pages without my picture just to practice interacting with men.
