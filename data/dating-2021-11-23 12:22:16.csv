Of course I don’t think about him all the time, but every time questions about dating or love comes up, he’d be the first person that comes to my mind. He’s like my Instagram/celebrity crush, but at the same time I have this idea that unlike Instagram/celebrity crushes, he’s attainable, since he’s just a normal person.

I haven't been in relationship for 10 years bc I have unbelievable bad luck. Every time I get feelings for someone very soon after I sort of accidently find out they are already in a relationship, they have a crush or they just vanish out of blue. I never get a chance to confess my feelings. This has seriously made me slowly afraid of falling for anyone, because it's so repetitive that deep inside I know my heart will get shattered the moment I start to have feelings for someone. My crushes are usually very kind people, someone who I get along with or become close with so that is pretty much a normal reason to start liking someone, right? Sometimes crush is an attractive stranger I just met but same still happens. And I don't purposely chase anyone who is already in a relationship, I meet up with singles, so every time it's like a big surprise slap right on my face for daring to fall in love.

It's just so ridiculous how this happens all of the time I can predict when it hits, the moment after I realize that I like a person, next day they are unavailable. I feel like the whole world is just playing with my feelings. Maybe I'm cursed.

So after the first date, I could tell from texting him that something was off and really worked myself up about it, but I waited to see what happens when we meet in person. 

So he comes over to my place this afternoon, we play some card game with some wine, and then after a while he opens up that he's not fully ready to date, and after seeing his therapist and thinking about it since the first date, he wanted to tell me in person. I told him I would have honestly preferred it via text, but I'm glad he told me now. Honestly, I'm sad, and we had an honest, somewhat convoluted talk.

This is where I'm conflicted. We talked about setting up a check in about a month and a half from now, when we're both back in the city from visiting family, to see where we're at, while neither one waits for the other person, since I don't want to be a rebound and it wouldn't be fair to either one of us. He did try to suggest still maybe texting sporadically once in a while if he sees something that makes him think about our conversations, and I could tell he's conflicted about still liking me, but I told him I'd rather not text for now, but we decided to sleep on whether or not the check in thing is a good idea, since I don't know if I want to have the ""what if he's interested then"" looming over my head. So we can both opt out early from the check in thing if we change our minds or meet someone else.

If I were into casual dating I would have probably gone and gotten laid this weekend, but I'm not, so I won't. I'll live with the rejection. It's more about timing than me specifically, but it still sucks, and I wish he would have told me earlier. At least we didn't have sex. He did go after we talked and we hugged it out, but I told him I'm going to assume I won't see him again, which I think was a bit of a hard pill for him to swallow based on his reaction.

7,r0jyn0,1637692803,I just wish he'd let it go.,"I'm 18M living in a small city in a little European region. I just turned 18 when I dated for the first time 7 weeks ago. He is 17M and we met over a common friend. She introduced him to me when we were out for drinks. When he came I was pretty loaded. So naturally I enjoyed the conversation and was happy to finally meet a man who might be interested in me. There aren't many of ""us"" around here - so it was the first time I got that kind of attention. We met again and I drank again. I can't say I noticed that I wasn't interested - I just found it interesting. We had three other dates, six in total over a timespan of maybe 4 weeks. After the third date - the first time I didn't drink - I felt something weird. I was extremely uncomfortable but could not really put the feeling into words. I just didn't enjoy him as a person, he was sympathetic of course, a really nice person, but no connection at all. It made me stressed. After a fall break party where I drowned that feeling with alcohol I decided it was not for me and I sent him a WhatsApp voice memo. YES, one breaks up personally. BUT I met him 6 times. We only held hands once. It hurt him I guess. He texted me messages as long as novels. I told him I just didn't enjoy myself and that I felt no connection. He just wouldn't stop asking for us to meet. But I grew so uncomfortable that I just didn't feel like it anymore. He started kind of gaslighting me by telling me how unfairly I'm treating him. 

Now, after two weeks since the last message I had a letter in my mail, no stamp. It was from him, meaning he took a 45min Bus to my village. In the letter he repeated how unfair I treat him, and that he ""couldn't ever forget me"", that he ""wants to know me better"" and that ""he deserves a chance"" and that he really, really wants to meet. 

I feel backed into a corner honestly. I think it's a tad much actually. It seems to me as if he wanted to make me feel bad for not wanting to date him. Sometimes I can't help but ask myself whether he's entitled to it? I just feel like what we had was insignificant. Six dates that were nice, but that was it.

How do I go forward? Text him? Call him? Can I just move on (again)? I don't feel like letting him reopen the conversation. Was my behavior wrong?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0jyn0/i_just_wish_hed_let_it_go/

12,r0kbmg,1637693747,"Maybe he was too good to be true, after all?","Long story incoming. Tldr at the bottom. On mobile so sorry for formatting.

I (30f) recently matched with a very handsome, sweet guy (31m) on Bumble. Initial convo was good if brief, he was very sweet and affectionate which is a weakness of mine. He’s a police officer and I’m a bartender, so we both work evenings/nights. After a few days of chatting, he suggests I come “door up” (police term for grabbing a coffee/chatting in your car) with him after my shift one night.

I go (we met at a 24hour coffee shop so it was completely safe), he pulls up in a police vehicle. I think, ‘okay check, he didn’t lie about his profession’. We talk for maybe 45 mins until he gets dispatched, great convo, I’m way more into him than I was expecting. He’s sweet, kind, handsome, genuine, funny. 

Awhile after I get home, I see a message from him saying he’s happy to have “finally” seen me. I think that’s weird because we’ve only messaged for a few days, so I check and turns out we matched on Tinder a couple months ago, he messaged and I didn’t reply (his Tinder profile was empty and he sent me a “Hey. How are you?:)” so I’m not surprised I didn’t reply. I usually only respond to conversational openers, I hate small talk and empty profiles usually mean fboys anyways. I know it's not ideal to leave people on read but we all know how dating apps can be.

Friday we have our first official date. He came to my house after work, we drank wine, talked, laughed, cuddled. It’s the most natural I’ve felt with a man since my most recent ex, who was really hard to get over. We ended up having sex, it was very passionate, felt like making love and not just fucking, ya know? Afterwards, we’re laying in bed talking and he casually mentions he’s gonna delete his apps. I kind of just stared there shocked, it’s only our first date and it felt like so green of a flag it must’ve been red lol. He couldn’t stay the night but he messaged when he got home and I was kind of in the clouds about it but trying to remember there’s still lots of time for this to go left.

Fast forward to Sunday night, we're texting after midnight and it gets steamy and he asks me if I want him to come over. I say I'd love him to but it's late and I don't wanna be a booty call. Normally I don't care that much but I wanted there to be substance to our relationship and not just sex. 

I fell asleep not long after I sent that text and when I woke up his response had been ""Lolll sorry. I just wanted you. and sweetheart you’re not booty call. Papi is here for the long haul 😘"" I respond with something sweet, asking him to be patient with me and telling him he doesn't have to apologize and I can't wait to see him tonight (we have planned Monday night to be our third date.) he responds saying, ""No worries sweetheart it was late haha. And of course I’ll be patient. Like I said I’m here for you and only you 😘""

It seems again to me like so green of a flag it might be red, does he say this to all the girls? Why is he so taken with me so quickly? Like, I know my worth but it's been two weeks. Then again, I hear stories of people who just ""know"" and I fell in love with my ex on our second date, so I kind of get it. I decide to just be happy and take him for his words, if it's an act it'll show up in time.

This is where it starts to get weird. Around 4pm I message him and ask what time he's thinking for tonight. And I get crickets. He hasn't unmatched me on either apps, but I haven't heard from him since 11am yesterday, the same texts I just quoted above was his last two texts to me. 

I'm not stressed about the slow replying, life is busy and I don't get bothered by that. However, I don't like being stood up for a date with no explanation or cancellation. If he was any other guy I'd have already unmatched him for such poor behaviour so quickly but our connection felt very real and I don't feel connections like that very often.

What do you guys think? Do I ask him if he's okay? Wait it out til tmr? God forbid something terrible happened I don't want to assume he's just being an ass. But I'd like some sort of explanation asap, if possible.

Tldr; I've been ghosted before our third date by a guy who was very sweet and genuine, seemed like he was really taken with me and I was with him.

14,r0km1q,1637694472,"Spilling your emotions to someone who goes cold won’t win them over, it will push them away even more","This is in the context of first getting to know someone or for newer relationships.

Neediness is perhaps the most universally unattractive quality for both men and women. Sometimes, we can confuse being vulnerable and honest with our emotions, when in fact we’re displaying neediness and desperation.

Attraction in the real world doesn’t work like it does in romantic comedies, where undying devotion and over the top progressions of love are what it takes to win someone’s heart. In fact the opposite is true, especially if we don’t know the other person very well.

When we meet someone that we like, the biggest mistake is to fantasize and project romantic fantasies onto that person. It allows us to have a skewed, unrealistic view of reality. We may feel they is a deep connection, when on the other side they don’t feel anything.

When someone goes cold—they aren’t responsive, their answers are shorter, they are unreliable with keeping plans, etc—they do not have enough interest to keep you at the forefront of their mind.

When we like someone and feel them slipping away, the first instinct is to try everything in our power to hold onto the relationship. But this is the incorrect course of action, and often makes things worse.

Part of this often involves a “confession” of emotions, or trying to logically convince someone of a connection between the two of you that they don’t feel.

While on the surface this seems reasonable last-ditch effort to establish an emotional connection, it has disastrous results, and pushes them away further. This is because these type of vomiting of emotions isn’t vulnerable or bold, it’s needy. It is essentially asking for their sympathy and trying to guilt them into giving you a chance, because you have these unrealistic, deep emotions for them. This makes people feel cornered and uncomfortable, especially if it’s a new relationship.

Almost always, they will do the polite thing and say they don’t feel the same way, but would like to be friends. When in reality, they want to phase out the interaction altogether, and hope the other person will get the hint.

If you feel like something is going well with someone, but they suddenly go cold, they either are having second thoughts about you, or their attraction has waned. This isn’t the time to spill your guts. Hang back.

If they cancel plans, respond in polite, concise manner, like it doesn’t bother you. As it shouldn’t. The ball is in their court now.

You don’t want to waste your time trying to get others to like you. Respect your own time and value as a person. People who truly are interested and want to spend time with you will make the time, no matter if they’re busy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0km1q/spilling_your_emotions_to_someone_who_goes_cold/

23,r0lat5,1637696317,Dating has started affecting my mental health.,"21M here. The title says it all I guess. I recently got out of a 2 year old relationship. We dated properly for 6-7months after that pandemic hit and ruined every single thing. My relationship became a LDR. I could hardly meet her 3-5 times a year. Ik people make it work but we couldn't. In 2021 I met her only twice before breakup. My relationship lacked serious intimacy. Actually it lacked a lot of things like reassurance, affection, interest, excitement, reciprocation, emotional support. There was a point where I had to explicitly ask for these things and still the reply would be ""I can't give you this"". I feel like it was a huge disrespect that I had to ask for these bare minimum things. I used to get ignored if I tried to have any sort of intimate conversation. And the only conversation she would initiate would be about studies or the classic ""what you doing"". I felt like after a year of dealing with this it got really monotonous and boring. And anytime I'd voice my concerns or raise an issue I'd get emotionally tortured like ""ik I'm the worst gf ever I'm sorry you have to deal with me."" Or some other version of ""you deserve better"". I mean no one wants a boring relationship/dating life. We had too many fights over this same topic. But she'd never understand that I was just asking for bare minimum things. Her reasons would be her mental health, etc. Which seemed fine when she was doing everything else or talking to anyone else or meeting anyone else. Except me. When I tried to convince her to meet me she said ""people are dying cases are increasing and you want to go on a date"". And then she went out with friends. I did everything for her without getting anything in return. Even after we broke up I helped her with her studies.

Now I've been feeling empty and disgusted. I question everything because I feel like I don't even deserve bare minimum things. Idk why tho. So I tried to get back into dating by online apps. Coz that's the only way I could meet/talk to anyone in this pandemic. Let's just say it was complete failure. A mixture of no matches and getting ghosted. Being ghosted hurts. It brings back all those feelings of abandonement. Like I feel like I'm unwanted. Exactly how I felt in my relationship.

I started talking to a cute girl in October but things aren't going anywhere. Because we can't find a chance to meet. We had planned previously like 5 times but she cancelled on me all 5 times. Due to very legitimate reasons. I dont blame her. But online conversations are difficult to keep up with. She doesn't really text much. I try my best to start topics but how much am I supposed to do? I asked her twice if she is interested and she said she is. I suggested that we should probably cancel meeting altogether but she said ""no we are not doing that I'm sorry I've cancelled too many times but we will meet"". She isn't being flaky for no reason. But idk what to do. I've texted her that if you think this is going anywhere we should meet or we should just call it quits.

I just feel so drained. Like I want someone. I haven't been touched in over a year. I want some touch. I feel like I deserve bare minimum things. I miss dating. I miss going out to different places to eat, to watch movies, cuddle in cinema, making out, staying in and watching a movie, cuddle, kiss, be goofy, be cute. I literally miss all of it. I am trying to find it again because I feel like I missed out on so much. But I can't find it. And I just feel so depressed when I see other people having fun relationships, irl and on Instagram. 

How does it feel to be wanted? To be desired? To have someone who will respond to you physically and emotionally? Does it feel good? Do you feel loved? Do you feel safe? I just don't think I'd ever find this.

I'm making this post because I've seen quite a few posts being made asking for advice when it comes to dating someone with a history of abuse and trauma. As someone who had a truamatic childhood and struggles with anxiety and low self-esteem, it was honestly kind og triggering to read a lot of comments advising OP to ditch their SO because there will be more problems down the line. While I can understand if the SO is being toxic and manipulative that it is perfectly okay and acceptible to leave them, I can imagine how damaging it will be if someone feels comfortable with sharing their trauma and is ditched right after because they have been deemed as mentally unstable. Look, if you can't handle being with someone with that kind of history or with a mental illness, and I understand that not everybody can, you can at least offer helping them find a therapist and other resources before leaving. That is the humane thing to do if you actually care about this person. 

Nobody should be held responsible for curing anybody, but it's blatant how stigmatized mental illness is when it comes to dating based on some of the extreme conclusions people on this sub come up with despite not being offered any additional information. I for one have been in and out of therapy and am currently on medication. My mental illness will likely never go away and will always be something I struggle with. Unless we are hurting others or are completely dysfunctional, telling us to get better before we date can be hurtful because some of these conditions are life-long. Am I supposed to just confine myself to never dating? If someone is understanding and supportive, and I use the correcting coping tools and respond/listen to their needs, i don't see why I can't be in a relationship. 

Nobody is perfect and everyone has things they can work on to improve. So, please stop labeling us as crazy and unstable and stop jumping to conclusions about what we will do and what we are capable of. And, anyone who is presently struggling with a mental illness, i just want you to know that you are worthy of love and a healthy relationship like everyone else. You are more than your illness. 

Please feel free to share your thoughts on this matter!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0lq68/dating_and_mental_illness/

The guy I’m talking to right now responds just to keep the conversation going. He said he’s reserved so it’s likely he wants me to take the lead.

I’m not sure if I should draw a line and just stop. I’m slowly loosing interest when I don’t want to. He asked me if I wanted to get to know him (I thought we were both getting to know each other) and I do so I said yeah I would like to get to know him (and responded to the rest of his messages). He then said “what do you want to know about me?” 

This was like half an hour ago. I have no idea what to say. Is he expecting an interview or…?

I have a feeling he wants me to take the lead. He has told him he’s not that talkative and reserved previous. The problem is I am too but I made the effort to speak to him (what helps is that I want to talk to him). I’m so confused, is this a sign to just stop now?

29,r0m919,1637698824,What would you do?,"I (29f) have had a crush on a guy at my gym for months. I noticed he’s social, and friendly and seems to know everyone there. I realized I’ll never meet him organically, or fast enough for my preference, so I approached him one day as we were leaving. “I see you say hi to everyone here except me so I thought I’d introduce myself. Hi, I’m **** “ he is of course, friendly and makes small talk for maybe all of 3 minutes before abruptly ending the conversation. He says, “it was nice to meet you. Say hi in there!” I walk away defeated because that read to me that he’s not interested. Next day I round the corner in the gym and it’s him. His face lights up in a genuine smile and he removed an earbud. I pull off my headphones we talk for 30seconds and he says “what are you working out? okay well better get to it before it gets too crazy in here!” 

I don’t see him for 3 days. Last night I get to the gym and find a rack. I get through my squats and set up for deadlifts. Guess who takes the empty stall next to me. It was most likely the only empty stall. He doesn’t make any eye contact or motion for a hello, what’s up- nothing. I did look at him but the look wasn’t returned so I say to myself “okay cool, he’s not feeling it today.” (Not out loud obviously.) The fact that he’s not acknowledging me is kind of disappointing I know I need to go refocus. I retract my weight and move to the turf on the other side of the gym. I’m super setting kettle ball Romanians with walking lunges. At one point in a particularly compromising position (think: 🥴) I look up and guess who’s walking past me to the water fountain? Only this time he happens to look down at the same time I look up and he gives me the weakest half grin I’ve ever seen. To which I give him the ugliest and widest smile I can muster. (Unintentionally of course.)

Beginning of 2021, he cheated on me with « one of his friends » and he just ghosted me without any explanation.
Got my shit together and didn’t ask for any closure, just moved on with my life.
Since we do less home office and he sees me more often at work, he has been acting weird, I am starting a new job and moving so he is trying to help me with the flat search, paperwork, give me advise. He also asked me to catch up for a drink, and he was kind of tactile (rubbing my back multiple times, hands on my shoulders while sitting...). He didn’t bring the breakup chapter tho.
For now I am carreer focused and not planning to take him back, but just wondering if he is being flirtatious or just wanting to clear the air and be friendly ?

My friends are either married or in long term relationships, but the same just hasn’t happened for me. I hate feeling like things are completely out of my control. Whether I was actively dating or not, the outcome remained the same, going through the motions just doesn’t feel worth my time and effort anymore.

Hi Everyone,Im John,Im 17 Years Old and i live in London.

Sorry For The Repetitive Text but i need your Help.

So I met a girl in the park in October of This Year, She was very cute (Blonde, Blue Dark Eyes, etc).

Her name is Caroline, she is 17 years old.

When one day i was coming back to home,I found her in the Park with a Friend .We talked and She asked-""How Can i be Fine if you are going away""And Asked to me""Can you sit next right to me""? but i couldnt because i was very busy in that day and have Friends at Home who need my help.

In Afternoon i was with a Friend and She asked me ""Why I Didnt sit with her in the Morning?"" and i Said to her""Because One Friend needed my Help in that day"".

Than in The Next Day i gave to her my phone number.

Than in Friday ,she asked to me if i would like to go out with her but I didn't want to leave but after 10 minutes I said I would go with her.

After 30 minutes I met her and a friend called Olivia in The Entrance of Waitrose &amp; Partners Supermarket.Her friend made me smell her hair and after That We talked a little and Her Friend was Like""You Like Her?"" or""What Is Your Heart Saying?"" And She was Like""Stop""

I dont know if was kidding.

So after that We Entered In The Supermarket Because They was hungry .

Than Her Friend said to her in Loud Voice i was going to buy to her Milka Heart Chocolate (but i didnt) and She was Very Happy and Kissed Me in The cheek and Her Friend said""Ahahahaha"" but i didnt buy because it wasnt available in that store so i bought to Kikat and Lays chips to Them.

Sometimes i send messages to her in Imessage and she answers me with short texts.

Onetime i Saw a Instagram Post saying Send This to A Cute Person and i sent to her like ""I saw this post and remember You"" and She Replied""Ahahaha 🥰 "".

But Onetime I sent a Instagram Post like(You are The Best Company)to her and She Saw But didnt Reply.

I have a friend who has her like Friend and He said to Me""I saw what you sent to her,did You Like Her"".

I asked her when we were going out and she says we had to see.

I said to her ,""When You want company at Lunch ,Send a Message to Me"" but at The Time She Didnt Send Me a Message and I see Her with Her Friends at Lunch Time sometimes.Sometimes I dont see her Everyone.

In November 25th makes 1 Month that I met her.

I want to ask her out because i feel like We are moving away and I dont Want that Because She Is Pretty Cool and I want to give to her the Milka Heart Chocolate she wanted i think. and Go out with her and have Her Company.

I dont Know if She Likes Me , IS She Likes Me??

Should i I ask her out??if yes,Should i say to her to call her friend to come too??Because in Last Exit ,her friend come with us and made She kissed Me Because She said i was going to Give to Her The Milka Heart Chocolate .

Im going to ask her out Tomorrow by Text after School but Tomorrow at 18h PM i have doctor's appointment so i can only have a 1 hour or 1/30 Minutes with her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0n34n/should_i_ask_her_outis_she_like_me/

I've come to accept this as fact.

I have some VERY horny friends, both male and female, who are okay with showing their naked bodies and aren't shy about it, all polyamorous, etc.

Well, I noticed something pretty simple: I honestly don't get horny from most people's nudity. This is more than just having a sex and then booking it, I may actually just waste time dating someone and then realize my body doesn't react the way I hope it might because oh no their nude body didn't hit all the check marks for my brain. That is how I wasted 4 hours during a threesome without finishing.

Now, if I imagine someone else, it works, but whoever I imagine is way above and beyond the average.

Clothing wise, I can never actually tell if someone is attractive to me under their clothes, so that's a no go.

43,r0nes3,1637701933,How do I cope with that I will always be alone?," 

Hi I'm 34 old virgin(M). I want to know how to accept that I will  forever be alone I will never meet woman who will find me attractive.  I'm not so short(185 cm), going gym 3 days a week, have good eating  habits etc.  Over the years I tried it all: cold approaches, meeting  through friends, hobbies, etc, OLD. It never works for me.   
 Cold approaches just end in a girl not interested so I wish a good day,  and go on my own business. Meeting through friends just never worked for  me. Hell even my best friend didn't wanted to make me  
 acquainted with any of girls he has been dating. He tells that was out  of fear that I somehow will seduce them. Most of dates I had been OLDs, I  usually get to date like 1-2 girl a week, but most times it end with  'How that happen that you are not in relationship? You are so nice guy,  but I don't feel it. Let's be friends.' And even this 'friends' think  mostly ends when  they find that I still try to date with someone or  they start dating other guy. I even asked such 'friends' when they told  me that we can't be friends after I mentioned that I meeted good girl  recently, they told me that we never was friends and they just wanted to  have me close as backup plan. I'm just tired of countless rejections in  a row. Most hard ones is when you meet, have similar tastes, hobbies,  good time together, meeting regularly for some time. You grow feeling  with time, then confess it to receive   
 'I don't want any relationship right now, and don't think will in near  future. I need to know person for way longer before I even consider  dating.'   
 and next week she introduce you to the guy she meet like two days ago  and they already dating. And like 'You both best people in my live I  hope we will hang out together from now on'.  
 I'm quite introverted so this all experience of getting to know people,  sharing past experience with each other, feeling some close connection  even just as friend, and then they just vanish into the void, is so soul  breaking for me. Right now I just fear to have feeling for anyone  because it will eventual end with rejection. Even catched myself on that  I even don't try to keep in mind think about a woman I'm chatting with,  I write down a notes.   
 From time to time I took big periods of not even trying dating and don't  thinking about it. It was usually a most worry free time in my life.   
 But right now I can't return to this mindset anymore. I tried discussing  this with close friends, most of them was like 'how is this  possible?'.  I'm tired of generic nonworking 'advice' people gives. I  tried nearly all of them. Except advice like 'why you even bother  knowing them first? If you see girl in club or bar you like, just go to  her hug and kiss her ' from some womans. I know that my inexperience in  such old age is deal breaker for most at this point. When I think about  it all it feels hopeless. Frustration about lack of close connection and  sex in my live just make me miserable, right now I'm feel like shadow  of myself. That's feels unbearable. I mostly write this to vent, but if  someone want to leave their thoughts, discuss, or will have really good  advice I will be glad.  
 pls don't write about 'numbers game', when you number of rejections is so high as mine it is extremely hard to believe.  
 And I know that it will be advice about mental therapy, I am looking for  one I can trust right now, because last one I been going to, laughed at  me when I told her about this, started bragging how she can find sex  with a girl in no time, and then I found that she been telling about  this to other people.

47,r0nmkr,1637702526,I want love but I am too scared to look for it,"26. year old female 

I never dated in high school 

I didn’t have my first date until I was 22. Ever since then, I tried the OLD thing and was only able to land three more dates (after several  failed attempts) until I met a guy named “Mark” last year. “Mark” and I only dated for five months and we broke up for several reasons (I.e., i don’t want kids while he does, he was emotionally absent and never once wanted to talk to me about his depression/mental health struggles while I am looking for a relationship based on emotional transparency, i was too clingy, too much physical distance between us, he was in the national guard and I was not ready for the stresses that came with that territory, he never wanted to talk about the future, and I was too pushy with trying to get him to be more emotionally vulnerable with me…..it was a mess). 

A few days after we broke up, I met a recovering alcoholic named “Luke”. Luke and I bonded over shared trauma and love for music. We even wrote some songs together and i felI so head over heels for him that I would do anything for him as long as it was legal and safe. I asked him if he was interested but he friendzoned me and recently started dating another boy (he is bisexual). And despite how jealous, sad, and hurt I felt…..I still kept that pain to myself because I still value his friendship very much and still wanted to have him in my life somehow .

I then tried my best to move on from Luke and took a shine to a coworker named “Steve” but he tuned down my invitation
for a date. I then later found out that he probably turned  me down because he’s rumored to be fucking my boss. it’s just rumors at this point but I don’t know what he would see in her if it is true. She’s twice his age, is mediocre looking, is arrogant, and runs the company like a tyrant. And no…..i am not saying this out of jealousy because I had those thought about her looooooong before I heard those rumors. She’s always been the kind of manger who looks down at us with snide remarks of and writes us up for simply telling Karen’s that masks are required in the building….despite that being company policy to begin with .

I already felt insecure about my desirability because of all the high school rejections, the failed first four dates, and the ghosting in between. And Being rejected by both Luke and Steve back to back made me even more insecure and I sort of developed a defeatist attitude that says, “no one is gonna want to be my life partner so why bother?”

But I still can’t deny that I am very lonely. I even cried to Luke about how badly I want a boyfriend and asked what it is that I lack. He said that he doesn’t think I lack anything but I don’t buy it. After all, why would he reject me if that wasn’t the case?

My own mother even said that nobody will want marry me and I’m starting to believe that she was right….",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0nmkr/i_want_love_but_i_am_too_scared_to_look_for_it/

57,r0ogm3,1637704787,How do I initiate the “defining the relationship” talk?,"I (26f) have been dating/hanging out with a guy (29m) for 3 months now. In the beginning we saw each other multiple times a week but once his grad school started back and he got busy with work we stopped seeing each other as frequently but he would still take me to lunch during the week because our offices are super close. 

We hung out 2 weeks ago at his place I made dinner and then we watched a movie and I tried initiating the convo but ended just asking if he was hooking up with any one else. It went as follows:

Me: “So, I just want to do a pulse check. Are we both only hooking up with each other?”

Him: “uh, yea I’m not sleeping with anyone else. If you want to hookup with other people that’s fine but I’m not and I don’t have the time anyway. I’m sorry I know I’ve been shitty and haven’t been around much.”

I’m hoping I made it clear to him that I don’t want to see other people and I understand that he’s been busy and I’m not upset about it.


I’m completely new to dating and 3 months is the longest I’ve ever gone talking to a guy and I’m an over thinker, so of course this left me questioning our future more than before. 


Tbf in the beginning he said he was looking for a casual relationship because he’s so busy and I was ok with that because I wasn’t expecting more than a few dates (I didn’t think we would have much in common) and I’m still ok with it being casual , but I do hope that since he’s completing his final semester of school he’ll be open to something more serious. 

We might hang out Saturday and I would just feel better if I knew exactly how he viewed our relationship. I’d feel better knowing if he also thought we could be bf and gf. I how do I bring this up in a mature way without sounding clingy or naggy?
 
Also, I feel like I should add that he’s the first person I’ve slept with, so that’s why I’m a little afraid of coming across as clingy. I don’t want him to think that I think we have to be together because he “took” my virginity.

61,r0om95,1637705189,Is it a bad idea to not wear makeup for a date with someone I very recently became exclusive with?,"So this is just me overthinking, but I have a date tonight with a guy I met very recently and we pretty quickly became exclusive/bf and gf. He has seen me without makeup because we’ve slept at each other’s houses etc. And I know he personally substantially prefers people who look natural and unconventional to people who look perfect and conventionally pretty (I truly believe he feels this way, it fits with a lot about him). 

I have pretty bad skin at the moment but he says he likes it/doesn’t mind it. It’s a lot better off if I don’t wear concealer so it can heal (it’s in the process of getting better). 

The big thing is that tonight I’m going over to his place and I don’t really want to wear makeup. I have put a tiny bit of concealer on under my eyes but I think I look okay without makeup? Idk. He saw me this morning lol and I had smudged makeup from the night before. 

I feel like if he likes natural looks more then he probably will prefer me without makeup? If I just had better skin I’d feel less self conscious… sigh.


Guys (especially ones who prefer people who are more natural), what do you usually think about a girl not wearing makeup? We aren’t going out or anything. And/or I guess are there any girls with advice about makeup? 

I’m honestly not the biggest fan of wearing it and I used to never wear it and like- I do hate the way it feels on my face. If only my skin looked better I think I wouldn’t be super worried. But idk I just am worried I’ll look old or sick or like I am not putting effort in. I’m 19 so I’m not actually old, but idk.

I guess you could put it lamely by saying that it just doesn’t fell right and like something’s missing. We have fun when we hang out and we’ve been sexual with each other, but still.

We haven’t had the talk about wether we’re dating other people or not (I’m not), but he’s already at the point where if I get a text he asks me who it’s from. To the point where he stopped in the middle of sex to ask me to check who texted me. He also asks me about my guy friends and if there is, or ever was anything between us. 

There is also a component where I feel we’re not very sexually compatible as we need and feel comfortable with different things. 

He’s really sweet and at times a bit to much. He tells me several times a day how amazing I am and how lucky he is, but gets irritated if I don’t say it back. Usually I could respond with a “thanks” or “yes” just to please him as I was not comfortable with such statements yet.

64,r0oy5w,1637706120,"Abnormal PAP smears are common for women, and are not an indicator that someone is irresponsible with their sexual health.","Shame around abnormal pap smears is a dating insecurity I see on Reddit a lot. As a woman who has had one herself, as a result of her FIRST sexual interaction at 17... it was both extremely jarring and left me feeling embarrassed, ashamed, and disgusted with myself to the point where it affected my ability to feel like a worthy partner for someone again.

Some fast facts.

\- Men don't/can't get tested for HPV (at least in Canada) and therefore are often ignorant to whether they are carriers of one of the hundreds of strain of HPV (yes, its more than just genital warts, and the ones that cause pre-cancerous cells are asymptomatic).

\-The Gardasil vaccine was not widely available for men until recent years, and it was only available to women up to the age of 26(ish) when i was in highschool. I'm 30 now, and thankfully it is available to women between the ages of 9-46, and also men... although even my little brothers hadn't heard about it and they are both still in high school. It only protects you from the most common strains, so you can still get an abnormal smear. It's a common misconception that this vaccine protect you from ALL HPV strains. It protects you from the most common ones. 

\- Most abnormal paps and precancerous changes are due to HPV. There are few exceptions to this. I tried asking my doctor if it could have been from something else. 

\-I managed to pay for it through my extended health care, but it is expensive ($600 for me, 3 doses between 1,3 and 6 months). I can't comment on how expensive it is in the USA. However, it protects you from the most common and high risk strains (AKA cancer causing ones and genital warts) which is why its worth it. I don't know much about Cervarix, feel free to share info you might have on this.

\-When you have ""pre-cancerous cells"" on the cervix, it is usually classified as either LSIL or HSIL (ASCUS is also VERY common, perhaps the most common, but involves a bit more digging as it can be just a yeast infection, inflammation, or super mild cervical changes) I cannot count the amount of times I've read a post where people automatically assume they have cancer when they get LSIL or HSIL... and I don't blame them, even the word 'pre-cancer' makes your stomach drop. However, the majority of young women will clear the LSIL (low grade cells) in two years, and while the HSIL (high grade cells) tend to be monitored more closely, they also tend to clear within a similar time line. Typically they don't do HPV testing for women under 30 because the expectation is for the cells to be gone in a couple years anyways, women over 30 will get testing done, particularly if the cells stick around. But again, its seriously a miracle we have this preventative testing, so take advantage of it. 

**-** Roughly 14 million people becoming newly infected each year with one strain or another. Most men and women — about 80 percent of sexually active people — are infected with HPV at some point in their lives, but most people never know they have the virus. 

\- Smoking increases your risk of cancer developing. It's just a terrible habit in general for your health.  Stop smoking.

\- PAP smears are IMPORTANT. Cervical cancer doesn't appear out of nowhere, its slow growing cancer... over the course of 10-15 years. Its better to have LSIL/HSIL (CIN1/CIN2/CIN3) than to ignore testing (there are no symptoms when it comes to an abnormal smear) and deal with consequences later down the line. Procedures can be done to get rid of the more aggressive cells, and your ability to have children will be preserved. This is not the case if cancer develops as its common to suggest a radical hysterectomy. 

MOST IMPORTANTLY: An abnormal pap smear does not mean you are dirty and reckless. It does not mean you are irresponsible. It does not mean you are worthless. Men, educate yourself on the fact that you could be a carrier and never know it, therefore it is always a good idea to wrap up outside of a committed relationship, even if it's not the preferred option for you and doesn't feel as nice. If your girlfriend has an abnormal smear, it doesn't mean she was unfaithful, and it doesn't mean anything about her character, these cells can stick around for years. If she has to get a LEEP or a colposcopy, she will need support. It is an unpleasant experience overall. Women, remind yourself of how common this is... and how likely it is that your body will do its job and give you the normal PAP smear result you want again soon. Don't feel ashamed in asking a partner to wear a condom. While they aren't a 100% guarantee, they still help.

 Most importantly, there are many MANY women in the same boat, and you are not alone. I repeat, you are not alone.

About 3 of the guys I’ve actually become friends with. I was debating on deleting the app because TBH I found people I already liked. But, this one guy comes around and he is eager to meet up for coffee. I seriously thought this meant like maybe a 30 minute date. So, I said “sure” let’s do it.. WHY NOT right??? So, we meet up in person.. and the first thing he says is “oh sh*t” not really the most gentlemen approach to meeting me. But whatever LMAO. So, we sit for coffee, he seems nice. Then, he ask to go on a WALK. Now, this is where things get weird. On our walk he keeps asking me questions, (honestly Im not really an open person but I think I was just talking because I was nervous…. )I mean how could I not, I’m on a trail by myself with a strange man(who’s older than me). He then starts asking me questions about POLITICS.. he wanted to know everything about my political views. And, I was not comfortable with this AT ALL. I mean I don’t even know him. **AND IT iS A FIRST DATE***. He then goes on to ask me “if I ever go on walks” and “I don’t look like a person who goes on walks”. I’m pretty sure that was code for *You seem out of shape*. BC this man literally had me going on a 3 hour WALK. Yes that’s right, this **WALK WAS SO LONG. ** He then started asking to see me again later this week… I said probably not because it’s Thanksgiving…. Also, because I was so uncomfortable. Then he was like “YOU SEEM like you’ve had your life handed to you on a silver spoon”. *Meaning he thought I was some rich girl… *I’m like okie hahha.. more weird things to say on the first date.

All that walking, and personal interrogation.. JUST FOR HIM TO SAY “EHHHH”. What I have learned from this experience, is that I should definitely message a person longer before I meet them.. so, I’m more comfortable. Also, I will never let my first date be a walk AGAIN WTF.

I've been on Hinge for a couple of months now and I'm starting to get frustrated. I'm lucky in the sense that I usually get one or two matches a day, which is really good considering I'm picky. Half of the time, these girls will even send a really nice first message but that's where it always ends. I message them back and nothing happens. They never respond after that. It doesn't matter how interesting or engaging my message is or if I end it with a question. Always ignored. I've even had my girl friends go through my inbox and read my Hinge messages to try and figure out what I was doing wrong. They said everything was normal and I was completely fine.

So what's the point of reading a guy's profile, liking his picture and sending him a really nice first message if you're just going to ignore him after that? If this only happened every once in awhile, I wouldn't think anything of it. But it happens to me about every other day. 

Is this normal on Hinge?

90,r0rhfq,1637713329,Why he takes off his tshirt in front of me unexpectedly when I go to his house?,"So I've been seeing casually this guy and a couple of times , when I was at his house,  he would take off his tshirt in front of me telling me that he did a hair removal on his chest area and now looks so good and told me to touch him and the other time while taking off his tshirt , was talking about hiw much he works out and that he started getting shredded. 

Honestly I do find him attractive,  but I dont find it so impressive at all,  he has a nice body , handsome guy but have been with even fitter and taller / maybe even more handsome guys. 

The last time I saw him,  I told him I wasn't into sex that day and even if he initially tried to changed my mind many times, in the end he suggested to just come there just to see each other , talk and cuddle but I've noticed that he has done this thing and loves to showing his body in front of me ,in times out of the blue when I dont expect it , he will just stand up and take off his shirt.
Also I've noticed that one day after I saw him, changed his viber pic that previously wasn't even showing him but a boat , now he changed his viber profile pic showing him the upper part of his body without clothes, head raised and basically a selfie in what seems like a bathroom or sauna/spa.

Never had physical relationship. Wanted to marry her and it was her decision to do it only after. 

Everything was perfectly alright until i moved to London for my higher studies. Slowly things got worse and we had to come to an end. :')

I made new friends in here. Some of my female friends proposed me and i rejected them saying i dont feel for you like that way then they badly wanted to know why am I still single and why don't i have anybody in my life.

I had to tell them the truth and everything. Thought I'll get their sympathy now and they won't talk about these things. But now they want to set me up with almost any random girl, today during the class my friend Y, she downloaded tinder on my phone and started liking all the girls.😄😅 (my friends are crazy idiots😂)  
Instantly got some like backs and texts, she started giving away my contact details but none of them were like serious. 
And even i didn't find it interesting. It seems as if all of them wants quick/boom boom and bye bye🤣

I somehow still think I'm not over her yet and I'm gonna die alone with her memories 😇

98,r0s1zk,1637714991,Did she(f18) play me(m18) or is there still a “chance?”,"So this is a long story to get the main situation..

It all started in sophomore year of high school, she was the new kid in school and barely knew anyone. We never talked to each other, but we did have a class together. The reason why we started talking is she became friends with another girl I was friends with. The three of us went out for a small birthday celebration, that’s when we started talking more. 

Nothing really changed between us until halfway through senior year of high school. 

I came back to my school after leaving for that semester to take college courses and online high school classes. She was excited I came back, including a lot of other her and my friends. I got back on the school tennis team and started practicing again with my old teammates that didn’t graduate last year. I jokingly asked her to join the team and she said she would join with me. At the time, nothing really seemed special between me and her so I never really thought of us being in a “relationship.” When she joined and we started hanging out more, I started to like her more. We would always practice tennis outside of school every week and just have fun. After awhile, we started going to activities together and going to restaurants. 

This is where the story takes a turn.

After graduation, we had a lot of free time. Every week I went to her house and watched her favorite movies and shows. The first couple weeks were just me and her sitting there watching the tv and us talking. After a while, she started laying on me and touching me; which caught me off guard. Probably a month in, she was literally on me and and rapping her arms around my body. At one point, she literally grabbed my hand and put it on her ass. That night of the ass touching, we both went outside so she could say bye to me when I was leaving, and we did a 30-60 second tight hug, which was kinda awkward since I’m quite a bit taller than her. She also brought me around her family and her mom and dad loved me. Her dog also LOVED me, it was hilarious. She’s also in pageants and won the city last year and she was competing for state queen. I promised that I would go but something came up and it made it where I couldn’t see her preform. So I got her a small gift for what she did, and it was a cameo of one of her favorite actress’s congratulating her on what she did. When she saw it, she almost cried. 

After the gift, was when I gained up the courage to tell her my feelings. She did say that she cared also but since we were going to colleges that are pretty far apart from each other. Which I understood, I was in a long distance relationship at one point and it fell apart. So do you guys think I still have a chance or was she playing me in some small way? The thing that stings about it if she was playing me is that she seemed like the one. Whenever I tried to talk to other girls after her, I would grow disinterested with any other girl because they weren’t her. She was the perfect girl I was looking for; funny, smart; likes to play video games, same religious standpoint, and same political views. I know this is surface level but she is beautiful and she would always complain about her “assets” but I thought her body was perfect the way it was. I’m not a fan of girls having big “assets.”",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0s1zk/did_shef18_play_mem18_or_is_there_still_a_chance/
