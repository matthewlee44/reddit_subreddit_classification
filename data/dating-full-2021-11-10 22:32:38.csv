I don't know ANYTHING about dating. I have recently tried to start dating and have been making a consistent effort on the apps, asking friends to set me up, etc. because since I was 20 I really have wanted to be with someone (I am a very late bloomer lol). Lots of reasons why I haven't yet including low self esteem, immigrant family, hyperfocused on school/work, going to uni in a pretty racist place, etc etc 

I'm trying to find someone I want to date but so far it hasn't happened. and I can't help but think - is this even worth it?? I've lived without ever having someone like me/have a crush on me, without ever having a partner, without ever even being touched - do I really need to keep trying so hard? I do think I want this - I get really lonely and sad sometimes and I am now comfortable with myself and I think I have a lot to offer in a relationship. And the rest of my life is going pretty well, I finally feel like I have the capacity to think about this. But at the same time I keep thinking maybe I should stop trying because if it hasn't happened yet, maybe it's just not for me and I should focus on things that I can actually succeed at (like more career stuff, my friendships, etc - although all my friends are in relationships now so I don't see them as much anyway/they have other priorities). 

I might take a break from this but I don't know if it should be forever lol. Does dating really making your life better? My guess is yes because people focus so much on it and all my friends seem so much happier now that they're in relationships and it would be cool to matter to someone after all my friends have moved on and it would be cool to be a priority in someone's life... but really does it matter???? I know I'm responsible for my own happiness and I do a pretty good job of managing that, wouldn't put that responsibility on another person, but does it enhance your happiness or wellbeing to be with someone???

There is a girl in two of my classes (we're both 16), and I realize I have a bit of a crush on her. So I start to pay attention to her out of the corner of my eye, and I realize she stares back, and quite frequently. Her eyes will linger for a moment if she turns her head, she'll glance over, and glance again shortly after, she'll look over after laughing with friends, she'll look over her shoulder if she passes me in the hall, and sometimes she'll just stare for a few seconds.

We'll make eye contact a few times each class, and usually she looks away quickly. I try to never stare directly at her, I only look at her if I think she's looking first, so I'm not creepy.

I see this, and I go over to her table in physics, as I have some friends there and we are allowed to move around for assignments. We have to explain to the class how to do problems on the assignment, and the first day when I asked if I should stay or go back to my other seat, she's the first one to tell me to stay. I had a friend invite me over one class, and she was leaning over the table to see if I was coming or not. There is another girl at the table, and whenever the other girl was talking, she would glance back at me repeatedly to see how much I was listening to the other girl, and seemed slightly put off if I was. There also was a time where a sub said my last name wrong (it's polish so it's spelled weird), and she noticed and made a comment about it. I wasn't at her table when the sub said it wrong, so she was paying attention to me even when I wasn't over there and enough to know the correct pronunciation. We could make good conversation, I could get her to laugh, and we do have a good deal in common. She is a shy person, she sometimes talks really quietly, but she never really was shy around me.

So, at this point all I see are signs she's interested. I ask for her number one thursday, and immediately text her so she has my number. That weekend I text her about soccer, as we both play soccer. No response. I checked with a mutual friend and it is the correct number, but that friend said that on occasion she hasn't gotten a response either. The issue is, we moved seats and she no longer sits with friends so I don't have an excuse to go and talk to her. A week after, I managed to catch her after class and I asked her why she didn't respond. She said she was at a soccer game so she couldn't respond, but she did apologize quite a bit.

The really weird thing is that that week and the week after she was staring more than usual. There was a time when my group was behind her group, and she repeatedly looked over her shoulder back at my group, and when I moved behind her other shoulder she started looking over that shoulder. In the first class, whenever she gave thoughts on a poem she was looking at me out of the corner of her eye and not the at teacher, and she did that every time she gave thoughts to the class last week. She would look at the floor in front of me when she presented in physics, and she would lean over her table to watch my group present, and she wouldn't do that for other groups. She also was glancing over more frequently, and sometimes would turn her head, linger on me for a moment, and then look at something completely unrelated to the class like a wall behind her. She also would mess with her hair a few times each class, and straighten up her clothes when she presented in physics. Even today, she was leaning over her friend repeatedly to take a look.

I only see two options, and neither make sense.

She's interested, but shy. This explains the staring, but not the texting.

She's just being nice, which explains the texting, but not the staring.

So idk wth to do, I'd talk to her about it but it's unlikely we'll end up nearby for the next two days, and I don't have a guarantee she'll respond to another text. I'm sick of thinking about this, so I was thinking about texting her tonight, to ask her if she didn't respond because she doesn't want me to text her, but i'd rather do it in person.

Last weekend we were on the same cottage and there she was. Between this time we didn’t talk to each other. She had broken up with my old classmate a long time ago and is now single.

I'm only interested in short-term dating since I'm not going to be in the area for very much longer, and she goes back to Italy in March.

It started about \~6 months ago, we did aerial dancing together where I pick her up and swing her around. She laughed and giggled her ass off, even the instructor pointed it out. 

We went out to brunch and did yoga together. After that, I asked her for a ""date"" with a plan, and she countered with a different plan, but in the same text told me ""My heart belongs to someone else.""

I never heard her say anything about a SO and we've danced together for awhile now... I expected to see him at the event she invited me to, but it was only her. We danced and had a fantastic time.

That was several months ago. She visited Italy for a couple months and came back last month. When we met at the next dance class, she jumped with glee onto me yelling my name... I asked her how the trip was and she never once mentioned having someone there, or brought with her. Recently, we chatted at a dance, and I asked her to go see a romantic play with me, and she eagerly accepted. I told her I'd purchase the tickets and she agreed to pay me back.

I told her I would pick her up at 13:00. The day of the play, I texted her at around 10:30 asking if we're still good for the show. No response... I didn't think too much about it until around 12:30 when I still had no response! I started to panic. 12:59 she responds ""Yes, hahaha, sorry I didn't see this.""

Why such a late response...?

I pick her up and I asked her what she did that day, and she told me she was cleaning and rearranging her wardrobe for winter and that's why she didn't see my text, even though I didn't mention it...

After the play I asked if she'd like to go around the corner for a bite, she told me she's going to have a big dinner and I said ""Oh, well we don't have to then"" and she insisted we still go. At the place, we talked for just shy of 2 hours and in our conversation she mentioned she has a date that evening...

Get to my car and she has the audacity to ask me to drive her to the place! I thought wow... You're really doing this to me.

Get to to this cafe, park on the side, and she isn't getting out... I look at her and she asks me to come inside. I tell her I have to go find a parking spot then, I'll meet her inside, and she insisted she goes inside with me.

We get inside, and it's her friends. She meant a date with her friends... No boyfriend there.

Talked with them, had a good time, they mentioned they were going to a restaurant afterwards and I'm invited, but I had to decline because I had a different thing that evening. They tried to persuade me but I couldn't. I left shortly after.

Once I returned home I texted her telling her I enjoyed everything. She told me she did too and also said we should go watch a musical next time. I agreed and told her not to text me at the very last minute next time lol.

My question is *what do I do?* I want to ask her about 'this lucky guy who has her heart,' but that's not smooth or anything. Is she playing with me? Was the boyfriend going to be at the restaurant and it was actually a date? Was that just her friendly way of rejecting me? I've glanced at her phone before and there's a picture of her next to a guy, I'm guessing her BF, but why never a word about him to anybody?

I was really busy and also getting over an ex boyfriend so I ended up not responding to him at one point. About two months later, he randomly added me on Snapchat to get my attention. We started talking and made plans to hang out.

Long story short things started moving really fast. There was some love bombing it seemed like, he would just tell me over the top romantic things when we barely knew each other. Maybe he was genuinely just infatuated with me, but I have a theory he's a narcissist. Anyway, we ended up having a miscommunication and I told him we shouldn't keep talking because I was overwhelmed by it all. I'm also in school and I work so dating is hard for me right now.

I regretted my decision because I actually liked him so I reached back out to him. He welcomed me back into his life with open arms. We started texting a lot and made plans to hang out. The day of our plans he ended up disappearing for like 3 hours at night and I was really upset because I had a 9am class the next day and couldn't wait all night for him. I told him we shouldn't talk and he left me alone. Then, 2 weeks later, he was the one to reach out to me, asking to see me. We made plans to hang out and it actually happened. I told him we can only be FWB and to not text me. Of course, he ended up texting me twice, to check on me and to make other plans.

We made plans for today and he's been MIA all day. He texted me at 10AM saying he's free all day and asking if we can hang out and I said yes hours ago and nothing. It's almost 6PM now. This is a pattern with him, he disappears during the day and then reappears at night. He'll either text me back within literal seconds or take hours to reply. I don't know whats going on. There are things about him that don't add up. He quit his job but still somehow makes enough money to live alone in a very nice apartment. He promoted a private snap (for nude pictures of himself) on his Twitter and posts lewd content on other social media apps. When I asked him about this he denied it. My friend has a theory that he's a p\*rn star. Because Im pretty sure he told me he's not working and only doing real estate school but I texted him yesterday and he said he was ""working"" and couldn't use his phone at work.

So I met this girl through friends, she was hot (30F) and I could tell she was really into me (39m) from when we first me (I had a GF at the time). I met her two kids at a party and they were well behaved and seemed to really like me even though I didn’t make an effort. She’s been divorced 4 years and doesn’t talk shit about her ex which is a good sign. 

The first red flag was that her bff mentioned that she’s always in toxic relationships and she’s actually in serious debt despite having many $10-$15k designer bags and an $80k bmw truck. A couple months after meeting her she actually asked me to hang over text shortly before I was about to. 

So first date went well (a month ago), tons of chemistry/attraction, the bouncer told us to “keep it pg” cuz we were making out a lot lol.  we slept together, she slept over, we spent the next day together getting to know each other and sleeping together some more. 2nd date she takes me to a fancy place for my bday, insisted on paying the bill which must’ve been over $200. I think we hung out once more before I went to a retreat/vacation for a week. She offered to take a break from woek to drive me to the airport and to pick me up at midnight the following Friday when I got back. 

So we were texting everyday, I’m excited ab getting to know her better. Lots of deep conversations, she told me some personal thing she said she never told anyone before (came up naturally I’ve been spiritual lately). Seemed genuine at the time but maybe she was just love bombing m?

I got back from the vacation/retreat and now everything seemed normal but ever so slightly off. I thought it was weird she didn’t invite me to a party she went to considering she was acting as if I was like “the one” lol. Then the next week she said she didn’t have her kids over the weekend (implying in my mind “let’s hang”) then she said on Thurs she did have them. She says cute things throughout the week like “miss you” “thinking of you” etc.  Sat morning we swap funny pics on snap, I suggest we make plans for the following weekend and she says her kids are gone for the day (that day, implying she’s around to hang) I say I’ll call her in a bit then she says she’ll call me in an hour. 4 hours later she never calls, I ask if she’s alive and she says she fell asleep. I ask if she still wants to hang and she never responds (weird).

Next day I meet my buddy to hang and apparently she told her bff who told him “I dunno why he’s still texting me” “it’ll just fizzle out I’m sure”. Bff says she’s all about games and drama, the thrill of finding new guys..

She had given no overt indication that she wasn’t into me as much anymore I was shocked when I heard this. 

It’s been three days and we haven’t spoken but we’ll probably either cross paths again or meet up to hook up or something.

But so now I’m wondering if it’s all in my head; was I being manipulated the whole time or was she genuinely super into me and I was just a little to excited(clingyish) and she lost some attraction? Regardless she def should’ve been more open ab how she felt right? Def feel like she was stringing me along; “miss you” meanwhile She was telling her friend “he’s still texting me?” Maybe it’s just normal dating drama I dunno. I kinda had a bit of a “whipped” vibe I guess but seemed less than what she was throwing my way. 

So did I get played out or maybe she’s just shy and afraid to tell me to pump the brakes or something? She told me she’s all about honesty etc. I dunno I feel like I was used to make her feel better or something.

My mom had a serious problem with smoking - all sorts of things. I made it a rule not to enter a relationship with people that had toxic/unhealthy habits. But things *were* really good, and he did say that he wouldn't force me or push me to smoke, so am I being silly in breaking things off? 

In the back of my mind I keep thinking that maybe I won't find anyone else. That he was the good one, and that I'm being silly. But he kept information from me, since I asked when we first me if he smoked (cigarettes) and he said no.

So that Friday (3days later) I ask him what he is up to and he tells me he is going to his parents house (1 hour away) but he will tell me if he comes back into town Saturday. So Saturday evening roles around and I end up seeing snap chats on his story of him currently at a concert, so he is back in town? The concert was over at 10pm and a few minutes later I get 2 calls and text from him. I end up ignoring him bc I’m a little upset he didn’t tell me as soon as he knew he would be in back in town.  Then throughout the night he keeps calling me and texting me. 

2-The next morning (Sunday) I reply that I was sorry I wasn’t responding but we should get together soon. He then invites me over to his place to spend the night I reply that I can come and then he replies that he just remembered he has to be at work super early the next day and asks if we can do tomorrow night instead bc that may be better for us? I say sure. 

3-So then the following evening  comes and he ends up texting me that he is sick and asks if we can potentially do Wednesday instead bc he is about to go to bed early bc he feels like shit. I tell him that Wednesday should work. So that was Monday evening and now it is Wednesday and I haven’t heard from him. 

What is going on? Is this guy not really wanting to see me? He has been acting very interested but this past week he has canceled 3 times? I know Saturday night I ignored him but I don’t get why he keeps making plans but then cancelling? I get if he is sick this week but still he could at least tell me that tonight?

**1. I'm too friendly, even from the start.**

- Don't open up too much. Try and keep things on the surface. I know you want to just unload all your quirks and little secrets that makes you... you, but you just met this person. You need to build tension and create some mystery. If you're going to be way too open and tell them all about you without them asking or showing interest... it just makes you seem desperate. (A good friend is always a treasure, but not a 'fake' friend who'll do or say ""nice"" things in order to get into her pants, that is just a desperate ""friend"". Don't be that.)

**2. Unaware/unclear or afraid of what I want and unable to ask for it properly.**

- Be clear and assertive with your needs and wants. Don't be afraid to say what you want. Everyone wants something/someone, and you need to be clear with yourself and put your intentions and interests out there clearly. Practice saying these things to yourself and actually ask people out, fail and try not to repeat the same mistake. Recognize the pattern first. Don't push/force too much. Just ask once, if they're interested they'll reciprocate otherwise don't be push them to go out with you etc. (This is easier said than done. But I'll keep trying.)

**3. I'm always there for them.**

- This add to my first point (or issue), but always take care of your priorities first. You can always reschedule or pick up a new time or place to meet, or help them later AFTER what you're doing is done. If you're free go for it, but if not... YOU come first. (No puns intended)

-------------------------

Well, I'm sure there are a lot more things to add to this list but for now I can only disappoint myself so much, haha. Anyways, it was painful to confront myself and my shortcomings like this... putting it out there in public but I'm on a journey to improve myself for my own good and this is necessary.

She has incredible hobbies, super smart, and emotionally healthy. She is incredibly attractive, but she's had terrible full-blown acne (for over a year now) that I have an incredibly difficult time ignoring.

I feel terrible writing about this since it's something outside of her control and considering how awesome she is as a person, but I notice that my attraction for her decreases significantly because of her acne. When I first met her, her amazing personality overshadowed the acne, but as I've spent more time with her, it's become something that I've tried to ignore and tried to focus on her other numerous positives, but I ultimately can't help but get a visceral reaction each time I see her acne.

 It's crazy because I know I would find her to be an absolutely gorgeous person without her acne. On occasion, there are days where it's mild and I find myself absolutely attracted to her, but those days are rare. She'll even show me photos of when she was in college/high school and I absolutely marvel at how beautiful her skin was and how beautiful she was as a person. Again, i truly feel terrible even having these thoughts considering how awesome she is underneath.

She still has an incredible body, we have amazing sex, and connect deeply on an emotional level. But no matter how hard i try, it's difficult for me to ignore the acne issue and I can also sense that my decreasing attraction is harming the relationship and I'm not giving the same attention I was in the beginning and I'm getting questionable thoughts like, ""oh, i hope she changes soon so her acne disappears like when she was in college."" And on the flip side, she absolutely deserves to be with someone that fully loves her inside and out, and I feel like I would be doing her a disservice by continuing the relationship.

Acne can be a pretty sensitive topic and I know she's tried multiple skin care products, but it seems like it's something that might be a long-term issue, but I'm also (maybe foolishly) clinging to the possibility that her acne resolves itself.

Obviously, physical attraction is necessary in a relationship, but in situations where the attraction is impeded due to a potentially temporary condition (like acne), is it a sign that I should cut my losses and end the relationship if my reaction to the acne issue doesn't get better or am I being a shallow idiot for leaving such an otherwise amazing girl and not supporting her/sticking it out?

TL;DR My otherwise supportive and amazing partner has terrible acne that decreases my attraction for her (despite my efforts to focus on her numerous positives) and my lack of attraction is ultimately affecting the relationship too. Since acne is often a temporary condition, I'm wondering if it'd be best for me to leave this relationship or if I should stick it out (considering i love all other aspects of her).",False,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125462,public,self,I (26M) experiencing decreased attraction due to GF's (24F) acne and it's affecting the relationship.

We work in the same place with telemarketing and we know each other better because we were part of the same training group, it's a very relaxed and easy place to make friends and meet other people.  We've known each other for a few months, but I feel like she's the kind of person I won't meet again.  We talk alone a few times, she always seems more comfortable talking to me when there's someone close, but she seems to avoid me when we're alone.  she seemed very curious to meet me and sought some information even from friends of mine about me.  We have a lot of compatible tastes and usually say we're pretty much the same, I think because we both have ADHD, but she seems more open about talking about it.  I saw that she started to show signs that she liked me, she always turned red when I looked at her, we had a lot of fun with her teaching me how to draw, there were some moments when we looked at each other without deviating and not caring that the other notices, but I think I blew it in a certain day.  That day we were on a quiet Sunday at work and I saw that she was behind me at my desk, thinking and quite nervously tapping her name tag if she should talk to me, I was going to say hi to her, but she walked away fine fast, in the last few days i had heard her lie to some friends that i was her boyfriend and how much we did things together, she got to the point of going with an outfit pretty much the same as i sometimes wore and saying ""i like a lot of wearing my boyfriend's clothes"" to her friends, I don't know if this was all a joke about me or if she really likes me, but it gave me more courage to talk to her.  I wrote her a poem with an effort not to look simple and on the way out I said I liked her and how much I admired her and then I handed her a poem, she seemed very surprised at the situation and rejected me saying she had a boyfriend.  A few days later her best friend said that she didn't have a boyfriend and that she thought we were very compatible, I tried to avoid her a little because I felt ashamed, she tried to look for me and wanted to talk to me, she had said that we don't. she knew her well enough to get close like that and that I made her very uncomfortable with the situation, she thought I knew a lot of her stuff without ever telling her, but those things that I had written in the poem I tried to guess seeing her personality, so feeling ashamed I apologized to her and avoided her.  When we're in a group and I say a word she joins the conversation right away, but when we're alone she seems pretty closed she even looks like she's mad at me, when I say ""hi"" she seems to walk away pretty closed, I think she feels uncomfortable with me and must hate me.  Lately I've been seeing her less often as our schedule has changed a bit, but I keep thinking about her and I don't know what she should think about me after all this situation, she's someone very absent-minded, sometimes quite rude without she see, she has some pimples and skin problems, she doesn't have a body that fits popular beauty standards and she's not the most feminine person, although that might repel other men I think that makes her unique, but I think I screwed it up wanting to hurry things, she must think I'm the kind of person who says that to any woman, but I'm kind of introverted and putting all those words out and writing a poem just embarrasses me when I see her, but I think now she think I'm ridiculous and I don't know what to do

We had four very good dates. On our last one this weekend, we talked about what we were looking for. I was really clear that I didn't want to move in and get a dog with anyone, but it is still really important to me to have an emotional connection beyond a sexual one and a level of trust and conversation. (And I do think we've had that, we always go out somewhere for dinner and talk for a few hours before going back to my place or his.) 

His response was, ""okay, yeah, so something casual."" I *assumed* he meant casual dating, not casual sex, since we're always going out and it was clear I wasn't just looking for casual sex, but I guess I'm not 100% sure. He said that he is moving in 6 months and doesn't see himself getting into something really serious for that reason but he gets the emotional connection aspect I was talking about. I agreed I wasn't looking for a super long-term relationship at the moment, which I'm not, although that also doesn't mean I'm looking for casual sex.

Everything seemed normal after that, he texted the next day to say it was great to see me. I said it was great to see him too and I was just thinking of him. He was like ""Ooh, what about me haha"" and I assumed he was flirting so I said back ""do you \*really\* want to know"" with the blushy face and now two days later he never answered. He normally answers within a day, and used to ask me a lot about my day and tell me about his, and I feel like something changed. Aside from that one text we've not talked at all since the weekend.

I don't know if I""m being paranoid and it's normal to not text back for three days (it's not like I haven't made him wait that long in the past), but does it sound like he lost interest? Was he was freaked out by my saying I wanted an emotional connection? If he just wanted casual sex, why wouldn't he answer my flirty text? Should I ask him where his head is at or would that come across as too clingy?

I'm also not totally sure he didn't feel badly because he was looking at my phone as I was doing something and saw my Bumble app with a few message notifications. (I'm not dating anyone else but still getting messages, and he probably assumed I was dating other people). He hasn't been on the app in around a month.

Have easily talked for hours upon hours across the last few months. Asked her initially to grab food with me and she agreed to, but was busy. Schedule conflicts lead into her hanging out in the pool with a buddy of mine and myself for two hours one night. Then I think I scared my own self off by sending an innocent drunk text and backing off really hard. The entire time she was still really friendly with me and seemed to enjoy talking to me in person. 

Another buddy has been around her a little bit and thinks she may have some social anxiety ( I do as well and it made sense thinking about it). Said maybe I should propose some activity with him and his girlfriend and this girl and myself. She seemed really interested in sports so I invited her to a hockey game. Showed her the dates on the my phone and she immediately rejected like four of the upcoming games due to her schedule but said she would definitely go to one which is a little under two weeks from now. 

The next day I mentioned we were buying the tickets then. She asked how much they were and how much she owed. I said ""I got you if you're fine with that"". She said ""awwwww, thank you!"". The next day she even ran into the girlfriend of my buddy and was light hearted joking about me ""not letting her pay"" in front of her friends. Girlfriend said it was cute and a great sign. We've also had many friendly conversations after and she has shown zero signs of flaking yet. 

So, do you think she knows this is a date? I'm approaching it as a casual get together to get to know each other better. If attraction is there then labels do not matter. I don't really believe the friendzone is a real thing. But it's also fine if she is viewing it as a friendly outing without any romantic involvement. Everyone has their own preferences. I have absolutely ZERO intention to hold the ticket price over her head even if she rejects even a hug at the end. Just curious how many women would view a guy paying 120 dollars for her ticket would go into it thinking it wasn't a date. My buddy comes from an extremely womanizer background (greek life). Said to just keep it casual and get to know her. Not put pressure on her by adding a date label. 

First time I've been this deep into questioning everything. Normally just go with the flow and hardly ever ask about ""What does this mean? What did she mean by this? etc etc etc"".

This is taboo af.

I \[F27\] have a TA \[M27\] for one of my college classes (not in my department, just an elective to fill a requirement), and lately things have gone from ""yep, that's \[TA\]"" to ""???????"" I've always thought he was cute, yes, but that was just a random thought that's lived in the back of my head and not anything I paid much mind. I also want to put out there that I'm an older student and there's only a three month age gap between me and this TA. I'm the older party between us, and all of this started the minute I mentioned my age in passing to him. 

I didn't really think anything of this TA until a few weeks ago, when I asked if we could find some time to go over some of the material I missed while I was absent. I came into office hours pretty frazzled and he pulled up a chair *right* next to me. Like, we were close enough that we were almost touching, which seemed a bit much for just a review session. I didn't think much of that, either, I guess, until one of his fellow grad students walked into the office right then and he kinda jumped back like he wasn't supposed to be there. But then that person left and he went right back to leaning in all close to look over my notes. It was so close that I couldn't even focus on the notes and wouldn't have remembered my own name if he'd asked it at that moment, if you want me to put it into perspective. 

Then, the next time I was in office hours, he spent the entire time asking me about my interests and hobbies and getting super animated about my answers. You'd have thought I was the most interesting human being on the planet. He remembered a book I said I liked, gave me some more book recommendations, gave me some potential grad schools to look into, asked me my career goals and wanted to know all about my research. Like, he asked SO many questions. In the end, we devoted maybe ten minutes to actually reviewing material (vs. almost an *hour* talking). During both of these times, he also just kept looking at me. I mean, it wasn't staring, but it was direct eye contact, held for longer than I would have expected anyone to hold my gaze. Just 100% rapt attention. Oh, and if I said I wasn't fond of x, he'd say ""x is overrated"". Or if I had trouble with y, he'd say ""y is tricky and stupid; sorry"". And then he'd smile with his whole face like I was doing brilliant work (I got almost everything wrong and am hanging onto my current grade by the skin of my teeth).

Since those interactions, he talks to me more. He acknowledges me by name every time I walk into class. He asks how I am. We talk over email a lot. He calls on me in section way more than he used to. He smiles when he sees me, and I keep catching him looking at me. I'm trying to keep a poker face because I know for a fact (having dated a grad student last year - sorry, they're closer to me in age than most undergrads here) that there are conflict of interest rules that get drilled into them from day one. I do like him, but I don't want to do anything to encourage him at least until class is 100% over because it could spell major trouble. He's always been very nice in general, which is why I don't know what to think here. But this seems like it might go beyond ""nice"". If I didn't already like him, I don't know how I'd feel about these interactions. Would I even be reading anything into them at all? Would I be horrified? I don't know. I also definitely don't know how to differentiate between niceness and flirtation here, especially in such a taboo context as this. Like, I genuinely do not know who to even talk to about this, and wow, is it all sending me for a loop. 

I've looked into the rules of my university. Once class ends and the final grades are in (\~3 weeks from now), we're just people. I will never take one of his sections again because he's not even in a remotely related department to mine, so dating at that point would be totally fair game if it turns out he is actually interested in me. Hell, my mom's best friend met their spouse that way. What happens post-2021, the vibe is ""que sera, sera"". But while we're still in class, those distinctions between TA/student are still very real and I feel a bit conflicted. Yes, I like him. Great, maybe he likes me. But for the moment, he is still my TA and it's definitely a tad awkward to be thinking my TA might wanna bone me while we're reviewing material (even if that is totally mutual), if that makes sense.

So a few days ago I matched with a girl on tinder and we started chatting. She was replying decently quickly and definitely made it seem like she was interested.

I’m wondering if I did something wrong here. I really think that I should’ve kept texting her on Monday even after making plans to just keep a chat going until the day today (I guess to be technical she did text last with “Okay yeah that works” so my turn to reply) but a part of me thinks that if she was interested she’d atleast text back today.

If you decide to read it, thanks.

I'm a dude in his mid-twenties, and I've been single for a while - mostly due to anxiety which became significantly worse due to the pandemic. To add, lot of my friends moved away for their careers and my job became remote so I could no longer see any of my coworkers which were a large part of my friend group. I've been lonely and wanting more friends/to date but have had issues putting myself out there due to self-esteem issues. I tried the dating apps for a while but man they were brutal and only exacerbated the self-esteem issues.

Despite all that, I'm finally beginning to feel like I'm at a place where I can maybe start getting of my comfort zone, so I've been trying to make some positive strides so I can get my confidence back. Ultimately I've been dissatisfied with my life; I've been complacent and haven't really been pushing myself to change anything. I'm pretty introverted as well, so being alone for so long didn't really bother me at first because I became so comfortable, however at this point, I know my quality of life isn't optimal, and I attribute it to a lack of social interaction. 

With all that said, I got a dog several months ago. She's been great as I've been able to get out a lot more. I love dogs, and I knew if I got one, it would essentially force my ass to get outside and interact with people. Within the first week or so, I met quite a few fellow dog owners in my building, one of which was this girl who I was immediately infatuated with and still am. Simply put, I was a nervous wreck and 100% did NOT make a positive first impression. I've ran into her a bit more here and there, and while our brief chats weren't as awkward as the first, they never go how I want them to. One time I ran into her and she offered to give me her old crate because her dog grew out of it. Did I ask for her number? No. Another time she and her friend were walking back from the park with their dogs and said we should do a play date with the dogs. Did I get either of their numbers? No. Now let me make one thing clear, while I for sure have anxiety issues which have contributed to this, I've dated girls in the past and know how to talk to them. I guarantee if this were a different scenario, meaning she wasn't a neighbor and didn't live in my building, I would've shot my shot by now, *I think.* 

What seems to be stopping me at this point is the fact that she lives in my building. The last thing I want is to make things awkward for her if she isn't interested in me. Although I'm almost certain she's single as I saw her profile pop up on Hinge a while back, I'm assuming expecting rejection since she's a straight up 10 and definitely has way more attractive dudes all up in her inbox. The other thing is I've found it to be very hard to have anything more than a brief chat with her as I have to manage my crazy puppy who's still not on her best behavior going complete ape shit every time I come in close proximity to her and her dog. Plus, I tend to see her in the evenings and lately it's been pouring rain, so there's not much chance to talk. 

I'd love some advice on how I can best ask her out. I really want to make my intentions clear, but I also don't want to make her feel awkward, so I'm am thinking it may be best to just try to befriend her first so I can gauge her interest organically over time. But at the same time I feel like dilly dallying around and not stating my intentions outright is a bit disingenuous. While I think she'd be a cool friend, my objective isn't that, it's a relationship, and given how attracted to her I am, I'm not sure it would be easy to live with being in the friend zone.

So given the aforementioned obstacles, what should I say to her the next time I see her, whenever that may be?

Phones always in his pocket and if it’s charging… it’s face down or just face down next to my bed. He won’t touch it, endless I’m not around. 
I know his password to his phone,  but I don’t want to go through it and he’s knows I don’t want to… (guys like to say girls are crazy) But he pick up my phone no problem. Use it, go through my messages… go through everything. I have nothing to hide.

From our first date onward, we made a clear connection that has built much to my delight. We've gone on fun dates, creative dates, routine dates, etc., each of which have topped the previous time we've spent together. I quickly became acquainted with her closest friends, too. Until a month ago, we were seeing at least two times a week, sometimes more.

Over the past month, her schedule has been busy. And I mean busy. I've seen her twice since her schedule blew up—once near the middle of October, and oncee at the end of the month. In-between those times, we spoke less than we typically did, and that's continued to where things are now.

We haven't yet had the opportunity to DTR. Her schedule has prevented her from seeing anyone or doing anything, and as a result, it means the way we communicate is understandably a noticeable shift from before. I want nothing more than to provide her peace of mind, I just don't know how to do that without coming across as overbearing.

I understand this might mean we talk less because of her physical and mental exhaustion, and I'm totally OK with that. I really, truly just want to be of help. I also want to have the DTR talk with her... but doing it over text doesn't sit well with me. I'm not sure when I'll get to see her next.

First of all, let's get this out of the way. 

**Stop hiding behind ""I'm shy and introverted""**

*Sorry, if that's the lazy excuse you're going to use, you're going to lose in life and lose big.*

*I'm introverted AS F\*\*\*, it just means that some days, I spend by myself and recharge my batteries. I can still go out and be the life of the party.*  

*As a guy, you need to get out of your shell.  A shy girl is sexy, a shy guy is a weirdo and you will die alone.  Hoarders are usually introverts.*

*If you don't get out of your shell when you're young, it is 1000000000 times harder to do it when you're older.* 

That being said, let's begin:

**Did you ask her out?** No, then ask her out on an actual date.  None of this drippy ""You wanna hang out?""  Pick something fun and inexpensive that you can chill out with her, holidays are coming, ""Hey I wanted to check out this christmas festival next week to find a gift for my mom, care to join me?"" There will be people there, you can window browse and chat.

Don't go to movies or dinner.  Shoot pool, play miniature gold, go for a hike, do something active that you and her can talk that has external stimuli.  Chicks dig waterfalls my man.

Ask her out, if you suspect she likes you ASK HER OUT OR THE NEXT GUY WILL.

Why do women always seem to end up with idiots?  Because the idiots are too stupid to think and they just ask her out. 

Stop losing your dream women to idiots.

Next:

**Did she answer?**

If she doesn't answer, she's not into you. If she does answer but it's not a hard ""yes"", she's not into you.  If she rainchecks ""I can't do it friday, how about saturday"", she IS interested.  Plan the date for saturday.

**If she hems and haws, she's not into you.**

""Uh sorry, something came up, I have to help my grandmother water her cat's plants"" or whatever drivel excuse she comes up with.

Women don't make excuses for men they want, they make excuses for men they don't want.

Every girl I've ever dated literally has a free schedule almost every single day of the week, women have come over my place when they have to be at work in 5 hours.  If she's making excuses, she's not interested.

You're ONLY answer is ""Hey no prob, another time then"" then NEVER contact her again.  If she's interested in you or becomes interested in you, she has your number and she WILL reach out. I've personally done this and the girl reached out a year later and we spent 6 months together.  Walking away is your best tool.  It means you value your time.  This puts you above 90% of guys who just overtext the girl until they end up chasing her away. 

**Don't Overbuy the Milk:**

The phone is for setting dates.  If I had a dollar for every guy who sets a date then proceeds to text her all week until the date only to have her flake or cancel, I'd be a far richer man.  You set the date, you get off the phone.  You're a busy man and if you're not a busy man, become a busy man.  The more you text or call her, the less interesting you become to her and the less she wants to know about you and the **ONLY REASON WOMEN GO ON A DATE WITH YOU IS BECAUSE THEY'RE CURIOUS ABOUT YOU.**

Lose that curiosity, lose that girl.

95% of the dating problems on this thread can be solved by following these simple guidelines.

I like this guy. We went on dates 4 years ago and we reconnected this summer. His behavior is so contradictory and confuses me just as much today as it did then but it seems to be more intense now. 

First off. We don’t do anything physical. We kissed i think 3 times, 4 years ago, briefly. This time around literally nothing. No hand-holding. Half hugs. So hopefully this helps express my confusion. 

When we are in person, everything is so easy. The conversation flowers. I feel present. We are just enjoying each others company. He has invited me several times before and this time around to having dinner, meet with him, go on day road trips with him, BUT 95% of the time doesn’t show up, not cancel, just doesn’t show up. We’ve gotten to the point when we talk on the phone and he invites me to something, I say no or I remind him of how he doesn’t show up. 

Him: solo male 4life. I call him “3 weeks” bc thats how often I hear from him because he is traveling or working. Very nervous energy. When we talk, sometimes he can’t look me in the eyes, or when he holds his phone his hands are shaking. He will call me, he will pay for dinner (when we meet), he is a gentleman in his behavior towards me. 

This situation: We met for the first time after 4 years. Amazing night. We planned to meet again. No dice. Eventually a month+ later, I get a phone call asking if he can drive over now to apologize for standing me up. This was the second time I saw him. We were supposed to meet again last week and I heard literally nothing again, and he knew how reluctant I was to saying yes. I can’t figure out if he is just so fucking nervous to be in person that he just doesn't have enough guts to do it when the day comes to see me or if he doesn’t like me, or maybe I am just not important at all, or embarrassed to be seen with me.

I only have this certain gut instinct which is he does actually care a lot about me because he told me 4 years ago he loved me completely out of the blue and said ""just give me one day, to be myself"". And he keeps coming back but not for physical contact because we don't have any. You see?

I just want to know if anyone has ever had a similar situation and maybe dated a nervous guy or just a confusing as all hell guy.

We met on hinge and if I were to describe my dream partner, he would fit the description perfectly. I was all in before I even met him. We’ve now gone on a few dates and he lives up to the expectation and more. It’s still really early and I feel myself getting super excited about him but I want to stay realistic. 

Historically, I have gotten attached to men too easily who offered me almost nothing. To guys who treated me like shit and never saw me for more than a pretty face. I also should mention I’ve been single for almost a year after ending a 4 year relationship. This is my first real attempt at dating since that breakup.  I haven’t been single since I was 19 years old and had never used a dating app. Needless to say, I’ve felt totally out of my element but am embracing it anyway.


I feel ready to date. I am in a really great place and am confident. If anything, the only negative emotions I’m dealing with are embarrassment for how much I settled in the past and how disappointment in those past loves. My mindset in dating is to try not to take it personal if it doesn’t work out. Being rejected will leave anyone with a bruised ego but my goal is to never blame myself for the outcome itself. I know my worth, what I deserve, and what I refuse to compromise on.

This guy is great and I really do hope my excitement is justified. We have great chemistry and both seem very into each other. Since the quality of men I’ve dated previously is atrocious at best, I can’t help but wonder if this is what it feels like to date someone who’s actually worth my time. Someone I didn’t have to compromise on or turn a blind eye on their problematic traits. Is this how dating is supposed to feel?
