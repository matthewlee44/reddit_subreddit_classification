0,re7ya4,1639254057,What's the minimum notice that's considered ideal (or even acceptable) when asking someone their availability to do something?,"Of course it depends on the current status of your relationship with the other person. But let's assume this is someone whose number you managed to get after a night out etc.

What's more likely to get a '*Yes sure I'm free to meet up for drinks*', as opposed to getting swerved with a '*Sorrryyyy I'm too busyyyy*'.

I feel like spontaneity is KEY when keeping the inquantifiable 'magic' or 'spark' alive. But of course timing is so subjective that some may say a week is too short notice ... and a some might even be willing to drop their preliminary evening plans on any particular morning if inclined to do so.

I ask this because I kinda just wanna drop the following text to a girl...

&gt;*Hey if you’re not busy this evening, you wanna grab some drinks? x* 

And I just wanna be reassured that 

1. It's gonna be more likely than not to get a positive response
2. I time it well so that I don't let the girl sit on it for too long to give her the chance to ghost, yet allow for.

Some may argue that asking someone to meet up that same morning is tooo short notice BUT realistically people aren't actually as busy as they make out - and surely if they WANTED to do something, they would do more to work around.

I COULD lead with 'Wanna meet up some time?' - But the 'some time' part of that phrase leads too much uncertainty of whether that will ever happen. To me, it's just an 'empty' request.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/re7ya4/whats_the_minimum_notice_thats_considered_ideal/

2,re8037,1639254211,what do women like nowadays?,"So I’ve come to terms with myself that I am actually pretty unlikeable and realize why I can’t get anybody. So with that said, I’m trying to change myself so that I can get at least ONE woman to find me at least somewhat attractive to the point where she’ll like me. I don’t have anyone in particular, just someone random really. I don’t know a whole lot of women except for the ones I met in high school, and most of them are doing their own thing with their own lives since you know, we all graduated. I only had one relationship in high school but that girl hates my fucking guts so, there’s no getting that back. As much as I tried, there’s nothing I can do. She was the only one I loved, and to this day there’s STILL unresolved issues between us, which contributes a little bit to this whole problem. I pretty much moved on, but the fact that there’s unresolved issues and questions left unanswered definitely fucks with my dating life a bit. But with that aside, what do I do to make myself more attractive? I’m willing to change everything about myself just so that I can have someone. I’m about 5’6, 5’7, somewhere around there. I know I can’t do anything about my height, but I do know that I’m not too small, but not too tall either. I’m like medium. Societal standards say that’s short, but I think of it as if I was a drink at McDonald’s or something, I’d be like a medium size lol. I’m also pretty skinny. I definitely don’t look like I eat enough but I do. Maybe I need more iron? Like iron vitamins or something? I at least play beat saber for cardio so it’s not like I don’t work out at all, ya know? Uhh let’s see I don’t really have a job, but that’s because I’m still trying to figure out my career path. I worked at hot topic once but couldn’t handle it due to my anxiety. I don’t have a car YET, but I am getting one in the near future as I’m just now learning to drive, so that one’s not really a problem. I don’t really have a religion but my best friend did give me some advice and I’m starting to consider converting to christianity. My clothes are a little bit weird considering it’s composed of mostly black (black skinny jeans, black cargos, black/red/pink hoodies). It’s definitely a weird mix of emo and punk for sure. So I’m wondering, should I get more flashy and bright clothes? Is black a turn off maybe? Or do women like that and I should instead keep my existing wardrobe? Next is my hair. I’m not gonna lie my hair’s looking rough right now lol. It was originally shaved in the back and on the sides, with it being long in the front. It was definitely on the more punk side, but since then it grew out and it’s looking more rough for sure. I originally wanted like a crazy cool hairstyle to stand out from the crowd, but then I’d literally just look like everybody else because everybody’s dyeing their hair and all that nowadays anyways. So instead, I was thinking about doing the opposite and just getting a normal haircut instead. My two closest friends have normal haircuts and they have girlfriends so it makes sense wouldn’t it? I know I also need to shave my facial hair and body hair, but I’m planning to get a Manscaped razor sometime soon, so that shouldn’t be a problem. Hmm I think that’s mostly it in terms of describing me in my current state, but I really do need some advice. This sucks.

TLDR; I feel like I’m not attractive enough so I’m willing to change everything about myself so that I can get a girlfriend, and I need advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/re8037/what_do_women_like_nowadays/

She was the one pushing for the break up originally and was acting like we are together.  

I would have been fine with just being friends and sleeping together.  To be honest I don't even know what we are.

She's been acting distant lately.   I've been busy focusing on earning money so no big deal.   

Today she texts me saying she's now working 22nd and 23rd.  

Days she didn't have to work (she's working by choice),. Then she's acting like I'm pressuring her for wanting to hang out and do Christmas stuff with her. 

She's also been acting really distant. 


When she broke up with my I had lots of attention from women but didn't get a chance to sleep with them.  

My girlfriend (or whatever she is ) doesn't seem to give a damb about me.   I don't feel like she is good for a relationship.

So I have a little dilemma right now. Next week will be my last week of work with my current employer. Friday is my last day. I’m going to be moving on to a new job.

I have a coworker who is incredibly gorgeous. Really confident, charismatic, smart. I would really love the chance to get to know her more.

She has mentioned in the office that she is currently dating. I think she may be seeing another guy. I don’t think they’re particularly serious however. They’ve maybe only had a few dates - definitely not gf/bf.

We get on really well in person. We follow each other on insta and she always watches my stories, she’s complimented me a couple of times. Obvs these aren’t huge signs of attraction though.

9,re8leh,1639256024,Apologize to ex after 10 years or let sleeping dogs lie...?,"We dated on and off for about 6 years. It was mostly long-distance, sometimes in the same city during summers, but overall it was pretty toxic, on-again-off-again, lots of bickering and fighting, and we even went many months without speaking to each other during that 6-year period. Those periods of silence were always initiated by me telling her I couldn't talk to her anymore or I needed space, etc. We ""broke up"" many times and somehow always ended up on the slippery slope that led back to some kind of relationship. Very high highs and very low lows. It was a rollercoaster. We had insane chemistry but we were both in our early 20s and very insecure and that manifested in all the bickering and fighting. At a certain point in 2011 I told her I needed to take some space and I haven't talked to her since, even after she reached out a few more times - I didn't respond and she got the hint.

Over the last 10 years I've thought about her on and off, I've dated other people but no one has excited me as much as she did. I haven't felt that kind of chemistry since.

Today I was looking through an old laptop of mine (for other reasons) and inadvertently found an iMessage convo from 2008 that I saved to prove to myself that we could never be ""friends"" (something we tried to do a few times I guess). What the conversation really ended up proving to me was just how responsible I was for all the fights and stress that I used to blame entirely on her. I was pretty damn mean to her and it's all because of my own insecurities at the time and not setting healthy boundaries. The truth is, we probably shouldn't have dated at all after the first time we fought. I should have said, ""nope, not for me, I won't tolerate this, best of luck"" (at the time I WAS astounded at the reason she picked that first fight with me, but after she got over it I shrugged it off, despite finding it very stressful and confusing, and continued to see her).

For some additional background, she was going through some hard times back then, more than I even know. Divorced parents, stepfather becoming deathly ill and I think he passed away at that time, family cat died, body image issues, and all the rest of the coming-of-age issues a young woman has to deal with, issues finding the right fit for university and having enough credits to seamlessly transfer from one to another, prescription pill abuse...

After I stopped talking to her she had some odd outbursts where she even slapped my friend (whom she was living with at the time, just as roommates) but then claimed to others that it was he who slapped her! To be honest, he's probably a hard guy to live with (lol) but I also suspect there were some displaced feelings about me not talking to her anymore that led to that strange violent outburst.

Anyways, it's been a point of pride and discipline for me that I've held out for so long and haven't reached out to her over the years, but I wonder if it's completely justified. I've always felt that there's really nothing good that can come of me reaching out to her, but after reading that text convo I feel like I want her to know that I don't believe all the fighting and stress was all her fault. I've really worked on myself over the years, especially this year, and learned a lot about myself, setting and maintaining healthy boundaries, self-compassion, self-love, self-acceptance, and I've grown immensely. It's clear to me now that I didn't set healthy boundaries for myself and unfairly blamed HER. Considering all the trouble she's gone through and her mental health struggles, I think it could be very liberating and validating for her to hear that. I'm sure I'm also trying to justify ""breaking the line"" I've set of not talking to her for so long, and I'm curious if the chemistry is still there and how she's doing etc. But I honestly do think it could be quite therapeutic for her to hear a genuine apology from me and admission of my responsibility.

It's been 11 months since our breakup, and it took a while to finally settle the last few bits related to our old shared apartment.

I feel like a door has been officially closed. Once the money is transferred, we'll have no more reason to talk. We only talked a handful of times since the breakup really, and I don't want him specifically back.

But the sad, empty little part of my heart that really wants a relationship again - the sense that I have ""my person"", the intimacy, the affection, the love - that one is feeling extra raw right now. I don't feel very hopeful about finding someone again in the near future (or possibly in the next few years, easily), so to be honest, I wish I didn't want it at all.

16,re9dcj,1639258345,What happened?,"Hi, first of all i am not a native speaker, forgive me for my terrible english. 

i'd like to know the opinion of both men and women, i don't know if this is the right sub. A little context: i am not asexual but i have low interest in women as partners and relationships ( i don't mind being single), so i don't have many experiences. 

I work as a shop assistent in a supermarket, the staff is mostly composed by women ( with few men), and i thought that every woman had an husband or a boyfriend. i wasn't dissapointed because i never try to date a coworker as a personal ethic. i started this job 1 month ago more or less. the coworkers are very informal to each others, joke a lot and are very friendly. i like joking but i am a bit shy/introvert, most of my coworkers noticed that i am a bit silent ( i don't like talking too much when i am working) and tried to make me feel like at home. i appreciated this. i am in my mid 20s

now here it comes my question. there is one coworker, let's call her Claire. Claire has my same age more or less. Claire is not from my country, she's east european. Claire has a similar approach to mine when she's working, she doesn't talk too much ( but i don't think she's shy) and try to be as professional as possible. 2 weeks ago she started behaving in an odd way. My interactions with her were almost 0 before 2 weeks ago because we work in different areas of the supermarket

\- she stared at me different times and in the instances where are our eyes met we both smiled. this happened a lot of times. at first i smiled because i was embarrassed but later i smiled because i enjoyed the attention

\- another coworker, let's call her Jasmine, said to me: "" i saw how Claire look at you, she promised you something ehehehe"" ( this happened 2 weeks ago more or less). i dismissed it as a joke.

\- claire call me with a cute nickname. almost every other coworker use it but she uses it with a different tone

\-claire occasionally called me ""honey"" ( it's not the direct translation but close to it)

\- claire used to call me with no reasons and smiling when she was working close to me.

\- claire has been touchy(touching my arm or my back) for no reason at all in few occasions.

i think i am old enough to understand if a woman is flirting or not and i think Claire was clearly flirting. At first i didn't want to accept it (again, my polacy is no dating between coworkers) but she clearly ignored my other male coworkers and doesn't talk a lot with the female ones. she was obviously different in my presence. and i had to admit to myself that i had a little crush on her

i reflected a lot on how to behave with her. she's a single mom and a coworker, both not an ideal situation for me, but she is good looking, very kind and funny. so i started to flirt back few days ago. i didn't want to ask her out immediatly because i knew she was very busy (she goes back to her daughter every time after work or during the launch break) and i wanted to make sure she was 100% into me before making an obvious move ( because it's my coworker after all). 

but 2 days ago she stopped the flirting. she isn't cold or distant but she doesn't treat me like before. maybe it's a good thing i avoided a potential relationship beetween coworkers, but i am a little dissapointed. did i wait too much or wasn't into me from the beginning?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/re9dcj/what_happened/

I know that texting is not a legitimately realistic form of effective communication. I lack good communication even more so when it comes to him, because I’m forced to say what I’m feeling and why on the spot. Or when I would have to backtrack and give evidence of an action he took to back up why I feel a certain way, on the spot. 

And don’t let my point be explained incorrectly cause then there’s no going back on how I am now seen by him, or may sound to him. I get under pressure and end up being very silent. This is why he usually always has the upper hand in any discussion or disagreement we may have. 

I always let myself down but I do not do well with confrontation and I communicate so much better in my writing. I feel as though it’s best for me to be off something so that I don’t feel any anxiety when we’re talking or ‘arguing’. 

So it angers me that I can’t even have a halfway decent convo with him unless we’re on the phone. 

But can I be mad? I don’t think so.

After all of these I stay without seeing her for some time. Then she basically got to me again and we kissed again for a while. After these I just left and went back to my girl and stayed with her the rest of the night without saying a thing

We both agreed that we should take it slow and go on a few proper dates when lockdown was lifted. And since we are out of lockdown, we have been going out properly on fun dates. 

To be honest I thought she was thinking we were in a relationship because she has invited me to spend Christmas lunch with her family (I said no because I always spend Christmas with my Family), holding hands in movies and making plans about our financials. 

So tonight I asked her if she wanted to make it official and become my girlfriend. She said `Yeah sure’ but then had doubts about the age difference. We didn’t really talk about it any further and we continued about the night like nothing happened…
And then when we were saying goodbye I was expecting to kiss but all we did was a cheek kiss and a long hug. To be honest it was 2am and we were both tired but still…

This did not go the way I thought it would...

I am honestly so confused as to whether I have a girlfriend or a friend right now.

Afterwards we continued to talk and  I asked her if she wants to come back to my city or if I can go to her city to meet again and she said ""no"".I asked her why and she doesnt want to say why , but she said to me "" I dont know what ideas you've got ""  and "" We met once "".
I mean why did  she talk with me for 6 months, then she comes to see me , we meet and she acts super interested , still talks to me afterwards but doesn't want to meet again?

25,reae2w,1639261514,What are your best and worst experiences with online dating?,"I (27F) certainly don't miss those days. I had my share of rotten apples over the years.

There was one guy who I had one uneventful date with who actually wanted to drag me into his messy custody battle over his kid, and sorry, but that sent me running for the hills. In my humble opinion, that's a lot to ask of somone *even in an established relationship*. You don't drop that on someone after only one date. That's just messed up.

Then there was this guy who absolutely begged for my attention like a neglected puppy almost constantly. One date and I pretty much got tossed out like garbage, because apparently, he was still pining for his ex girlfriend. Not cool to try to date other people and lead them on if you're still hung up on your ex... Not cool at all, but whatever.

Then there was a guy whose personal hygiene left a LOT to be desired... He was actually nice, but I think he must have had some untreated STI or something. I couldn't stomach the prospect of doing anything sexual with him, because the smells coming off him, from down there, were THAT bad. I'm actually pretty tolerant of gross things, but this just turned my stomach.

Not to bash online dating or everyone on the scene entirely though. I actually met my partner on one - we spent our first date spending like seven or eight hours walking around and just talking. At the end I was sunburned and had blisters all over my feet, but I wouldn't change a thing. It was perfect ❤️

28,realvr,1639262173,No career/passion and dating.,"Ok so I guess I have this insecurity around not having a career or much of a passion and people judging me for it. I don’t really have a title, it’s whatever job I’m doing at the time before I quit and do something new. And before anyone reads all of this and tells me I need to work on my confidence, I know that. 

Im just surviving and trying to earn enough money so I can buy a home one day and have some luxurious vacations for time off (I have a bucket list). I don’t have plans to have kids or be a parent either, it has never appealed to me. Although being a housewife and lady of leisure doesn’t sound bad. 

I don’t worry about the future I live in the present. I have high school level education, didn’t get the grades to enter university directly so would’ve had to do something in college (which I started but dropped out) I’m from the UK btw. I didn’t enjoy school much (I was bullied here and there) which really knocked my confidence and trust and I developed a lot of anxiety too and started therapy. Other than that I just wanna be happier and healthy and remain by my loved ones. 

I’ve struggled finding a true passion and something I wish to do with my life. Some times I think about doing voluntary work abroad just to get out of the same routine and perhaps meet some people, whilst getting to see the world. But then I snap back into reality and realise I don’t have the courage for that and I really hate the travelling part. Plus going on vacation is one thing but working and living in another country would make me too home sick I think. 

I also feel like my hobbies aren’t interesting enough either and I’m pretty much a hermit. But I love being alone. I don’t mind doing things if my friends and family invite me to things but most of the time I don’t go out. I have few friends because I’m not very outgoing, I have social anxiety and struggle making friends with people I actually like. Friends will usually initiate plans and organise things for us to do but most of the time it’s just going for dinner and drinks or going to a bar on the weekend. Which is fun. A concert here and there too or shopping trip. 
But In my free time I’m usually tired from work (I have waves of depression which I’ve been in therapy for) so I’d rather chill and be by myself. I enjoy going on walks, eating and watching YouTube/reading forums too. 

I’m worried that when I try dating I won’t be good enough. Ive been on dating apps and so many people of my generation (20s) look like they have so much more going for them. A lot of university graduates with buzzing social life’s and dreams and goals. But why do i care about others? I enjoy the simple things I guess… and I don’t care enough to go and chase a career that I genuinely have no interest in. Sometimes I feel embarrassed telling people that I work in a warehouse picking and packing orders all day. And before that I worked in a care home doing jobs most people don’t wanna do, I’ve also done housekeeping. Sometimes I feel like people judge me and see my jobs as lower or something, or ask why a young thing like me is doing these jobs. To be fair a lot of my coworkers are older.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/realvr/no_careerpassion_and_dating/
29,reanyi,1639262356,Need advice on learning to date at 31 in a weird place in my life,"\[M,  31\] Recently got out of a 3 year relationship and have never used OLD,  and also haven't had any social media for maybe ten years. Every  relationship I've been in has started organically IRL, but that doesn't  seem like an easy thing to pursue anymore. Moving states recently has  kept me disconnected from my old friends, and I don't have a network to  mingle around anymore, or events to go to. So I really need to start  over from scratch and kind of ""learn to date"", probably mostly through  apps. Are there any especially useful resources on the current dating  landscape for our age groups? Outside of that, have any of you had luck  with IRL singles events? I've never been to one. Should I start up  social media again - and would you find it weird if your date wasn't on  IG/FB? (I keep a linkedin - that's it.)

I'm  also worried about starting to date again with my current lifestyle and  what I'm doing in life. My professional career is secure, but I'm in  college for the first time and as a result live just like I did when I  was 20 - roommates, shared bathroom - this is not normal for my age in  my area. I make above-average income and have nice things, but live like  this to ensure I can finish school without needing to gap semesters to  keep finances healthy. Between how I live and how busy I am I kind of  feel more like three raccoons in a trench coat than an adult, although I  keep my spaces tidy. I've been considering renting a studio or master  bedroom just to make dating easier. Would you see any of this as a  deal-breaker?

I am in Utah now  (not LDS), which has it's own challenges. If anyone is from the area I'd  love to get any advice on that too. Thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reanyi/need_advice_on_learning_to_date_at_31_in_a_weird/

32,reaumv,1639262945,What would you do?,"I met a guy on Tinder back in June, I thought he was cute so I swiped right and we matched, however, once we started to talk, I was a bit annoyed by his quick set of questions: 

Do you like dogs? 
Do you believe in God?
How important is your family in your daily routine?

I felt like I was being interviewed for a position and kinda stayed quiet for a couple days, we started to talk later on and after a few days we agreed to meet. He lives 4 hours away from me and he is 38 years old (for context), I’m 34.

We agreed to meet on a Saturday but I had to cancel that morning since my dad was sick and I was taking care of him, he understood, I was a bit bummed since I wanted to meet him, and most importantly, go out and have a bit of a normal day for a chance.

That same day he called to find out how my day was and also mentioned he had bought a gift for me and will need my address to send it over or even deliver it himself if possible. He then admitted that even tho I cancelled, he drove all the way down just to hand me the gift and hopefully have coffee with me, I thought that was super sweet so I got ready and we went out for dinner.

However, something about this guy didn’t click for me, he is handsome, is a doctor, has several jobs, a very stable life and somehow he had only had one boyfriend and several attempts, there had to be a catch… 

During our dinner date he said - I need to tell you I’m a bit intense when it comes to relationships, I give it all and I want it all - I thought it was a bit too much for a first date but I told him I understand his position.

He kissed me on the way back home and he smelled soooooo freaking good (a major turn on for me), it was a nice day.

We continued to talk and later on I told him I had planned a trip abroad for over a month, he was shocked when I told him that and said - what am I going to do without you? - his friend was with us and she said - don’t be ridiculous, you’ll be fine -

We agreed on meeting before I left, he took me to a nice restaurant for birthday dinner and brought another gift (I’m not used to giving people lol), then we went home and things happened.

The day prior to my departure he came again and hugged me, but he started to cry, I asked why and he said he loves me, I mean, I know it takes a long time for me to tell someone I love them, but I just hugged him and avoided the extra details.

Now during the trip: 

We texted daily and even did video calls, however, one morning he called me freaking out and demanding details of the people I was staying with. It looks like he did major research overnight and thought I was the -type- of my friends and they would probably try to take advantage of that. I told him it was too early for a mess like that and that he should actually take some time for himself to get on track and feel better, I encouraged him to stop texting or talking and do something healthy instead, we didn’t talk for like 4 days until he sent audios crying and saying he was sorry about his attitude.

Worst part is what he understood as - do something healthy - to cope with his anxiety:

He asked his friend to create a chat group, name it - My gift from god + My name - she added him but immediately left the group so that it would only be him talking to an empty group, and he used it to pretend he was texting me, that actually scared me a lot.

So this is the thing, I really developed feelings for him since he is very sweet, but I’m also scared of the things he does, I have kept my distance and we text more under control now, but it’s only a matter of minutes for him to go crazy again and come up with something weird.

34,reaw0u,1639263068,Am I in too deep…advice appreciated,"Okay, so here’s the dilemma. I(23F) am in a “situationship” with a guy I met on Hinge. We went on a first date about 2 months ago and it was the best I’ve ever had. We get along well, we have the same views and morals, we like the same things, and we are both Christian (this will become important later). We have continued to hang out on a regular basis since then. He’s met my friends and we’ve hung out and done a few activities together, but we often hang out at his house. 

I started out with some pretty solid boundaries. I said that I was not going to do anything on the first date and that I was very strictly not going to have sex with him for the foreseeable future. But as we hung out some more and things happened, we made out some and did a little bit more here and there. This was a pretty big thing for me, as I have never dated or done anything physical with a guy. After a few boundaries had been crossed (consensually), I wanted to have a conversation outlining some stricter boundaries for myself as I believe that certain things should wait until marriage, or at least a committed relationship. My boundaries stood for a while, which was easy for me. Mostly because, not only was it something I was planning to wait on, but I am also very nervous and somewhat insecure when it comes to sexual things. After quite a bit of waiting, which involved fooling around, I asked him what kind of relationship we had. The good old DTR…

He said he wants to wait on becoming a couple because he has screwed up in the past and he is hoping to marry the next person he dates and he wants fewer regrets. I am totally in the same boat, however, we are opposites in our expectations. His expectations involve becoming closer with me physically/sexually before he is comfortable opening up emotionally. My expectations involve becoming closer emotionally/spiritually before getting too involved physically/sexually. He didn’t wait until marriage (obviously) to have sex, so he knows what he’ll be missing if he chooses to stay with me. I have decided to wait (and he is aware that I will not have sex with him), not because I am a Christian, but because I have waited so long already and I think it would be best for me to wait until marriage. That’s not to say I won’t do some things. I am just struggling with the fact that we are basically at a standstill because neither of us want to give in to the other’s wishes in fear of getting hurt. (Oh, he also has a troubled past, which could be the reason he is also hesitant.)
Is that a guy thing or is he manipulating me? 

He is still being weird about us, but everything is there besides a label at this point. It also kind of stresses me out that I haven’t been invited to meet or hang out with his friends, but he has hung out with mine many times. Is that a bad sign?

I’m just kind of confused. Advice appreciated…",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reaw0u/am_i_in_too_deepadvice_appreciated/

37,reazsc,1639263411,Dating horror story: I peed my pants on a first date,"I (25 M) had been friendly and flirty with a friend of mine for about a year before I finally got the courage to ask her out. We made plans to get dinner and then see a play at a local theater that our mutual friend was in. I know that’s a little bit of a strange first date since we can’t chat, but again we were friends before this.

Anyways, dinner was going FANTASTIC. She was dressed to impress or looked amazing in this little black dress. We chatted easily, flirted, she grabbed my arm on the way, it couldn’t have gone better. I did start need to use the bathroom at the restaurant, but figured there would be time to go at the theater before the play and didn’t think about it.

However, there was a massive crash on the highway and driving to the theater took 45 minutes instead of the 10 it was supposed. When we got to the theater the lights were blinking and they were already making a last call before the doors closed. I tried to say to her that I needed to run to the bathroom, but she grabbed my hand and ran with me to the door and I felt really awkward and embarrassed trying to break that off, and also didn’t want to get locked out of the theater.

Once the play started it took a good amount of my energy to not squirm constantly and embarrass myself with a “pee pee dance” but I figured I would be ok until intermission. Our seats were also in the middle of the aisle and this cute girl was holding my hand and I didn’t want to embarrass myself by jumping up in the middle of the play and running out of the theater. And then about an hour in I learned a fun surprise, there was no intermission. Awesome!

Once the play was finally over I was seriously dying. I was squeezing my leg muscles together and getting seriously worried I might leak in my pants. The theater was taking FOREVER to empty and I was standing up by my seat waiting for the people in front of us to clear out of the way. My date now decides it’s the perfect time to lean her hips into mine and whisper “don’t laugh but I seriously need to pee right now” I was so nervous at this point that I was stuttering and told her I needed to go too. 

I don’t know what the final straw was, but as we we waiting by our chairs I couldn’t hold it anymore and started to go. I don’t mean a small leak, I just started to full on wet my pants right there. She was still pressed up against me and I instinctively pushed her away and backed up and tried to hide what was happening with my hands. She looked confused and asked “what’s wrong” and then a second later her eyes drifted down and saw my jeans go from a quarter sized wet patch, to one the size of a large dinner plate. 

I’ll never forget the look on her face. Her beautiful brown eyes turned as wide as saucers and and gave an audible “oh” and then her hands covered her mouth. A few other people nearby started looking over and noticing what was happening. My dates face turned red and I think she was embarrassed to be with me. She then tucked her hair behind her ear and gave me a fake smile and said “just, push through the crowd” and sort of shewed me away. I was pushing my way through the sea of people trying to rush to the bathroom. I looked back at my date still standing by her chair and her she had her phone out and she was giggling to herself. 

I got to the bathroom finally and the damage was done. My jeans were wet past my knees and it was super obvious what happened. I had no idea what to do. I drove both of us there too and didn’t know what to do about the ride home. After about 10 minutes I decided to just leave the bathroom and play it by ear. As soon as I leave I see my date talking with our mutual friend who was in the play. My friend (a woman BTW) starts laughing as soon as she sees me. I think I see my date say to her “be nice and don’t say anything.” 

I walk over and my date keeps glancing at my crotch. Her face is beat red and embarrassed herself. She presses her lips together and asks “you doing ok?” As our friend continues to giggle. I am so humiliated that I can’t even spit out a coherent sentence but mutter “I’m good”. My date tells me she’ll get a ride home from our friend and I sort of just sulk back to my car.

I texted her the next day just saying “hopefully we can do it again soon” and she responded with a crying face emoji and “yeah maybe.” That was a few hours ago and I don’t know what to do from here and pretty sure I blew my chance with an amazing girl. Any advice on what to do?

The fact that I don't have a friend group at all came up about 15 minutes into the date and he completely focused on that fact the entire rest of the date, which only lasted about an hour and a half. He brought up the subject of friends and I just kind of awkwardly tried to avoid saying straight out I don't really have friends, but he noticed and said, ""Wait, do you not have ANY friends?!?!!"" (Technically I do still have one friend from high school, but I just choose not to talk to her most of the time and it's how our relationship has always been).

&amp;#x200B;

He was clearly so turned off by me not having friends. He kept asking me questions about it and said he was just fascinated because he'd never known anyone like me that was so closed off from people before (fascinated in a very bad way, because his entire tone was like What the f\*ck is wrong with you??). He suggested I try Bumble BFF and go to therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

He pretty much tried to psychoanalyze me the entire time (when he wasn't too busy laughing at me), trying to figure out what happened to make me like this. There's nothing interesting really, I've been a loner my entire life by choice. It's just how my personality is. I had lots of friends growing up and all through high school had a big friend group, but still chose to be alone a lot of times. I don't have a problem being alone most of the time. I'm not looking/desperate for friends at the moment (he seemed to think I should be). I'm only interested in a partner for right now that I can be intimate with.

I've always been nervous about revealing to dates just how extremely anti-social I actually am. The weirdness of me not having friends has come up as a problem before, but not in a very long time. I am very nervous about trying to date again after this disaster. I've at least learned I should probably avoid going out with very social people who would not understand me, but I can't always tell that about them from just their profile. I don't really know what to look for anymore. On my OLD profiles I even put that I'm a bit ""weird"" and I'm looking for a fellow weirdo who could understand me (I don't know how else to put it); it's not my fault that guys tend to choose to just ignore this warning and not believe me because I look ""normal"".

Anyone who's working or works crazy hours and has a significant other, are you able to make any time for them? Would it be unreasonable for your SO to expect more communication than a text a day?

I intend to discuss this with him and I've pretty much made my mind up to break things off with him once he has the time to talk... he's still working now apparently and I have no idea when his work will ease off.

Last serious girl I dated was 3 years ago. She hurt me but good. She basically left me for someone else.

Now, 3 years later I'm in another s*itty situation. I'm a teacher and because of my role, have been working closely with another female teacher. We get along great.

She always flirts with me. She comes up with reasons that I have to see her after school to work on stuff. We talk for hours sometimes. She flirts with me, laughs, touches my hands and arms when she talks. This has been going on for a month. I actually like her and developed a crush on her.

Then, after a month of this, yesterday during a convo about COVID and doing things for fun, she casually says she has a bf she met online during covid who lives an hour away. She then asks me if I'm dating anyone and I say not seriously. It floored me. Not this s#it again.

Anyway, I have to work with her on Monday and wondering what I should do/say to keep things status quo and come off like it didn't bother me although down deep inside it did.

I'm planning on avoided her as much as possible because I do have a crush on her and don't want to get hurt but chances are I'm gonna have to work with her next week.

Time passed, I kissed someone else where I lived, and that’s when all hell broke loose for us. For the next 7-8 years, we fought quite a bit. He would flirt with my other friends, ask them out, and just in general, we were at each other’s throats a lot of the time. 

He entered into a long term relationship, and so did I. 

Over Thanksgiving I saw him for the first time since we fought when I visited his families home. I fully accepted prior to coming to see them that he may not be there. That what happened between us is the new reality, and it’s a reality I’m going to have to live with for the rest of my life. 

Well, that’s not at all what ended up happening. 

He came back to the house after working out and spent the next two hours talking to me and asking me questions about my life, things like that. When it was time for me to go, I opted for a non-physical contact photo. 

That didn’t work either. He wrapped his arm around me and pulled me close to him as his brothers stood by. 

Then when I was leaving, I hugged his parents and brothers, again thinking it would be for the best. 

He got up and wrapped me into a huge hug and held me before I left. 

I left feeling like I knew I wasn’t over him, and now I feel freaking stupid because I know he has a girlfriend. 

It’s like what do I do? I saw that in his eyes there was still something there. I hate myself.

45,rebo7z,1639265545,Anyone else think dating apps are a hobby?,"I truly believe ""meeting people and having fun with dating apps"" is a valid hobby. Just as if someone told me ""I play Call of Duty, world of warcraft and elderscrolls"" or if someone told me ""I day trade options on meme stocks on robinhood.""

However, atleast in my experience (mid 20s straight male), dating apps have been a positive experience that have contributed to my personal development.

 I'm actually quite nerdy and really into intellectual discussion and exploring different perspectives. So quite often, I try to match with women who have / are working on graduate degrees. I'm a software engineer by profession, but I've met women working on other fields such as healthcare, finance, public policy and it's a cool way to explore different perspectives and broaden my horizons.

Of course there are hookups and the physical pleasure element too. That's always fun, I'll be honest, no need for further elaboration there.

Lastly, there is an implicit motivator to be more attractive. Like I'm already physically active and workout primarily for long term health and improved performance in sports. But I'll be honest in that wanting to be more physically attractive to women is another motivator for me to keep working out, eating healthy and being well rested consistently. 

Being more attractive isn't just about my body too. There's also my clothes and social skills which I have improved since using dating apps. I think we all know that being better dressed and having social skills are very beneficial.

I've been using tinder and hinge for the past few months, going on 1 date every week or every 2 weeks ish when I'm available. It's been fun and productive use of my time and energy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rebo7z/anyone_else_think_dating_apps_are_a_hobby/

Each time we were together he would kiss me, cuddle with me and stroke my arm, play with my hair etc. just acting very loving. 

On the last 2 occasions we were together it started getting more heated - we were kissing passionately and it felt like it would lead onwards.. but then he pulls away and says “I need to get you home now, it’s late”… I jokingly say “but I don’t wanna go yet..”
He ends up dropping me off home.

That was a week ago and I’ve asked him to hang out twice since this night. He’s declined both times, saying he is busy.. but hasn’t attempted to make alternative plans. Previously he was asking to see me almost every second day!

I’m so confused because I know he has had casual flings before and definitely isn’t afraid of sex etc. I just don’t get why 1: he was so against having sex with me.. and 2: since I tried to initiate it, he seems to have gone off me.

I asked him if he had water I could drink and he said ""No."" I got annoyed by that and asked if he was joking. He's often sarcastic, which I don't usually mind, but I was in a bad mood that day. He said that if I wanted water I could go to the bathroom sink and get some myself. I'm not really sure if I was acting entitled or if he was being rude? I didn't demand for him to get it for me or anything and just asked if he had water I could mix into my drink (I had previously just bought us both a meal for us to share).

I had been annoyed by something that had happened earlier and that comment just made me extra mad. I think the least he could do is not answer sarcastically to me when I ask a simple question, given that I had just driven 30 minutes to his apartment and paid for our food -- in addition to this, it's just water from his sink and the gesture of him getting something for me would have been nice. He also rarely pays for my food (since I don't want him to think I'm using him for money) and I drive to him every time we hang out.

I met a great girl on eHarmony. We talked for hours and wanted all the same things: to find a strong emotional bond that could have the potential to turn into marriage and starting a family one day.

We hung out. It was great. With out conversations, the chemistry was just instant. We gave each other kisses, smiled, laughed together. It was the first time in years I felt such a spark, and that includes actual relationships I was in.

After a few weeks, I invited her over. We hung out, cuddled, kissed. One thing led to another and we had sex. It was great and we were both out of breath afterward. We cuddled and talked of a future together. I wanted to ask her to be bf/gf but enjoyed the natural flow of things so much I decided not to push for it.

Fast forward a few days later and she said her ex texted her out of nowhere for the first time in months. She said she  was previously in a long term relationship and thought she was over him but now is confused and has to take a step back and figure things out. She said she meant it when she said she liked me and wanted to be with me and apologized and asked to stay friends. I told her I was hurt and caught off guard and needed to take some time to myself.

Based on past experiences, I need to cut my losses. The rational side of me knows there's probably a 1% chance I hear from her again, but the part of me that was really into her is like Lloyd Christmas thinking ""there's a chance""

I am absolutely hurt and just want to move past this. I could use any advice, tips, coping methods, anything to help me get over this and back to feeling like myself again.

He invited me to meet his sibling for a double date with their partner. To be honest with you all I was taken aback by this, but said yes, although hesitantly. It seems very soon - we've literally met a handful of times so is it a good idea to meet member of family so soon? And what does it mean? Is he really into me?

my best mate came round tn. I hadn't mentioned this girl to him before. he asked how my love life was and I told him about her. he asked how old she was. I said 16. cos I knew he'd be disapproving. he was still disapproving even with my lie, called me weird. I asked why he cared and why it matters and he said ""it doesn't I guess"". 

but idek why I lied. I shouldn'tve. I shouldn't give a fuck what he thinks even if ik he's gonna be disproving. I wasn't planning on lying. I diddnt plan on anything. I diddnt think he'd ask because how old someone's partner is isn't a question I would ask someone. I feel bad for lying.

I have always resisted doing any form of online dating. I finally decided to give it a shot. I suspect a lot has changed. there is no requirement to put your height, or racial preferences. I guess that is good for a lot of men?

I registered, put distance close (no more than 9 miles apart) I live in a big city btw

I put my age preference + - 5

after a single day passed i got a total of 30 likes, and 2 disappeared.

1. why did it disappeared?
2. since I am not paying for gold (which i didn't know is required to view who liked you), how else can you see who likes you?
3. are the people who liked you bots/scammers? why?
4. why is there no action after the ""noob boost"" phase?
5. any man successful with the app?

Then he slept with his co worker and made her his gf a couple weeks later. This destroyed me. I stopped talking to him. He would send me nudes while being with her non stop. Everything was cool afterwards where I settled for being just a friend but not really that close. 2 days ago he blocked me on everything then unblocked me a couple times. He says that he can’t stop thinking about me. And when he does he gets turned on. He said when he sleeps with his gf he imagines it’s with me sometimes. I’m thrown off bc he has been with her for 5 months and kept saying he was so “moved on” and “happy”. He says he needs space from me when I don’t even text him or anything. He’s also moving next month so how much more space does he need. He already ruined everything we had I just don’t get why I’m blocked right before he’s gonna move.

89,ref9ep,1639277315,Childhood sweetheart approached me for sex while I'm starting to date someone else,"I've started dating someone (Girl A) and we've had a good first date. We did an escape room in town, got some food, and we went back to her place. While we were there she didn't want to do anything intimate, but she was eager to arrange a second date and so was I. She's told me she wants to go very slowly, which is okay by me. We've bonded over a few weeks prior to this date. 

As a preface to this, I've been unsuccessful for dating for a few years. I've had plently of dates, but for one reason or another things haven't worked out. I'm liking that this is going well but I feel continually on edge as every time this has happened I get heart broken. I've been out of a relationship for 5 years, and haven't had sex for two.

With the second date coming up, an entirely alien situation's happened to me. A school sweetheart (Girl B) who'd I'd had a bit of a crush on and had been in a relationship for the better part of a decade has broken up several months ago, hit the gym in a BIG way, and flat out invited me to sleep with her (phrased in a more creative way). This is a complete fantasy made real. 

I like the girl I've started dating and it's going well, but it remains to be seen if this is going to continue (we haven't even discussed the 'big' dating questions like wanting kids, nor is there any hint if we're sexually compatible yet). She's heading back up to the netherlands in a few days after our upcoming second date to see family, so I'm probably not going to see her until new years. 

So reddit, what would be your opinion on taking up the offer of Girl B while I'm in the early stages of dating Girl A? Is this morally wrong? Should I try and buy some time with Girl B to see if things with Girl A is going to progress? Is there a way to articulate to Girl B that I want to, but I've just started seeing someone and want to see if it pans out, or would that make them feel completely inadquete? 

I have anxiety that there's a real path here that causes me to lose both opportunities, and return to the utter sheer hell of dating which I honestly can't bare anymore. I am deeply craving intitmacy at this point.

tl;dr Just started dating Girl A, it's going well but Girl B has told me she wants to sleep with me. Worried to mess up both opportunites, need opinions on what others would do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ref9ep/childhood_sweetheart_approached_me_for_sex_while/

She used for me for genetics and other stuff and so I really hated that. I let her know and told her to quit texting me, I needed a break. I didn’t unadd her or anything it was All fairly friendly. 

Now I stopped talking to her early last week. She first sent and deleted snap to me last week. Then today she unadded me from Snapchat and unfollowed me on insta. 

I mean what do you guys think, does she hate me now or what? I mean it’s not like we had something going on and I interrupted that by stopping our text cycle, there was nothing, frankly, she was probably annoyed of me because I was always texting her. And now this?

She went as far as to record a video of me in class when I didn’t know I was being recorded, and then posted it making fun of me. Whatever… right?

I was obsessed with sex, was admittedly insecure and got a lot of my validation from women. I strung a few girls along and used them for sex. One girl really love me for me and I dated her for a year and a half and refused to commit. I kept cheating on her by having sex with other girls that I met online or at bars with my friends. I didn’t even really view women as people and I was always after the hottest one. I’ve grown up a lot since then and I realize how fucked up some of the stuff I did was. Most of my friends married in their late 20s/around 30 and even then I would give them shit for settling down. As time has gone on I’ve realize that I really want a children, and a wife. My dating pool is a lot smaller now and I’m having trouble finding women in their 30s who want children. It seems like a lot of the women that I’ve dated recently around my age (30+) are either still single because they don’t want children or would have been open to children when they were younger but The guy wasn’t ready to settle down and so they focus on their career and changed their mind. I’m starting to feel like I waited too long to settle down.

Looking back, I’m realizing that that one girl in my 20s was probably the girl that I should’ve settle down with. I think that was my wife and I was just too immature to realize what a rare connection we had.

Most of my guy friends have created a stable life with a partner, own their homes, are financially stable, and have begun the journey into fatherhood. I’m happy for them but it’s hard for me to watch. I feel like less of a man.
