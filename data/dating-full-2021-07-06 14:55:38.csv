He told me I can always text him first too (he usually initiated the conversation, but lately takes forever to reply back).

The second time I confronted him, I said: 
Hi *****, I noticed that texting isn’t really the right way for us to communicate, and would like if we could hang out a little more in person since it’s always a lot of fun. No pressure at all, but if you’re not up for that anymore just let me know, I respect whatever you decide on☺️

The story of a weak, quirky man who wins the heart of a beautiful woman primarily through pure devotion and acts of servitude, presents a false representation of how attraction actually works. Logically, we all know these stories are fantasy, but somehow this idea is still adopted and accepted by a large number of men. This often leads to situations of unhealthy infatuation, years in the friend zone, or a pattern of unrequited attraction.

We want to be in relationships with those who make us feel comfortable, we can have fun with, laugh with, who evoke positive emotions.

Since men are visually driven, we will project our idealized fantasy of someone if we have a high level of physical attraction to them, instead of vetting them and getting to know them as an actual person before developing deeper feelings so quickly. Women may find someone they find physically attractive, but are typically more concerned how someone makes them feel before developing feelings. This is primary reason why some handsome guys will sometimes have trouble holding down a long term relationship.

It is crucial to take your time to get to know a woman and not fetishize her beauty before deciding that she is someone you want to be with. Beautiful Women may be aware that they are attractive, but don’t view themselves as un flawed goddesses that some men make them out to be. They can be clumsy, they have frustrations at work and with family. They do mundane things like go to the grocery store.They can be insecure. They are human, just like you.

If you find yourself acting nervous or feeling unworthy around someone, ask yourself if you’re projecting your needs and desires onto them or fetishizing their physical appearance, rather than seeing them as complete. Can they feel safe and comfortable around someone who is intimated by their mere presence? There is no way a healthy relationship, or any relationship at all, can happen with that dynamic. If you cannot be yourself and feel like you are in their equal, you must realign your thought process and focus on staying present, not projecting needy fantasies onto women you truly don’t know.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,881516,public,self,"Men’s advice.

My (17F) boyfriend (19M) and I have been together for almost 2 years. We ae both in college. We are also each other's first serious relationship and we both are each other's firsts. His parents both advise him that he explores other relationships before really considering the one. I believe this is good advice as well, but how do I get over this feeling of sadness when I think about it. I understand that we are both so young but when I think of our future (him as well) it's long-term and I want to grow and learn with him in the future. He's helped me so much to grow as a person and I've done the same. I really love our dynamic and the love that we have for one another. He even asked me the other day if he was someone I would marry and I told him yes if we were older and he said the same.

But since we are so young and haven't explored the world or other options I believe that they're right as well.

May you please advise me to think about this logically rather than emotionally as it hurts to think that I am not 'the one'.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,881530,public,self,How can I get over this feeling of not being 'the one',0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oexp4b/how_can_i_get_over_this_feeling_of_not_being_the/,all_ads,6,,,

Highly doubt this post will solve anything, but here goes.

Prior to the first date, we'd been texting on and off for about a month, before finally settling on a date – and it was amazing. We talked non-stop for about 6 hours till late at night, walking about singapore's beautiful marina bay till 3am. That was exactly a month ago, and since then, I couldn't help but have her running through my mind everyday. Goes without saying that thoughts of how things might progress with her, or how a future with her would look like, have gone through my head endlessly. Couldn't wait to meet again, but busy schedules (mainly hers) put it off till a month later (today). 

Then, we met today, and I just couldn't be the same for her. 

As it happens, the last couple of days of work have been particularly stressful for me, and being myself, the thoughts have crowded my mind, especially some insecurities with my ability at work – and tonight, I just couldn't be the same for her. Just wasn't able to have a presence of mind. And the insecurities carried over to my being good enough for her. 

I found myself not being able to hold a conversation beyond sharing things about myself, or asking things about her. Idk, perhaps it wasn't that different the first time round, but it certainly was a much more magical night on the first date. Perhaps this is all in my head (what isn't in our heads anw) – but what if we don't really have that much in common, or we don't really get along as well as I thought? Then again, I believe 2 people need not have everything in common to share a beautiful friend/relationship. 

This isn't a first for me. Second dates seem to pose a formidable challenge – most of my intrigue in the other person is expressed on the 1st date, while the 2nd date seems to carry more pressure to impress the other party. Then again, they did say yes to a second date right? Now I wonder if she sees this as anything more than a hangout with a friend, or if she considers it a date too – my feeling tells me it's the latter though. 

And frankly, on many accounts, she's out of my league (cue fitz and the tantrums). She's a hustler jumping from internship to internship (we're both undergrads), a lot more capable, a high achiever, had a couple relationships before. While I'm rather average at school and work, and have not been in a relationship before (although others have told me I appear alot more capable and ""sorted out"" than my confidence lets me believe). 

Wonder if anyone else shares this experience with second dates. Or just any thoughts on this situation.

I’m a 25 yr old male, currently finishing up school for a STEM major at one of the reputable universities in Los Angeles. 

(And have a military background, fit (I often participate in Spartan Race), Korean-American, around 5’7, 173 lb.)

I’m writing this to get some perspectives from the ladies on a situation. Thank you in advance!


So I’ve noticed the dating scene has changed a lot: Due to the pandemic, it’s even more difficult to meet people organically. So I’ve been using Hinge and went on a couple of dates, but either the dates didn’t meet the expectations or didn’t really progress where I want it to be.

I took a break for little bit and recently went on the app again. And there, I found the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen before… she was so my type!
(she had her professional headshots on the profile so there were no filters or anything)

Her information as well - Her profile said she works at a tech company and we share common interests. And we are the same age as well.

I’ve had a couple of LTRs and some flings in the past, but oh boy, she was like the perfect girl that I’ve been wanting.

Well… I sent her the free rose I got on Hinge but no response :( So… I searched her handles but couldn’t find any, expect her linkedin. (I know that’s creepy but guys become weirder in front of their crushes lol.)

At this point in my life, I know what to expect from dating and I am not delusional nor desperate either - I just genuinely wish to get to know her because so far based on the profile, EVERY ASPECT of her fits perfectly to my type, and I’ve never felt this kind of attraction just off of a profile. It takes time for me to be attracted to someone. It’s weird.

So ladies, what do you think about the situation? What could be the best course of action for me if I want to pursue her and not come off as creepy?


P.s Yeah after writing this out, I found out that I’m way more into the idea of being with her than I thought xx

I guess this is going to be more of a vent, but if anyone else feels this way and might have some advice, it’d be appreciated.

The title sums it up: I want a relationship. I want to experience what it’s like having your other half. I want to enjoy physical intimacy. I want emotional intimacy, but I feel stuck because I don’t find anyone attractive.

A couple weeks ago I tried downloading tinder. Despite my age and the fact that I do not follow gender roles in the slightest appearance wise, I got 100+ matches in that “people who like you” tab. But looking through them, none of them appeal to me. I look at them and feel nothing. Not even the slightest desire.

It wasn’t always like this. I went on dates and dated people when I was 16-18. I dated seven people in a row and had no problem finding my partners attractive. Now it’s like everyone I look at just doesn’t appeal to me.

I’ve tried dating people since 18, but I’ve slowly come to realize that I’m just not into it. I don’t feel a spark. You know the spark, right? That feeling when you’re really into someone. I don’t get that anymore and it’s tremendously lonely.

I want to feel attraction for someone… I know it’s not impossible because I felt it in the past.

Prior to COVID I traveled a lot and went to a lot of social gatherings. I have a lot of friends and many of them have asked me out. But I never feel anything for them, and I don’t want to be in a relationship where I don’t feel anything. I haven’t felt that spark since I was eighteen.

I’m a 27 year old cishet man. I’ve had a ton of diverse experiences in my life with different types of people, jobs/trades, and experiences. I come from a strong and successful family and have had nothing but good influences from my parents and other role models. I live in a city 2000 miles from my hometown, working remotely as a mechanical engineer in a job I absolutely love and take seriously, and which pays me very well. In that job I have nearly complete autonomy and the ability to travel and schedule myself as I please. I own a house and a nice vehicle, and a beautiful, healthy, well-behaved dog. I have money coming in from diversified sources representing multiple contingency plans. 

I cook or bake for myself most nights and actively work on getting better at it. I can make baguettes or cheesecake that you’d think were from a bakery. A love for mountain biking has caused me to take fitness very seriously, and I plan to begin competing in the next year.

My sexual needs are those of a submissive, and I am very much Demisexual, to the point where I sit here and can’t even imagine having enjoyable sex with a new person.

My biggest shortcoming is that I have no patience for much of anything. If I turn down an aisle at the grocery store and someone is in it, I turn the other way because it feels like the most efficient thing to do. If YouTube gives me an ad, many times I just shut the video off. I also grew up a little bit on the spectrum in the aspergers direction, and although I’ve gotten better now at empathizing and recognizing what people are feeling, I don’t necessarily understand it or respond to signals. 

Throughout life I’ve set goals for myself and continually worked to meet them, save one- I haven’t the slightest prospect for a good significant other. I’d like to find someone who takes fitness seriously, has a successful career and who is sexually dominant. I’m not interested in children, but I would very much like to have a small family with an s/o and animals. Every so often I’ll find someone close, but it falls apart after a couple of months when we both start feeling like it isn’t quite right.

I was really busy then and could only see him once every 1-2 weeks, so by early May I’ve only gone on ~7-8 dates with him, although most of our dates are pretty long (half a day-ish). 

By this time he had developed feelings for me and told me that, and we ended up sleeping together around the 6/7th date (very unusual for me, I’ve only slept with exes in the past after many months). I was attracted to him but had hesitations due to his history of casual sex and feeling like I didn’t know him well enough yet (we are also from different cultures). Once we slept together, I told him I wanted to be exclusive as this is huge for me. He agreed and went one step further asking me to be his gf.

I wasn’t ready at that point as having the bf/gf label means a lot to me - typically once I acknowledge someone as my bf, I would start introducing them to my family &amp; friends, and I would be very committed to the rship in trying to make things work. For him, the threshold for labels is lower - it just meant that he liked me and could see this going somewhere.

Anyway, he asked twice and I said no and to give me time. In mid June we went through a period where we argued a lot and almost broke things off. One time we were arguing about how he didn’t feel security from me, and I brought up labels and said we could label it if he wanted to, but he felt that it didn’t make sense to jump into a rship when we were arguing so much (I agreed). 

Fast forward to now, things have been really good for the last 3 weeks or so, and my feelings for him have increased a lot as we spent a lot of time together. I sleep over ~3 times a week (sometimes we have dinner, sometimes we just hang out and cuddle) and we go on at least one long date a week. I’ve also met his family and friends (introduced as a girl he’s dating).

I brought it up again and thought he would be happy (since it was a source of conflict for us in the last 2 months), but he actually said no. He felt that between when he first wanted labels and now, there are problems/ issues between us that arose that he doesn’t feel like we have resolved yet (nor does he have the solutions to some of them), and wanted to monitor the situation and see how it goes before we move things forward. I know he’s serious about me as we’re exclusive, I’ve met his family (he’s only brought exes to see them before), he spends most of his free time with me and remembers small things about me, he planned a whole weekend getaway recently and we had a lot of fun. He said he still wants me and wants things to work out but he can’t give me the security right now that I want (ie that of labels - my feelings have reached a point where I am now somewhat insecure if we don’t label it) until he has a better sense of our compatibility, and he can’t tell me how long that will take. 

So now I’m stuck and this is weighing on me. On one hand I know I asked him to wait so if I rush him now it feels like double standards, on the other hand isn’t a relationship about working through those issues together, rather than requiring that we’re a 100% fit before jumping in? Also, if the threshold for him previously was Low, why is it so much higher now?

I (F22) am on the fence whether I should wish my ex-boyfriend (M22) a Happy Birthday. We dated in Highschool and recently graduated college. We broke up around Sophomore year of college due to lack of communication and just being busy doing our own thing. So we ended amicably.

Next thing I know, couple of days after my dreams, he follows me on my social media. We haven’t spoken, but to dream of him and then he follows me on social media was weird to say the least. 
Well, it’s his birthday today, and I’m wondering if I should message him to wish him a happy birthday?

 We hung-out 4 times and I'd usually spend the night and we'd get breakfast. We hooked up the 4th time. I get that's not that long, but it was enough for me to go ""I really, really like this girl.""

After we had sex I told her I liked her and I guess she didn't like that. I texted her a few more times trying to make plans but she always flaked out. Eventually, I just decided it was best for me to delete her number and move on.

We hooked up in December. We hadn't talked since March. I still think about her often, but I hadn't reached out more than a handful of times since December. There shouldn't be any bad blood between us. I never was rude or tried to make her feel bad for not liking me. I just laid my feelings out there and when they weren't reciprocated I just went ""okay."" I was unemployed, living with my parents, and 5 years younger at the time. I get her sentiment. She was kinda rude about it, but obviously I get why I wasn't a catch at the time.

I recently got employed and moved back into the city I met her in. I was grocery shopping and I looked up and she was right in front of me. Figured it would be better to say hi than to awkwardly stand behind her. She gave me a hug (I think) and asked where I was living/what my job was like, etc. She said she either missed me or wanted to hang out and I should text her. I told her I lost my contacts ( I didn't, I just deleted her number) and she was like ""oh I'll text you."" She probably won't but it was a nice gesture. It turns out I actually did have her number in my phone, but I haven’t texted her.

It just felt like Dazed and Confused by Led Zeppelin was blasting in the background. I won't get into details, but she didn't treat me well when we were hanging out. I was an option when she was bored.  Can't say for sure, but at the very least there's some emotional instability. I'm not saying this to beat up on her, but it's just what it is. Even if she were interested, she's not the best option for me and I know that. But at the same time I've never felt more comfortable around somebody ever in my life. She knows we clicked. She knows there was sexual tension. She just told me the night we met that she wouldn't date that much younger and I was stupid enough to think I could change that.

I guess this is all pretty much irrelevant at this point. I'm just ranting. I feel like shit. I had a dream about her. I woke up thinking about it. I can't focus. I've never really run into an ex or hookup before and it just fucked me up. If she does text me, what should I do? I’m assuming she was just being nice and if she was interested she would’ve texted me by now. Then again, she was an awful texter when we were friends. Idk.

We've been dating for 5 months, and things are going great between us. We're very compatible personality-wise as well as physically. He's made comments before about how he finds me attractive. Usually, he'll tell me something about how he likes my eye color, that he thinks I look hot when I'm tan, or that he likes my body shape.

Well, yesterday we were hanging out and I was swimming with him at his house. He was going on about how hot I looked in my bathing suit... then he says it. He told me that I looked like ""some sort of mixture between a Brazilian model and a geisha"". I just sort of laughed it off and said ""I guess that's a good thing"". Wtf is that supposed to mean though? I get that he thinks I'm hot, but the comment came off a little weird to me. 


First off, I'm neither Brazilian or Japanese (I'm Swiss and Korean). Secondly, instead of just saying oh you look like a hot mixture of someone Brazilian and Japanese, he said ""Brazilian model"" and ""geisha"". That specific wording just felt really... stereotype-ish to me? Idk what about it, but it just didn't sit right. Thirdly, it just feels a bit bad to have my bf try to tell me what race I look like. It brings back memories all the way from elementary school of when people used to try to play guessing games of what my race was. I know that's not what he was doing. I honestly think that he's just really naive when it comes to discussions of race. He grew up in a really predominantly white affluent area, so I think he's just not aware that I would view it as anything but a compliment.

The first couple weeks felt very casual and fun, and I honestly wouldn’t think about him much when we were apart. He went away for a week and when he came back, told me he missed me while he was away. I didn’t really have the same feelings at the time, but thought it was cute. 

Since then, we’ve been seeing each other much more frequently (2-3 times per week), and he stays over. So I’m essentially seeing him almost everyday. He has a toothbrush at my apartment (practical… right?). A main focus is definitely still sex, but we’re also extremely cuddly and tell each other pretty intimate details of our lives. We cook together, go to brunch on the weekends and he casually brought up me maybe meeting his friends.  

It feels like the start of a relationship, but I’m nervous to bring this up. I’d be happy keeping this as it is and I’m scared a conversation will change things, or put one of us in a position where we’re conceding to what the other wants over fear of losing what we have going.

me: what are you up to?
him: actually was going to ask you to go to the beach tomorrow
me: i have an appointment and work but next week works.

So he messages me asking what I’m up to Tuesday, even though we kinda planned for next Wednesday. I didn’t answer him til later or the next day and asked what time we were meeting. He told me he had an assignment due and couldn’t meet up, to reschedule for next week and asked me when I’m free. 

I didn’t answer for a day. Long story short, he knew I went to a party and asked me how the party was. We facetimed and I asked if he was mad because he was acting weird.

It was nice, no fireworks or anything but she was attractive and we seemed to get along well.  But it was just one date and then I fell in with Patty (2 year woman).  While with Patty, Jan actually messaged me on FB about a year after that one date asking if I were single and then saying ""Well I guess I missed out"" when I didn't respond (I didn't respond because I wasn't sure who it was and Patty would get CRAZY jealous if she heard I messaged a woman).  Fast forward to last week when I got a new notice from bumble (I had canceled my account when I got involved with Patty) that Jan had liked me -- again.  I liked her back and we started chatting.  Then we went on this date yesterday.  It was super casual.  We laughed about the situation.  Had some nice conversation, yadda yadda yadda.  I like her.  I think she's extremely attractive.  I think *she* thinks I'm attractive.  I mean, why else would she match me twice 3 years apart *AND* message me on FB out of the blue??  After about 1.5 hrs, she says she needs to go talk to her daughter.  I ask if I can walk her to her car and she agrees.  At the car, she turns, holds her arms out and I go in for a kiss.  I then go for tongue.  She is clearly a little shocked.  She didn't exactly object, but she certainly didn't get into it, either.  I pull back and apologize and she says, ""You're ok,"" and puts her hand on my arm.  We say good bye and she leaves.   

OK:  WTF was that?  Was I out of line with a passionate kiss?  I guess I tried to move too fast.  Do you think I blew it?  Should I even bring it up in messages or anything?  Again, I'm super awkward with dating.  

TL;DR - Woman who I dated once 3 years ago, sought me out unsuccessfully two years ago, then matched me last week.  Had a date and I tried to tongue kiss her but she wasn't ready for that.

I don't know. Go crazy. 

I never had much skill talking to girls (having been an introvert and was at a boys school through junior and senior high school and literally only the first year of uni was I ever in the same class with girls and never again since no girls majored in physics that year so I never did get exposure to having girls as friends and thought I never needed it anyway). I had issues of low self  esteem and subsequently avoided girls almost religiously.

There were girls (before) who I suspected liked me but either I never had the guts to ask out or just thought they were out of my league and couldn't possibly like me. (I kinda have this thing in my head that there has to be some form of mutual interest in one another for me to ask a girl out. I'm too self conscious to ask a girl who I'm sure doesn't like me in that way)

By some stroke of luck of whatever it was I met someone, got to like them and long story short were dating from March of 2017 to a week and half ago. 

We had our issues through the years but I always believed that we were going to get married so I shut my eyes to them and tried to work them out with her and work through my feelings when we couldn't meet. I just wanted focus on getting financially stable to support us.

Our story feels too long to summerise so I'll just share a message I sent to her elder sister the exact Sunday before the past one. 

****

Hello good morning.
I have a favour to ask of you and there is no easy way to say this I'm just going to go right in.

This message is going to be quite long and I apologise for that but it can't be any shorter.

N___ and I have been having problems. I don't think I know exactly when it all began but our communication has been very poor lately and has taken a turn for the worse in the past few days.

At first I just tried to be understanding and took it for school on her part. Since I've also been a little busy myself I tried to brush it off but tried my best to keep in touch when I could.

I will say now that I have had a weakness with being consistent and keeping in touch with loved ones so I'm not proud of the effort I made but I really did try. I say this so as not to paint myself as pure. I have my weakness so let that be known.

She is your sister so I know it will be more than natural to side with her over me and I'd expect nothing less than that from you.

Anyway of late I'd started getting depressed about how we were not really communicating that well and not seeing much of each other. That last time I saw her was the time when she was coming from seeing you and the newborn and that was just for a short while.

Each time I'd ask when could I see her she'd tell me the timing was not right and to wait for later but she'd not get back to me about when I should go.

Each time she did that I'd get disappointed but try and tough it out thinking I should understand her and her school situation. My mental health took a hit and I'd get more and more anxious and that made me  feel less and less motivated to call and all this while she doesn't call and has not called me come and see her in many months.

I've kept getting worse and many times I did not realise it but the longer I waiting the more I could not about the situation on the phone. I'm sure you know that some things are better said in person.

All this 'we need to see each other but she tells me we can't' kept affecting me and must have made a feedback loop where I got worse by the day.

Maybe a month ago I'd asked to see her but she told me she had tests and maybe I heard worng but it sounded like she said it would be on a Tuesday and Thursday and the same week. I got excepted thinking I'd be able to see her on Friday or Saturday. I reached out when I thought she was done only to be told her next paper was actually the following week which hurt me a little but I decided to brush it aside.

I'd been feeling low so I didn't ask to meet immediately she was done but then asked to meet after 2 days and again excuses. 

Last week or so, my efforts at trying to keep in touch over phone were met with excuses about needing to get things done at school which I tried to be understanding but it still hurt. I decided to try and tell her (via text) that I was feeling depressed and she just told me it would be fine. I went futther and told her it had something to do with us and she said she knew. At that point I tried to call but she cut the line and texted saying we should talk later. I didn't a time frame for later and was feeling low so I let that be but spiralled into worse depression. At this point let me just ask you not worry too much about me. I'm a little used to this feeling. It's not that bad but I don't think I've felt this consistently depressed since before I met her. Again, I'm not trying to sympathy, I'm just trying to tell me side.

Anyway she never did get back to me the next day and our WhatsApp convos were not great either.

I started trying call the following day and the day that followed but she did not pick up the calls which prompted me to reach out to you yesterday.

I did something I've never done by just imposing that I would come over and see her today which tried to dodge but saying she wanted to go to church and also she has her roommate's friends wedding to attend today.

I told her I too would be missing church I did not accept that excuse and as for the wedding, it's a roommate's friend so it may not be as important. I tried to explain that it was important that I see her for my mental health so that at least I know what is going on and have peace of mind as it was affecting me too much. I've felt like giving any time over but because I didn't know exactly what was going on I felt I needed to wait till I knew for certain and not make assumptions that I couldn't prove.

She agreed that we could meet today and I told her that I would be starting off at around 8.

I started off a little earlier in Kalulushi (76km/47Mi from where she is at school) so that I could be in the bus in kitwe by 8 and move well since public transport is unpredictable. Whilst on the bus I receive a WhatsApp from her saying she today was a bad day and that she had already prepared to go to the wedding.

At that point I tell her I was already on the bus and it had already started off. She complained that I didn't tell her when I was starting off but I don't know if I did wrong to assume since we'd set a program she'd be expecting me so I wanted to only call when we'd already moved a bit.

I tried to tell her it's just a friend's friend and she should wait for me but she then texted saying she had already gone.

Thinking she my have just been dodging I still went anyway and true enough there is no one at her Apartment. She's not picking up her phone and she's offline. 

I don't know what is going on and I don't know what to think of her actions and what she wants me to think of it all which where I want to request a favour.

I want to know what is going on. I have had am manner of thoughts about what could be happening but I don't want to assume anything because I could be wrong.

I ask that you don't bring up how much I've told you. At best you can just tell her I've said she's avoiding to see me and is not picking up my calls. She does not need to know how much I've told you or she may not open up. Try just to get her side of things which you could tell me. This whole situation is driving me insane and I would just like to know what exactly is going on.

Again I ask please don't reveal how much I've told you. I'm not trying to create to gain your approval and I don't want her to think I told you this so you can side with me. She's your sister so side with her as much as possible. I just want to know what is happening. The full truth.

I still love her a lot but how she has behaved over the past months has weakened my spirit.

Also don't call her until the end of the Day. I want to wait and see if I can still meet her.

*****

It turns out she didn't really go to the wedding but just ignored when I knocked at her door (I know knocked anyway even she said she'd gone). 

5hrs later she came back online and I went back to see her, this time she opened. when I asked about why it felt to me like she was avoiding me she said it was she was no longer feeling us and needed space. She said she was not sure if she loved me though a small part of her hoped things would change (her words).

I told her she'd get her space but I'd been hurt too so I don't know if I'd be there if she came back.

Told her space would just put me back in a state of hoping and not getting any fulfilment.

I thought it'd be at least nice for her to hear this after a long shift of just standing there all day

Most people would’ve brushed it off, but it just felt icky to me. I didn’t say anything and tried my best to ignore it and to focus on him as a person.


He seems like a good person at heart, and was very affectionate. It just didn’t feel right at the time, since he was getting ready to be stationed in Europe for an indefinite amount of time.


I noticed that we’re still connected on Snapchat, but it looks like he removed me as friend since I can’t see his snap score. I don’t currently use any other forms of social media, nor do I have his number anymore, so Snapchat would be the only option for me to reach out.


Looking back, I could’ve done more to at least maintain a meaningful connection from a distance, but chose not to subconsciously. I regret loosing this connection. I’m under the impression he might have a gf too, since he deleted me.


For the past month or so he’s been randomly, yet strongly coming up in my mind. I feel compelled to re-add him and attempt to reconnect since we’re both more grown now (late 20’s,) but I’m so afraid. I also would rather try and see what happens knowing I have nothing to lose, rather then be stuck with this feeling. I also don’t know what his personal/dating life is like currently, so I don’t want to accidentally cause chaos.


This guy really liked me, even from a distance. I need some guidance on this…


TLDR; I lost touch with a guy I was briefly seeing from the military a few years ago. It looks like he unadded me from Snapchat probably after realizing our connection wasn’t going anywhere at the time because of differences in our paths at the time, and living in different countries after he was stationed in Europe.

Have met up with this girl 3 times now, first a proper date where we got drinks, talked and then made out on some benches near the bar. Second I went over to her house to watch a movie but since she was on her period we just made out and she gave me head. Last night I go over to her house to watch a movie again, and we have sex. I was fuckin terrible, went about 5 minutes in cowgirl before my dick slipped out, tried to put it in in missionary but couldn't really find the hole and it kept slipping out and I eventually lost the erection.

Got real awkward and we kinda just lay there not talking for about 5 minutes. I literally thought she was about to kick me out but to break the tension I asked her if we could watch a show on her laptop. She immediately warmed up and we watched this TV show, cuddled, and talked for hours, and I spent the night. No mention from either of how shitty the sex was. We woke up and cuddled and talked for another 3 hours. She was really into the cuddling, kept nuzzling her head up to me and dragged my arm over her body and hugged it close so we could spoon closer. I kiss her goodbye and say ""see ya"" and don't really mention seeing her again, since I'm still baffled as to how this girl hasn't kicked me out.

Like 20 minutes after I leave she sends me a funny screenshot from twitter related to something we were talking about?

This guy I’ve been seeing for the last month (M27) told me (F27) he found someone else and wanted to still be friends. We met up, had sex, and now he wants to talk about a relationship.

To be fair I may or may not be moving in a month which is why he hesitated. He told me he was worried about being friends and this other girl not wanting to date him because we’re still friends after being fwb. He tried to cut off our relationship but then was like, let’s meet up. 


We met up and he kept teasing me asking if I had feelings for him and he’s like “just admit it, you got attached.” Hung out and our chemistry was off the rails. We had sex and then he told me to focus on my interview I have that might keep me here. He said he didn’t want to fall for me if I’m not staying.

But what about the other girl he’s interested in? This was after we had this amazing night last week and cuddled. We were supposed to hang out and he wasn’t feeling well after and then canceled on me. 

This weekend when we met up, we tried just being friends but kept flirting with each other. He kept touching me and teasing me. Later he told me that me that he liked “watching me try not to flirt with him” and how “cute” it was. 

When we hooked up, he also popped a Viagra pill that he’s been saving to use with me. Why doesn’t he want to use it with his new lady friend?

I’m just so confused. He went from basically 
“I met someone else we shouldn’t see each other” to “focus on staying, I’m falling for you “in literally like 3 hours.
