I really want to start trying in the future, though I have some more work to do before I can see myself as a dateable person.  I've seen posts here with people my age or older who haven't had any success yet and the responses are usually I wouldn't date a person like you, or I would date a person like you as long as there is a good reason you haven't dated at your age.  Well I haven't dated yet because honestly I have yet to be at a point in my life where I think it would be healthy for me to even try.  I spent the first 5 years of my 20's a functioning alcoholic and deeply depressed.  I had completely given up on all my hobbies, going to college, and stopped leaving my house besides to go to work for the most part.  

Since the start of COVID I have managed to become a mostly normal functioning person again.  I've cut back on my drinking significantly.  I set goals to ween myself off heavy drinking which have been very successful, and I feel that I am completely in control of my drinking again.  I resumed some of my old hobbies, found some new ones.  Began exercising again, eating 3 times a day, actually keeping up with my hygiene now.  I still have room for improvement but I feel my mental state is currently the best it has been in probably 5 years.  I am going to start going to the gym to put on some weight.  I feel that improving my self image is the last step for me to become a person that I want to be.  I'm mostly happy already, I have a decent job in the trades I've held for 9 years now, I own my own house, I'm in decent shape physically, and have hobbies that I enjoy.  

All that being said, I'm almost ready to start dating but I do have some concerns.  Obviously I have no experience, and I have no idea what to say if any questions regarding it comes up.  Is past experience something people ask about when dating?  Telling a potential date ""I'm a 27 year old virgin with a history of alcohol abuse and mental health problems"" really doesn't sound great.

Dont judge me. But what do I mean by cougar frenzy? Ok ill tell you.

Im fully convinced that this big wave of older women that actually went for older men as far relationships and casual dating is pretty much over. It was a time where it was somewhat common like the 90s or the 2000s. But now this wave has long passed over. Older women will not go for men in their 20s anymore. Ive noticed as time progresses the dating landscape gets more difficult. This is something that is evident by the change. I remember growing up and the OGs would tell me how easy going and chill older women were and how they loved dating younger men. The first part is true. They are chill. But man are they just repulsed by younger men nowadays. 

I know this personally because I I approached tons of older women. The results are pretty darn slim with older women. Unless you are swimsuit model you or look way older than a 20 year old you might as well just let them pass by. As soon as they feel like you are hitting on them the put the breaks on everything. They admire that you had the balls to approach but they are forthcoming about telling you how its never gonna happen. Even if you were the first guy to approach her that year. You're not getting that number most of the time.

Even when I introduced myself and we would have great and meaningful conversations, they still couldn't stop harping on the fact that im young or they have a son or daughter my age. Its all hurdles with them. You cant win them over with your personality unless shes a really big kid at heart and most of them arent. 

This is a big problem i run into by total accident because me dating around my own race. The problem is black women never age. So the odds I run into a women who looks like a 25 year old but is 42 is all too common. So even when I actively try to avoid older women I keep running into them.

Now this starts to change once a guy reaches his 30s. They are more open to dating them at that age and more likely to be open to flirting with them. So you can have your fun when you are 30 with the young girls and older women. But if you are in your 20s most of the time forget it. Its futile. Even women in their 20s arent as attracted to guys in their 20s as much anymore. Women just prefer older men. When a women reaches above 30 this requirement goes up by alot.

Now im betting someone in the comments is writing a whole sermon on whole their girlfriend is older than them by 13 years or how their uncle is married to an older women.

(hes from romania in europe) we had a romantic fling, nothing sexual though if that matters. After he left we kept in touch talking short every once in a while but eventually he stopped reaching out and I was hurt by that so I blocked him because my feelings weren't going away and i needed them to, and it worked (kinda).

Now just a few months ago, i searched him out on facebook and added him, he messaged me about how he had been looking for me but couldn't find me, then we had a short convo and i told him about how im moving to spain (in europe).

Then I had started using instagram again, so i added him earlier this month since he had asked and he messages me ""i really wanna see you again, i wish im gonna visit spain soon haha"" and he had told me he had been drinking so i joked around about how i was just a drunk text and he says ""wym?? im texting u because i really liked u and feel we didnt get enough time, it feels good im still talking to you and that you added me because when you disappeared from social media it sucked"" i ended up confessing i blocked him to move on from my feelings from him and he understood. Then i ask him (when he was sober) why did he say those things and what did he want from that? and he says because he missed me and would love to see me again at some point in life, if i want that too. Then i told him that he brought my feelings back and him saying that gave me false hope, and to not say those things unless hes willing to actually visit me. he says ""im sorry, i didnt mean to make u feel that way. but i didnt say i would come or that it will happen i just said i would love to see you again, and i hope that happens. i do still like you but im aware of the context too"" then i thanked him for clearing it up and we had a normal convo after that.

then a week later he sends me a tik tok meme thats like ""hey you should know that you're pretty darn beautiful"" then right after went to sleep but texted me the next morning and apologized and then we had convo but i had to go so i ended it and added ""bye miss u"" and he says ""haha miss u too"" and i asked why he laughed and says ""im not laughing at you i just didnt expect that""

then last week i noticed he posted a song on fb that i had recently put on my instagram story so i texted him this monday cuz i was like you gonna copy me but not reach out? and it wasnt a popular song. so i sent him a song he had gave me and told him that he gave it to me and he remembered and threw in ""and wonder where you got that song from on your facebook"" he had said he didnt even notice i posted it (i call bs but taking at face value haha) then we talked a bit more and had some banter and convo ended. then he slides up my story yesterday and he congratulates me on the vaccine and warns me about side effects. Then I ask for his snapchat so i can add him again and when i add him he sends me a video of him using a vape pen with this brother. Then I send him a pic of my thc pen and he asks if it is cbd or thc and i tell him thc and that i dont smoke actual weed anymore (we did that as an activity togethr) i just use the pen for medicinal purposes. Then he tells me that he doesnt use weed at all and i congratulate him and tell him i stopped for a while because i used it irresponsibly back then, and he opens up to me about how it was the same for him and he tells me all the shit that got messed up for him bc of it, and he tells me hes trying to quit nicotine too and i suggested him to try nic free vape juice whenever he feels ready.

Then he sends me a pic of himself with a joke about the mask, and i replied something funny back then he sent a picture of hum watchhing netflix and i didnt respond because i didn't know what to say.

Does anyone here watch the Netflix show ""Bling Empire""?
It's one of my favorite shows during this TV season. 
I have always felt that even though the show is awesome and I can't wait for Season 2, I can't ignore the fact that all the men on the show are extremely sexy. 
Is that odd to say?
Most of the guys on the show are single except for one or two of them, so I understand if it's odd because of that. 

I dated white &amp; Latin men and women in the past. I don't want a toxic partner to create racial trust issues out of disrespect.

But I've always wanted to date Asian men, without putting labels on sexuality and without all the stereotypes that would come with both our cultures. 
I just always wondered what I've done wrong, dating wise - I have fallen in love with quite a few Asian men in several years, but my love for them was unrequited. 

I have dated white &amp; Latin people in the past, and racial stereotyping was prevalent--even with so many of my exes. I just want to make sure that I don't become the exes and dates who stereotyped me.

Deep down, I've been angry at myself for so long, because I repressed my attraction to Asian men; I felt that ""Maybe it's not meant for you to date them because they may clash with you, culturally and with other things - you never know what they might think.""

I noticed I always got my heart broken by other races, repeatedly. 
I have survived 10 abusive relationships, and I've been single for 17 months. 
I've been scared to get back out in the dating scene, because I value relationships over casual sex; and I often feel conflicted when I have casual sex, because I start to judge myself harshly, for hooking up instead of getting to know someone. 

But I always wondered whether it's okay for me to speak about my attraction to Asian men, because I was scared of being judged. 
It's a sore subject for me. 
I get very angry when I hear about Asian people being victimized in the media, because I have always gravitated more toward Asian people and culture.

I also want to say this, briefly - I'm an empath.
My emotions shift, depending on how someone feels about me - even in meeting someone I find attractive, no matter what race the person is. 
If it's obvious whoever my date is doesn't have feelings for me, I will subconsciously mimic his body language (and I've never known why this happens to me!).

If I sense that the person is interested in me, I try to take things slowly - and all of the men and women I've dated, their personality and actions completely changed when we started dating. 
My mother also said my father's personality and behaviors switched, immediately after they got married. 

I always wondered if I was attracting men who act like my father (in terms of his neglect of love for my mother after they got married), and I stayed because I felt defeated in the dating scene, so long before.
I found myself saying, ""This is not the person I fell in love with"" or ""I love you. You're making me feel sad, and you're dismissing me"", and ""I can't be your seventh priority.""

What do you guys think?
Is it strange that I find all the cast members attractive?

Been seeing this girl for a few weeks now and I really like her. obviously I have more to find out but I've found her very different from the girls ive seen before and id like to continue to get to know her.  


We last met last week and just hung out and then went back to hers and hooked up but didn't have sex. I was teasing her a bit and she seemed pretty into it and we were just joking around and had fun. the next morning she told me to stay instead of heading home. that's when I started to think about her nonstop since then.  


I hit her up again to go out this week and she told me that she thought I just wanted to hookup and she wanted something more serious. she meant it in kind of a ""its over"" way which caught me off guard. I said that I dont just want to hook up and I like you. She then backed off in a way and agreed to talk so I called her and told her that I liked her, and that there were times I couldnt stop thinking about her. She brought up my history with women (all one night stands no ltr) as a red flag for her which I understood. I Realize now that I was in the defensive mode and I probably sounded so cheesy that it came off as fake and lying but I did mean it. Anyways she was a bit iffy on the phone but told me that she liked spending time with me too and agreed to go on another date. But she also mentioned that our dates had been short and It seemed like my only intention was to go back to her place. I didn't realize that but was making a plan for the next date to be more fun and enjoyable.  


Im not one for texting a lot I like to save the talking for the date but I decided to hit her up the day before to talk/see if she was still up for tomorrow. Until then it had been her checking in with me. She said yeah we were good and we joked around a bit as usual. Then on the day of she told me that she didn't feel right about meeting and that she doesn't entirely believe me that i dont just want to hook up. I responded that no big deal about the date but I don't know what to say I genuinely like you. I told her that if she really was done id respect it but I really did like her and would be down to do sometihng more lowkey in the middle of the day rather than night to reduce implications. I just didnt want this to go away for something that wasn't true. She responded a bit to this and asked me a few questions and we joked around a bit but she didn't respond to my proposal. I just kind of ended saying to let me know what she thinks.   


Now I have no idea what to do. I feel like I should give her space to think about it, but its driving me nuts that she thinks that Im not into her for her which I am. Should I do something romantic like send flowers? I also don't want to overdo it and give her all this attention which could be a turn off and drive her away.

Context: Girl in my dorm, been acquainted with for a bit, a while back her and her friend group took modeling pictures with my car. Never really talked much after.
Calling this girl ‚ÄúA‚Äù

So I don‚Äôt even remember how this happened but I started talking to her a bit more and stuff then I took her and a friend of hers to a bar I was trying out. (All under 21 so no drinking). We were together for a while but she went and was on the dance floor for a while and didn‚Äôt regroup until later. I was being flirty wherever I could at first to test the waters but then she was into it so I was like why stop? Anyway here‚Äôs what I mean by flirty: Showed her how to play cup pong and played a game or two with her. Before we went out to the bar she was being really self conscious about if she looked good enough to go/could make a decent outfit. I gave her a few compliments and told her to go with me. When we met up she kinda flirted back and complimented me on my body spray. Later after we regrouped we got in my car and were on the way back to the dorms and the two girls said they were trying to get water from the bar before they left but it was taking too long so I offered them some Capri suns I had in my room. Then her friend (not attractive to me) said thanks daddy ‚Äúmy name‚Äù (caught me off guard but quick thinking) I said nah the only one allowed to call me daddy is ‚ÄúA‚Äù. I forgot exactly what she said but it was like an ooh or something like that. Then on the way back ‚ÄúA‚Äùsaid her belt was crushing her stomach so she was gonna unbutton her pants until we got to the dorms, I said I was chill with it she was sitting behind me so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Then again on the way back her friend (wasn‚Äôt drunk so this was weird) said it‚Äôs hot in here I almost want to take my shirt off (being somewhat sarcastic) and I said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt‚Äù then ‚ÄúA‚Äù says ‚Äúwhat if I take mine off?‚Äù I said ‚Äúfree country‚Äù she said ‚Äúooh naughty my name‚Äù then we talked and stuff going back to my room. On the way to the elevator ‚ÄúA‚Äù also said her ass felt like it was not looking good or something along those lines, I told her that her ass looked great. I gave them the Capri suns then they went back to their rooms. 

The next day I asked if she wanted to get lunch, she said yes but had to cancel. Then I had a brief conversation with her, went well. Later that day I saw a meme that I just had to share with her, so I DMd it to her and we both had a good laugh.

About two days later I DMd her and struck up a conversation, at first I didn‚Äôt think she was gonna contribute but then she invested in the conversation after a message or two.

Long story short she flaked on me one other time, though the excuse was pretty valid (posted evidence on her story etc)

Then two days ago I saw I still have like $300 in university food credit that I have to use by next week or it‚Äôll be wasted so I DMd her and asked if she wanted to get lunch (on me) and she agreed but didn‚Äôt give a specific time. Later on I think I got a snap from her or something and found out she was in the hospital (asthma attack). I stayed by my phone as I was watching a movie and I kept a conversation going, made her laugh, just being nice and there for her (note I‚Äôm trying to date her not fuck her). Anyway it‚Äôs 2 am and I finish watching the original Star Wars trilogy in the lobby and she comes through with her friend from the hospital and she thanks me for being there for her and stuff. Then says we are gonna get lunch or dinner (today) depending on when she wakes up. 12:00 rolls by and I meet one of my female friends for lunch(don‚Äôt post this on social media by the way), around 3 I text ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ask if she wanted to get dinner and she said she didn‚Äôt know since her mom told her today she had to move all her stuff into a storage container before the semester ended. (Evidence on story she wasn‚Äôt lying). I text her a little bit, reminded her that Friday is my last night out downtown and she should come, she said so long as her asthma symptoms keep getting better she would but her throat is really sore. I offered to bring some cough drops from my dorm, had a brief debate over artificial flavoring (playful). Then she asked what I was doing (studying) and wished me luck on my exam. Sent her my score 94/100 and she said she was really proud of me.

Anyway sorry for the freaking novel I wrote I just felt it was best to have more info than less and I‚Äôve shortened it as much as I can. We get along fine,I‚Äôve been flirty and everytime she‚Äôs been into it so what should I do next. Still friends right now. Also after re reading it I see she‚Äôs flaked but most have had legitimate reasons for it, her being into the flirting has me getting mixed signals though. Help appreciated

Bit of backstory, I (24M) just got out of a pretty serious relationship, 4 years, about 4 months ago. About a month ago I texted an old coworker  (27F) who had always expressed an interest in me and had previously told me to let her know if me and my ex broke up. We start texting and things are going well but she told me at the start as a warning that she was a hard person to hangout with as she works a lot. She works 6 days a week but doesn‚Äôt have too many commitments outside of this.

So we text for about two weeks and things are going well, but every time I try and hangout with her she has a reason that she can‚Äôt, that all seem legitimate for the most part. I tell her I can work around this and to just let me know what works for her but it never seems to work out. Probably around the 7th time of me asking her to hangout and getting a no as a response I just say that I am going to give up on trying to set something up and ‚Äúleave the ball in her court‚Äù. After this, she basically goes cold. I could tell previously from her texts she was interested still but after this, it seemed she wasn‚Äôt. We haven‚Äôt been texting as consistently since and when we do, she responds but doesn‚Äôt seem as interested. 

I felt that despite her working a lot that she could still be able to make time for me at some point and was clearly not prioritizing me, but now I realize that we didn‚Äôt have a serious relationship and maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have expected so much from her.

I am not quite sure what to do. I think I may have overstepped the boundaries of casually talking by implying I was frustrated by her inability to hangout but I think telling her that now would be continuing to overstep those boundaries. I would still like to try and make things work but am not sure how to go about it.

Everything going good. Then she gives me her number! Awesome right? Everything's going good till we start texting annnnnd.


I have to carry the entire conversation. For days the most she replied was ""WBU?"" Or just answers. 


So I say ""well obviously she isn't actually interested"" so I stop messaging her and talk to the 3 other women who I've been talking to who all show massive interest. I don't have to carry the convo, it just rolls. Which is nice. 


I run into the girl again. She looks visibly shaken and anxious (at this point we haven't talked in over a week) and I just wave at her with a smile say I hope she's doing well and go about my day. Well later that day she hits me up to talk and then asks me on a date. 

So now I'm like ""ok I guess she is interested?"" I say yes to the date because this girl is unfortunately about 3 times too beautiful to deny a date with. 

We start talking via text again and wouldn't you know it 

I have to completely carry the convo again. She shows 0 interest what's so ever. The only thing that changed was that she tells me when's she's going to bed. And will send me hearts when I say good night. 

So now I'm irritated. If she doesn't like me that's fine. But why didn't she just let it end? It feels like what she's interested in is having someone Interested in her. 

So now I feel hella awkward. Our date is next weekend. And I don't even know if I wanna go. It just feels like it'll be hella awkward. Like part of me wants to try cause this girl is legitimatly gorgeous. And in person she's more proactive about conversation. But still. I feel like being the only one wanting to talk will get old really really fast. 


I suppose this is more of a rant. But I needed to lol. My brother is not helpful, he's a player so all he tells me is to not give a fuck about anything but finding a way to get her in my bed.

Ill go straight to the point my gf broke up with me after long term relationship and i decided to get back on tinder and other dating apps, i met my ex on tinder but it was easier because we knew each other from our hometown so i didnt have to think about what to say at the beginning, basically she was my 1st tinder date and i didnt have to use it anymore.
Now when im back here and match with some girls its hard for me to even start a conversation, i dont know what should i say, sometimes i look at her bio and say something about it sometimes she doesn‚Äôt have anything in bio so usually i just dont say anything to her. 
The problem is that even if my conversation starter is quite good most of them responds with one word or just without any excitement and i feel like i have to drag that conversation- i delete those girls immediately. 2nd scenario is when she responds in a good way and conversation is great but than suddenly she goes quiet, i unmatch from them too because i dont want to waste my time. I never had bigger problems with girls im not very attractive but im not ugly either + i think what usually works is my charisma in person, all my previous dates i met them in real life so there was always some other things to talk about besides my recent ex but like i said we knew each other before.

We had a very good en special relationship and were/are madly in love. But he ended it, because he thinks he doesn't want a relationship. We had already talked about it 2/3 weeks ago and I was searching for a solution. He kept saying that it was getting better, but Sunday he said it was to conform me. 

I was at his house when he broke up with me and everything was fine at first, until I asked about it, he said he was still thinkinwg about having a relationship.I was very upset, because I didn't want to loose him. We went downstairs because it was his sisters birthday and we had a little party (just the parents, her boyfriend , my boyfriend and I). But Everything went downhill after that we went back upstairs and I was sad and he was sad. Than we both begin crying because we both knew something was wrong. He said he didn't want it anymore and ofcourse I started crying even more (he was still crying). I was saying I didn't want to loose him an was whipping his tears away and comforting him. We talked a lot and he said he still loves me.

The next day I had to go to school and I was thinking about it a lot, when we were home I sent him a message that I tought he was to impulsive and he said he was thinking the same way. we decided to leave eachoter alone until Sunday and than we were going to decide what we want to do (it is up to him). But I couldn't leave him alone for even 1 day, I really tried my hardest but I couldn't ignore him, because I miss him a lot.

I've cried a lot of times but I feel like it would be even worse if I didn't have school. Sometimes I cry, but most of the time I feel nothing (not in de way of no sadness, I am full of sadness but it feels like my heart died) and stare. I've already lost 2 kg ( 4.40924524 pounds ) in 4 days, because I am not Hungry and everything makes feel  nauseous.

But i've talked to him about it and he didn't cry after that Sunday and I don't know what to feel about it.
