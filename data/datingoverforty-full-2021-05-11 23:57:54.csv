I think I have still learned a lot but it has not translated into any real success at least here in the States. 

I wrote this [other post a couple months](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/lh2ak6/first_time_dating_in_20_years_sucks_some/) ago, for some reason I find writing this therapeutic. I was kind of ticked off when I started writing and I feel great now. 

Well, I cannot say anything has improved at all.

I have pretty much resigned to the fact that I need to move from where I live to meet anyone.

All local dating has come from apps, any attempt to strike up a conversation with a woman in person has been **terrible to catastrophic**. There are no single women apparently where I live. 

**Improving profiles just increased noise**

I spent a bunch of time improving my dating profiles. At first these seemed to be working I was getting way more matches and messages.

But now some time has passed I have noticed these do not translate into relationships or sex. 

Where I live there are lots of tourists, they match with me and then just want to chat on the app. They never want to hookup or even just hangout, it is the biggest waste of time.

I have had women match with me and say they just wanted to say I was cute. Great, to be honest if you do not want to date me, I don’t care if you think I am “cute”. I can see why some women find unsolicited compliments annoying.

I had another match say she did not want to meet but then she wanted restaurant recommendations.

I had another out of towner match and want to meet, so I went to the bar to meet her, she stopped texting as soon as I got to the bar so I was just standing around like an idiot. I think I saw her at the bar but could not be sure. The next day she texts again and asks I  want to met again. I was like “so you can stand me up again?”. She got made and unmatched me. 

Another wanted to meet but only if I brought a date for her friend. 

**What standards?**

I cannot seem to lower my standards enough to get many dates.

When I first started dating I thought I would find someone like my late wife, smart beautiful, fit, highly educated and successful ….

My standards now are pretty much if you are not morbidly obese or on hard drugs I guess I will give you a chance.

For the guys out there, who think you are not doing well online because of your looks/weight. I am kind of ripped, I have basically a six pack. I work out with guys in their 20s and run circles around many of them. It has not benefited me at all. 

I don’t have shirtless pics in my profile, maybe I should try it?  Feel like I have nothing to lose.

In past two months I have gotten 3 dates, I guess that is good?

**1.** **No Chemistry**

First one, She pushed to have a date right away, which frankly was super refreshing compared to usual wishy-washy interactions I have. 

Unfortunately I was not attracted to her, which kind of sucked because she seemed actually nice. I have no idea why people would want lead people on, I felt bad even though I did not do anything wrong. I hated that this lady was interested, and I could not reciprocate. 

**2.** **Ms Not Available**

The next one was almost the exact opposite of me in every respect, but she worked in the same field. We had absolutely nothing in common at all. I had zero hope or expectations.

We had a great date, I thought “wow, I think I could see spending a lot of time with this woman”. 

Problem she has two kids , a big job and is only free one night a week, unless there is something to do with work comes up in which case she is not free at all.

She also does not do “casual” relationships.

I do not understand the committed one night a week relationship, what am I supposed to do the other 6 nights a week? I guess I am used to relationships where you spend time together and do things like go on a trips together. 

The whole thing was stressing me out, how could make this work? This lady seemed super interesting.  I honestly was probably thinking about her way too much.

We had another date lined up but something came up. I had a huge opportunity to do something I have always wanted to do. So, I asked to reschedule, she said she could not but she understood.

She has not returned my calls since. She was texting me about daily minutia every day, which sounds annoying, but I sort of liked it. 

**Update:** Since writing this she texted me with no acknowledgement of not responding, seems chilly now. I would try to get her to do a second date but have friends in town on the one day a week she is available. 

I feel like it would be stupid to ditch my friends to just buy her another dinner and get another hug. 

I am starting to question whether a **woman having great job is a positive**? It just means they are busy all the time. I don’t need money from a woman, I need companionship. 

**3.** **Young and Drunk**

The next one was this bartender, I met her on swipe app and gave her my number and did not hear from her again.

Then a week or so later I get a text from her. She says we must meet in person because text does not work, so I say ok.

She is a heavy drinker and 15 year younger than me. 

She proceeds to come up with 100 obstacles to meeting, finally I lose my patience and pretty much say “Meet me right now, I am driving to where you are”

It works, we meet hang out for a few hours seems to go great, she seems really into me. She texts a bunch, we were supposed to meet at this pool by where we live yesterday (she lives right down the street).

She disappears, finally texts me hours after we were supposed to meet and says she is not coming.  Not really any explanation so I guess this is done.

I did not have high hopes for serious relationship, but she was pretty sexy so still not happy with this outcome.

**Update:** Since writing this, this one also came back, made tentative plans and **disappeared again**

So yeah, the whole thing is pretty f-ing depressing, but I did have something go well.

**Dating in other countries**

I went on a trip to Costa Rica to fish with some guys. 

I have dating apps on my phone, just on and I guess pinging wherever I am.

As soon as I landed, I stated getting pings, like dozens of them. I think I had something like 150 matches in the first 24 hours.

Where I live there is very few single people, so I did have the filters wide open. Ages 25-50.  I got matches from all ages, all backgrounds, lots of local women but also a lot of expats from USA or Europe. 

Where I live, I might get a date a month tops, here I had multiple dates a week.

**This is what it is like for some women.**

I have way more understanding now for women on apps, because this is what it’s like for some of them. There are so many people to sort through, and it almost stressful.

Weeding out the ones that I was not interested in, the bots, the escorts/prostitutes etc. was very time consuming. 

A lot don’t speak English and I don’t speak Spanish so that is a deal breaker for some, but only some.

Trying to figure out who I should met etc sort of stressed me out as well.  I actually canceled one date last minute, something I would never do or could do in the States. It felt terrible, honestly.

**Differences between there and the states**

· For one almost no women write anything in their profiles. 

· They tend to push to meet right away, the whole lets text for weeks stuff is dead there. They are not scared at all to give out phone #s or meeting in person.

· I had many texting me repeatedly first, which almost never happens in the states.

· Some send sexy messages and images, without much preamble. Never had this happen in the states.

· They don’t seem to care that much about age. In the States I hang around a lot of young people because of the sports I am into. I have had multiple young women compliment me, feel my muscles, say I am “handsome” or a “Badass”, but they **don’t date or sleep** with me. It was different down there.

I ended up dating a woman I met IRL who worked at the one of restaurants near where I was staying. She was having a birthday party with her friends at the resorts pool. We talked for bit she said she wanted to work on her English and we went from there.

I also dated an expat from Canada, she was from tinder. She was great but time was limited and the local woman I met would show up at my hotel when her shift got out and sort grabbed all my attention.

I got super catfished a couple times which is funny now but very annoying at the time since I was only there for a little while. One I just walked in saw her, just shook my head and walked out.

Frankly after taking care of my wife for three years while she died and then being alone almost another year alone, I really needed this to remind me that there is not something wrong with me.  **Why is dating so terrible in the USA?**

Now instead of debating on where in the United States to move to I am considering just going down to Costa Rica for a couple months. I work remotely, why not? 

I am sure someone will tell me that the foreign women just want money well let me preemptively respond to that

· I don’t care, I have lots of money. If women want to date/sleep with me in hopes of using me for money form a line. I’ll take all I can get.

· Women in the states care a lot about how much money men have as well. “financial security”, “financially stable” etc are just code for “has money”. 

· The expat women I dated probably has more money than me, there were local women with good professions that matched with me as well but were just too far to meet. 

To add to the conversation prostitution is totally legal in Costa, and its everywhere. Do you think that radically changes the dating pool? 

I mean if every toxic guy who just wants sex with nothing else can just buy it cheaply and easily, do they still date?

Mary and I were best friends in high school.  We never dated, but mainly because we both always had other things going on.  We went to different colleges and our lives moved on without each other.

When I realized I was going to marry Kelly, I completely cut all communication with Mary.  I knew it wasn't fair to either of them if I continued my friendship with Mary, knowing I had a thing for her for a very long time.

In Jan. 2020, Kelly ended our 20 year relationship, with no prior discussion about martial problems, by having months long affair with my best friend.  Needless to say, 2020 was a rough year for me.

But, I'm back.  I have my legs under me and I'm actually doing really, really well.

So.......I found Mary's one and only tiny social media presence and I messaged her.  I apologized for ending our friendship.  I said straight out that I've always been interested in her as more than a friend.  We haven't spoken in 20 years.  She lives on the other side of the country.  I asked if she would be interested in reconnecting.

It took her 4 days, 4 long, freaking terrible days to respond.

When she finally responded, she was not extremely direct, but it sounds like she might be married and that her marriage is coming apart.  She says she's dealing with a lot and is very stressed out.  She said she knows she won't be able to offer anymore more than friendship for a long time.  She gave me her number and said she hopes we can catch up about the last 20 years.

I can feel the pain and suffering in her response.  If she said she needed a hug, I'd be on the next flight out.

I switched the conversation to text messaging since she gave me her number.  At 5pm, I said I'm excited that we can reconnect as friends.  I took full responsibility for ending the friendship and explained why I did it.  I explained what Kelly had done to me in 2020 and offered to be someone that would listen if she just needs someone to vent to about whatever she is going through.  I said I didn't want to add stress to her life and can go my separate way if that's best for her.

I sent a second message about an hour later, trying to lighten the mode.  Yesterday was a major day for me in my career.  It was a massive win.  So I just wrote her a few sentences about it.  Trying to move the friendship forward.  I have a ton of female friends that I text with nonstop all day long, so I decided to put Mary in that group that I shoot the shit with.  I said I wasn't sure what her schedule is, but I basically don't have office hours, work from home, and would love to hear from her if she wants to talk.

5 hours later, trying to lighten the mode I sent a final message.  Jokingly, I said she didn't need to call as it's super high pressure and that I'd accept a text which is low pressure and what all the kids are doing now a days.

Nothing.  No response.  Just dead silence from her.  I don't know what to do.  I have a million and one questions about what she's been up to.  She friended me on the social media network I found her on, and all her private posts are available to me.  She looks to have been living an amazing life.  There are no posts of a SO, but tons of a super cute little boy she has.  I have a million conversation starters, but I feel like I'm pissing into the wind when she hasn't replied yet.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,47771,public,self,Reached out to an old flame and now I'm in a tailspin....,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nakywp/reached_out_to_an_old_flame_and_now_im_in_a/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,b50cbf0c-3935-11e9-a609-0e217b8f2048,Seeking Advice,,,,,,,,

It was complicated when I was staying and I got a part time job and I didn't make enough money to support myself here, send money home and also splurge some more. Anyway, now I'm here again until next year and I got a better paying job now and I'm thinking about going to NYC in August for my birthday, and I told him to join me there, he just have to pay for his plane ticket and whatever he was to buy but he will stay with me in a hotel (I'm paying for my hotel room) I think it would be a nice opportunity to finally meet each other and have some fun times in the city. He hasn't gave me an answer yet but not so deep inside I know he won't go because he will say he can't afford it or he can't get some days off or whatever, even though I'm always threatening to go where he lives I have never gone, I feel like I'm the only one making an effort here even if it's only empty words.

So I've had this male friend for almost 9 years where our relationship was to say it lightly ""complicated"". I got the feeling he was interested (staring at me, and one time while staring at me walking into a wall, giggling, trying to hug and touch me in a nonsexual way, etc). I kept waiting for him to make a move but he's so incredibly shy and so am I so we were friends. He would talk often to me, opening up about his life and me to him. We had the most compatibility of any guy I ever met, including the same interests. He had a lot of personal issues he was dealing with like his mom was sick and running a store so for a while, he wouldn't be a good boyfriend and I backed away at times. 

Eventually, he moved 4 hours away and we lost touch for a few months (he moved right before Covid) but have been talking. At times our conversations have been flirty (at least in my mind) and enjoyable. He mentioned me moving to where he lives and how lonely he is (because of not being with me or just in general, not sure). Tonight I revealed that I've always had a crush on him but was afraid to tell him. He works a lot (he's trying to recover finances after the loss of his store) so I haven't heard yet but sure I will. I felt awkward telling him but figure if he doesn't like me or want a relationship I know. 

Meanwhile, around the time I started chatting with him I reinstated my OkCupid profile. I started getting responses but long story short, found out most were seeking hookups only. However, a couple of the guys claim they are seeking serious relationships but my experience with online dating shows me many of them lie. I guess my question is what would you do? I plan on visiting my friend in July, and not sure if I should meet these guys before, or not at all.

I've been single I've played around a little bit ( making out, oral) but that's it since no relationship has gotten past that point ( for other reasons) 

 I watched a YouTube video about herpes and have scared myself to death because a condom doesn't necessarily protect you from herpes ( and I love oral sex) and most STD tests don't cover herpes since that has to be asked for separately. When I read that 25% of women have hsv 2 and 20% of men do and then 80% of everyone has hsv one . So in my travels of life I might already have it or either and probably so do you. 

Is it reasonable to request all of these tests from a future sex partner? And has anybody had any good success with that because it's hard enough to find a person I even like let alone somebody that will go along with all this.

what one looks like. Here is a pretty good list that breaks down what to look for in your next relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Taking Interest**: People in healthy relationships take interest in one another. This is usually done in a variety of ways from asking how someone is doing (and not just in the small-talk-passing-on-the-street kind of way), inviting them to do things, and asking deeper questions about how they experienced something rather than just what they did.\n2. **Acceptance &amp; Respect**: This means accepting what we have come to know about the other person and continuing to treat him/her with respect. When we\xa0*really*\xa0get to know someone, we find out things that are not that great about them, and they find out the same about us. Continuing to hold the other person in a positive light (and you being held in a positive light too!), are essential practices in healthy relationships. Additionally, people in the happiest relationships also talk favorably about each other in social situations, and also try to honor the preferences the other person has for things.\n3. **Positive Regard**: People in healthy relationships tend to see negative things the other person has done as honest mistakes or due to difficult circumstances, and attribute positive things as the result of the other person just being a good person, due to hard work, or other positive character traits.\n4. **Meeting Basic Needs**: The basic needs that everyone has in relationships are companionship, affection, and emotional support. People in healthy relationships are focused on meeting these as well as other special needs that\xa0*the other person has*, and they are willing to grow to be better at this. \n5. **Positive Interactions**: Research shows that relationships are the most satisfying when there are quantitatively more positive interactions with the other person than negative. For some relationships, there may be a large number of negative interactions, but as long as the number of positive interactions is a lot higher, satisfaction will remain high.\n6. **Solve Problems:** There are a lot of unsolvable problems in relationships that will continue to cycle through, regardless of solutions, and people in healthy relationships find ways to reduce these conflicts as much as possible. However, there are also a lot of problems that\xa0*can*\xa0be solved, and highly functioning couples will actively compromise and find solutions to those.\n7. **Rupture &amp; Repair:** People in the healthiest relationships are able to quickly and effectively repair damage (ruptures) to their relationships. This means a) recognizing that you or the other person is hurt, angry, or unhappy with something, and b) addressing it in a way that fixes things in a timely manner. Many people wait too long to initiate repairs, some try but make things worse because they aren't sure what to do, and others do not do it at all. A good repair usually starts with an\xa0apology,\xa0or bringing it up in a constructive way.\n8. **Reciprocity:** This means that both people in the relationship are working on this stuff. If only one person is taking an interest, accepting and respecting, giving the benefit of the doubt, meeting the others' needs, providing positive interactions, and repairing ruptures, then the relationship likely has larger problems that need to be explored.\n\n**10 Don’ts Towards Building Good Relationships With Others**\n\n1. Don’t take the other person for granted.\n2. Don’t go to bed angry.\n3. Don’t allow insecurities to overpower your relationship.\n4. Don’t hide things from each other.\n5. Don’t put the other person down.\n6. Don’t hold your pasts against each other.\n7. Don’t ignore each other.\n8. Don’t belittle each other’s dreams.\n9. Don’t be sneaky in their lives.\n10.

This has been in response to having conversations in public places, but far apart (social distancing and all) from one another.  I personally don't like to talk across a room, so I will say something all these lines and usually the person will respond they have been vaccinated too and I move next to them to chat.

Now that the CDC has stated that fully vaccinated individuals won't have to wear masks (in most places - how this is going to work is for another conversation), lots of states have relaxed/done away with restrictions, and the US is nearing a point where (for the most part) if an adult wanted to be vaccinated, they would be in the process or fully vaccinated.

I personally am not interested in meeting up with a potential date if they aren't vaccinated.  No offense to them, it is their choice, just like being vaccinated was my choice - I see this issue as a non-starter for a ""relationship.""

* young men (he’s almost a decade younger than men)

We’ve never seen each other in person or on video but we’ve talked a bit and have a mutual online community.  

The kicker is that he gave me his password to Reddit.  And I’ve seen a bunch of his posts and comments.  I asked if I could read his personal messages, too and he laughingly said no and said it wasn’t anything anyway.  But I got curious and read a couple conversations because I kept seeing so many matches.  I’ve gotten to see so much of him and I’ve learned so much from him but I know he’s one of those guys that could probably handle like 20 of me and needs someone much better than me.  Like, I have no goals in life and he’s got many and a young kid he adores.  He has so much love in his life.

What do I do?  I really value his friendship and learn so much from him and he talks to me and makes me feel safe about all sorts of life situations.

I also don’t want to meet him because he’s super hot and I’m not.  I feel like I’m only getting to learn so much cuz he has this imagination of who I am.

Here's my story...

Last Saturday, a woman I've been seeing on an off during the last 7 months came over. We got dinner, and had great conversation. So great, the time flew by and it got to a point where she was going to have to leave in about 30 minutes because her kids were home alone (they are 11 and 13). Leading up to this date, we had done a lot of texting with sexual innuendo and I felt confident this would finally be the night we'd have sex. Alas, it was slipping away. 

When it became clear she'd be leaving soon, I initiated a kiss that quickly became a passionate makeout session that after some time, lead to our first time having sex with each other. I know it was uncomfortable for her being on her back on the rug (she commented ""rug burn"" at one point). I felt like our bodies had a hard time getting into a rhythm. You could say it was awkward. I'm surprised because our previous times of getting sexually physical, when she was staying the night, we seemed to be hitting on all cylinders. I know in the back of my mind, I had the clock going and worried about her being able to get home instead of enjoying this experience and being in the moment. Of course, I ""finished"", she didn't. She then left about 15 minutes later as now she was running pretty late to get home.

Since that evening, we've been in touch, though it's been more me as the initiator than her. While our texts have been a lot of fun, flirty, with sexual innuendos,  I haven't been getting those good morning/midday check in/ late night texts before bed from her like I did in the past. We are getting together for our first ""day date"", going kayaking this Saturday. It's unlikely we'll have a chance to have sex again for at least another 2 weeks, as we're both single parents. This really bugs me because I know that first experience could have been so much more had I just taken the lead earlier in the evening. It didn't have to be rushed.

Could the hurried first time be impacting her attraction for me? Do I ask for her take on that night, use it as a springboard to a discussion to find out what she likes in bed? I really would like to see things continue on because I see a lot of potential here. I sort of lost her once, and really hate to lose her again.

I recently had a heated exchange with my friend on what I drive and I'd like to get other people's opinion, especially from the ladies.

To give you little background, I am divorced and my 5 year old lives with her mom 80 miles away, and I  bring her over to my place every other weekend. Couple months ago, I dropped off my child to her mom's house and on my way down on the freeway, my car broke down (10 year old Mazda, just over 100k miles). Thankfully it was not a serious issue (spark plug) and I was able to take streets and drove under 30 mph to get home safely. I repaired the car and it runs good now. 

I told that to one of my friend and he recommended that I should get a new car. His reasons are because I drive long distance with my child and it could put her in danger if my car breaks down again. Also if I were to date, it would be more attractive. I don't make a lot of money but I make enough to pay bills, child support, and save, etc. I guess I can buy a car but then it will put me under debt, which I prefer not to. Right now, I'm focused on saving to buy a house and getting into another debt is a no no.

Now this friend of mine keeps telling me I'm cheap and the woman I will date thinks I'm cheap and driving better car will make me look better.. and his shit talking continued (I don't mind that.. we're best friends for 30+ years and we talk a lot of shits to each other). I think otherwise. My car has been pretty reliable except this one time. I rather not spend money on car and either save or go out for a nice dinner. Driving better car may make me look like I make decent money, but it doesn't change my income.. it actually decreases my net asset. 

So does the car that someone drive make you think different of that person? The change I'm talking is like from 10 year old Mazda to something like Tesla Model S or Tesla Model X, which I had the slightest temptation to purchase after my car broke down. That means $1,000 - $1,500 less savings per month.

At the start of the relationship she seemed ready to get into something serious (I told her up front that I was looking for a serious relationship) and it looked like it was heading that way until 3 months ago. We went on weekly dates, spent a weekend together,  talked all the time., and I sense real potential that this was the start of something good. 

Then things changed... she went away for a weekend with her kid and the communication sort of tapered off from there.  I called her out on it and she said she wasn't ready for a relationship and purposed we be friends with benefits. 

2 weeks later she changed her mind and said she didn't want to be just used for sex and to hang out. I gave her some space and told her to call whenever she figured out what's she wanted. 

About 3 week go by, before she reached out again, and told me she's been super stressed because she was helping to.plan her best friends wedding and that she had a cross town move to plan and didn't see how I'd fit into her life. 

We talk for a but and I express how I didn't feel.liek having a relationship was a priority for her and that I need someone who puts as much effort into a relationship as I do . For example.I planned a romantic trip for the 2 of us early in the relationship and I all I got for my birthday from her was a ""hey happy birthday"" text and nothing else. 

Fast forward to last weekend. She calls me as shes getting settled into her new place to help move some stuff and being the guy I am I agreed. She tells me how much she misses me and asks why we don't go on dates any more. I tell her that she seems to always be busy or working and that I don't feel like I'm a priority. 

Anyway, now she wants to have a define the relationship conversation and discuss how to introduce the kids.Honestly I'm not sure if I want to commit seeing how the last few months have gone. 

In a way i feel like.I'm leading her on because I have told her that i like her, but I also don't want to be selling myself short and settling for a just ok relationship where I take a backseat to her friends and the work drama she always seems to have.

Quickly on what’s happened since:

The woman (F40) - let’s call her Svetlana - trickle truthed the length of her trip out of the country that she surprised me with - what was supposed to be 10 days ended up being over a month.  The reveal came every few days.

She came back from travels and then was friendly but sex dropped off. Or more accurately, we had sex twice in a month - each time was amazing, but the frequency was absurdly low compared to prior. And this was even as she was staying with me while her flat was being renovated.

I broached the sex question directly, she said she didn’t have a frequency # in mind but ‘with the right man \[she\] can stay in bed all day’.  (realization: I wasn't the right man)

We had plans for a particular event that only happens once a year, and she did nothing to protect the evening and scheduled work calls, so blew me off. We had made those plans a month in advance. 

We had plans for the following evening and she insisted that we didn’t and that I should switch to the next day, because she had made plans with a friend.

I stopped texting and suddenly she began showering me with texts and emoticon kisses.  

I remembered what it was like to be with a woman who genuinely is into me, and this isn't it.

I'm going to break it off at dinner tomorrow night.

She had said she was looking for a friend who might lead to a long-term relationship; also she said she has depression &amp; anxiety and isn't good with relationships.  Without knowing her well, I wasn't sure how bad that was.  We really enjoyed each other's company &amp; conversations though, and I got to really like her.  She said she really liked me too (and at one point, we said we were developing feelings for each other).  I thought she was giving me mixed signals too.  However, when she realized how much I felt for her, she backed off a bit and said she isn't ready for a relationship.  She explained some bad trauma she's dealing with (and is talking to a therapist) that makes it hard for her to accept love and affection.  She said she can't reciprocate and thought it would be best to just be friends.

After that, we hung out at her place one time, watching TV and having something to eat.  At one point I asked about what she had said, and also asked if she might be open to anything in the future.  She said ""what do you mean?""  I said I dunno and just left it.  We watched TV some more, and when I was leaving, I asked if she'd want to hang out again the next day.  She said she'd text, and she did text the next day saying she didn't feel really well and needed to rest.  I haven't heard from her since then; I had texted a couple times to check in and she didn't reply.  It has been almost 3 weeks.

She had added me on Facebook a couple months ago, and she still has me on Facebook.  I've wondered if it would be okay for me to react to any of her posts.  She doesn't post often, but I noticed this morning she shared a memory from 5 years ago of one of her cats she had.  A couple months ago, she had to have this cat put down due to terminal cancer.

One colleague “B” stated the issue must be I am “giving it up too easily”. While I have never fooled around with someone before several dates, my stance on sex is that it should happen naturally, with mutual respect, when both parties are ready. I don’t withhold sex for a set time, or use it as a device to dredge respect out of men.

Am I mistaken? Is the “making him wait” trope effective and valid, or is it as outdated and sexist as I think it is? I would not call myself a feminist, but this idea seems ridiculous to me. I would think being a confident, kind, decent person who treats others with respect, would garner me some respect from a male partner - not making him wait for sex like a dog balancing a biscuit on their nose.

B has had trouble with women in the past, and this isn’t the first time he’s said something about women that was sexist, hypocritical, etc.

For context  I (48M) separated 18 months ago, been divorced for about a year. 7 months ago I met my girlfriend (43F) on OLD. We are really going strong it's a very solid and amazing relationship so far. 

I told my 3 teenage kids very early on (1 month in) that I had started to date someone which was hard for them to hear - but at least I did not introduce her until two weeks ago. For the kids the divorce was unexpected and they did not take it well, especially my oldest son. My GF now met 2 of my kids and that went well enough. Only my 16 YO son did not want to meet her and stayed in his room. I so want to take away his pain of the divorce but I can't. I am not forcing my kids to spend any time with my GF and we already decided we will not move in together as long as we both have kids at home - but on the flip side I also no longer want to hide her from the kids. I feel they need to at least start accepting that she is a part of my life.  

Shortly my birthday is coming up. If this wasn't a COVID year I would be inviting 20+ people including my GF, my parents and a bunch of friends including my ex-wife with whom the contact is amicable. But now it has to be only close contacts and I find myself overthinking on how to manage the situation wtih my GF and my ex wife. I would like to invite my GF to join along with my parents - but my GF has not even met my oldest son yet and so it may be very awkward for both of them. The kids on the other hand are definitely expecting that their mother will also visit. I set a precedent because I visited my ex-wife on HER birthday last month (after all I am friends with her), and that was just me and the kids. Now it would be super weird to invite my ex but not my GF - and my GF is not fond of that idea (I agree with her). But if I only invite my GF it will create drama with the kids and not quite sure how to explain to ex. I am thinking of inviting both my GF and ex, with my parents as ""neutral"" in the mix. My GF and ex have briefly met and that went well - but that was like 5 mins not a full afternoon. I feel so ABSOLUTELY STUPID for not being able to make up my mind over something seemingly so simple. Any wisdom is appreciated...

Yet, it seems the guys I’ve run into so far aren’t very good at the whole “asking out” thing. I don’t mind doing the inviting, and have, but it’s feeling a bit one-sided.

Another will text and call but make no invitation. I made the first date and want him to take the initiative on the second so I don’t get a repeat of guy #1. 
I’m not talking about doing something that requires spending money. Invite me to a park, on a walk, to the batting cages... something.  Show a little effort.

For those who don't remember or never heard of it, there were a few variations. The first one was you could leave your phone (usually for free) and then people could call a 900/976/other paid phone number to hear messages and get your number. The second way was you could call a phone line (sometimes free, sometimes not) to join a ""party line"" with other people. The third was you called a number to leave a message and got a password and box number to retrieve the message others left you. I'll admit I did all of the above with varying results. 

1. I left my number on a 976 number for free and several called me. One of the most memorable incidents occurred when this guy called. We spoke for months and he told me he was going to come and meet me. In the meantime he kept telling me he was a stockbroker, owned a condo in downtown Chicago. I was a bit young and naive (I was 18 and not very worldy) and believed he was legit. Eventually he came to meet me and we took a ride around. He kept mentioning about me moving in with him and he couldn't wait. He then asked me for a date that night at the Signature Room, a fancy restaurant in Chicago on top of the Hancock Building. He then gave me his address and phone number.  I was so excited and waited patiently for 7pm and it passed. I figured he was running late but eventually I realized he never was coming. The next day I called his ""number"" and found out it was disconnected. I then sent him a letter to the address and it came back ""no such address"". I honestly have no idea what he was up to and why he did this. I was very pretty and very thin (I had just gotten medically discharged from the navy). Did he expect sex or something? He didn't even try to kiss me! 
2. I had been talking to this guy on a party line for months and we decided to meet up. We had exchanged photos and it seemed like it was a sure thing and I was excited. I brought a friend with and he asked if I could pick up a friend of his who lived near me and I agreed. He met us at a local museume with two of his friends. Both of his friends we met there were friendly and spoke to us more than he did. While there he kept avoiding me which i thought was odd. Long story short, on the way home his friend told me he told her he had no interest in me. oesn't end there, the next day I started getting calls from the party line, seems he started giving my phone number around and saying how ugly I was. I could handle him rejecting me but this was cruel? He did this for months and I ended up changing my phone number.

I started a texting conversation through an app last weekend. She's 41.

I asked her after a day or two if she'd like to meet this next weekend and she said, yes.

A day or so later, she gave me her last name and I gave her mine.

As we continued texting I alluded to the fact that I'm somewhat well-known for some of the things I get involved with in the area. (This is hard to explain without going into TOO MUCH detail and I'd rather not, just in case - you never know who is reading.)

Fast forward another day or two and things are going good with occasional texting... when suddenly I could tell something was off. I asked her 3 questions - 1 of which was about plans to meet - and she only answered the other 2 questions. Hmmmm.

I then asked her another question about something else and the answer was short and to the point.

Then the next day I noticed she had unmatched me on the app.

I haven't heard from her since.

I THINK I know what happened:

She Googled my name and there are numerous sites online that have my brief bio write-up and it mentions me being married.

Look, I'm fine with it if she's changed her mind.....or is no longer interested.....or found someone else.........BUT it's driving me crazy to think she thinks I've lied to her, especially since there's always the chance that we cross paths some day by chance.

I'm half tempted to text her (assuming she hasn't blocked me!) and ask her if there's ""something else"" she'd ""like to ask me."" Thoughts?

I’ve chatted with a few guys and they don’t match my need for intellectual conversation and I let them fizzle out.
