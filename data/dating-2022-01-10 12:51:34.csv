0,s0rf6c,1641840836,Taking a break from OLD to work on myself.,"I'm taking a break from OLD to work on myself. I've been back in the dating scene after getting out of an LTR in August 2021. I'm just distraught. I can't seem to land a relationship. I have met some great women, but things usually end after a few dates. Now granted, it's been about 50/50 where I don't want to continue to pursue a relationship vs. they don't want to continue a relationship. I just don't get it. It always feels like something is misfiring. 

\[My stats: 30m soon to be 31, I'm reasonably attractive (have a ""Dad bod""), have a stable job/income (50k a year, no debt), my own place, I'm emotionally intelligent and take care of mental health and go to therapy.\]

What else can I do to make this work? How can I work on myself?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0rf6c/taking_a_break_from_old_to_work_on_myself/
1,s0rfbp,1641840846,Remarriage?,"I’m a divorced (36F) seeing a divorced (47M). We are in a committed relationship, and both admittedly expressed how each other checks off all the boxes and we are so in love. Our kids get along, family adores each other, and we’re both financially stable with strong careers. I have zero complaints!

My only issue is after multiple discussions he firmly states that he does not desire to be remarried.  He does want a life partner and the monogamous commitment, but says he doesn’t see the need to “get the government involved”.

I in the other hand strongly desire marriage. (Prenup and all so we are protected), but I cannot see myself selling my home and uprooting my life for a long term “boyfriend” with no mar in sight. I value marriage and without it would be resentful of him down the line.

Given we’ve only been dating 11 months and I don’t need a ring anytime soon, do I continue seeing this amazing man knowing the conflict that lies ahead, or do we acknowledge the disconnect now and part ways?

I absolutely do not want to lose him, but don’t want to set myself up for a huge heartbreak either when the ring never comes.

As the weekend got closer I was trying to set up a date however her weekend was very booked. At first she agreed to a drink Saturday night. However she said she was to busy, but invited me to a unique spiritual event. I said sure I would go. But than she's like great I'll pick you up at you at your house if you're comfortable.  I said let's meet at a coffee shop first, which she agreed. Then when I asked what the name and location of the event she started to avoid my question and finally said no it's a secret and It would ruin the surprise. At this point it really set some red flags off. I always like my first dates to be comfortable for both parties especially location details. After a that she joked about taking me hostage that didn't really go over well we stop talking that night. The next morning I said screew it and texted her are we still on for today.

i told him i was 21, which surprised him because he thought i looked 18 or 19, but it clearly isn’t a dealbreaker for him because he ended up texting a couple hours later.

my intuition is pretty good and i don’t see myself in a relationship with this guy, but i still think something casual could be fun, but the age difference is throwing me off for really no reason

i just know i wouldn’t even be thinking  twice if it were a 24 y/o asking me for my number, even though i probably have more in common re. experience with an 18/19 year old than i do with a 24/25 year old.

9,s0s5pp,1641842683,What's the deal with mixed signals?,"I (M31) am in the dating scene, mostly online, but super discouraged by how common and accepted it is for people to offer mixed signals.

These are the things I encounter and they will be familiar to anyone on any dating apps:
- Ghosting
- Agreeing to a date then backing out
- Replying to messages weeks or months later
- Inconsistent expressions of interest (e.g. interested one day, disinterested the next and vice versa)
- Matching multiple times on multiple apps but never replying
- Good conversations and digital dating, but not wanting to date irl

It's hard not to think that this is my fault. Like maybe I give off a desperate vibe? Yuck.

But another part of me thinks that the instant gratification world we live in has lowered all our standards of basic dating decency. As men, we take zero risk (of hurting our ego) by swiping. We need zero courage, and zero confidence. Plus there's this feeling that everyone is lying. When I do have dates usually I think to myself: I would never have approached this person if I saw them in the real world. Not just that they look different but they are different. The online version ≠ the irl version. 

I just looked at Tinder: I have 285 matches, and out of those have been on maybe 2 dates. On Hinge I have about 500 matches with maybe a dozen dates. On the other apps too, more of the same. I keep trying to delete the apps but keep coming back. I think I should probably try talking to real people and seeing how that pans out. But definitely don't want to come across as creepy or aggressive. 

I'm tempted to switch up my approach. If I were to ask a woman out almost immediately does that come across as extra? 

From my perspective I try to be as direct as possible. I message basically everyone I match with. And I ask people out within like 20 messages. 

Probably I just care too much. Any advice appreciated. Give me that hard truth. ✨",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0s5pp/whats_the_deal_with_mixed_signals/

15,s0snyn,1641844006,Can average-looking men get with really hot women? Or are we forced to settle?,"**NOTE:** ***I know that this will come off as superficial to a degree, but I just need to make this clear as a man who struggles with both Autism and ADHD. Please read the previous post linked below.*** 

Ok, so I've been having this struggle for awhile now. While some people, particularly my parents and older brother always tell me that I have to settle or date down. I get tired of hearing it, especially since I'm the type of guy who wants to date to marry and have children, I'd rather not settle and be stuck with an average or below average-looking woman for my entire life. As cringey/weird whatever it sounds like, I wish for any future children of mine to look good when they grow up. 

I made a post before this in far greater detail. *Please read before commenting:*  [I'm tired of having to settle for everything in life!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/rp2r5r/im_tired_of_having_to_settle_for_everything_in/)

Now, I've been told by many of my pals that I'm a good looking guy or at least above average. Be it a 5-7/10 depending on who I talk to. That said, I've always seen myself with a woman who's a 7-8/10. In America, I found it impossible to get with a woman of my preference, which was partly why I left to Central Europe because I got fed up with not being able to get what I wanted, as noted in the post linked above. I heard stories that back in the day, average looking men managed to marry really beautiful women all the time and I've seen this in pictures too. My great-grandpa is a prime example of this in fact. 

So, the general question that I have is: Is it possible for an average-looking guy who's a 5-7/10 to get with a woman who's a 6-8/10 in this day and age? If so, how can an average looking man get on a date with one?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0snyn/can_averagelooking_men_get_with_really_hot_women/

i trust that he isn’t doing anything shady, so it isn’t that. but not even one single text? am i overreacting? i’m a little disappointed because i know he didn’t plan to camp the entire time he’s gone (although that is what he’s going to be doing a majority of the time). 

again, i know he’s on vacation, so i understand the lack of communication. i just wish i know that he at least got to his destination safely. or maybe that he’s thought of me and missed me at least once.

i struggle with deep abandonment problems, so i’ve felt myself kind of detaching myself. and i know that’s so bad, but i can’t help it. it’s like i’ve convinced myself he’s gone forever and that i should get over him. he’s never given me any reason, though, to believe he would do that. we communicate well, especially when we’re in person. so i think that’s why i’m like, what’s happening? does he not like me anymore? is he happy to be away from me?

We had plans to watch Season 2 of Euphoria Sunday(yesterday) and also to make hot dogs for us while we watch. So anyways on Saturday night she asked me ""So we're seeing each other till tomorrow then?"" and I told her its however you want because she was going to a party she had to go to for a close friends kid's birthday party. So I told her I don't mind seeing you I can go for you if you like but if you want to stay at the party and hang out with your friends then that's alright. She later on said oh okay and later on that night she told me ""hey so I decided I'm going over"" so me all excited looking foward to her she messages me to go for her so I'm waiting about a block away from the border she gets in my truck and is MAD.

ANYWAY, the matter at hand: 

I'm back in the dating pool after a 3 year hiatus and I'm definitely out of practice so I'm not sure how to proceed/if to proceed. 

Met a girl on Tinder, she messaged me first (cue surprised me); absolutely stunning, little bit of baggage, but who doesn't these days? She said she was looking to date with minimal pressure and honestly that's perfect for me because I'm looking for the same. I really just want to get out and have fun with someone. 

I prefer getting to know people in person so I didn't waste much time and asked her if she'd like to go out sometime but not anything specific outside of dinner/lunch/coffee since she has a kiddo and I knew I'd have to work around her schedule with that. She said she would love to. 

Communication over tinder was a little rocky because she kept forgetting to check the app so she asked if we could text instead and gave me her number. Chatting via text was better but still meh so she asked if we could switch to Snapchat because it's easier for her to remember to respond on there, so we switched platforms again. 

We talked about availability for the date, I was a little hesitant to make solid plans because we had a winter storm coming through, but when it turned out to be shorter than expected I asked her on Thursday if she was still available on Sunday (her day of the most availability). She saved the message (only message she's saved during our convo), but didn't respond. Followed up on Friday to say if she wasn't available, no worries we could try again this week or if she just wasn't feeling it to just let me know. Still no response, and left on read. 

I haven't messaged again because I don't want to be ""that guy"" but after she went through the effort of making sure we could talk and she would remember to respond (Tinder to Texting to Snapchat) I feel like maybe I should? I just don't really know what to say. I'd still like to take her out, and hell if it has to be a kid-friendly date I'm cool with that too. 

If she wasnt interested anymore I was hoping she'd at least unfriend me on Snapchat or un-match me on Tinder because that would be some kind of closure 😅",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0tjb1/unsure_howif_to_continue_after_being_left_on_read/

I just recently got married &amp; I love my husband more than anything. We’re total opposites but it works so dang good. He’s been with me at my lowest, I haven’t been the best to him. I can admit that. Some of it was due to my mental health, as I was diagnosed with ROCD this past year after a hard couple of months, mentally. Anyone that deals with OCD knows it can be tough &amp; if you’re in a relationship it can literally be the reason why it ends. Back in April of 2021, I had a mental break. That night I said some hateful things to my fiancé (at the time, he’s now my husband). I was a little tispy &amp; was being aggressive. I remember saying things like “yellow teeth” “small balls” &amp; “no neck”. My tispy mind thought I was joking but obviously I know now those things are &amp; where hurtful to say. That same night while this was happening, I remember my now husband saying “just please give me a moment” &amp; I wasn’t trying to hear it so I continued to follow him through the house &amp; finally got to bathroom &amp; tried to close the door but I wouldn’t let him &amp; he said “stop, chill out”. I remember him taking my hands putting them down &amp; pushing me away from the door. I didn’t fall or anything &amp; there wasn’t really any force behind the push, it was stern though &amp; I just kinda took a step back. &amp; He closed the door. In that moment I remember it was like something snapped &amp; I was like “omg he abused me” “what if he’s abusive?”. I obsessed over this thought for MONTHS &amp; that eventually led to my ROCD diagnosis. I was accusing him of abuse &amp; it was hard for him, he would just break down. It wasn’t until I started to see an ocd therapist that I realized I was indeed the problem. 

Fast forward we just recently got married. Prior to marriage I was virgin but we still did things (if you know what I mean). During the time of us doing things sexually but not having sex, I discovered I liked rough roll play &amp; I like choking &amp; name calling in the bedroom. At first I could tell he was hesitant but he knew I liked it so he did it. Now that we’re married, apart of our role play is me talking smack or being sassy &amp; him grabbing me by the throat which I happen to enjoy. Recently we were in the bed &amp; that morning we had intercourse, he got his &amp; I was fine with it. So that afternoon we were in the bed &amp; I jokingly said “oh must be nice to have a orgasm” “I can’t even get a back rub”. He grabbed me by the neck &amp; chocked me. It wasn’t firm enough to cut off my breathing or anything like that &amp; it didn’t really hurt but it did feel firmer than usual. &amp; he had kind of a dominate look &amp; I said “why you choke me like that?” &amp; he said “I knew you liked it, I was trying to be sexy but if that didn’t translate well I apologize, I’m sorry” &amp; he kinda been apologizing the whole day. I tried to be over it but it triggered me &amp; I went back to the “omg what if he really is abusive &amp; tried to hurt me”. I set him down last night &amp; told him how I was feeling &amp; he said “honestly babe, I never said this but I’m not really comfortable with choking you &amp; calling you names during sex, it makes me feel weird. I only do it because you enjoy it”. My husband is a gentle guy &amp; I hate that I feel like I might changing him into something he’s not, you know? 

I’ve just been stuck on that whole choking moment since yesterday &amp; I want to stop obsessing over it. Just not sure why I feel that way.

I never received real care. Or they disappeared completely only to apologize a couple of weeks later to say that their girlfriend became jealous.

32,s0uf5n,1641848430,I would like to date a white Girl but never dated one before and I have a racial barrier in my mind,"
I will try to make this short since it’s my first time doing this…
So where should I even begin?!?lol  
I’m a black male (21) born and raised in South Africa but now I live in France, I’ve been here since I was 18. In my ‘’career’’ of dating girls I’ve dated about 5 to 7 girls as much as I can remember, dark and light skin girls but most of them were light skin.
All the girls that I dated were either from my school or from my neighbourhood or friends introduced me to them. I haven’t been in a relationship for a while, about 2 years just to be precise, and not to mention I’m a gamer(LoL player) and an amateur football player so I put less effort into girls as long as I’m doing what makes me happy I don’t mind being single. 
But I finally decided to bring someone in my life to share my happiness, enough with my life. 

I have this mindset of mine I don’t know if it’s a ‘’racial barrier’’of my own or I just overthink sometimes or maybe I’m just exaggerating, I usually think that white women aren’t really attracted to black men they just fantasise their d*cks or they just prefer white men when it comes to LOVE, it’s obviously understandable to have a preference in terms of dating, and I’m starting to prefer white women a lot since I’m surrounded by the majority of them but still have to figure out how to get rid of this weird mindset of mine 
It’s not a mandatory for me to have a white girlfriend, I would just like to date one…
Please don’t get me wrong I’m not saying this is the reality I’m just saying what mostly comes up in my head 
Whenever I see a white woman that I’m attracted to 
I easily lose courage to hit on her whenever i think about what I said about my mindset I don’t know if I lack confidence or it’s just something that haven’t done before since I’ve never dated a white woman before

My main question is how do you hit on a white girl as a black dude is it the same way as you hit on any girl or the approach is different?

I would love to read all the advices :)

And also, do any of you get turned off when a guy does that in front of you? I would hope so, only because if not you’re endorsing a double standard.

34,s0uoxi,1641849109,Opinion on whether I was being irrational,"Had a class with this woman (20’s) and we began talking for a few months, she began flirting with me more and more, and as I started to pick up on more romantic than friendly feelings I asked her out. 

She agreed (to the activity I proposed) and said she was excited but because of some COVID stuff that came up, the date was postponed a few weeks while she went home to see family. 

While on the trip we continued to talk/text throughout, flirt, send pictures (non-sexual), etc. This entire time she’s telling me she’s excited for the date when we get back. Awesome! I ask her when she’ll be getting back from the trip and she says she’ll let me know. Great! I tell her to focus on the family time and just let me know when she’ll be getting back so I can get tickets, she agrees.

Fast forward a few weeks and I haven’t heard anything so I reach out and ask her how the trip is going. She tells me she got back from it a few days ago but is super short and makes no mention of the date. I tell her that I thought we agreed she’d let me know when she was coming back so I could get tickets (time sensitive) but if she was no longer into it nbd. 

She then accuses me of calling her a liar and trying to make her look bad. I tell her maybe I could have worded it better and I was just looking forward to this thing with her since she said she was, so not hearing anything from her was surprising to me.

She then suggests coffee. I say I’m all for it and suggest a date and time, and she says she’s busy but will let me know. The day I propose comes and goes, but I don’t hear from her until a few hours after when she says she was busy and apologizes but wants to reschedule. 

I ask her when she’s free. Left on delivered for 2 days until I run into her in person, still no reply. She acts super weird and finds a reason to leave early (takes a “phone call”).

I shoot her a message and tell her it was good to see her, she has my number, and the offer for coffee still stands whenever she’s up for it (thinking she’s no longer interested, and I would just never hear from her). 

To my surprise she suggests coffee next week. I tell her I would love to but I just need her to communicate what’s going on or if she’s serious about this because at this point I’m getting mixed signals and she’s acting distant than before. 

She tells me it’s just coffee, I’m making it out to be more than it is, and she’s distant with her “fucking mom”. So I tell her not to worry about it anymore and I’ll see her around. 

Now she goes out of her way to try and talk to me at school and make conversation, waves hello, and still follows me in social media. Was I misreading the situation or was she sending mixed signals? Was I being irrational? Any advice on how I could have handled the situation differently?

TL;dr- Woman seemed hot and cold to me, not sure if I was misreading the situation or i was justified, and any advice on what to do in the future?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0uoxi/opinion_on_whether_i_was_being_irrational/

She doesn't do much outside of work so I feel like she became dependant very quick, something I thought wouldn't really happen because of her age so I didn't pay much attention (stuff like ""why did you leave me on read?"" Etc while I'm just busy with work and maybe leave my phone for like 10 mins) she mentioned her past trauma etc which I won't repeat on here but, I don't want to be a therapist so I ended up cutting it off. Biggest red flag for me was that, although I do acknowledge she went through a lot of stuff, she victim blames herself a lot, so she doesn't have any friends etc despite her not even making an effort to do so, she just rants a lot. Honest to god at first glance looking at her you would never get vibes like that off her as she is quite easy going at first and imo very attractive but yeah, just feels like I'm getting my energy sucked out of me, she started speaking over me quite a bit recently on phone calls and I just stared at my phone once like wtf am I doing, I know so much about her but it's not even the same the other way round. I'll stick with people round my age moving forward, I read a lot of you had a good experience which I'm happy for but I just don't want to risk it moving on, I already have a hard time reading people so I don't wanna get another headache, if it wasn't for this sub I probably would have stayed with her for a lot longer though so thank you guys, even the people that were for it/encouraged me to try anyways it was very relatable so it made me feel a lot easier about myself.

I thought it went well, she thinks we should be friends","Before I begin, I’m not going to be sour and say “I’M AWESOME! SHE DOESN’T KNOW WHAT SHE’S MISSING!” If she “didn’t feel a spark” then so be it! I am heartbroken a bit, but I do appreciate her honesty and she genuinely wants to be a friend (and I am down, too).

What I want to know is did I play it *too* safe? We were only supposed to have dinner at 8 (which we did), but afterwards, we ended up getting coffee and didn’t leave until 3. Nothing in our conversations were forced, she was laughing at almost everything I said, but I didn’t make any bodily contact either (kissing, hugging, even a playful tap on the arm). I saw her put on lip gloss at one point and I thought “maybe she’s hinting at something?” But still, I didn’t want to ruin anything.

For future reference, on first dates, in a situation like this, is light contact okay? Moreover, do you think that’s what didn’t cause her to feel the spark or was it just the whole date in general?

Ps: I’d like to point out that I met her briefly in 2013(?) and that was that. We met on Hinge a few weeks back and have been texting every single day.

He initiated and we talked the entire day till midnight, had so much in common and conversation was so easy back and forth. We finished off both saying good night and we hoped to chat with each other again. The next day I didn’t message him because I didn’t want to come on too strong and he didn’t message me. The day after that I initiated and asked how his weekend was going  and if him and his daughter had any fun plans. Then we kept on talking all day just like before till 11pm. Again even more in common and we both are raising our kids the same, same views on things, great conversation. He drops the occasional oh if we end up meeting up with should do X or oh I’d be really interested to see that book you have etc  I split from my ex husband a year ago now and he split from his ex wife 2 years ago.

He ends the conversation saying it was nice chatting again and wished me a good day with my son on Sunday. I replied and wished him a good day with his daughter. I left it alone Sunday so he could focus on his daughter and he didn’t message either. 
Now it’s Monday and I really like this guy but I don’t want to come on strong but I also don’t want to seem disinterested. I am the last one who replied so I’m just leaving the ball in his court since I initiated the last convo and sent the last message. We’ve technically only talked 2 days so I’m telling myself to chill but people say that if there’s no mention of a date or flirting or asking for contact info after so long they aren’t really interested. 

So second opinions, does this sound promising at all? I should leave the ball in his court right? Is there a point or any signs that I’m just filling boredom as opposed to genuine interest?

She said these kids moved a lot and didn't grow up like any normal child they didn't go to school or play with other kids grow up and get their dirvers license get a job ect. They were homeschooled living in their own filth they got fed 2 times a day mostly just sandwiches no fancy homemade dinners they had to learn to cook on their own when they're parents were away the older siblings were in charge like beating raping or punishing the other young children. Their dad was a mentally unstable and very religious like running a cult what they called it. They never even heard of the police doctors or even medicine even the oldest who saved them was 17 she didn't realize she was talking to a police officer because she didn't know what the police was. They never met anyone other than their neighbors and own family members. That's really sad for a child to grow up not knowing what police and doctors and dentists are. My girlfriend has a 10 year old son from a previous marriage were having another baby in July she's really upset about this. They showed a part where a neighbor came over found a kitten crying in a dumpster and they left a dead cat on the stove seriously this makes me wanna adopt all these kids take them away from this. What kind of parents don't let their kids eat or shower. Also they would hide their toys not let them open them and manipulate them even trick them with food they would eat desserts in front of the kids and tell their siblings to share a can of vehana sausages.

We went out several times. She was giving me a mixed vibe: she was very kind and friendly but I didn’t really understand if she’s more introverted or not that interested in me. When id make some romantic move like holding a hand or something, she could politely pull away. But now I’m sensing she’s just more a close type of person. Then we actually ended up sleeping with each other and in sex she’s pretty passionate and open. 

So after sex I was confused if she wanted to continue or not (overall she didn’t give me a lot of romantic vibe, just a kiss and then we slept with each other, in the morning she was more distant). 

I didn’t message her to see if she’d make a move and after 3 days she did message. I was away, we texted a lot and opened up more to each other. I came back, we went out and ended up sleeping again. This time she was much more romantic and intimate. However, she didn’t message much after the meeting and I didn’t either so conversation wouldn’t keep up. And I’m just not understanding what she’s more into… also, I’ve noticed that her ex stopped following me on social media and I friended me. I didn’t speak to him, he didn’t either.

Imma 25M that had sex w/this 26F this past weekend (Saturday night &amp; Sunday morning because I spent the night in her apt) that I met on a dating app.  We’re planning to be FWB because she’s moving to another state at the end of the year &amp; we’re both cool w/friendship, cute lil dates here &amp; there, &amp; sex w/out the committed relationship label because she’ll be leaving anyways towards the end of 2022.

Today she texted me something similar to, “you’re a really good person &amp; I need to tell you something.  I lied about something &amp; you don’t deserve that.”  So being a bit nervous I ask her what is she so upset about &amp; that’s when she told me that she wasn’t truthful the night &amp; morning that we were having sex when we removed my condom.  Yes.  Pretty idiotic on my part.

Thing was, we were bar hopping in her neighborhood all night &amp; by the time we went back to her place we were both pretty drunk.  We had great conversation/banter &amp; were sharing some pretty personal shit so I felt a level of trust developing.  My erection was coming on &amp; off.  At one point I muttered something about the condom &amp; she told my that she hadn’t been involved w/anyone for like 10months or something &amp; that she trusts me when I told her I’ve had 2 partners last yr that was protected sex.  We briefly had vaginal intercourse but def had oral/foreplay &amp; all was unprotected.

The STD in question is “The Clap.”  After researching it I see that it’s very treatable &amp; she was quite upset to the point where I had to reassure her that everything will be okay.  She’s a very sweet girl &amp; deep down I can tell that she never had malicious intent.  I suppose just an awful lapse in judgement &amp; she lied?  I just kind’ve needed to get this off my chest but I guess my question to y’all would be what would you all do w/her moving forward?

He did call me on the phone and asked me a few questions about myself and I did the same , but now he’s cold again and only active when he returns home and all he says is I want you and I want to kiss you and that made me uncomfortable again , I have a gut feeling that he’s using me and only wants me because I’m pretty like he says , oh and when he sext me and I say no thanks he gets annoyed and says you don’t want me to kiss you ? 

I’m confused now I only gave him a chance because I genuinely liked him for his personality in real life but I guess he doesn’t really care that much about me.

As more I get to learn about her, turns out she has a bad reputation. We live in Dallas and every asians kinda knows each other out here. She had a wanted poster on instagram once a yr ago saying she stole something. The girl that posted that wanted poster is also crazy too. So the story on both sides are different. 

She’s young but shes really good at talking. In good way, shes a good listener and a good advisor but the bad is that she can be manipulative and can gaslight. 

She also has a lot of guy friends who are gang members or bad influences. 

All my friends are saying I need to get out ASAP. But she is so nice and loving to me and shes obsessed with me.

I originally cut her off but she messaged me with long paragraph saying shes sorry and asked for another chance saying she will be a trustable girl. I never had a girl who liked me this much so I told her I’m not gonna promise anything but I’ll see how it goes. We’ve only known each others for less than 2 weeks. 

Tmi but We had sxx too. I can do one night without feeling but I think having sxxx made her like me even more. She texts me like we are together and texts me every seconds before bed.

I don't want to accept situations which aren't healthy for me. If you have advice on how to improve the relationship, let me know, because I am truly interested in doing so..

Hi reddit, I want advice about boundaries. I am new to dating and am having trouble seeing how a casual partner and I line up. I am trying to figure out what I am willing to accept a partner's boundaries to be and also what others think is healthy to accept. I want to figure out what type of person I am compatible with, in other words.

I am a 26 year old dude and have gone on 4 dates with a woman my age. So far I like her a lot, but things are moving slow. We have less physical intimacy than I'd like, we go on less dates than I'd like, and we talk less than I'd like outside of those dates. We have not kissed (I have asked on date 3 and was turned down), we see each other about once a week, and we have texted and talked little on the phone outside of the dates. So far none of this is a deal breaker and I know I must communicate better and be patient before I can expect to have my needs met.

She opened up a little about a bad boyfriend she had in college on our last date, but only went as far as saying that he didn't respect her boundaries. I didn't ask her to elaborate because judging from how closed off she has been, it may be a bad story and I'd rather let her feel more comfortable with me. She is also new in town and said she doesn't want to jump into a relationship when she doesn't have a group of friends around her. She has communicated that she is interested in being more than friends currently. She was the first person to suggest we see each other again on our last date, as on most of the others.

So my question is, how do I navigate my impatience? Is it worth doing so? So far we have both talked about how we are not seeing other people and I like her a lot so I am willing to see if I can work things out, but I wonder how this comes off to 3rd parties. If we were talking more I would communicate my feelings, but I feel like we need to be in a more serious place before I can comfortably bring them to the table and know I won't overwhelm her. My goal is to understand her more and escalate all the areas I mentioned earlier in a way which respects her—more touch, see her more, talk more. As long as she stays into me, that is. But does it seem like we could be compatible? I don't want to change her or rush her, but I am frustrated.

Just a beautiful on the outside, but on the inside is where I'm having issues with her. She seems to be a bit immature for my liking. For a while now she's acted passive aggressive towards me and I've addressed her behavior towards me on two separate occasions. And each time she's told me that there wasn't anything wrong but yet she's back to the passive aggressive behavior and she acts hot or cold with me depending on the day. One day she's talkative and goes out her way to say hi to me then other days she'll walk right past me without saying anything or even a simple smile. 


Now I get it some people have bad days so I can respect that but with her there seems to be something else going on with her. And I'm kind of done spinning my wheels on what I did wrong because as of lately she won't talk to me it seems as if she hates me for some reason. But I'm honestly chalking it up to her maturity level which doesn't seem very high.

I get everyone's living situation is different and so I don't know exactly what it's like in her home but I would figure she would have a full time job and or her own place.  

But that is not th case for her. And the fact that she can't seem to have a normal and healthy conversation with another adult about if there is any issues between the two and she denies that there is but then proceeds to act immature when I'm around.

I was in Spain three weeks ago and I met this really nice girl. First date went really well and we spent the next 5 days together. We got really close fairly quickly, then I had to come back home to the U.S. 

I have a return flight at the end of the month to Spain to be there for some time (unrelated). The first two weeks apart went fine and we talked everyday and she would express how she can’t wait for me to be back and be with her but this past week there was a shift. 

She says she is starting to feel pressured to make things work and is scared that when I come back we may not get along that well once we get to know each other more, and thinks I have all these expectations for a relationship/am coming back just for her. We had a long talk today and I assured her that none of that was true and that I just wanted to take things one step at a time if she wants to. 

At this point she says she likes me but she doesn’t know what she wants one day vs the other and that she feels the connection we had is fading. She says everything was great when I was there in person and she could see me and talk to me, but with the distance and time difference/schedules, she’s having doubts. 

Distance is a challenge and I feel like if she wants to meet when I come back things will go better, but, is this even worth pursuing? I really like her and we shared a genuine (though brief) connection but just not sure if it’s worth my time.

He came back from the trip, drove far to see me, we had a good date that also ended up with intimacy.

For the last month we were on winter break so I haven’t seen her in person in over a month. We still talked pretty frequently and played games together over break though. We’re seeing each other in a couple days and I feel like I really need to make a move or she’s gonna give up on me and move on. I’m pretty much positive that she’s into me and won’t deny me but I still don’t want to fuck up and make things awkward or weird. 

We’ve hung out one on one 10+ times and the most I’ve done is held her hand and had my arm around her. I’m just really nervous because I don’t have any experience with this kind of stuff. I’ve never been as close with a girl as I am with her and I’ve only had one kiss before and I’m 20. And this kiss was really low stakes since it was just some tinder girl I’d been talking to for a few days. 

What’s the best way to go about making a move? Should I just explain to her my situation? Should I say something that initiates a kiss? Or should I just look at her and try and go for it when the time is right. For some context we’ll probably be watching tv sitting next to each other on my bed. I usually put my arm around her and she leans into me and rests her head against mine. It’s kinda awkward turning my head to look at her from that position which makes it hard too but I don't know. If you could, explain it detail like you’re teaching someone who has zero experience.

82,s0zku3,1641861733,Stay off of dating apps/sites,"For those of you thinking about trying online dating, just don’t do it and here is why.
Basically almost every single dating app/site ranks you based on how many people like you, how much matches you get, and how active you are.
Something else to know too is that there are tons of ugly women on these sites that make themselves look pretty, have absolutely nothing in their bio except for either their Instagram or their Snapchat just to boost their ego, and they are just outright immature and waste everyone’s time.
So unless your average or above average, have extremely good pics of yourself, somehow know which women are the right ones, and probably some other things.
Just don’t do dating apps, trust me you will be much happier talking to women in public instead of wasting your time swiping left and right.
For example, if you are into let’s say acting, go to an acting school and meet women there who also want to act.
Overall just stay off dating sites especially if you are a 19 year old boy just like me.
Anyways if I gave out my advice in a mediocre way, feel free to better it in the comments.
But yeah, just stay off online dating and focus more on finding girls in real life through the things that you are passionate about.
That’s my plan.
Trust me it will pay off pretty well and you will get lucky even if you might be ugly.
I mean I’m pretty average, maybe even above because I have been called hot a few times by girls IRL lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0zku3/stay_off_of_dating_appssites/

84,s0zxej,1641862752,Advice regarding dating apps?,"Hello everyone! 19F here and just wanted to ask for advice about dating apps.

I downloaded tinder last week and have been casually using it only checking up on messages like once a day.

Maybe it’s just my location as I live in a suburban area around Dallas, but are the men really awful to message overall or have I just been unlucky?

I kept my bio as short and concise as I could. Just wrote my plans on becoming a nurse, used to do track back in HS and I enjoy swimming, hobbies include watching drama/romance shows and playing LoL/valorant with my friends, and that I’m not looking for short-term or casual relationships or hookups. 

I also like to pay attention to their pictures and their bios so when I message them that I can bring up discussions of whatever they put.

Also have 3 pictures with 1st of me in my daily attire in class (solo picture), 2nd picture of me at the beach with no makeup, &amp; 3rd picture of me in a family photo dressed up (everyone else blurred out). So the person should have a clear picture idea of what I generally look like.

I keep getting super suggestive messages even though I put in my description that I want something more committed. Guys also early on like to point out the fact that I’m Asian which creeps me out since I don’t mention anything of their ethnicity.

I feel like the worst ones though are the ones with huge tempers. As I mentioned before I only check like once per day, but a lot of guys if I don’t respond within like 3 hours get super pissed off and rant about me so I instantly unmatched. Feels like it would be too much of a hassle trying to explain that I’m in school and volunteering.

Overall I feel like the type of men that I have even matched with and I skipped a lot due to lack of bios, proper pictures, etc. are terrible. Like I don’t know any guys IRL within my classes, clubs, or clinics that I volunteer at have been this bad to talk to as these guys online.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s0zxej/advice_regarding_dating_apps/

I have matched with this guy and we were talking for a week before going out. On the phone I have discussed that I’m not getting intimate before marriage and he was fine with that even supported my decision. He wasn’t sexual in anyway very respectful guy. But when we went on a date he wanted me to give him a kiss on the cheek but I wasn’t comfortable since it was are first meeting. He got angry because I said no to giving him a kiss. Are date was less then 30 minutes he seemed very upset by something and when I went home I messaged him and he said that he can’t be with someone who can’t give him sex. It’s fair enough everyone has preferences but I have told him multiple times before meeting that I’m not interested in have sex before marriage I made it clear because I know some men like to get intimate with their partner. He was fine with my decision on the phone but when we met he was not too happy. His intentions was to have a relationship but I’m thinking otherwise?

Also he always start the conversations every-time we sit together at work. Although I know it’s just normal to have conversations with coworkers. But like two times before on our conversations he mentioned his girlfriend. So I know he’s not interested to me. But it just confusing sometimes.

Many social activities are gender based and a work environment is not ideal in case it does not work out.

So, I am keen to hear from women who have successfully met a nice guy and where?  Or at least where do you hang out and imagine you might meet a nice guy?

Also, what attracts you and what puts you off?  What age range? etc

95,s10ppm,1641864952,Weirdest Dating Experience,"I (M26) had been talking to this girl (27) on a dating app. Originally we had planned to go for a walk because she wanted me to meet her dog, but due to the rainy weather she invited over to her apartment instead. I thought this was an odd move, but it ended up being quite nice. Well, the first two hours anyway..

It started off great. We had tea and pastries, I got to play with her dog and we were making decent conversation. She seemed happy and it appeared that she liked talking to me, but at around the two hour mark, something seemed started to feel a bit off. I’m pretty used to leading conversations on dates, so I thought things were going great because she was talking a lot. But then I realized she just kept talking and talking and talking... And she just wouldn't stop... For another 4 1/2 more hours. 

She just kept jumping from topic to topic, sometimes talking about certain topics for 15-20 minutes straight, then she’d think of something else and start talking about that topic and then the cycle would repeat. It began to feel like she was basically having a conversation with herself but I was just kinda in the room too.

I’m very much an introvert so I’d much prefer listening to talking, but even I have my limits. At a point, I was having trouble even keeping up with what she was saying because she talked so fast and because a lot of things weren't even about her, it was about random things like why she hates Kroger or crate-training animals, etc. She hardly paused long enough for me to even go “Mhmm” or “Right.” I eventually stopped doing that just to see if she would notice that I wasn’t really engaged but it didn’t seem to phase her. I think she maybe asked me four actual questions in the 6 &amp; 1/2 hours I was there and even when I was given the chance to answer, she’d still cut me off and start going on another tangent. At one point, she had asked me about my job and I started telling her and she was like, “It’s probably like this right?” and then proceeded to perfectly describe what I do for a living in vivid detail, exactly the way I’d explain it to anyone so I was just like, “Yup… that pretty much sums it up.” I also remember asking her if she had ever been on a really bad date and she said “no, most guys are just boring.” And I couldn’t help but think that she might think that because they never even really got the chance to say anything.

Around the five hour mark I was getting exhausted and honestly just wanted to leave, so I politely said, “Well I don’t want to keep you, so I should probably be going.” She was like “Oh wow, it’s so late!” And then I shit you not, she started talking about how early the sun sets, which led to another hour long conversation with herself that I had to endure. I remember seriously thinking, ""I’m actually going to be stuck here all night.""

Thankfully, another opportunity arose where I could nicely ask to leave and we parted ways. Usually I try to be super courteous and set up the next date at the end of the first, but I kinda just hugged her, thanked her for the tea and awkwardly said goodbye because I was so emotionally drained.

I’m just so baffled by the whole situation. I’ve never met someone who’s talked for that long in my entire life. I seriously can’t believe she didn’t lose her voice or like need a drink of water or something. Has anyone else ever experienced this before on a date? I really can’t understand why this happened. I truthfully don’t know if she had ADHD or if she was just so comfortable with me that she felt like she could just be super open? Or maybe she just doesn’t have many people to talk to?

I really don’t know if I’m overthinking it but I’ve never experienced this before on a date. I feel kinda bad because she was still very nice and accommodating so I want to maybe give her another shot. She expressed an interest in meeting again, but I’m just afraid of this happening again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s10ppm/weirdest_dating_experience/

97,s1142k,1641866143,"He just started talking to me again after his facebook status changed, and after I visited him in November. I don't get it, and don't know what to make of this situation. 26 M 27 F","I need to start off this post by saying I have \*ZERO\* interest or desire in dating someone right now because I was just roofied a matter of weeks ago by a different guy who lives in my area.

The person in this post is my oldest guy friend. He was my first love, he meant the entire world to me. However I was SA'd by a classmate of mine, and in a panic and being only 17 years old, I pushed my oldest guy friend away because I didn't have the tools to deal with what had happened to me. It ended in a bad and nasty fight and we didn't speak for several years, but when we did, it was ugly nasty fighting.

My oldest guy friend began dating someone 4 years ago, and at that same time, I was in the midst of a 4.5 year abusive relationship. At that point, he and I were talking a little bit here and there.

\*Even though I still cared for him, I did nothing about it and still to this day have done nothing about it\*

When his relationship got more serious, he automatically just stopped talking to me. Which is fine, I chalked it up to it being life, that our bridge was burnt for good and it was time to move on.

In November, I was on a layover where he lived, and I was invited by his family to come over to their house for a few hours. Before I came over, I mentally talked myself into the reality that mine and his friendship was over, and that was that, and there was nothing more. To my surprise, he came back about 15 minutes after I had gotten there, and talked to me and asked me how life was going.

When it was time for me to leave, I opted for little physical contact because I was and still am dealing with trauma. The photo we took before I left is him with his arms around me, and before I left, hugged me tight for a few minutes.

The thing that had me questioning things though was that when I was there, he bashed his girlfriend. Not in a mean or abusive way at all, but the way he was talking about her made it seem like he didn't want to be in a relationship with her. He sounded-annoyed almost when I'd ask him questions.

And they weren't intrusive questions-just simple, polite small talk.

I saw on Facebook recently that his Facebook status changed, and she had removed the tag she had of being ""in a relationship with him"" And \*No\* I did not ask if they had broken up. That would be rude.

I was actually able to talk to him last night for the first time since he began dating this girl-and he responded.

Why would he talk to me after he changed his facebook status and the November visit?

\*Disclaimer: Hopefully redditors can be kind. I am legitimately wondering about this situation because I thought that mine and his friendship was over\*
