9,s7gl77,1642563862,"I think I need to break up with her, but I can't find the courage to do it."," This is a throwaway account. My girlfriend uses Reddit, but I doubt she comes to this side of it. To my girlfriend, on the off chance that you are reading this... I'm really sorry that you're seeing this. I just need to let it out.

My mind is very scattered right now, and I'm feeling sick just from the thought of breaking up, so please forgive me if the post is a little hard to read at parts.

I met my girlfriend in the second semester of college. We almost immediately fell for each other and started dating very shortly after meeting each other. Now we have been dating for a little more than 3.5 years. We shared all our milestones in that time - studying side-by-side day in and day out, celebrating the end of each semester, spending school holidays together, going on day trips and dates, finding our passions and careers, and graduating from college together. We have made so many amazing memories together. In all this time, our relationship has been mostly perfect for me. We had disagreements, we had times of tension, but we worked through these things and our relationship grew stronger. I can't express just how much joy our memories contain, and just how much joy I get every day I spend with her. She is amazing in every way - she takes an interest in my hobbies, senses when I'm feeling down and how to cheer me up, spontaneously surprises me with kind actions, is very emotionally mature, and more. I am really, really lucky to be with her and she is a wonderful person and partner.

This is my first relationship. I learned a lot about myself, and a lot about how to be a good partner. 

Over the past few months, I've been thinking a lot about the future, and there's one thing that I worry will force our relationship to end. I am a vegetarian, raised that way due to my religion. I do not consider myself religious at all, however being vegetarian is something I believe in and follow - completely separate from my thoughts on religion, if that makes sense. My girlfriend is not vegetarian - which has been fine so far, and I think it is fine while we're dating. I've learned through this relationship that, unfortunately, I cannot bring myself to be intimate with someone who has recently eaten meat. Kissing her when I can smell the meat on her breath makes me physically nauseous; it's not an ideological thing, it's a physical response. As I said earlier, I DO believe in vegetarianism from an ideological perspective; however, I have never and will never attempt to ""convert"" anyone, girlfriend included. 

To her credit, she's been absolutely amazing at working around this. She eats vegetarian food (partially because, according to her, she just doesn't like meat that much) when we are out on dates or just with friends, so that we can still share food as well as kiss, etc. If she eats meat, she makes sure to thoroughly brush and floss before seeing me. I fully recognize the amazing effort she is making, and that I am lucky to have that in a partner. 

But I've been thinking about the future. I love my girlfriend, so much. But I don't know if I can live with, and marry, someone who isn't vegetarian. I don't think I would be comfortable having meat cooked in my kitchen, or always having to have my hypothetical wife brush and floss and all before we can even kiss. I would want my hypothetical kids to be raised on a vegetarian lifestyle.

This clashing of our cultures has come up before, and she has been firm that she has no intention of going vegetarian - and again, I am NOT wanting to convert her. It is her choice, and meat is a big part of her culture's food. I... have been less firm, because I can't bear the thought of losing her. Our most recent, quite emotional, conversation about this topic resulted in me laying out what I said in the previous paragraph, then realizing how there was no way forward but to compromise, I began taking back what I said and qualifying it with things like, ""I suppose you (my GF / hypothetical wife) could cook meat in the kitchen of the home we would share if you used an entirely separate set of cookware and dishes"". I also promised that I would try to be less distant / less weird around her on the occasion that she did want to eat meat when we're together - something I am not doing on purpose, but I am aware that I act differently and it obviously hurts her.

But, deep down, I am very much NOT confident that I would be okay with that. I do that easily and on a daily basis with my housemates and friends. But there is a huge difference between a housemate/friend and a significant other. 

In the recent conversation I mentioned earlier, I started by asking my girlfriend what she wanted from our relationship in the long-term. Did she eventually, assuming we were happy and still together, want to move in together? Could she see us getting married, eventually? No deadlines or timelines, but just, eventually? Or were we dating with no real intention (from her) of moving forward? 

Her response was that yes, she did see us taking the next step eventually (moving in together). However, the two things that worried her are the vegetarian issue described above and, tangentially related, the very valid concern that my parents wouldn't accept her (which my parents have made very clear to me is the case, because she is from another culture). I don't care if my parents don't accept her, but I recognize that she wants a whole family and a relationship not just between us but our families as well.

I don't know. I don't really see a way forward where we're both happy. I have one or two relatives that have done it, but obviously every relationship is unique and who knows if it'll work for me.

I can't bring myself to break up with her. The last 2 times we had this conversation I started by basically saying what I've said here, but as the conversation gets more emotional I find myself taking it all back. Even just thinking about breaking up makes me feel sick; I haven't slept for the past week; and I'm shaking as I type this.

I also have other concerns about breaking up - I am heartbroken at the thought of hurting this amazing girl so much just because of an issue ""on my end"".  Everything about us, except for this one issue, is perfect in my opinion. And I hate that this is how it might end.

The most terrifying is the prospect of loneliness. After college we both moved to the same city for our jobs - but she grew up here, has family and friends here. I grew up very far away. My social circle here is, roughly in order of closeness:

* her
* (Exception: this person does not live in the area) My best friend
* my childhood friend (in the area, but still not super close, so we only can see each other once every 2-3 weekends)
* my housemate (who is a good friend of both me and my GF)
* her housemate (who I've become good friends with)
* some work friends (but they're \*work\* friends, and I'm a pretty new employee)
* one uncle who I am not very close with

If we were to break up, I would really only have my childhood friend, and maybe my housemate(? who knows which person he would feel more comfortable being a friend to, even if the break up is very clean), to keep me from being completely alone outside of work. My best friend is in a different city, but we call once a week and I know she would support me as much as she could remotely. 

In the past, I have dealt very poorly (read: depression) from being alone for just a few weeks.  So ... that's where I am. I suppose I'm both simultaneously looking for a solution that preserves my relationship, and the courage to end it.

Coming off a 2 week hiatus of 4 months of serial dating and ONS I met up with a hinge match and we hit it off. We got along really well, and the sex was amazing, to the point where we met up/spent most of the following week together, with a few cute dates in between, and lots of texting 

I was her first hinge date coming into the dating scene and obviously I didnt mind her having other ones lined up (we discussed this on the first date), but after a few days of not meeting she asked to meet up - she's slept with some other guy since and has been apologizing since I've gone cold

Now I completely see why she did, especially since we  both said from the start we're not looking for anything serious, but I'm a bit disappointed since we both acknowledged our emotional and physical chemistry and it seems a bit thoughtless and unappreciative

23,s7hfuq,1642566396,What am I doing wrong?,"**Warning: long post**

A little bit of background. \[29M\], average looking, on the path of losing weight, but what I'm about to describe has nothing to with my looks. Grew up in a non-western country, moved to the west at the age of 20

In high school, I was not successful in getting a date

In college, I did get some dates and relationships, mostly without knowing what I did. My I got my first serious gf without even trying, I had no even considered her to be a potential match, but she fell for me.

After her, I moved to my country of origin for volunteer experience, and again got a gf, again without me trying really. Almost as if she did most of the work until I got the hints that she's into me.

Fast forward another year, I had broken and was going to leave the country where I was volunteering. 2 weeks prior, I meet another girl who asks for my number, and we've kept contact on whatsapp, until she confessed to me 2 months in... needless to say we sort of held a long-distance relationship, I flew back the year after to see her, had a great time. Continued keeping contact online, went back again to see her the year after but this time she became cold and all of a sudden cut contact with me. Dumbstruck, I ended my vacation without really seeing her (no I didn't go there just to see her, it was Christmas time so I was mostly with relatives) and then flew back home.

So, all what I've told you so far have been the women I've been able to attract without having a clue. Looks were not the factor for sure, since I was heavier at the time than I am today. 

Between those girlfriends, I have had short-term dates, but I quickly left that scene because I didn't enjoy it. 

However, since 2016, and especially since 2020 with Covid making things harder, my dating life has been a struggle. Here are some examples: 

1) I meet a girl in a social circle of mutual friends. She's my type (or so I thought), we talk, chat, share some laughs, common values. I ask her out, she says yes... I go back home and I text her the next day, I get ghosted... I am shocked and devastated.

2) I meet a girl in a study group. Similar background as I. We talk over the phone and whatsapp. I ask her out, she says yes, we meet up at a coffee/pastry shop. Same country of origin as I, we talk about our experiences growing up there, how our experiences have been moving to our new country, and many other things in common. We end the date on a very good note... the next day, she has blocked on whatsapp and all other social media platforms.

3) not to mention all examples, but I have also met a few girls online/in person with whom I have hung out/dated, but never able to maintain a relationship. 

In all 3 cases above, I have been direct with my intentions, and whenever I've been openly rejected, I've accepted it and moved on, instead of causing a scene.

Needless to say, those series of failures to get a solid relationship (cases #1 and #2) are what have scarred me the most. The feeling of after investing your time and energy into someone, only to get ghosted/ignored. These experiences have made me more cautious to open up to a new person. Hence, I have not approached any other woman whom I've found interesting so far, out of the fear of living that same experience.

**Before, I wouldn't care about dating, and all of a sudden I would find someone interested in me. Now, when I proactively want to find someone, it is not working out.**

For the most part, I have managed to keep myself busy and become a better version of myself with my hobbies, career progress and studies. I have told myself that eventually things will take a better turn and I will connect with someone, but there come times that feeling an intimate connection becomes a necessity, and it's sometimes hard to cope with the lack of that. I'm not even looking to casual hookups, only a decent relationship. 

Needless to say the pandemic has not made things easier. There are less in-person events taking place, so less opportunities to meet and interact with new people in general. I find that I can connect better in person than online. 

So, my question to you in short dear readers, please point me out if I am doing anything wrong of there is anything I need to adjust/change about the way I think. 

I appreciate any constructive criticism, all I ask is for your honesty :) 

Thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7hfuq/what_am_i_doing_wrong/
24,s7hgau,1642566439,Melancholy in Madison (disclaimer: long post),"Hey all. Sorry for the silly title, idk what else to put and it was all that was coming to mind. This is kind of a vent/advice post, sorry in advance for the length. Open to whatever feedback/support you have.
So I (22F, lesbian) have been single for 1.5 years, following a 2.5 year relationship with a girl (22F now but my age at the time) that had seemed good for a while but ended badly (we were on different pages about intimacy and had different levels of emotional maturity). 
I've been on dating apps and have gone on so many first dates, none of which really got off the ground. The only people I've really felt a spark with, I met either in person or another way (the most recent one (19, NB lesbian) I met online but they're from my hometown and it turned out they know some of my friends and used to work with my mom. Yeah, that was super weird to find out).
Last year, I got my heart broken twice; different circumstances but both boiled down to: someone telling me they liked me a lot and being super sweet/affectionate, then suddenly taking it back and saying they weren't in a place to date at that time. 
Then around Thanksgiving 2021 I met someone (19, NB, previously mentioned), a really incredible person who I liked a lot, which I told them and they said they'd like to get to know me and see where things went. We went on a few dates, things mostly seemed to be going so well and our in-person interactions were amazing (they said they thought so too), but a few weeks ago they stopped putting in any effort to make plans/communicate, and then the other day I found out (through social media) that they have a girlfriend. 
I was really hurt that they hadn't just told me that they didn't like me/were dating someone else, and maybe I can't really be upset when I didn't explicitly say ""tell me if you decide to date someone else,"" but it still hurts that they knew how I felt and chose to not tell me and just let me keep trying to make something happen when that just wasn't possible. I told them this in a mature and respectful but honest way, and deleted them off the social media app we'd been talking on after I saw that they'd read my message (they didn't even respond, which also hurt, lol). 
So now I'm finding myself missing that excitement, and I'll be honest, I really did like them, so much. They made me smile so hard and I got so excited when they messaged me (like, throwing-my-phone excited). I feel sad that that's gone, and I don't know exactly why they made me feel that way, but I'm really scared I won't find it again. I don't feel that with people on dating apps, and I'm an okay-looking person but frankly not someone that people are often attracted to irl (in my experience). 
I know I'll get over them, I'm just sad because after over a month I had finally let myself be hopeful that they liked me back, and I'm scared I won't find someone like them again. Does anyone have any reassurance they can throw my way? Or if not, thanks for reading this all if you made it to the end. I think I also just really needed to get this off my chest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7hgau/melancholy_in_madison_disclaimer_long_post/
25,s7hnrq,1642567086,My boyfriend of 3 years refuses to talk to me about his emotions and it makes me very sad and helpless.,"Here‚Äôs an explanation:

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for 3 years and the last time he has talked to me about his emotions when he is upset was when we first started dating. Since then, he just tells me that he finds no purpose in talking about it because it just doesn‚Äôt make him feel any better. He also says that he can deal with it by himself and that he will feel better by himself as time passes on. As his girlfriend, it makes me feel so helpless and sad that he doesn‚Äôt tell me what he is thinking and how he feels. All I want to do is help and offer sympathy but I can barely do that without knowing what he is going through. Maybe that since I am a woman, it is easier for me to openly talk about my feelings and emotions to him, but I just don‚Äôt understand how it doesn‚Äôt help. Even if it doesn‚Äôt help, I think that being open to your partner about your emotions is important and healthy. How am I supposed to know what to do to offer him help? He claims that he doesn‚Äôt see any benefit of talking about it, but do you guys maybe think that it is because of men are told to not express or talk about their emotions when they are upset? How do I help him overcome this? How do I even talk to him about this? Would it sound selfish to tell him how much it affects me that he doesn‚Äôt ever talk to me about his feelings? I just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I‚Äôve been thinking about this for years but I just never know when the right time is to bring it up. Any advice or help would be very much appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7hnrq/my_boyfriend_of_3_years_refuses_to_talk_to_me/

27,s7hqou,1642567348,Please put some sense into me‚Ä¶,"First time posting, sorry if this is painful to read lol

I‚Äôve been hanging out on and off with this guy for a few years now, we have mostly kept it to a casual arrangement however we would text throughout the day pretty much everyday. (We live in different states) We go through phases when he says he wants to date and start spending more time together and I‚Äôve agreed to try, in the past this has been he will back out of it and just kind of ghost away. So as it goes, we don‚Äôt talk for a while and he will come back around with the usual I miss you and start pushing to have a relationship but honestly it scares the shit out of me and I just can‚Äôt and I have told him this, he knows about my commitment issues and why I have them. 

So I have been holding my ground that I don‚Äôt want to take this past platonic friendship anymore because I‚Äôve felt hurt from our situation to many times. He was upset about my refusal to give in and said he was done with whatever this was so I said ok and respected his wishes and didn‚Äôt contact him anymore. 

Well here we are again, it‚Äôs only been a week and the I miss you message comes in‚Ä¶it‚Äôs clearly become a repeated pattern. I can never really get much out of him when I inquire what his motive is to keep coming back to the pursuit of this, it‚Äôs always just that he misses me and pushing for the connection again. 

Just want an outside opinion, am I being ridiculous? I just don‚Äôt understand what drives him to keep coming back with this, he‚Äôs an attractive guy I have no doubt he has plenty of options. He‚Äôs a good person, a dad, and a hard worker. So I get confused why he wants to continue this loop with me.  What‚Äôs his end game? What should I do?

32,s7i4cx,1642568557,Very confused by a woman's behavior,"So let's start a year ago. I meet this girl at a party and we get to talking. I get her number fairly easily and things look great. We meet up and have a great date. We went on a couple more dates then I told her I enjoyed her company and wanted to take her out to dinner. All of a sudden she wasn't into something serious. So I just let it go. Stopped contacting. It was pretty tough because I felt a strong connection but knew it wasn't a good idea to keep pursuing her romantically and friendship was off the table. She is in my friend group so I figured if it happens it happens but it wasn't happening then so move on. 

A year later I see her again at a party. I straddled the line of ignoring her and engaging. I hate to admit it but she has been on my mind. Not in a weird way just wanting to find a connection with someone on the same level I felt with this particular girl. We spoke a few times, we caught up and that was that. I remember seeing her leave and telling myself... Don't you dare contact her. And I didn't. 

The next day I get a text from her about one of our conversations, specifically how much she likes my music on spotify. To be honest, I was annoyed and excited at the same time. We chat a bit and that was fine. I ask her to hang out but she was busy. Okay, again, felt dumb for asking and moved on. 

Then. Somehow. We run into each other again a few weeks later. 

Listen, she's still on my mind. It is what it is. We chat again. I'm trying to not be flirty but it's just kinda the default. Again she leaves and I decide to not reach out because she's clearly not interested. 

The next day I get a photo of her, taken by someone else of her doing a sexy pose with a caption about an inside joke we had at the previous hang out. So again we chat on the phone for a bit. I... Like a total idiot... Asked her to get a beer today. She says ""can't today just got done with work next time""

At this point I'm realizing she is playing with me right? I'm frustrated that she's even on my mind and I'm also confused as to why someone would treat me like that? To me these texts feel flirty and I would guess if you know the guy likes you you're only sending stuff like that to mess with him.

I‚Äôm gonna try to make this is short as possible, but basically, I was talking to two people on a dating app before moving to this new city. Once I got here I ended up sleeping with guy one (we‚Äôll call him Jim), and then shortly after, I ended things with guy two (we‚Äôll call him Dave) with a long and polite text. I was very conflicted about the decision - Dave seemed to have a few red flags though, and I had just in my mind made some kind of next-level move with Jim. 

Literally within 48 hours, Jim had a freak out and ended things with me with no real explanation. I think he got scared that things were heading toward a serious direction (he literally started crying and I had to comfort HIM as he was ending things with ME‚Ä¶ it was wild). And though I was offended, my ego was bruised, and I felt hurt that he waited until after we had sex to bail‚Ä¶ in the back of my mind, I was honestly somewhat relieved. I knew in my heart at that point we weren‚Äôt a good long term match and though I would have gone about it in a much more thoughtful way, I probably would have ended it somewhat soon with him anyway.

Not an hour after Jim and I were done, I got a text from Dave. It was the most mature and thoughtful response I‚Äôve ever seen. He walked through the list of concerns I‚Äôd given him and explained that the red flags were a misunderstanding. I can‚Äôt get into too much detail here but it was truly wonderful. I was so happy to hear from him and knew instantly that I‚Äôd made the wrong choice with Jim. Dave asked if I‚Äôd still like to see each other and I enthusiastically said yes.

Fast forward a week and a half and a few dates with Dave, and things are going REALLY well. He‚Äôs incredible. I‚Äôm so insanely relieved that things ended when they did with Jim so that I didn‚Äôt miss out on this incredible person‚Ä¶ I only wish they had ended even sooner. I feel so guilty that Jim and I had sex while Dave and I were talking too (even though we hadn‚Äôt even met yet and we still haven‚Äôt even defined anything or agreed to be exclusive).

All of this to say‚Ä¶ Dave and I have had some discussions about sex, and he is extremely careful with his health. I am too, and I wonder if I owe it to him to tell him I slept with someone else 9 days ago. We used condoms and I just got tested, but it feels wrong to omit that info. 

On the other hand, if I do share that, I have no idea how he‚Äôll respond. Will he be grossed out and turned off? Will it hurt him to think that I was with someone else while we were first talking (even though we aren‚Äôt exclusive yet)? 

I am so afraid to ruin this by being too honest, but I also don‚Äôt want to build a relationship on a lie of omission. I wish I could press an undo button on that night with Jim, but I can‚Äôt.

So it‚Äôs at my high school. It‚Äôs important to know the entire school attendance from 9th to 12th is less than 20 people- yep.

PUA is the biggest gimmick bullshit, and It doesn't work, and It never has the only way to get a girl is to be tall, be white, have a six-pack, and a perfect-looking face. This is the only thing that matters in 2022, back in the past, women literally couldn't even open a bank account without a man's signature, and they didn't have many career choices either. This meant that average/ugly men could find an average/ugly woman as his wife even though the woman wasn't really attracted to him, and was using him as an accessory.

Nowadays though, women can go to work and advance their education for better pay, and they no longer need the average man to do anything. This is a good thing I believe since all humans should have the same opportunities, however, this is very bad for the average man. Because of this, women don't have to settle for average men anymore, and they only want the best of the best. A good chunk of men do not make the cut these days, and most women only want the tallest hottest male models who are dominant.

The truth is women have always been attracted only to this type of man, but they were conditions to go after betas because of the societal oppression at the time. So yes 80-90% of us men don't make the cut, and there's nothing we can do but enjoy life in other ways, focus on achieving a goal in your life. Become a karate master, or master your career or hobby such as music, and get really good at It, play video games, visit hookers, and go to the gym. I'm focused on my career as a nurse and saving people's lives, I've given up, and I go to work, go to the gym, and bang hookers. It's not really the life I want but It's the one I'm forced into and 90% of men will have to follow the same path as me I'm lucky that I love my job.

Throughout history, only 40% of men got to reproduce, and the men back then didn't complain about It, we've just got to give up, and pursue other things in life.

54,s7jf26,1642572962,Some benefits to dating as a late bloomer.,"I've seen a lot of posts on here by young people worried and anxious about being late bloomers - either they are virgins or haven't had a relationship yet.

As someone who has been single all her life and was a virgin till 25, I was VERY self-conscious about it when I started dating. Over the last couple years, I've grown so much and been much more self-accepting of my history and I just want to share some positive experiences I've had as a result of being a late bloomer.

1\`. Everything is new and exciting! 

First kiss, holding hands, first real makeout with someone - I still feel all of these so intensely. The flip side of this is that it increases the risk of getting attached, but I like that about myself. I like that I can get strongly attached to people compared to people who've gotten a little desensitized to these things. 

2.  If you start dating in your mid-20s, people around your age tend to be a little more mature and so are you! 

Not everyone is that mature! we all learn at different rates BUT I know that me dating as an 18 year old would have been a disaster! I was still learning about effective communication and healthy boundaries. Now at 25, I know myself pretty well, I know how to take care of myself and know how to communicate effectively with people. And I also know what to tolerate and what not to. 

3. I was able to focus on my career and other things that I felt were important to me when I was younger

I really do feel that if I was involved with someone in college, I would not have been as successful. I had close to a perfect GPA and got into a grad program of my dreams. I also felt like I got to give a lot of time to friends and family. I would not have tried dating in college if I could go back in time since I wouldn't be where I am now. 

4. Lastly, you stand out. 

Yes, you may stand out negatively to some people but positively to others! There were guys who were so excited to show me things and do certain activities for the first time. It also makes certain people curious about you which can draw them in. 

Anyway, those were just some thoughts I had. Maybe you relate to them, maybe you don't, but this has been my personal experience.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7jf26/some_benefits_to_dating_as_a_late_bloomer/

Where should I go from here? Would I seem desperate if I message him again and ask him about his day or if he got up to anything fun? During our chats he mentioned he is very shy and doesn't like to reach out first hence why I been the one to start the last 2 chats. I want to show him I'm very interested but don't want to seem I'm just waiting around for him too.

He's totally my type. 

But lately I've been feeling quite unsure about my feelings for a very specific reason: He moves too fast. Maybe it's because I'm new in the relationship situation since he's the first guy I actually kissed and went out, so I have no clue how normal is to have this type of conversation after 2 months in. In less than a month talking he said he was in love with me, he wrote a song about me, he told his mom about me and keeps talking about ""when I come to his place"". 

Today I told him I was a bit scared on how fast things were going and he said that he was also scared because he never liked someone as much as he likes me. Maybe I made a mistake trying to talk it thru. I feel like he's a little immature sometimes, he often tries to romanticise everything.

My dating approach is kind of quick and systematic, I try to get their number then send some generic texts and set up dates. I don‚Äôt really take the time to talk to them much before meeting up. Just playing the numbers game.

The question is, what‚Äôs the issue here? What should I be doing to get the hot ones? Should I be more patient with them and actually talk and make a connection? Am I just not attractive enough?

I also don't understand it at all. I don't want to be judgemental, but these people are having kids while still living w their parents and working minimum wage jobs.

I feel like getting married is a huge step in a relationship, and I also feel that people who get married would want to kid free for at least a couple of years to enjoy whatever freedom they have. Having kids is a very demanding thing, sure it is rewarding, but I think it also strips you from any freedom you had, especially if you're working for 15$/hour and living with your parents.

It has been almost a decade since I've tried dating out again, and I'm scared shitless that history will repeat itself. 
 Mostly I can see the difference of how open I was to love, and how closed off I am now. I am not nearly as willing to show my true personality. I doesn't even feel like a choice, more like a deep seeded survival instinct. I really want to be emotionally available for this woman. I want to be able to make a real connection again. 
 Forgive me for being long winded, just wanted to give some extra info for context. Also I want to state that I am open to seeing a therapist if necessary. My question still stands. How do you get over the fear of abandonment, as well as making yourself emotionally available again?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7lf0a/to_those_that_suffer_from_fear_of_abandonment/
81,s7lhpa,1642580978,I need some advice please,"This might be a long post but I'll describe my situation. This is kinda difficult for me to write so please bear with me. &lt;3
So I'm a 27, soon to be 28 year old male in a small town in Ohio. I was raised kinda sheltered and didn't date growing up, I barely had female friends or friends much at all. I knew people and hung out but not that close. Was bullied a lot, was and am a fat kid. All my relationships have been atypical, where either it was all dating, or straight to bedroom. I never was a popular guy but knew a lot of people locally. 

Well I'm now working on exercise and dieting, I'm 23 days in, every day. I'm serious about it. I went through a rough relationship (kinda) and it made me realize that my lack of confidence is about my weight, and so I started changing that. 
I'm moved on, for the most part (I had a gut feeling for a while, had the last potiental relationship blow up on me in a very similar manner, down to specific details, but that's not relevant) so I took a step back and looked at myself and realized it was change or die. So that's what I'm doing. But I'm still ""lonely"" and shy. I'm a sensitive guy, and I feel like I subconsciously turn women off to dating. I'm working on that and have been for years in therapy. Which brings us to this post. My therapist told me I need to put myself out there. 

So how do I do that? I've had a few hits on dating sites, but they fizzled. Because I don't know how to text women. The women around here largely seem to either be unknown to me, or have a certain mindset I dislike. 

But part of my fear is, I don't feel like I look good enough, I feel like mentally I'm seen as too dark (I have mental illnesses like depression, ocd, possible ptsd and potentially am on the spectrum, I also dress in dark colors, listen to punk/emo/rock music primarily, and make dark jokes. But usually people laugh because they realize I use myself to make others laugh because I like making others laugh. I've been told I'm decent at it, but my brain tells me otherwise, and have super nerdy interests, oh and if you couldn't tell, I overword myself CONSTANTLY. I also am overweight, but also tall. Can provide pictures for feedback purposes?)

So I guess I just want to know if I am correct, or if not how do I market myself and how do I carry conversations? Oh and where at?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7lhpa/i_need_some_advice_please/

85,s7m7ny,1642584060,Dating too soon after a breakup but this new guy is GREAT. Any advice or thoughts are so appreciated I really need help.,"okay this is a lot but I would really appreciate anyone that wants to take a look at a huge issue I‚Äôm having and offer any thoughts or advice. 

TLDR: began a relationship too soon after a breakup and now I‚Äôm unsure if I should break things off with him to heal or stay with him and try to make it work. 

I (f 20) got broken up with in June, my relationship with my ex partner was so intense in good and bad ways but was ultimately unhealthy. They were my first love and and I didn‚Äôt want it to end. I was, and still am left with so much emotional baggage from this. Three months post break up I met my current boyfriend. We hit it off really quickly and he is a gem, he treats me incredibly, values me in every way, and wants to build something really great with me. However, now 4 months into this new relationship and I am having major doubts that I‚Äôm not ready for this. 

A recap of my new relationship, we basically never left each others sides after meeting, he told me he loved me a few weeks in, we spend most days together. (Yes this may seem like red flags galore.) i suspect moving so fast reflects immaturity in both of us, or at least a big need to have an attachment to someone. It‚Äôs also apparent that few people become this close with a stranger in 4 months, so does he really mean so much to me already that I ought to fight to have him or have I tricked my brain through creating an attachment that this relationship is essential? 

I had doubts at the beginning, I recall the first week of being together I almost clipped it in the bud because I was thinking of my ex and how I didn‚Äôt like how things moved so fast. But I stayed. Then 2 months in I had major doubts again, I was questioning if I was ready for a serious relationship as I could tell he really wants something serious and lasting with me. And I even brought it up to him that I was having doubts I was ready to be with him but ultimately decided to stay and I reassured him I was ready. Up until that point we had spent so much time together and I had grown to really care for him and the thought of not having him in my life made me so sad and I was persuaded by the hope of what could be with us if I healed and became ready. I‚Äôve had slow burn doubts throughout but have reconciled it or pushed it away. Now currently I‚Äôve been having a full on war in my mind again for a week or so, wondering if I need to end this relationship. 

I am not over my ex partner. I think of them often. And I find myself withdrawing from my boyfriend emotionally and PHYSICALLY. (This is a big one, I haven‚Äôt been able to get physical, I just don‚Äôt want to, and I‚Äôm a very sexual person.) 
After reading this it may seem like an obvious answer to end things but I genuinely care so deeply for my boyfriend, when I look at him I feel a connection, I feel very loved and I see a best friend. 

But I can‚Äôt stop being hot and cold towards him, I get annoyed with him very quickly sometimes, especially in my times of secret doubt, and the lack of sexual spark is confusing (especially because we were VERY sexual together in the beginning). I am so back and forth in my head that I‚Äôm ready, then I‚Äôm not, then I feel that I am, etc. is this in itself a huge sign? I don‚Äôt want to damage my relationship with this guy because of uncertainty. 

The reason I‚Äôm still holding out hope it could work is because he is amazing, he is a great person and if the time we‚Äôre right and I wasn‚Äôt so freshly out of a relationship I can see myself being ecstatic at the opportunity with him. I‚Äôm so confused and would appreciate any advice or thoughts anyone has.

might be daddy issues because my father is a musician, too. i like to consume and discuss art but don't feel the urge to create it myself.  


  
the men i date have a lifestyle that is very different from mine: they usually don't sleep at night, smoke, don't do much sports. they get very immersed in their creative activity where they seem to forget about the outside worlds for days or weeks at a time. they typically don't have a stable income or earn less than me.  


  
i have flexible working hours, i'm an early bird, like to start my day with yoga. i lift weights regularly,  go to the sauna and cold dipping in a river. i try to eat well. on the weekends i like to go hiking and bouldering.   


&amp;#x200B;

of course this is wildly incompatible with the lifestyle of my lovers. even they will tell me i should date someone who is more like me and who has more resources to spend quality time with me.  
however, anytime i get asked out by someone who is similar to me, i will immediately turn down the offer. i have friendzoned software devs, guys who were into biomedicine, anyone fitness-oriented.

how do it change it? is this a form of self-sabotage or a form of subconsciously avoiding a functioning relationship? is there any future for me with artists?

After thinking about this issue very long and hard, and after doing a lot of research on this subject, I could not find the solution to this problem so here I am on Reddit hoping to find some solace.
For context, after my last serious relationship, was 20 at the time, I decided to focus on my education and career, which I‚Äôv done successfully in my humble opinion, got a masters degree, a decently paying job and got promoted. I recently decided to dive back into dating, however, this time it felt and still feels different. I‚Äôm much more mature and want something real. I‚Äôv been on countless dates and met a lot of amazing women that I liked and they liked me back. Now the problem is,  this how a typical encounter goes for me. We go on multiple dates, girl says she likes me and wants to be with me, I accept, a week or two goes by, girl stops responding to texts, stops making time for us, sometimes even straight up ghosts me. I have tried everything, I have tried holding off a relationship, playing hard to get, I have tried providing constantly paying for all dates not in a simpy way just cause I can afford it. Nothing seems to work, this happened like 5 times in the last year.

90,s7mxzd,1642587099,Went on a date and am now confused,"Kind of a vent this one because its got me a tad disappointed. 

So i (24m) met a girl (22f) on tinder, we hit it off initially but replies started to slow a bit but still managed to score a date with her even after giving her the option to say no, she still said she was keen to meet up in person. This was after 2 weeks of talking on snapchat so we knew each other a bit by the time the date happened.

So date night rolls around and I pick her up and we go to a restaurant. Took a small amount to get into it which I have put down to nerves but in no time at all we have the conversation flowing for the next 3 hours of the date before I dropped her back home because she had work early and was feeling tired. We had laughs, banter and great conversation throughout the whole date.

Now for a bit of back story about her. She said she broke up with her last boyfriend at the start of 2021 because he was involved with the wrong crowd and she didn't like it. She said she could see the good in him but it just wasn't working. Another note is that it was her friends that downloaded tinder for her so she could get out the house and go out more. Lastly I am the first guy since the ex to have taken her on a date and get to talk to on a dating basis.

2 days go by after the date and I had initiated convo on both days since we went out which was making me worried. Not only that but I was left on seen when trying to keep it flowing. Finally the message saying she isn't ready for her next relationship which honestly sucked so bad because the date was amazing and she was an awesome girl. The reasoning I got as to why she wasn't ready is not because we didn't have a good time but because the timing is really bad for her. This is her last year in uni as well and I think the thought of a relationship is a bit daunting at the moment. She said we can hang again in the future but needs space right now and doesn't want to talk to anyone and just wants ""me time"". I really want to see her again but I don't know how to play it, I've made that known but if she wants space then there's nothing I can do, shit sucks.

Has anyone had a similar situation and managed to score a second date and make it work? Sounds desperate but I really felt something for this girl and would love to see her again",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7mxzd/went_on_a_date_and_am_now_confused/
91,s7ndqj,1642588933,Dating a girl in different cities,"I need your advice, me M(34)- I've been dating a girl (31) since September and it's looking very good and promising, we have loads of fun together, we are very alike and enjoy each others company, however, we live in different cities (45 miles / 70km apart).

Even though the distance is not that bad, we only see each other during the weekend and this is kind of becoming an issue. I don't have a car but she does, so for me, I have to take a 90mins train to see her.

She rents and shares an apartment with 3 more people and I own an apartment, so to me, I prefer when she comes over to my place as it feels a better place (her place looks like a university shared apartment, there's no living room) and we also have more space and privacy.

The issues I am experiencing now are these ones:  
\- She moved to that city about 7 months ago cause her sister lives there, however, I have my friends and work in my city and they are the only thing I have (family lives in a different country). So I don't want to live there just because her sister lives there too, as I will have to sacrifice the little I have and start a new life just knowing her in that place. I know it sounds very dramatic but probably I will start losing my connections.

\- I used to meet my friends at the gym every Saturday morning from 10:30 am till 12, and she already mentioned this is annoying asking if I could change it as we only see each other over the weekend and wants to spend more time with me. This is an issue when I need to go to her apartment as it takes me a while to get there.

\- She started the process of buying an apartment, so if we stay together we will end up having 2 apartments in different cities, again my apartment is far better in terms of location, size and quality. Her budget is very limited so if I ever move there, I will reduce my quality of living.

So my issue is, I am not willing to start a new life in her city and I told her already that if we move together, it would be to either my city or a bigger city and not to a little town. I just feel that my future opportunities and things to do are going to be limited just because her sister lives there. Apart from that, I would need to buy a car cause the public transport in her city is very poor.

So I have been thinking a lot about this and it feels this is a long term failure, cause she will stay with her family and I will stay in my place or somewhere with higher opportunities for the future.

99,s7nua6,1642590767,In a relationship with my high school crush!,"We're both 25 years old, went to high school together, same class, but were never too close. We haven't seen or heard from each other in 6 full years and 4 months ago we ended up in contact, by chance.

In high school, I was an annoying kid and she even said that she wasn't really fond of me (can't blame her at all!). I was bullied through elementary school and then I wanted to be cool in high school, so I was the loudest, most annoying kid in the class. I was a bad student, had pimples all over my face and strived for attention.

She was always adorable, with a beautiful smile, eyes and pretty much everything. She was never one of those popular girls, in fact, she only had a few friends back then that she's still close with nowadays. She was a good student, quiet and attentive. Apparently, she claims that she did have an attitude back then and was a bit rude, but we've rarely ever even talked.

However, I still had a crush on her for like a year in high school. I didn't really tell many people about it, since we were in the same class and didn't talk to each other almost at all, so it was a bit ""illogical"". I remember sometimes staring at her, while sitting in the back, probably looking creepy.

High school ended, we had prom (where she was absolutely stunning) and after the last day, I haven't seen her for 6 years. Last year, we ever had a small get-together, a 5th year anniversary, but she didn't come. I grew up a lot since high school, became a better, serious and ambitious person, people even commented on how different I was.

So, months ago, I wrote this really long status about my year, 2021 was really dramatic and life-changing for me and I decided to share what I went through with my Facebook friends (for whatever reason). Turns out, it was the best thing I ever did. It was a really, really long text and while many of my friends and close ones read it, I was surprised to see her like on it, after 6 years with no contact, nothing. Even more interesting is the fact that I removed many of my hugh school classmates from my friend list, but she was one of the rare ones that remained there.

My logic was telling me that if somebody was willing to read something so long and intimate about me, they obviously care about me in some way, at least enough to wonder about my life. So, I hit her up, nervously, after 6 years.

To my surprise, she replied with a long, detailed and excited message and we started chatting. It went from few messages a day to all-day long chats and I recommended for us to meet. Obviously, she said yes. We went out and damn, when I saw her, I was speechless. I've been in relationships since high school, I've had crushes, but that smile of hers and those eyes hypnotized me once again.

We really hit it off, talking about everything, she was also in a long, toxic relationship, just like my last one, we talked about our lives, intimate things, what we went through, everything. She recommended the next day that we meet up again in a day or two and we did.

That time, she came completely ""prepared"", made herself look even more attractive and not casual as the first time and we continued the trend of really getting to know each other as people, sharing our viewpoints, experiences and traumas, even.

After that evening, I asked her out on a date... and she declined. She said that while she does feel some attraction to me, it's way too soon, she's recovering from her previous relationship and she wants to really get to know me before accepting that. I understood her and we continued just hanging out, but I was crushing on her very much.

After a month and a half, I went on a vacation to Netherlands for a week and a half, she read my novel while I was there, I even surprised her with a video call one evening. Basically, things were really heating up and that vacation was beautiful in general, but even more so knowing that it helped us get to where we are now, as she missed me and I had a chance to distract myself for a bit.

Soon after I returned, we met, we talked a lot, I talked about my trip, she was dissecting my novel, there was even more physical contact than before and so on. A week or two after, I found a stray dog close to my work. It was my second one in 2021, the first one I adopted and he is a precious, thankful little fluff of happiness, but this one I just couldn't. So I offered it to her and she adopted him.

After that, she said how much I changed her life, even to the point of being responsible for having her first dog. And then she asked me out. I was smitten, smiling and I accepted it (obviously).

We went out, held each others hand, talked, hugged much more, but we actually only kissed on our third date! First one was a jazz concert (we both love it), second one was unplanned, but a music video filming for my friend's band and the third one was dinner. Our first kiss was absolutely phenomenal, extremely natural and breathtaking.

After that, it became much easier, we dated for a few more weeks, kissed a lot, only became more intimate after a few weeks and we have officially been together since Christmas Eve, which we spent together (one of the best nights of my life).

Everything with her seems so easy and beautiful, she makes me smile, really brings out the best in me, we have similar views, beliefs and interests. Even after some time, I still feel shivers when we kiss, no need to even mention anything further than that.

I've never been with somebody so amazing, so drop-dead gorgeous, smart, funny and into me. She really appreciates me and I appreciate every little thing she does. She really deserves every single thing that I do for her, especially cooking - I love cooking, have been doing it for years and I prepare some really exotic, nice meals for her and she returns that and so much more. I don't think loving her will ever be a problem.

I intend to continue taking her out on amazing dates and being the best for her, just because I ""have her"" already, doesn't mean that I don't want to impress her every now and then and bring out that perfect smile.
