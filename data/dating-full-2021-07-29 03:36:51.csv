I’m turning 30 in a few weeks and have never had a girlfriend; no, not that there is anything wrong with me, because for all intense and purposes I am currently the best version of myself I have ever been. I’m single and never had a girlfriend before because the right person just hasn’t come along yet and that’s okay. 

What really bugs me is when I see constant advice on Reddit along the lines of “work on yourself first”, “enjoy being single”, “If you can’t be happy on your own then you can’t expect someone else to make you happy.” “Maybe you should try therapy” etc etc etc 

The problem with those statements is that they always imply that person is doing something wrong or there is something inherently wrong with them…this is a silly assumption. 

I personally work a good full-time job, hit the gym 5 days a week, live alone in my own place, have a very supportive family and small friend group and even enjoy a numerous number of activities like hiking, amateur modeling, gaming and photography. I am in a great spot. 

Where I do struggle is dealing with the feeling of loneliness. Everywhere you go there is a constant reminder of how shitty being single is. Just this weekend I went hiking on my own to a beautiful location and all I saw the whole time were couples holding hands and enjoying the beautiful Saturday together; I was envious of them. 

I want to know what it’s like to have a date night, cuddle up on a Sunday evening watching a movie, celebrate Valentine’s Day, cook a meal together, have silly arguments, not be a fifth wheel when I get invited out and my friends bring their wives and most of all fall in love and be a dad. Some of the best moments in life come from being in a relationship. Some things you just can’t do alone and certainly not enjoy to their full potential; especially the being a dad part. 

Those are normal desires and it’s hard to cope, especially as you get older.

 I'm a Man and I tried Hooking Up two times, both times it was incredibly bad and I simply did not like it. But it helped me finding out what I want in life and what my Values regarding Sex is. Because I like Sex allot, but only if it's with someone who I have a lot of intimacy with.  That's the first thing, I get judged when I decline to hook up with them and get told to ""grow up and become a man"". Like what? Just because I'm a Man, I can't decline Sex with a Hot Woman? That's stupid. 

In general, when I'm dating I'm looking for Partner with the same Values like I have, I always did and this ended in great Relationships. And for me seeing Sex as something special between two People is a kind of Value. I always was respectful to the Woman I would stop dating because of to many Sex Partner.  You can do whatever you want and I'm not judging you, I would even be friends with you. But I don't want a Partner who just sees it as a fun Activity you can do with Strangers. This Woman are getting mostly extremely defensive and telling me I'm a Sexist when im dumping them. Which is weird, because I think it's a reasonable decision for a Woman to not date any Fuck Boy or a Guy who sleeps around a lot. I don't make a difference here between Men and Woman.

I've tried various different approaches, always adhering to the social norms and not behaving out of place, yet, to no success whatsoever.

However, today I have a different kind of question, as it seems there is no general advice on the above part. What I would like to ask you all, is how do you manage, when beginning to communicate with someone you have romantic interest in, to not create any expectations, so that in the end, when things don't work out, you don't get sad/depressed and let it affect you.

It's simply not inherent for me to put effort into something (be it a project, hobby, or in this case dating) and not expect results. This last girl I was talking to seemed really nice at first glance, however, it turned out she's still a bit confused with life and I didn't fit her perfect friend/partner model.

Don't get me wrong, I'm completely fine with this, everyone is entitled to a choice and preference. The problem is that I had convinced myself that, after so many failed attempts, even if things don't work out, it's simply how it was meant to be and I shouldn't stress over it. 

I was sure I wouldn't let it get to me (this time) and I will just carry on with my job, hobbies and daily life. Well, this didn't really happen and when the picture became clear to me (that things aren't going to work out) I could almost feel my heart become heavier and my mood, from rather cheerful or at least definitely above neutral, definitely plummeted and I couldn't bring myself to do anything I found enjoyable for the rest of the day.

It's just that each and every fail is taking toll on me and I'm not sure how long I can keep this up. I'm a man so society has some expectations already set for me, I have a really disfunctional family, can't communicate with my friends of recently and I don't see anybody to turn to for help.

There's this guy at work who came up with a theory. But before I introduce the theory, I want to give you a bit of a background on him. He's in his early 30s, married, has a seven-year-old daughter. He constantly makes jokes about cheating on his wife with younger coworkers and seems dissatisfied with the marriage, when confronted about it, says he's staying with his wife for the sake of their daughter. Yet he always does whatever the wife tells him to - she wanted a car, he bought her one even though he was very opposed to doing so, she asked him to leave a work picnic on the lake, he did so immediately, etc. 

Now onto the theory itself. According to him there are 5 kinds of women in this world. 

1 - the unattainable ones (virtually perfect, too good to be true, but you can only dream about them);
2 - the marriage material (not as great as the previous kind, but good enough to the point where you want to settle down and spend the rest of your life with them);
3 - the ones you would only hang out/mess around with (you wouldn't consider seriously dating them, they are only good for a fling);
4 - the one-night-stand ones (only good for a few commitment-free nights, wouldn't even waste your time on getting to know them);
5 - the ones that you wouldn't even have sex with, unless you were drunk or they paid you (pretty self-explanatory). 

I've talked to a few people about it, most seem to believe it's bs, but I'm really curious what you have to say.

Never posted in this subreddit before so please bear with me! I recently moved to a new country / city and have been in a hotel quarantine for nearly two weeks. I've \[M27\] been single for a few months and been involved in a fair few casual relationships, ONS etc. I was kinda expecting this to be the case when I came here, so whilst I was bored I went on all the usual apps and had a few convos with a few girls.  


Anyway something fairly crazy happened in that I actually started speaking to someone \[f27\] where almost immediately there was this crazy chemistry. We have been speaking for just over a week now and it's almost constant messaging, calling etc, and it all just feels so awesome and natural. Being someone who has done this dance before, I don't think I can recall a moment in my life when I've connected to someone this much online, or indeed maybe at all, and from what I can tell the feeling seems reciprocated. Anyways, we are due to have our first date on Sunday when I get out of the hotel, and as it gets nearer I'm starting to get more anxious about it.  


I've been reading a lot about how online / video calls never quite equate to physical chemistry. I was wondering what people's personal experience of this was, and if they had any tips? As a disclaimer we have both been very emotionally raw and honest with each other text / call, and are clearly physically interested in each other (ahem) and I was wondering how best to utilise that energy?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,926157,public,self,Nervous before a first date,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otv46x/nervous_before_a_first_date/,all_ads,6,,,

I feel like it's too late, I've already missed the fun 10 years from 16 to 26. People want to get married now and I didn't even have my first kiss. 

I was deeply hurt by the fact that I couldn't have someone I wanted when I was younger (HS). It wasn't even so much about having that someone, but more that I just wasn't good enough, or thats at least how I felt about it. 

When I started going to a STEM university (I'm from Europe), I basically had a talk with myself.  
If I can't have the women I want, I'll focus on myself and achieve other things and won't settle until I do. I started working out in HS, and seeing a visible change on my body, I for the first time felt like I was in control of something. I could change something, and that's what I did. I kept on working on myself thru out the university, mentally and physically, and I'm happy I did that.

A few girls, over the 10 year period, have shown interest in me, but I wasn't interested in them, I was focused on myself and on the women I wanted, but that didn't want me.

Now, at 26, I'm a very fit, tall guy. I'm 188cm tall (6'2), athletic, take care of my looks/clothes, I have a STEM degree and work as an IT engineer for a few years, have my place, drive a nice car, but I'm still alone.

I know those ""achievements"" won't get me the women I want, but I'm not getting looked at anywhere I go, and the more time passes, the less I feel like something is going to happen. I still feel like that 16 year old kid at times. 

I'm not motivated to chase women. I'd rather work on my career and stay single, rather than chase someone average that I don't really want. People ask me why won't I give someone a chance, but why am I not given a chance when I want one? The more time passes, the more bitter about relationships I'm becoming. I can remember all the women I've found appealing over the years, since there are just a few. And nothing happened with any of them.

I can't narrow the gap between the women I want and the women that want me. Or at least I don't know how. Fu\*k I'm going to die alone.

I personally get really turned off, because it makes me think the person is using me. Just a personal example: when I was young and dumb, a girl I had a crush on said we could go on a date if I bought her a video game. I did, then she said she *wasn't ready to date anyone,* never paid me back, and never spoke to me again.


I especially feel this way if we haven't even met in person yet. If she asks we have our first meeting at an expensive restaurant, I think she's only looking to get a fancy meal for free, and even if that's not the case, I'm not interested in spending $80 on dinner just to find out we have no chemistry.


I was talking with friends about dating and brought this up. For the most part they understood but a point they brought up is that we, as men, are in constant competition with other men during the dating phase, and someone who *does* follow through with buying gifts is going to have the advantage.

I am a 25M who has not dated in 10 years, and got out of a long relationship/marriage last year. I spent months working on myself, rediscovering hobbies, working out and getting fit, and focusing on myself and having fun. But I was close to starting a family before my divorce, and that is a huge want for me, so I want to get back out there.

I decided to try online dating out, got an account for tinder/bumble/hinge. At first I had a couple matches, nothing great but a start. Then nothing. Finding it weird, I asked my girl best friend to look over my profile and give me tips. She said that everything looked great, my personality showed well, and my pictures were giving me a good look, and she'd of swiped on me had we not known each other. Yet still, after several months, I have only been on one date and that girl only wanted attention. 

Being someone who works all the time, it is hard to find people that I don't work with (and the options are scarce at my workplace). I don't really go out, nor have the desire to look for a meaningful relationship at bars. I work so much I do not have time to attend my church much, so that's off the table. I want to meet someone naturally, so online dating really doesn't seem to be my thing, but having not dated in 10 years, I feel like my way of doing things is old school and doesn't work these days.

This relationship is a mess. I love him from the bottom of my heart, but he doesn't reciprocate and I tried to discuss about it with him, to know if I should move on or if I can hope because I know I'm no catch and those things can take a while, but each time he couldn't give me a straight answer. So in February I misunderstood and thought I had a good chance: I let myself fall really in love. Then, in April, he was a bit drunk and he told me about the girl before me (A), two years ago, whom he loved and had a fling with but she found someone else and kindly told him they could still be friends. So they're still very much friends and he is still very much in love with her but doesn't want to acknowledge it. He couldn't tell me he and I were just a casual sex item, but I could hear it.

Now, in April, it shattered my heart. I took it pretty well on the phone and told him I was happy to spend some time with him anyway, but after that I stopped texting and proposing online dates, in an attempt to heal and move on. He didn't stop talking to me though, talked to me more than ever actually, and I responded politely until he asked if we could hang out again. Stupid me decided it wasn't so bad of an idea, I was feeling better already and we were still friends, and let's be honest, I kinda wanted to have sex with him because we are undoubtedly compatible. I was wrong, obviously, nothing was over for me, again: stupid. We spent the weekend together, like a cute couple, going out and cuddling and all, so when he left, hope came back. He then proceeded to crush it little by little, never reciprocating anything remotely affectionate I sent him. And then, this happens:
I had the occasion to plan a trip to go to him, and also I wasn't sure if or how I wanted to end our relation, I knew for sure I wanted to see him one last time. I decided we would talk about it face to face, better for everyone. Last week though, A called him to plan her birthday, saying she wanted him there, probably on the day I was coming mind you, so he asked if it was possible for her to do it next weekend but she seemed less happy about that. So he asked me, if I could come on another weekend. I was visibly unhappy about it but said yes, thinking I wouldn't go at all if it happened and I'd end everything on the phone. It hurt me so much to actually understand how little importance I had in his life. Turns out she has too much work, she can't party. So I'm still going. And I'm ""breaking up"" with him on our last day together, this weekend. I'm selfish, I want to be with him one last time. I can't take it anymore, I'm mentally in a much better place than a year ago and I can't let this relationship that doesn't even exist mess with my head. And my already broken heart.

I guess I'm just venting, I'm so sad. I feel like if we could've dated in person it would've been different. He is such a sweet man, so considerate and so passionate. At first, I thought he showed his affection in his actions, asking me how I am feeling, saying I can always talk to him, answering my texts and my calls, actually trying to be present when I need it. I was wrong. I feel bad that I saw something that wasn't there. I feel so stupid and embarrassed. I feel like the pain is never gonna really go away.

I had my first kiss when I was 19 with a 21 y/o while I was working abroad in Spain during the summer - we were celebrating one of my coworkers' birthday at his place and he was one of his friends.
He asked me to hang out alone a couple of times after that, but we didn't click at all and run out of things to say pretty quickly so we ended up ghosting each other.
I haven't kissed a anyone ever since.

When I got back to university I decided I was gonna start dating around, but then Covid happened and I took all of my classes online until graduation, so I didn't really get the chance to meet anyone. 

I would ask my friends to introduce me to someone, but they basically only hang out with me and they're not big into dating either - one of them just found her first boyfriend at age 21, while the other one is 23 and hasn't dated since high school. They also don't like clubbing or drinking, so that's not an option either (I tried to go alone to a pub once and I felt so uncomfortable). Then again, it's not very safe to hang out in crowded places at the moment.

I moving out of town soon tho to start my master's degree and since I'm gonna have classes on campus I really wanna do better and meet new people and maybe go on some dates... I just don't know how. I really struggle to socialise, but I wanna do my best.

So, any tips on how to go about this? What should I do? How do I meet guys and eventually ask them out/get them to ask me out? What's the etiquette for dating? Anything I should be aware of?

ps: I'm not against casual relationships, but I need to feel comfortable with someone first since I've never done anything like this, therefore I would like tips on how to meet people in real life and not through dating apps since they are mostly used for one night stands here and you don't really get to know the other person much beforehand.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,926501,public,self,How to get into the dating scene (F23),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otznqv/how_to_get_into_the_dating_scene_f23/,all_ads,6,,,

In the beginning, here and there i'd notice he'd like some photo of a girl he knows and not think twice about it. This stuff popped up periodically on my discovery feed, and I never went looking for it... it was just something I noticed a couple of times as i scrolled through it. The photos were usually of their cool travel experiences or something that was genuinely interesting... but his engagement on social media is pretty minimal. 

Lately however, I was triggered a bit when a picture popped up in my feed of a very pretty woman that I believe he met when he was at an F1 race. I saw that he had left a comment on this girls bikini photo, referencing some inside joke from when he was out there a couple years ago. She didn't reply to it, but it was a bit startling for me just because he goes on about how much of a waste of time social media is, and he rarely posts let alone comments on anything. When I looked back at her feed, he had suddenly started liking all her selfies. 

He hasn't posted any pics of me and him together and at this point he hasn't told me that he loves me but he does treat me exceptionally well. For instance, he bought me some brand new camping gear last week as an early birthday gift and we are headed off for a backcountry trip this week. He spends money and his time on me, and has introduced me to friends and family. Unfortunately because it is out of character for him to comment on peoples pictures, let alone other women... the sting it caused made me do a deep dive into his friends list and noticed that specifically within the last month or two, the only photos he's ever liked are of other women, usually very pretty women that he knows, and only their selfies. His friends photos? Meh. Very few interactions. One girl in particular had about 6 selfies in a row and then a photo of her and her boyfrined. He liked all the photos of her except the one with her boyfriend. 

While I don't compare myself to these woman, it made me feel like maybe he was keeping his options open by offering up validation to these other girls. He told me early on in the relationship that he has never had much luck with women, which I found confusing as my view of him is that he is a great catch. Super kind and hardworking. Another reason it makes me fearful is that I come from a highly religious family and have a sour relationship with my parents as they rejected my decision to not attend church anymore when i was in my early 20's. Sometimes I worry this makes him second guess whether we are right for each other as he has a loving family who were happy to meet me, and my parents will likely never accept him... or would at least try to sabotage the relationship if they could. I have made it clear to him that they don't play a part in influencing my relationship choices, and that I will not put my partner in a position to be hurt by people who are behaving intolerant and irrational. It truly sucks because if i could change the situation... I would. But there are definitely women out there with better families that he could be a part of, and that reality really hurts me. 

 It made me wonder if he'd leave me if any of these women reached out to him (or he reached out to them and they reciprocated) and expressed interest. This likely shows that I think very little of myself, but I felt really sad mostly because I am extremely conscious about all my interactions with men, whether strangers or friends... just in case the wrong impression is given. I've been cheated on before, twice actually, and I know how confusing and devastating it can be when someone has no interest in respecting you or telling you the truth. I never want to give anyone any reason to think I don't have their best interests at heart, and I feel I am falling for my boyfriend pretty hard at this point.. 

 I want to stress I have no bitterness towards any of these beautiful women.  As it stands, there is nothing on his account to signify he has a girlfriend, and I think this fact makes me anxious that he is leaving himself open to better options by presenting as single. All i know is that any time a dude who has a girlfriend likes my selfies, or comments under them, i lose respect for him and feel bad for his girlfriend. Perhaps I am overthinking it, but I'd just appreciate some insight.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,926513,public,self,"My boyfriend has started liking other girls selfies more frequently, and it's bothering me.

Ended up seeing her 1.5 weeks ago and we spent the whole weekend together. Felt very natural with her and we were practically acting like a couple that whole weekend--hand holding, kissing, etc (all of which she initiated first btw). We both said we had a lot of fun and enjoyed the weekend and before I left she said she was so glad I came to see her and to keep in touch. However, earlier that day I asked if she wanted to come visit me next and she didn't really say/was hesitant so I assumed that I was maybe moving too fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next 7 days after that we just texted back and forth about small stuff--I didn't really mention the weekend with her and neither did she, but I did make some jokes about some stuff we learned about each other when hanging out. I wasn't sure what the next move was after having visited her because I didn't want to say something and have it backfire from me appearing to be moving too fast, so I played it a bit slow.

My whole world crashed that day and I never recovered. She was not there to support me by being gentle, nice to me and by showing affection. I do not feel loved nor appreciated, and we only have sex like 2-3 times a month. I am in my late twenties, we married young.

I tried talking with her but she gets nervous, start yelling and saying really bad words which hurt me. I was a sportsman, black belt, so I do not fail in that part. I tried ti be perfect but now I am in a big deppression. Every day I think of killing myself, but I cant do that to my kids.

I was also very religious, not strict in any way, but I loved  the calm heart when praying. I left religion after all of this.

My deppression is so hard that sometimes I just stare at wall being lonely and sad. I tried talking with specialized people for many months, but nothing saved me. I started smoking  alot and I am thinking of starting drinking, eventhough I am afraid that if I do that that will end me forever and I want to be saved from this state.

I cant say that she does not love me, because I think that she does but she almost never shows it. I am crying my soul out while writing this. I know I need help, but I do not know how to help myself, I just want to be loved, appreciated and happy. I can't sleep in most nights because I am so sad.

We are in our early 20s and it was my 3rd first date ever. I was nervous since I had such little experience. I made her laugh in the car ride there but conversation was still awkward and clunky and there were silences. We had bought lunch beforehand so we had lunch in beach and built sandcastles. Then we took a hike and explored a bit and then we drove to a cute waterfront town where we explored and got sweets at a shop.

The conversation was still awkward with pauses but we decided to go another beach an hour away. When we got there I asked her to make a sand heart and she did and then we did some dancing on the shore. When we sat back down it was cold and I put my arm around her and i managed to kiss her on the cheek and then the lips, then a few times. We got into a makeout session on the sand and French kissed and then laid down next to each other on the sand holding hands but it was cold and the sunset I came to watch with her wasn’t for another hour or more so I decided to go back to the car with her.

In my car we went at it made out my head in her lap but we decided to drive back and she kept kissing my hand while I was driving. In the freeway she gave me hickeys and had her arm around me. Then when we got back to where she had her car she made out more with me but nothing really sexual then we kissed more walking to her car and that was it. She said we could see each other again and that she had a great time.  I am just a 5’6 guy without a muscular build who is shy

Younger girl I've been crushing on for nearly a year found out a lot of embarrassing stuff about my childhood, what I did, how I behaved etc. I was also an ADHD fat kid with frequent rage outbursts bullying other kids, throwing chairs out the window. I was stupid and vulnerable and didn't watch my tongue in front of her best friend (we were hanging outside with our mutual friend; my crush wasn't there). I managed to slip somehow. Of course she told her. As far as I know, her best friend also told my friend I'd be a cool fit for her. I managed to overshare shit about me and actually open up emotionally. It wasn't no gay vent to a girl, I just spoke too much about myself, I was laughing about it anyway and we had a good time. But it was very cringey in my eyes, especially me being a man and usually keeping stuff like this to myself. The less they know, the better the chance.

To make things even worse her brother was my classmate in elementary. We are in good relations and almost neighbours. He probably confirmed a lot of the stories if she ever asked him. I feel like she sees through me now, maybe that's an insecurity? I want to ask her out but I was never in a situtation where the girl I'm infatuated by knows a lot of my cringey past. She's very beautiful, one of the best looking girls her age. But she's shy, introverted, works out at the gym hard and doesn't seem to trust a lot of people. Maybe because she has 3 or 4 brothers. I felt like she was avoiding me like the plague at first, but all of a sudden I realized we pass by each other a lot in the neighbourhood, at the gym she's smiling always when she sees me etc. She didn't behave like this before. She was very cold before so this is weird.

Keep in mind, I've met with her friend a couple of times later after that cringey night and we had a blast each time. Maybe I unintentionally fixed what I fucked up and now she sees me as a fun guy now. This COULD BE! But she could also easily see me as a weirdo. Easily. I can't lie, I've had my awkward moment. She was also the 'weird silent kid' once and wasn't really pretty. She always seemed to stick to the corners and walls and she was scared of anyone.
