All the signs were there. She was the one that started being a lot more chatty and flirting with me at work (she began teasing me all the time). She would offer to drive me home every time from work. She made up some bad excuse to get my number. She would talk about me all the time to other coworkers. She would occasionally compliment me, calling me cute or saying I have nice features. She would bump into me jokingly, and would get me to do things like get her coat for her. She would always bring up going out for drinks, or going to the movies. She would walk over to me during our shifts, and stand super close to me when we talked. We would text all the time, sometimes after our shifts. When she broke up with her boyfriend, she brought it up to me several times. 

Here's where I think I fucked up. When she brought up she broke up with her boyfriend, it was one of her last shifts at our company. I didn't press further because I didn't want to seem rude. But when she drove me home that night, she seemed kind of dejected, and was just like ""I'm sure I'll see you around"". I think she wanted me to show a bigger interest in the fact that she broke up with her boyfriend. I then invited her out to join me and my other friend going to a club later that week. She said she's going to get her schedule from work and that she'd come if she wasn't working. This is where I think I fucked up the 2nd time. I texted her later that week saying the plan, and she said she'd let me know. Then the day of, I didn't text her, and I never heard anything from her, so I went to the club without her. My friend told me that some girls want you to text them the day you're supposed to go out that night so they feel like they're wanted. I was just trying to not be pushy. He also said I should've invited her to do a 1 on 1 thing rather than to join my friends. After that we stopped talking completely.

Neither of us are really sure why we're feeling the way we are. I think the last time she's had sex might have been 2 years ago but I didn't ask her explicitly. The last time I've had sex was around 5 years ago.
Leading up to the dates I was really excited to be with her and talk to her, etc. But now, like I said I'm really confused about everything for some reason. I don't remember sex effecting me this much the first time.

**Depth**: Good conversation tends to have depth, meaning the replies from both parties are detailed and descriptive. They tend to be longer, have multiple parts, and are emotional. eg ""My morning was great! I just made some pancakes and they turned out to be perfect. Too bad I ran out of Nutella :(. How is your Sunday coming along?"" as opposed to ""Great. Just had breakfast. You?""

**Convergence**: A great conversation has replies that tend to converge when discussing a topic ie the time taken to reply by both parties progressively reduces over time eg she replies in 1 hour, he replies in 45 minutes, she replies in 35 minutes, and so on. This is obviously not hard and fast and can periodically diverge because we are all busy with our lives but some level of convergence shows that you are interested in them and vice versa.

**Media**: As they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Sharing pictures/audio/memes/links when used strategically takes the conversation to a whole another level, especially if is original content.

**An anchor**: I have seen a great pickup line or icebreaker doesn't really cut it for me. It usually takes an anchoring topic that both parties dive into for a short while until they become comfortable with each other. It could be a shared like/dislike, current event, etc eg moving into a new apartment, getting a new pet, a recent celeb scandal - anything that gets both the parties talking freely.

**Humour/banter**: This one goes without saying but it is so important that it shouldn't be left out. I personally have never seen a good convo where there weren't some jokes/ribbing/sarcasm/jokes/lols.

**Natural**: The minute you try to force a conversation you make it worse. Sometimes it is better to just let it go. Talk less, change the topic, change the rhythm, and if nothing works just stop. If it feels like an interview or interrogation you are doing it wrong.

And before that I had even problems making good friends. So I focused on myself and having a great college life, made great friend and had great experiences but generally stayed away from dating/relationships. 

While I've had self esteem issues all my life ( I know a lot of people do, I'm sorry if that sounds like I'm trying to give myself some kind of self importance). but yeah I'm 6ft 3 and now I'm a little chubby in my stomach area because I had a really bad accident which led to a broken back and also I fell from the second floor which really broke my left arm ( I still can't grip properly). So I worked hard to regain basic strength along with working on myself and overcoming mental barriers to reach here where I feel I'm actually gaining proper gym strength( upper and lower body along with back) but I still have that belly fat I need to get rid of.

But the thing is, all people see is a ""fat"" guy. I know I'm not that fat but yes when you notice my belly being a little wider than what it should be then yes I can be called fat. I'm still working hard to reduce it and it'll take time because belly fat is really hard to lose. Even a few ""friends"" I made here made some comments about them not believing I work out and that I wasn't dateable. I don't think I'm undateable because of my fat.. i know I might not be gifted with a ryan gosling face but I clean up well and look good, but yes that fat does annoy me and brings down my insecurities.

So now I, an Indian guy is in Birmingham England,getting his master's degree and meeting tons of other people. But yeah, I am alone and now after staying away from dating for so long.. I do wanna date some cute nice girl who likes me for who I am and LOL I'm not even rich because I'm an international student here on a budget trying to ""make it"".. and I know I will make it.  I hope this doesn't sound like I'm boasting but I'm a really great boyfriend... I'll take care of my girl, I'll be there for her, take her out on experiences,   ( in my financial capabilities and will go above and beyond my capabilities too) love her and walk around the city talking to her, snuggling in bed, studying together and I dunno much more. I'm unable to meet someone here though and I don't think dating people from my classes and/or my accommodation ( like the people I'll see EVERYDAY and have to work with) is a good idea... although I'm sure even that is a tough thing for me. 

I finally caved in and downloaded bumble yesterday.. hoping I can meet someone I can connect with more than just on texts. I understand that I don't ""need"" someone to make my life complete or make me happy... but I'm just a guy who wants a partner now. I'm 23 and have never had one proper nice long term loving relationship. But I know I can, if I can barely pass the first few gates. 

Also, there's a lot of stereotypes about Indian men ..some well deserved( and I know some of those people) and some really bad and undeserving and really off putting. I'm finding it difficult beyond approaching, talking and taking their numbers.... I find no real connection no effort from the other side. Is this what western dating culture is like(literally I wanna Know..)? Because people here are open, expressing themselves , being themselves, be it men or women and other non binary human beings, so I thought the stereotyping wouldn't be that much and dating would be just fine. Anyway.. the point is, I don't know what to do...  typing all this kind of makes me sound selfish and as if ther aren't bigger problems in this world.. but yeah, while I'm normally very confident,  I'm kind of in shambles right now with this)

I literally think I just need a pep talk lol. I matched with a girl on tinder last week and it’s going incredibly well. She’s smart as hell, really funny, kind, thoughtful, so good looking that my friends seem to think she’s ‘out of my league’, has similar interests to me, etc. And above all, she actually seems really into me. When we’re both free we text back and forward like rapidly, she gave me her number and all her socials, she was the one to message first, she sends me songs and other recommendations of things she likes that she thinks I would, when tv shows we’re both into her brought up she slyly suggests we should ‘watch it together’, etc. 

It’s getting to the point where I feel like I should definitely ask her out. We’ve been talking for like over a week now, we’re clearly comfortable with each other and enjoying talking to each other and she’s done a lot of the initiative taking so far lmfao. It’s just that I’ve never been in this position before. I’ve never had a girl show like such an obvious interest in me. I’ve asked girls out in the past but it’s never, ever been a yes. I’ve been rejected every time, and I’m just a naturally anxious person, so those times often came after weeks of building up courage.

But I’m 23, never been on a date and this mindset is exactly why. It’s time to grow the fuck up. If I can’t ask out an interesting, kind girl who I’m really attracted to that’s all but throwing herself at me, how the fuck am I ever gonna ask out anyone? It’s such an irrational fear, and yet I just can’t shake it. I know I’m being stupid and yet the thought of just asking her if she’s free and hitting her up with an idea for a date terrifies me. I feel like having no relationship experience has emotionally stunted me into being stuck in the mindset of like a 14 year old boy. I genuinely think part of me feels like I’m unlovable cause it’s never happened for me before, and now when a girl is showing clear, continued interest, rather than leap on the opportunity my brain just wants to shut down and run off.

She knows my friend that is getting married but I don't think she will be invited because it's going to be fairly small and they are good friends. 

So my question is, is asking someone to be your date to a wedding even a good idea to spark a potential relationship? Seconds what is the best way to go about it? Also as a backup if that doesn't work out, what's a good way to ask someone to be your date to a wedding in a non-romantic way, just as a friend to go with?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1031915,public,self,Asking someone to be your date for a wedding?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxd1ot/asking_someone_to_be_your_date_for_a_wedding/,all_ads,6,,,

Both of them are dudes. I am a girl for the record. Both of them are really great people, but really different people.

The first, let's call him John, is a bit of an aloof person. He isn't very emotional and isn't the most talkative person. He's tall and I'd say pretty handsome. He's very kind and has a sweet heart. I've known him for almost 6 years now, and we hang out pretty regularly. Things can be kind of awkward when we interact though, because he's super quite, and I'm super talkative, and honestly, it feels like talking to a brick wall sometimes.

Onto the second guy. We'll call him Tim. Tim is a really great guy. He's a lot more talkative than John, and definitely more expressive. He's very outward when it comes to his feelings. I've known Tim for only 4 years, and there was about a year there where we got busy and didn't talk. We just very recently reconnected and went out together. Meeting up with him for the first time in a while was amazing. There were no awkward silences (like there usually are with John) and he was so chill. We had the best time. I can also tell that Tim really cares about me, and he's even expressed that to me, while John has never really expressed any concern for my wellbeing in a way. I know John cares about me and he's just way to shy to say anything about it, but it's still hard sometimes.

Another thing about John is that my interests are never a huge deal to him. When he recommends things to me I usually look into him, but when it's the other way around, he kind of disregards my interest whereas Tim tries to understand what I like and vice versa. 

I know I've been painting more of a negative picture of John in some ways, but John is a really great guy. He's very sweet and has a good sense of humor, he just hasn't fully opened up to me yet, which can be frustrating at times since I've known him for so long. 

So anyways. There's my dilemma. If anyone wants to share any advice on how I should go about my relationships with them that would be much appreciated.

He apologized for ghosting me and that he said that someone from his past had reached out to him and that’s why he ghosted me. I understood so I kept talking to him and we exchanged numbers again. From that day on we talked on the phone a minimum of two hours almost every day. We had planned to meet up on a Friday night but he said he got busy at work and that he’d call me later. Well he didn’t. Then Saturday morning I called him and he sent me a text saying he was dealing with a work emergency and would call me later. He didn’t. He ended up ghosting me again for a week until I messaged him telling him that he was being dumb because we clearly like each other and there was a connection. We started talking again and he said that he felt overwhelmed and that he shuts down when he feels that way and doesn’t communicate with anyone about it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt because I knew he was dealing with stress from work and sometimes feelings can be overwhelming. Well we finally met Tuesday last week. He came over to my place after work and it was great. I felt such a connection to him, one I’ve never felt with anyone and I can’t really explain. We did end up having sex and it was probably the best sex I’ve ever had. It wasn’t awkward or weird and we kissed and smiled and made eye contact throughout. I again felt such a connection to him and I couldn’t believe how amazing it felt. I should say that I’m not one for casual sex, it’s awkward and I get nothing out of it. Anyways, we continued to talk and text throughout the week and I asked him if he wanted to hang out again during the weekend. He said sure probably Sunday because he wanted to do yard work on Saturday. Saturday I sent my usual good morning text and we exchanged a couple text then silence again, I was busy and figured he was too and maybe he’d call that night. He didn’t. Sunday I text him in the AM and he responds but then nothing. I call him, nothing. Then I call him a couple hours later and again he didn’t answer I leave him a voicemail asking what’s going on and wondering why he’s, again, shutting me out. If he didn’t want to hang out he can just say that. He sends me a text telling me he’s tired. So I leave him alone.

I have never dated anyone. Never had a first kiss, never done the stuff that comes after that either. 
I have had friends that are women just never a Significant other.

In my freshman year of college for the first and only time in my life a girl actually showed attraction towards me. She always wanted to sit next to me, and talk to me. She would also always smile at me  and laugh at pretty much everything. But I was too stupid back then to realize the signs and I kinda feel like I missed my only chance.

I want to meet a nerdy girl That I can share my passions with. I mean she does not need to be a nerd I mainly just want someone to love as I have been craving that for a long time. 

I am very good at having a conversation. It’s just really hard for me to get over my anxiety of introduction.

I kind of have a problem where I’m worried about approaching women because I don’t want to make them feel uncomfortable or make their day worse in any way. So instead of interacting I tend to just wish that I would interact. I’m not afraid of rejection I’m afraid of making her uncomfortable.

Am I just unattractive? I don’t have great self confidence when it comes to my looks. I am 6ft and 175 pounds. I lift and am quite strong but I still have a little bit of a belly (pictures of me at the end)

So I guess my main question is how can I start putting myself in situations where meeting a girl would be possible? I read online (I know kringe) that you should go to places like bookstores but what do I do? Just like sit around all day doing nothing and just look for girls? I feel like that is super creepy. 

If you want to address any of my other problems I have talked about I would also really appreciate it. 

Oh and if you have any questions please feel free to ask me. I’m a very open person.

We originally matched on tinder and after a while we started talking on Instagram instead. I wasn’t in the right headspace at the time and therefore didn’t respond very frequently and the convo eventually died out. He tried reaching out to me a couple times after that, but as I mentioned I wasn’t in a good place mentally. He reached out again in April and told me he thought I seemed like a great woman that he’d really like to get to know more. I was in the middle of exams in law school, so I told him I’d be down to meet up once everything had calmed down a bit. We ended up meeting up at his place for some wine and we had what seemed to be great chemistry. He was also very respectful and didn’t try to get in my pants. However he didn’t reach out in the following days, so I decided to send him a text asking when we are seeing each other again (I later found out he hadn’t reached out because he felt as if I left very abruptly, so he assumed I wasn’t too keen). He responded well and suggested a specific time and date, and told me he would love to take me on a boat ride to this really nice restaurant on an island. The date went really well and we hung out for almost 10 hours and it never felt awkward or forced. To make a very long story short, we’ve now been on at least 15 dates, but I just don’t feel like the relationship is progressing. He didn’t attempt to kiss me until the 8th or 9th date. When we finally did kiss he looked at me with a smile and said it was about time. Yet he hasn’t tried to do anything sexual with me. He even seems hesitant to touch me in non-sexual ways. Don’t get me wrong - I love a good gentleman and I’m happy to take things slow! If I wasn’t I would have taken the initiative myself. But the lack of progression combined with some recent “flaky behaviour” (being a bit hot and cold, contacting me nonstop when he’s drunk, being a little stingy with contact when sober etc.) makes me wonder if his interest in me is still there. The frequency in which we talk has also barely progressed. He pretty much always responds if I send him snaps, but I find that he isn’t reaching out much. He told me recently that he’d asked his best friend for advice before reaching out to me in April, and that that same friend had asked him to hang out a weekend we were seeing each other. When the friend found out we were seeing each other he had supposedly said jokingly that he wanted some of the credit for being the “matchmaker” so to speak. So his friends obviously know about me, yet I can’t shake the feeling that he has lost interest. I’m seeing him this week, and I’m kinda lost on wether to bring it up or not. My friends are convinced he’s just a little shy and perhaps need more time. I need all the perspectives and advice I can get.

I talked to him about it recently and we decided to leave it at that and agreed we had a wonderful time and wish each other all the best and really “broke-up” incredibly well.
I wish it could be like this more often. There are no hard feelings, it just feels right and we agreed to keep in touch.

During all of this he kept constant communication almost every day and I wasn’t worried about anything I thought things were going great. I was aware he was about to get really busy with work and he kept saying how much he wanted to see me but how busy he is (I know, excuses). I noticed he would go a few days without texting me (I would always just wait it out) and when he would, he would be really apologetic about it saying he “shuts people out when he gets busy” which I do understand. I started texting him first some days, but he was always so quick and positive in his responses. I took a kind of light approach to asking what was going on and he said he realized hes “too busy for a relationship” but “didn’t want to shut me out”. After this, he went from kind of shyly flirting with me at the gym to completely avoiding me like almost running away from me, he’s nowhere near my social media and when I texted him a few days after this conversation, he waited a day and a half to respond but was again positive. I just have no idea what’s going on and any insight would help I guess… is he just busy? Not into me? Or is something else going on? I’ve been told before I can be intimidating to guys and he seems pretty shy but I just can’t really tell what’s happening.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1032104,public,self,Help?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxf84z/help/,all_ads,6,,,

He doesn't seem to be that interested in responding to my texts or making an effort to call and talk to me. Under normal circumstances, I don't mind not texting all the time, I get it, people are busy. But the issue comes in when this is the only way we are able to communicate with each other. For context, we are in the same area when I am not in school and I am far away while at school. At the beginning of our relationship, we would text pretty regularly and he would insist on calling me every night, even when we were in the same area. Again, I do not expect him to call every night, but I would hope he felt the urgency to try to call at least a few times a week. I feel like I am initiating everything now. We used to watch movies online together as sort of a virtual ""date"" when we were LD last year, but now I'm struggling to get him to even set a date for us to watch a movie together. I am making sure to work around his schedule. I feel neglected in sort of an abrupt way. I have brought up our lack of texting and he just tells me ""You shouldn't expect me to text you all the time I don't want this relationship to feel like an obligation"" and yeah I totally understand that...But I really don't think asking for a movie night once a month is really a huge ask. I normally wouldn't be this worked up over a lack of texting and calling, but since it is the only way I can talk or ""hangout"" with him while I am far away, I expect more frequent online communication. In my eyes, that's something you kinda sign up for when getting into an LDR. For example today, I sent a good morning text and he never replied to it, and was active on social media throughout the day while not replying to my text. I guess I am making this post because I feel stuck. On the one hand, I totally get that he doesn't have the time to text me all day and I am not expecting him to at all. But on the other hand I feel like I am being neglected in my relationship, and I am not sure how to bring up the topic without getting the same response I did last time. What should I do?

First date (drinks) goes very well.  She's super into me and keeps pushing the date to go longer.  Towards the end she asks me what I'm up to on the weekend and tells me we should go bowling Saturday night.  I eventually agree.  We leave the bar she kisses me then grabs my hand and we walk to her car.  We makeout for a couple minutes at her car and say goodbye.

2nd date I pick her up and we go bowling.  Have a fun time and go back to my place for some wine (she loves wine).  We eat pizza, drink wine and listen to music.  We makeout in the kitchen and on the couch but each time she pulls away after about a minute and goes back to drinking/eating.  I maybe could've pushed to escalate more but she was acting a lot more reserved on this date.  At around midnight she asks if I can take her home as she has a dog at home and work in the morning.  I drive her home and we makeout one more time in the car.

Next day she texts me saying she had a great time.  We make a plan to get dinner the following Sunday night.  We text a few more times throughout the week.  Probably 50/50 each of us initiating.  

On Sunday (day of the date) I text asking what time she'll be ready.  We agree I'll pick her up at 7:30pm.  At 5:30 she texts me saying she's super tired from the last few busy days of work (she works weekends) and asks if we can reschedule.  I'm a little thrown-off but play it cool and say ""that's fine let me know when you're free and we'll figure something out"".  To my surprise she follows up asking my schedule for the week.  I tell her then she says ""well maybe Tuesday or Wednesday then?"".  I say ""Tuesday works for me.  I get off work around 5pm"".

And that is the last I heard from her.  It's now Tuesday night.  She never followed up.  The flake itself was a surprise but the fact she made the effort to reschedule then ghosted is what's really perplexing.  Is it worth reaching out at some point or do I just assume low interest?

I warn you, english isn’t my main language.
So goes the story. First, a bit of context. I met a girl through friends and when I first saw her, I thought she was incredibly gorgeous. She was at a party at the neighbor’s house and she came to make small talk with my friend whom she knows. I told my friend that I thought she was stunning and he told me that she had a boyfriend. 

Fast forward a month and a half ago, she started following me on Instagram. I was thrilled and curious why she added me since we only saw each other for like 30 seconds and that I didn’t say a word. On Instagram, I went to chat with her, but it was more in a friendly way since ai knew she had a boyfriend. We exchanged a few jokes and laughed a bit, but I ended up stopping answering. 

About a month later, I ended up having a match with her. I immediately dm her on Instagram. I knew she was fresh out of a relationship (less that a month) that lasted 4 years and I was reticent in meeting her, but I asked her out anyways. She told me that she wasn’t ready for this. Two days later, she asked me out. I told her no and asked her if she was really ready for that. I didn’t want to end up hurt or a rebound. Anyways, my friends convinced me to meet her and a couple of days later, we had a first date. 

I went on 2 dates with her. During the first date, I feel like we really connected (we joked a lot, laughed a lot and the conversation was flowing). Everything was fine until the second date in which I told her that I really felt like kissing her. After I told her, she started crying. I felt really awful, insecure and I was worried if I had done something wrong even though I knew that she was dealing with a breakup. We stayed with each other for two hours after she started crying and I was giving her emotional support and genuinely cared about her feeling better. She spoke a lot about her ex (as you may have guessed) and told me she wanted to get back with him but didn’t want to at the same time. 

At the end of the date, I said I was open to see her and that I don’t want to pressure her into anything. She said she wanted to see me again too and gave me a hug. 

The next day, we texted a bit and she told me she felt really awful. She said that she need some time alone and that she isn’t ready to date. I said that I understand and to take care of herself. I told her that my door remains open for when she is ready. Later that day, she messaged me some tik tok video. I answered her that I was confused since I thought she wanted to stop seeing me. I asked her if she likes me and she said she doesn’t know, that she is in a weird part of her life.

Yesterday, we texted a bit and I asked her if she was open to simply be friends since we really get along well. She said yes.

Here’s where I’m beginning to feel doubts. A part of me thinks that I may have been pushy with her and scared her off dating/a potential relationship with me in the future. Another part of me understands that she is in pain and that it’s not my fault, that it’s not because I’m not attractive/interesting enough. I can’t help but feel responsible.

I add her and she follows me back, I then message her explaining the strava thing and told her I thought she was pretty.

I'm now on a competitive team with a woman (27F I think) I'm interested in. We've had a few 1 on 1 conversations including one earlier today, and we get along but most of our interactions are in a team/group setting. I have no idea if she's in a relationship, but I would guess not.

Our season is winding down, we have one practice and one competition day left, those are both next week. So I need to make a move pretty soon if I'm going to make one.

To be clear, I wouldn't be asking her out right away through either medium, just trying to build up to that.

Pros of texting: 

* Moves things along faster, if I wait for in person I'm waiting probably a week or a week and a half
* Possibly build rapport better than quick conversations in a sports focused setting

Cons of texting:

* I genuinely don't think she would be distressed or anything if I texted, like I said, she knows me and our interactions have been good. Still, she didn't give me her number and that's a mental hurdle for me. Would this be weird?

Not though high school, college, and even now. Dating was never a priority in my life and it still really isn’t. 

But at 21 i feel like its a little weird to never be in a relationship. Dating and sex is such a common topic of conversation. I honestly feel a little left out. I wondered if it’s the idea of virginity? I had friends scoff or look at me in a demeaning way every time my nonexistent dating history comes up. Its not like I’m saving it for marriage but i would like it to be someone i trust and feel happy with. I personally just can’t stand it when they say “something must be wrong you.”

Another aspect is trauma. I have pretty severe CEN (Childhood Emotional Neglect). I haven’t realize how badly it effected every part of my being until I’ve done my part of the whole reflecting process during COVID. I don’t trust people easily, i have abandonment issues, I can’t rely on people, worst of all i feel broken and empty inside. It’s like whatever degree of emotions normal people feel, i sometimes can’t feel at all. 

I’ve always wonder what the feeling is like to get butterflies in your stomach. How its like to be completely obsessed with one other. How exciting it all must be. But sometimes i feel like it difficult for me to feel something as simple as attraction, (not aesthetic) but emotional or sexual attraction. Its a feeling i rarely experience. 

In terms of attraction, many people have told me to “give someone a chance” or “lower your standards”. But truthfully, i don’t know what my standards are. I don’t mind meeting new people but pushing myself physically outside of my comfort zone makes me feel scared and induces anxiety and panic attacks.

I don’t know if I should clarify this, but i hav toyed with the idea that maybe I’m a ace (or at least on the spectrum). It would make sense on the attraction level, but i always wonder if its just my CEN haunting me.

To summarise the backstory. Met this girl 4 months ago, hit it off, had a thing the last 4 months. I called it a fwb but she didn’t like that because she said FWB don’t have feelings for each other but we did. Anyways, we got really close and are each other’s best friend now. She said a few weeks back that’s she’d be afraid to make it anything serious incase it was a messy break up and we’d lose eachother forever. While drunk she tried to kiss my friend and  said she had a little crush on him. She told me this week she lost her feelings, but while she was drunk she was all over me and said she was just scared of it getting serious (she was drunk so didn’t take it to serious). Anyways yesterday I told her it’d be hard to move on from the thing we had, she called me and for 20 mins was saying how much she loved me and how much I meant to her and said “you don’t understand, you’re my priority…….as a mate”.

I've been terrified of it. But so excited. We haven't taken one day away since we started talking. He spoils me, but I have to admit, I've been acting kind of bratty towards him. And he doesn't deserve it at all. 

I got scared on Saturday, he kissed me and said he loved me. I went into full blown panic. I have genuinely only been in love with ONE person before. And while yes of course the feeling of being in love sounds so great, it's just not that easy. 

I can't be worried though, because I did this to my ex. I fell in love with him the day I met him. So I can understand the excitement behind it. But instead of acting like a normal human I decided to get smashed. He showed up to come get me, and I wasn't ready to leave (because I'm a brat) and he stayed with me, made sure I drank water, fed me, and let me keep doing what I was doing. I could tell he was pissed, as he should be. 

Finally he takes me home, puts me in bed, gets me water, and kisses me and APOLOGIZED for scaring me to the point I chose to freak out. 

Why the hell is he apologizing?! I'm the asshole here. 

I went and picked him up yesterday and decided it was time to open up about my love for my ex. I told him the good and the bad. Everything to help him understand why this is so damn hard for me. He didn't even judge me, he held me, and I cried a ton. And he told me it was okay that I still feel that way. He wants to keep talking through these things and building something better with me. 

I'm feeling pretty freaking selfish for acting out like that. I didn't do anything inappropriate and I did go somewhere safe where we have mutual friends who would have babysat me. We have this saying, we tell it to everyone, ""we came to together, we leave together, and if we don't come together, we will go home to the other person"". 

He was mad, he didn't yell, he didn't put me down, he didn't call me names, he didn't make me feel like garbage, and he didn't walk away. He so calmly explained how he felt, the next day, because that day there was no point.

I’m black, 6,3, but pretty fat and need to lose weight.

I live with my parents and I’m doing college online so I don’t go to campus. I barely leave the house

I’m not very social and no girl has ever liked me.I’m pretty much a black nerd.

I’ve never gotten interest from women.

The most I have ever gotten are some bjs from a girl who was a grade above me in school.

I’ve been made fun of for my looks a lot of times

Once in 5th grade a girl made a joke about my looks but gave a faux apology

In 7th grade on the bus, this girl called out to me and pointed to her friend next to her and asked if I wanted to date, and it was pretty embarrassing, her friend said something like ""you can’t keep your mouth shut""

In 8th grade my friend made a joke about a girl liking me and her friend overheard her and loudly proclaimed that the girl did not like me and swore to it.
