0,ofy42y,1625711905,First date,"Hello so I matched with this girl on tinder on July 4. That night I FaceTime to her and honestly I told her at first that I was only down to fuck while on tinder but after when we FaceTime‘s we talked about a lot of other things and I changed my attitude towards her. I really wanted to get to know her and maybe even pursuit her. So after that night she texted me throughout the day and started every conversation. She kept making funny sexual jokes but were lighthearted and eventually she told me directly that she didn’t feel comfortable with just having sex right away and that she wanted to get to know me which is exactly where I was as well. So we went on a date the next day after FaceTiming that second night. I took her into the city and we walked around four hours. 
She grew really warm to me. She started walking into me as we were walking down the street, when we sat on benches she got really really close to my face. She shared extremely funny details about herself , but overall she kept laughing at everything I was saying. We went out to dinner and I was super exhausted so I wasn’t fully there but she grew even more interested it seemed. She started asking me personal questions about my family and other things and we really enjoyed the dinner. When I dropped her off at her car we started making out for 10 minutes. She was so into it she even put her knees on the passenger seat just to get a better angle but she absolutely does not strike me as a girl that just wants to have fun because she doesn’t have a whole bunch of friends and she just broke up with her boyfriend like three weeks ago. Anyways from the time I met her and saw today today her Snapchat score has literally only gone up like 20 points. However today her Snapchat score is going up almost 300 points. I know that sounds funny but we met on tinder and my concern is that she is just keeping me around while snap chatting other guys. She texted me today little stuff but never anything about going back on another date. I want to date this girl but I’m afraid that two things may be happening. First is that she sees me more of a friend and secondly if she is snap chatting other guys I guess I didn’t read her well enough because I thought you really really was into me. So if there’s any girl out there that can tell me if it’s normal for girls after a first date to keep snap chatting guys just to maybe expand your options or should I be concerned. I’ve had very bad trouble with past relationships and I really don’t wanna waste my time",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofy42y/first_date/
1,ofy6l8,1625712156,I don't know what to think,"I've (26f) been talking (literally talking, not that ""talking stage"" people talk about) to a man (27m) for almost a year now. We talk on a daily basis, all day long, and if I don't reach out first, he will. He knows I like him (because I told him) but I didn't have the courage to ask if he liked me back, let alone ask him on a date. He's occasionally flirty and I definitely try to be flirty back but I have next to no experience with all that so I'm not too good at it. We like a lot of the same things, and he's really patient with explaining things he likes that I don't understand. He's very engaging and interested in our conversations and he definitely is paying attention, especially to my likes and dislikes. He lets me know what's going on in his life, with his family, his job, in his head. Never once has the conversation turned sexual, not even when we exchanged selfies. I have no idea where I stand with him. I can't tell if he's interested too and just shy, not interested and too nice to just stop talking to me, or if I have become ""one of the guys.""

I'm in my 30s and really it was my first major relationship and I made her feel like I wasn't that into her in the beginning. Granted I wasn't ready to agree with her statements of moving in together after 2 months and I told her I move slow emotionally.  

What scares  me is she felt like the one and the one I was supposed to meet after a couple failed relationships and I was supposed to end up with her. But reality took a wrong turn I wasn't experienced enough and and she left me for someone else.  Now I feel like all my relationships will be second best or just compete shit at this point due to it not being her and because I'm in my 30s and everyone is basically taken.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofyb6n/inexperienced_in_relationships_cost_me_the_one/
3,ofyb6u,1625712626,I have feelings for someone I work with and I don’t know what to do,"
So I started a new job recently and I have a massive crush on the person who trained me. I think the feelings are reciprocated but I’m honestly unsure. We’re both in store management positions so the situation is hard to read because we are both hard working professionals. We are both in the same position and we don’t work at the same location. (Both store managers for different locations) there was heavy chemistry from the start and it seems to only have increased.  I nonchalantly mentioned my ex boyfriend (who I was previously still involved with during training) and my trainers demeanor changed when I brought him up. He seemed uncomfortable and became quiet. During training he was extremely professional. Once we went off site on business he became more personable, asked me about my interests. We developed a really good rapport and have been playful with one another, lots of joking and giggling. I never giggle, just to put things into perspective. He helped me set up my store for grand opening and definitely went above and beyond his job description in the process. Might just be a really nice person that’s looking to move up in the company, which we sort of touched on when I asked what he earned in return for assisting my new store at this length. He didn’t seem to have any ulterior motive, just said he was doing it out of kindness and wasn’t gaining anything in return. I honestly thought they would be rewarding him in some way. After my opening we’ve still kept in contact professionally. I call him for support typically once or twice a week. He’s always been so patient and willing to take time out of his busy day to help me, whereas other SMs I’ve reached out to for support are short or in a hurry (understandably so, we work for a very busy retail chain-no one has time to breathe, let alone go out of their way to assist other stores) During his day off he actually came to my store, which was quite a commute, to pick up his supplies that he left behind. He ended up spending three + hours at my store just helping me with questions but mainly just chatting, while being off the clock. Are people really just this nice?! Maybe I’m misreading genuinely kind intentions, but I doubt it. My intuition is always spot on. I don’t want to make an absolute fool of myself and considering this job is really important to me, I need advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofyb6u/i_have_feelings_for_someone_i_work_with_and_i/

He says something that makes it obvious he is still seeing other people. Fair enough. We have never had that conversation. So I decide it is about time we do. I am starting to get feelings for this guy and don't want to get mgsf hurt.

He tells me he isn't looking for a relationship as he has his ans all set and is enjoying the freedom of doing what he wants. We have a long conversation about it and how those things don't always have to be separate. But anyway, he just says he isn't looking for a relationship.

But is happpy to keep hanging out and doing things as we are..... And so that he would ""think about"" going exclusive with me, but I am not convinced... 

 I am starting t oget feelings for this guy, but I know that he may never want more than what we currently have. Did I ask about being exclusive too soon? He has only ever had 2 serious (ish) relationships that has lasted around a year and he is 27.

I just don't know how comfortable I am with him seeing and sleeping with other girls, but I don't know if I am risking loosing the possibility of more if I cut him loose.

Any advice please!

I shot my shot, and completely air balled. Actually, I don’t know what happened. You tell me.

We get into work, normal day, but I didn’t see her for the first hour, so I’m thinking she bailed on her last day, I did that once so I wouldn’t even blame her. Turns out she just had to work in a different area at the beginning of our shift.

So we don’t get to talk until later, it was pretty busy, but I’m like once I get my chance I’m pulling up for the shot. So after an hour of a rush of work it’s finally just us 2 and I go for it.  My exact words, “wassup, how you feeling today.” She says with a smile “I’m good, how bout you.” I said “same, this your last day right?” She says “yeeeeaaa.” Held that yea for a second too. So I say, “well if I don’t get a chance to talk to you before you leave, just know I’m wishing you the best of luck on whatever you do after this, and I’m kinda upset we didn’t get a chance to really get to know each other, but I’m rooting for you nonetheless.” She didn’t respond to any of that, like completely went in one ear and out the other. I was completely shook.

But get this, if you read the first post, I speak about this little eye tag game we played, she tried to continue it. Like huh? I was so upset I couldn’t even look at her, it felt like I was left on read, or ghosted after texting for a week or 2. Now she doesn’t owe me anything or whatever, I was just really sick because I was expecting a response of some kind, not a no response at all. 

So later that day it was so awkward, I was helping out in her area and it seemed she didn’t know what to do with herself when I was there. She was pacing back and forth, excessively looking at her phone, kept turning her back to me, but every time I walked away I could see her out the corner of my eye looking at me. 

I don’t know, I don’t think I could’ve did anything different. Maybe I read our situation wrong, and she wasn’t interested at all. Or maybe she got something complicated going on who knows, certainly not me. I’m kind of bummed though because I was truly interested in this girl, but hey. I do wish her the best though.

16,ofzcjk,1625716391,I recently broke up with my ex and she been harassing me ever since,"Hey, how you doing, I know this is not a current relationship but I need opinions but first I’m gonna put a little bit of context before I start

So I (26m) broke up with my ex (22f) about 2 months ago, we had been in a 2 year relationship.

There was no cheating from neither of us, the reason we broke was because she was distant from me, she didn’t told me many things, she lied to me, we didn’t lived together because she never wanted to move in with me because she said she would only move if we got married, which at first didn’t bothered me but eventually it did, and I wasn’t happy in that relationship.

When we broke up I told her my reasons and she wasn’t happy about it, but she didn’t went insane in that moment, she told me that maybe it was a good idea that we took some time for ourselves, which seemed like a nice idea, I didn’t considered the idea of ghosting her because I don’t hate her or anything like that.

After about 2 days since we broke up she started messaging and calling me, telling me she misses me and wish we would be back together, I told her that we both agreed not to talk to each other for some time but she kept talking so I just silenced her notifications but I still reply to some of her texts so she doesn’t fill lonely or something, about 2 or 3 days later she went to “pick me up” after work but she didn’t “picked me up” in her car, she asked if she could come to my place to hang out, I said no and just offered to take her to her house, and she’s being going to my workplace for the past 2 months!, I always take her home, but at this point I’m really getting annoyed and I’m also considering ghosting her so she leaves me alone.

I already told her that I don’t feel love for her anymore and she really should forget about me, but she doesn’t give a crap

Was I a jerk for telling her that I don’t love her anymore, should I ghost her?

i've been trying to date for the past few years but nothing has ever worked out. i've asked my friends to set me up (they don't really know anyone or if they do, by the time they think of them, that person is already in a relationship), tried just existing and having a social life (pre-pandemic) and tried online dating. nothing has ever worked and i don't know what's wrong with me. i am doing great in my career, i think i look cute and i have tons of friends who all think i am great. even my very close friends who i would trust to tell me the harsh truth have told me they don't know what's wrong. 

last month i met this guy on an app and we clicked which has never happened. we've been talking basically everyday since then and for the first time ever i felt like it would be possible for me to meet someone. i was so excited. even finally getting to experience what it feels like for someone to be interested in you... that's honestly what i was the most excited about because it's never happened and i'm 26 and that's so abnormal. but due to unforseen circumstances i had to go away for most of the month so we couldn't meet in person. and by the time i get back he will have moved to a new continent. 

what if this was my one chance :( i know i've never met this person but it was so exciting to feel like something was possible for once. and it's not possible. i feel like this is a cruel joke. like why even let me have that hope if i'm just going to be alone forever :(((((( help me please idk how but i just feel so hopeless. everyone is going through all these exciting life changes - moving in with their partners, adopting dogs together, getting engaged and married, going on trips... and i'm just here on the sidelines watching it happen and my life is the same as it's always been. literally my life has not changed since i moved away for university when i was 18. i want to die. i want to experience the same excitement and joy that my friends are experiencing. :( i just don't know how it will ever happen for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofzn91/26f_feeling_really_discouraged/
20,ofzt8h,1625718176,I don't Believe in Love. (Advice Welcome),"I (23m) don't believe in love, even though I really want to. I've seen everyone around me have relationships that I would consider good and successful that last at least a year before ending up not working out, including my drughead uncle who managed to pull three different significant people into his life for successful relationships despite not working job, and with his last relationship while having a car smashed up in my garage for over a year and a month that just recently got pulled out of there still pretty ruined because we were tired of having it there. But I've still yet to have a successful relationship personally. The issue is probably with me... I'm an Aries and tend to be very up front and honest with things, because thats how I like things to be. I have Asperger's so I tend to find some things a lot more interesting than others and tend to gravate to those things, and because of that like to live my life outside the norm. I consider myself a Gray asexual, because I value personality and doing things together over sex or physical attraction, and I have a very specific view of what I want in a girl and also my future to be like, that most girls seem to not want to fit into... I'm also part of a spiritualist church and have had multiple mediums telling me ""its just around the corner,"" and even signs from the universe telling me to keep holding on. I don't swipe too much on dating apps, but have them in case someone swipes on me, because I can usually tell even the blurred pictures who swiped on me, but even then I never get a message back. I perfer going to events in public whenever I can because I used to enjoy the spotlight of my career choice before 2020 took that from me, but I've never got a girl to talk to me at the events, and there have been two different times where I've talked to a girl before, then other people got involved making the girls think the wrongs thing about me, and I'd end up in trouble (once in high school where someone else came up to the girl and said that I was sending her messages asking for nudes so they decided to try to go to the councillors about it to get me in trouble for it until I told the councillors to look for the evidence of me asking either of them for nudes and of course they didn't have the evidence because I didn't even have their numbers, and then again in my career where I asked a girl out, got rejected, was okay with it but one of her former ""friends"" saw, tried messing with me first and when I told them off about it decided to make fake accounts and lead her to believe they were me harassing her, thankfully she must have smartened up later because when they had a ""Speak Out"" movement in my profession, she never did a post about me like she would have if she still believed that it was me, but she did do a post about someone else who was around her all the time at that time and also said ""he caused heat between me and my coworkers""). Those incidents compounding my social awkwardness make me prefer girls to come up to me first. The closest I have ever been to a potientally good relationship was at an event where a family told me that a girl liked me but she kept denying it. I believed her and aired on the safe side, until the event was over and I was working cleaning it up. She gave me a look telling me that she liked me as the family walked out the door, but I was too busy to catch up to her, so I hoped that she would come back and she never did. 2020 happened and one of my bosses responses to the Speak Out movement that was happening made me quit the profession all together since it seemed to support people who abused women. I want to keep holding out for love one day, but it seriously feels like doing so only seems to make me look more foolish.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofzt8h/i_dont_believe_in_love_advice_welcome/

I see so much stuff on this sub about people hesitating because the spark is gone, or they are overanalyzing their SO/date's actions, or their insecurities are messing up their relationships.   


I have a no-bullshit policy, and I suggest you adopt it. Also, please get to know yourself, and learn, as hard as it is  (and trust me, it's really fucking hard) to put yourself first. No more putting others on a pedestal, no more questionning yourself, no more holding yourself down.   


If you feel like a guy is using you, tell him up front; if the problem's not solved, dump his ass and move on. The spark's not there or you feel your SO is boring, or you're sexually repressed? DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Tell'em, dump'em. Lack of sexual compatibility is an OK reason to end a relationship.  


Sorry for venting, but I felt like expressing this: learn who you are and what you want, accept nothing less and stand for yourself. Put your own priorities first. \[Sidenote: I've had really big anger problems and now I've learned to channel my own anger into self-preservation, like the stuff mentionned above.

Healing oneself when you were a child of trauma and are steadily working towards self betterment and recognizing your own patterns and faults with attachment styles is an ongoing journey. I don’t expect someone else to do the work for me, I just would like someone to appreciate that I’m doing the work in the first place, and make space for that.

36,og0yy1,1625722971,"Male here. On a date, when I suggest going back to your place even slightly too early, does it completely kill attraction?","I’ve had two dates in the recent past that both were going really well. The woman I was with was really enjoying her time with me, it was a ton of fun, and it seemed like sex was probably going to happen at the end of the night. I also caught a bit of feelings with the girl in scenario 1.

Here were the two scenarios where I think I blew it:

Scenario 1: Was on a hike with the girl. She invited me back to her place about halfway through. We make our way back, got a little lost. The car was across a big lake, and I made a joke without really thinking it through where I said “too bad we can’t take a boat to get across” and she replied “well if we’re that desperate to get back we probably could ask someone.” 

Although the tone was in a joking manner I feel like a bit of desperation/neediness slipped out and made things weird. When we got back to the car she said she needs to see her friend who’s going through something, so we just hugged and I went home. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Scenario 2: Different girl, I asked her halfway through the date if she wanted to get wine and go back to her place and she said that sounded boring, and wanted to stay out and keep bar hopping. Later on I brought her home, and we made plans to hang out next week. Nothing happened, we didn’t hang out a second time and when I asked her how she felt she said she didn't think it would work out.

Did I do something wrong in these scenarios? Both dates were going really well and there was good chemistry, so I kinda find it hard to believe I completely destroyed it in those two small instances but maybe I did. ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/og0yy1/male_here_on_a_date_when_i_suggest_going_back_to/

Then he started texting me less and only when he wanted to see me. I finally got fed up and ended things. We ended things on good terms. I told him I couldn’t do it anymore since I felt like we both wanted different things. 

After 7 months he texted me and we started talking again. We made plans to hang out and he seemed super excited about it. He was texting me every day saying how he couldn’t wait to see me. Although his plans had very little effort. Basically go over to his place and hang out there. So obviously still the same fuck boy but I agreed anyway.  I haven’t had sex in forever so I figured why not. 

The morning that we are supposed to hang out is total silence from him. We had planned for me to go over at 5. I decided to text him at 3 to see if we were still on. He responded at 430 and was telling me how hungover he was and had just woken up from a nap. But had woken up early that morning to watch a basketball game. 

I started to sense he was trying to cancel on me. So I asked if we were still going to see each other. He responded with “I feel that you would be upset/disappointed. I feel like I’m on a wheelchair.” 

It made me mad and I didn’t respond. He texted me later that night at 9 with “😢”. Again I left him on read. 

Did I overreact? I just feel like he could of told me that when he woke up for his game and if he could wake up for that than he must not be that hungover.

He is an engineer (like me) and wants a serious relationship. We had some nice chats and he seems very funny. He also is a Christian like myself.

So when he finally asked me to go on a date this weekend, I was excited. I told my mother and sister. Immediately, my (middle eastern and white) mother asked what his race is. I said he’s half black and half white. She got furious and told me she’d never agree with me dating a half black person and that I need someone middle eastern. Then, my sister looked up his linked and said “in his job descriptions he wrote w/ instead of spelling out ‘with’; i’d never hire him let alone date him. and he looks like a plumber.”

The kicker is that she didn't want to date me because she felt she wasn't ready for a relationship after having a bad experience with another man about a year ago. But now after she has seemingly noticed I've started to lose interest she has started mentioning other dudes constantly. By dudes I don't mean crushes or people she knows, stuff like ""I saw a hot dude at the supermarket"", ""there was a cute guy in the car next to me"". Shit like that.

Nothing about this makes sense. My suspicion is that she is either trying to make me jealous or shes trying to make herself more appealing to me. Why I cannot say. It comes down to trying to reel me back because she regrets rejecting me or she's just playing games as a keep the boys after me just out of reach ego sort of thing.

Any of you able to decipher the situation and if so what to do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/og3sru/girl_who_rejected_me_today_all_of_a_sudden_starts/
65,og418x,1625737925,Proud of myself for taking rejection like a boss but it still hurts a bit," So this girl I met on Tinder... I was very attracted to her. After one date, I felt like the date went really well and I really wanted to see her again. The conversations felt very natural and she laughed at my stupid jokes and shit. She said she had never felt so at ease with a guy so quickly.

We spoke a lot through text afterwards too and I thought we were doing well. She told me a lot about her ex family-in-law who are being massive dicks to her even to this day and how her kids feel the effects of it.

Anyways, I asked for a second date and now she says she didn't really feel the ""click"" and the ""instant chemistry"" and that if we see each other again, it's not with the prospect to be in a relationship. She said that she found me a super cool guy and it's rare for her to find a guy she gets along with so well, that accepts that she has kids and with whom she can talk so relaxed to and literally told me ""it almost feels like I'm letting a chance pass with you because I went on another date and that was no relationship material either. He just didn't have your intellect and wit"" (her words)

She even invited me to her place to watch a movie alone with her at night while the kids are gone, but then she ended up cancelling this the next day because of said ""lack of chemistry"". 

She said that apart from a relationship, she would be happy to have an extra friend though.

I respectfully declined. I've been in the ""lets just be friends"" territory once in the past. No more. I swore I would never allow myself to go through that painful bullshit again.

This is what I answered by text (translated)

""I appreciate your directness and I'll be honest with you too. I'm not looking for just friendship and I won't pretend I'm fine with being just friends. If we're destined to be just friends, I prefer to decline because being friends with someone I'm attracted to is self-inflicted emotional torture I have no desire for. I think it's better we just break contact. I wish you a happy life""

I want to make it *absolutely* clear I didn't reject her friendship out of anger or hate. It's purely self-preservation. I don't wish to put myself through that self-inflicted pain so I pull the plug. And that's that. Furthermore I have enough friends already and have no need for new ones.

She replied she understands and that if she only encounters the wrong type of guys from now on, she'd keep my number for in case she seeks an honest, honourable man.

That last part kinda offends me. So basically, I'm her last option and I'm only good because others are scumbags? What am I a fucking Nice Guy? Is she honestly saying I'm just a backup guy she hangs on the coat rack so she can take me back when she needs me? Either way, not gonna stick around for this crap.

But the bottom line is: if you find yourself in the typical ""let's just be friends"" situation, think very carefully whether you're cool with that or if you're actually deluding yourself that she might change her mind. It's OK to reject being just friends. She doesn't owe you a relationship, you don't owe her friendship. She's not entitled to your friendship.

66,og43rb,1625738291,Is anyone else astounded at how breathtakingly immature most people are even into their 20s?,"Perhaps most people are simply stupid - it certainly explains a lot - but I've always felt about 10 years older than I actually was at any given time. With hindsight and more experience of people and life, I realise I was thinking and behaving more like a typical 30-year-old at 17 and 18 than any one of my peers. I am astounded at how plainly immature most people are, especially when it comes to dating; by how people think others are just accessories to their lives and activities rather then people with full lives of their own; by how they think they can just drop something or someone if they decide they're bored of it like a child would a toy; how they think they can breeze through life without their actions having consequences; by how little they understand psychology and emotion and human nature. 

I left home to go it alone in life at 20 and encountered a lot of hardship, as well as dealing with the social, psychological, emotional, cultural, and legal repercussions of growing up and being gay.

67,og45xr,1625738567,What Happened to Dating? Was it Always this Way?,"What happened? I mean that. I don't know that there was ever a time where it was truly different, but it seems like more recently there's come a certain set of trends.

I'm more or less new to the dating scene, 22, male, but I've been doing some lurking and... man, there are some patterns I just don't get.

1. Why sex? What is the focus on sex? I understand it's biology, but what happened to personal appeal? Sharing interests? Helping eachother? Being two halves to complete the image?  
Sex seems like more of a romantic thing, something nice between close couples to be understood and enjoyed, but not to be the crux of anything. What happened? Why is that so paramount?
2. On the one hand you have crazed desperate men, and on the other you have desperate and often burned women. There are plenty all around who seem to just want someone to be with, and yet it never seems to happen.  
I just find this almost baffling. I know that people struggle, but... it's almost like the two groups that need each other never get along. I'm not going to ask why; I get it, but it is very discouraging to see.
3. While we're there, why pics? Why does everyone ask for pics? Aside from hygiene, does the appearance mean so much?  
If someone's healthy, nice, and you click, does it matter.  
Why is physical attraction the pinnacle of starting relationships? I mean it seems like that shouldn't mean all that much, not really, at least not beyond a fleeting interest. It's like looking at a painting and finding that you like it, but we're not paintings! People are more complicated than that, beautifully so. Yet, if that attraction is not there, then the discussion is often closed. Why?  
I've actually done a couple experiments before regarding whether the majority will say they'll be fine with someone who has no solid appearance at all, like a deformed burn victim or some poor soul who utterly lost the genetic lottery, and most of the time those answers are quite kind.  
...  
I'm not sure that follows to practice, but I'm not sure.
4. It looks to me like there's a very distinct back and forth where a whole bunch of people both hate and long for dating at the same time. It's like a war.  
""It's horrible!""  
""It's not!""  
""Everyone's terrible!""  
""They're not!""  
Can't we just agree the answer's probably somewhere in the middle and get on with it?
5. Why is it so shamed *not* to be a part of the dating scene? It's like if you aren't there at all, you're some kind of subhuman cretin. Why?  
People have anxiety. Maybe they're working up the gumption? Or they're not interested...? Or they're struggling? Why is failure or exclusion or disinterest ridiculed? Shouldn't they be encouraged? Most of these people aren't doing well.  
I'm not talking about fiends with a keyboard and liquid vitriol, just sad or disinterested folk who happened to say something.

If you're still going, thank you! I'm glad at the least to be heard. Yes, I'm rambling, yes, I'm venting. I hope though that at least some of this sparks some kind of discussion, even if a small one, and, you know, I'm glad to say it.

The point is that I don't get it. Was this ever about the personality, or has it always been this way? Am I naïve? Is that it? I don't know.

91,og79fy,1625751095,I've seen alot of posts about people who feel either down on themselves from being used or abused. And I felt there is something important these people need to know.,"I'm sure we've all seen these posts. The ""How could I have not seen this coming?"" ""How Could I have let this person do this to me?"" All of these posts have one thing in common. It's people who think that there is some magic bullet that if they had known sooner, would have stopped them from being vulnerable to abuse and manipulation. And this is the part that might sound depressing, But there is no magic bullet. EVERYBODY is vulnerable to manipulation. While some people (Specifically people who were raised in good homes and have very little trauma to cope with) may be more resistant to falling into an abusive relationship. It is IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to be immune from it. 

I will provide a link in the comments(Dating doesnt let me put links in the post for some reason) to a website that lists alot of the different forms of manipulation, and their names. This is really important because while you may instinctual know that something being done to you is wrong. But without a name added to it as validation, most people will doubt themselves wither or not they \*should\* have felt like they were being manipulated. When there is a actual name added to it, you can gain the confidence to know that the reason it feels wrong is because it IS wrong! I know it helped me tons when dealing with manipulative people. 

HOWEVER........ more bad news

Even with knowing all the offical names of manipulations you will still not be immune from it. And this is because of a certain quark of people who are predators. These people have more or less spent their entire LIFE literally obsessing over how to manipulate people. Which means by the time you are in your late 20's, you are facing off against someone who has been practicing how to manipulate you for nearly 2 decades. Ask yourself if you would feel bad if you were to get into a competition with someone with 2 decades more experience than you and then you lost? Maybe a tinge of sadness yeah, but then you tell yourself it just makes sense. However when most people are manipulated by someone who has been practicing the art for decades they will often degrade themselves, tell themselves they should have been \*better\* or \*smarter\*. They don't often realize that them being victimized was not a reflection of their own competence, but a reflection of just how good some people are at manipulation. (i will provide a link in the comments to a video of the interrogation of a serial killer, the video shows how easily the sociopath controls the conversation. And while it might seem obvious to you when watching the video, to the people who were there, they didn't realize it was happening until they later reviewed the tapes and realized just how much the sociopath controlled the situation and these are people who are literally TRAINED to spot it.)

This might come across as a weird mental health post in a dating subreddit, but my heart aches whenever I see someone degrade themselves as if them being victimized was their fault. Cause while yes, there are things you can do to help you spot it and pick up on it to protect yourself. No one will ever be immune. And if you then proceed through your life being paranoid about figuring out how to spot these people before they can do damage, you will only make yourself more vulnerable to it.

I suppose my real point is to stay safe, do research on how to spot toxic people and be proactive about your own mental health. But realize that if in the future you are taken advantage of, its not because there was magic tactic you should have known, its because we live in a world that only cares about who survives, not what they did to survive. You being cheated on wasent because you are lesser, it because the cheater was a predator who knew how to target you. You being abused wasent because you deserved it, it was because the abuser was a predator who knew how to make you feel like you deserved it. And honestly the best tool you can have to combat them is self love. Because the more you respect yourself, set solid boundaries and take care of yourself, the more resistant you will become to manipulation. But it will never be foolproof, and there will always be someone who knows exactly how to get to you. It's kinda like the idea of being struck by lightening. Yes it can happen, yes there are things you can do to mitigate the damage, but no amount of obsession over preventing it can truly protect you if a freak accident occurs. So it's best to give up on the idea that you have total control over it. And instead just concentrate oh the things you can control. 

Stay safe out there my friends. I hope you all find loving relationships that show you that holding onto the good in humanity was the best choice to make. It's really the only choice to make if you want to actually live a life that brings your contentment, happiness, and peace.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/og79fy/ive_seen_alot_of_posts_about_people_who_feel/

She and I was talking and going out a lot in the fall, but we were never a couple. Problem is, I had fallen pretty hard for her, and she’s basically got everything I’m looking for in a woman. Like literally, every personality quality and trait that I think would be important to have in a long-term relationship. We like way too much of the same things and have way too many interests in common, more than I’ve ever had with any other girl ever. And physically, she’s exactly my type. 

She expressed at the time that she was no longer interested, but then every time I was around her, she would act like she was into me, but when I would try to start things up again, she would tell me no. I loaned her some tools to fix her bedframe not too long after we stopped talking and hanging out/going on dates, and she seemed to want something from me, but I didn’t take things any further than that. In hindsight, I probably should have, her interest (at the time at least) seems pretty clear now. 

 I can’t stop thinking about her, and every time I see her I think she want a second chance with me, she always looking at me, or walking close to me/right past me, (she knows how fine I think she is) and one time I heard her switch up a conversation with her friends to a subject that she knows I like when she observed that I was close by. 

I been trying to see other girls, try to move on, but the thought that she might still want me kinda ruins all my other dates. I can’t really get past a second date with these other girls. On days when I don’t see her, sometimes I feel like I’m moved on, but then the next time I see her, and I make eye contact with those beautiful baby blues, I’m back to square one. 

But the thing is, I respect her word that she wants me to “back off” from pursuing her. If she told me she doesn’t want that then I won’t. But then there are days when she does these things that seem so deliberate, almost like she’s baiting me into trying again. Maybe it’s just a confusing hard-to-get game and I’m just a little too oblivious to know when and where to apply a little pressure? 

I want her to make a definitive decision to choose me. I kind of put the ball in her court, so to speak, last time we talked about this, so I feel like she should probably be the one to make a move on me. I figure, she’s a big girl, we’re all adults, if she really wants me she’ll tell me.

And look, I’m not an unattractive or uninteresting guy. I think I’m pretty good looking, and not too bad with my shirt off either, to brag a little. Pretty good amateur MMA fighter, I have dreams, ambitions, a job that pays OK. I make friends easily and I feel confident tht I can make interesting conversation with basically anybody. I’m certainly not a professional comedian, but I also don’t feel like I’m unfunny, like a good middle ground. I feel, at least, like I’m a catch. (Am I THE PERFECT GUY, no, I’ve got a lot to improve on, but I feel like I bring a lot to the table as a romantic partner)

Is there anything here, or am I projecting my feelings for her onto her motives and actions? What should I do? Is there anything I can do? Should I just try to forget about her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/og7l8m/the_ball_is_in_her_court_but_should_i_make_a_move/

95,og7wqd,1625753203,Should I not have?,"I (23) met a guy (27) on bumble and the conversation flowed. I sent him a snap of me, he opened and replayed it an hour ago. I just realised a few mins ago and I thought it’s best to be direct because I honestly saw potential. I’m not bad looking and the conversation was great…

I legit said:

“I’m confused

You have removed me and replayed my snap, not interested?” 

Should I not have?! It’s been 5mins since I sent it by now. I’m so confused, if I wasn’t interested anymore I’d unfriend or block. I’m tempted to just block him and forget this even happened.

96,og7zwm,1625753483,Can sex too soon hurt a relationship,"I recently had a guy leave me because we weren’t having sex yet. He didn’t say that but I’m sure that’s what it was since he is now in a relationship. The reasons I wasn’t ready to go further was because I was scared of getting too close to him too soon. We knew each other for about 3 months, 2 in person. Is this fear reasonable when in a early relationship? I don’t want sex to cloud things or move too fast. 
I grew up very religious which has affected my outlook on sex and am in therapy. I wish I could have communicated what I was feeling better because I really liked him but it’s too late. I’m also not really use to the whole test drive the car view of sex. 
Any tips and advice would be helpful on this and how to figure out when the right time for me to have sex is!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/og7zwm/can_sex_too_soon_hurt_a_relationship/
97,og82qc,1625753731,Her ex might fight me?,"I've (22M) been dating this girl from work (28F). It's been going well. Anyways, today she told me that if her ex boyfriend (babydad) found out about me he would try to fight me. If he knew who I was and saw me alone he would start something. To me this was funny and annoying hearing her say this. The way I see it is I'm in the position where I don't have to deal with that crap. I can find someone else. I told her to tell him who I was and get it over with. But I know the consequences that come with situations like this. What should I do? I like her and I don't want to stop talking to her for something stupid like this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/og82qc/her_ex_might_fight_me/

99,og89q9,1625754317,I will see my crush for the first time in 3 weeks on Sunday. I used that time to get over her and my plan to avoid her is this a good way of doing it?,So was the last time I saw my crush was 3 weeks. We talked for a little bit not a ton while I surpressed my feelings for her. Our last conversation didn't last more than two minutes. So a couple of days after our last interaction I spent the last 3 weeks getting over her and practicing how not to talk to her. Because i honestly don't think she into the way I am into her. I highly think she's just been really friendly with me and doesn't want anything to do with me outside a friendly conversation here and there. So when I see her Sunday I plan on not talking with her and I plan on not starting conversations with her like I always do. I plan on ignoring her and not looking her direction. She did nothing wrong to me I just feel like this is the best way to make sure I am over her and not going out my way to start conversation and avoid talking to her will continue to make my feelings and want for her to stay away. Is this the best way to go about someone that you have gotten over?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/og89q9/i_will_see_my_crush_for_the_first_time_in_3_weeks/
