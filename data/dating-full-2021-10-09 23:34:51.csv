But, problem is, I haven't met anyone gay/bi/etc., and, honestly, I don't know how!  


Obviously I'm too young to go to gay bars, and in my region, there is slim to no LGBT+ events or groups that I can join.

  
So, maybe in my school there are gay people. But how do I even know? And, well, I'm too shy to just come up to someone who I'm not even sure is gay!

It all started when we had a small talk at the beginning of the school year, so I can invite her in the class group I created on whatsapp, since this time I swear to god I felt like she was staring at me like crazy in the bus, and it happened multiple times. An intense staring not the ""Look away"" kind of staring from what I've seen. In fact, I was the first to look away, that's what made me initially think that after all I must imagine things and muh she just happened to look in my direction.

Then we happened to talk there and there. It was happening most of the time because she would kind of subtly eavesdrops in the conversation I had with my friends reacting to something I was saying, and it was usually moving to more casual talking especially with her. I wouldn't say at that point we were ""friends"" or something. But not strangers to each others for sure.

A few days after that I was with my buddies sitting at a table at the university and we were talking, and I see her coming with her friend and she clearly put herself in a ""talk to me"" position but without initiating, I was the one to automatically initiate a casual conversation with her, including her friend in the conversation obviously.

Then yesterday she made that thing that made me wonder what's her interest in me : (Like I said I don't consider we are currently actual ""friends"", we've talked from time to time so we're definitely not strangers to each other but we're definitely not comfortable as friends, at least that's not how I feel about it on my own. ) I enter in the big amphitheater of the school for a math course, I see her at the at the back of the amphitheater, she was all alone. I put myself in the middle of the amphitheater, definitely far enough from her so. I sit down, I take out my things, 1 minute later I turn my head back : And there she is RIGHT BEHIND ME she moved from the back of the amphitheater to the row right behind me without ANY explainable reason. I smile at her, she smiles at me so I move forward a few chairs while staying on my row so we can talk a little (She's behind me so), casual talk as usual honestly. After the course I talked with her a bit waiting for the bus and she touched my shoulder while saying something.

The problem is that when we talk she's not there to tell me she's crazy about me or anything like that, it's casual talk. I have no doubt that when she moved right behind me out of nowhere is a gigantic room it was to have more chance to initiate a potential conversation. But for what purpose then? Is it romantic? Am I kidding myself and it's purely friendly ?

Because of this, I don't have a lot of time to date. But I figured it wasn't a big deal, because I'm only 26, and the way I see it, I should focus on getting my life in order before I start dating. So for me, I need to focus on getting my own house first. Since right now I'm living with my brother and sister. 

But the weird thing is that they all keep trying to put pressure on me to date. My parents at least I can understand since they want more grandchildren and they only have one. My sister is constantly trying to pressure me to date by telling me 'Oh women like this, and they don't like things that you're into.' 

Okay again, thats just family, so its not that big of a deal.

But then my friends started asking me why I haven't started dating anyone yet, and they keep trying to set me up on blind dates. Which I usually don't want to go on, and I don't feel comfortable with when they're going on.

One time I told a girl my plans to move out the current state, and she said she thought it was stupid on our blind date. So that didn't go well.

Now its gotten to the point where my co workers are trying to make me go out with another one of our co workers who I have NO interest in.

I just don't understand why I have all these people trying to tell me 'Hey you need to date."" 

I'm not shy about women. Its just that I need to focus on getting ahead first. Again, I'm not going to date unless I have my own place first.

And its also my personal life, so I don't see why so many of them are trying to get involved. 

I got my own issues to worry about. And personally i don't think I'll be worth much dating material wise until i'm at least 30.

But now people are like ""No! You need to do it now!"" At first I was willing to dismiss it as just banter, but its gotten to the point where I get messages saying 'Yo i got a date for you!"" Even though I didn't ask for it.

I'm at a university in a 160,000 population city in a metro area that includes Atlanta and a smaller city, and remarkably I've gotten way less likes than in my old 7,000 population town in rural west TN. Strange isn't it. I wrote a bio and had pictures that have helped me in my old town and that helped me on Instagram. I guess a lot of girls don't get on dating apps. I look good for reference, and I run. I can go for a half marathon even. Not ranting, just trying to grasp the dating game. BTW I had a fling a few years ago, so I'm not totally new to this. Just new to the dating aspect still.

 The other day, I randomly heard a girl talking to someone about how she's studying abroad in spring (I am too) and I asked her about it, to make a friend. And it was just natural. I even got her number. Not saying it means anything relationship wise, but I think that's the first step you take in dating someone. Make a friend from having common interests, get to know them, and it can go from there. I guess I just have niche interests that most people don't care about, which makes dating feel kinda bleak. But talking to that girl felt much more real than fighting for relevance on a shitty dating app. I think the idea is to just be where a large amount of people are (unlike my old town), making it more likely to meet someone you match with. I had a similar experience when I got to college in August. 

Meeting those girls randomly and talking to them about shared interests just seemed like the actual way that you start to date. It all suddenly made sense somehow. I just had to be in an area with a lot more people my age. So since most of you are probably much better at dating, is it best to not use Tinder and just meet people randomly?

I will do my best to shorten this as much as possible . So I am speaking to this lady whom I've been friends with for quite some time and we just started to rekindle our friendship since she just got out of a relationship ( 8 years that she has been dating this dude) and is starting to at least dip in her toe back into the dating world . So my thing is that I am just playing the role as her supporting cast and just trying to help her wound heal quickly as possible in a sense of her breaking up with her ex. Remind you guys, she is still living with the guy but yet she tells me that she is trying to get out but of course her ex still tends to her needs and loves her dearly . Despite of all this , she still goes out on randoms dates with other people (because she is on hinge) and does her own thing. How do I know this? She would mention this to me here and there on our texts. Now this is where things get a little complicated on my end . She is a medical assistance and she works very late at night. I would text her and we would speak to like 5A.M in the morning and she gets out around 7 A.M. I don't mind it because at the moment I am not working plus I am a night owl so I am usually up at that time anyways . But lately she hasn't been responding to my texts and we went out a couple of weeks ago. We didn't do anything too special because she was meeting with one of her coworkers so our time together was pretty short. That time we spent together wasn't necessarily planned . She just called me up because she so happened to be in the city getting her hair done so I guess she just wanted to kill time which wasn't an issue for me. Again, I enjoy the talks we had through via text but I didn't want this to be our first hangout you know what I mean? Now ever since that day we hung out she hasn't been responding to me as much . So now my thinking is do I

1. Tell her how I feel and go from there?
2. Do I express my emotions and ask her what is going on ? Would this help me derail these negative thoughts?
3. Do I do nothing and continue to text her until she replies ?

After getting a divorce from their wife whom they have been married to for a long time, they expect to find the perfect woman for them and fall in love in their fifties.
I understand we all have an inner need to deeply connect with a human being and I also try to not be judgemental BUT I can't help thinking it is ridiculous or at least highly unlikely.

I am in my late twenties and I have found dating to be well...inexistent so far for me and thus difficult to find someone compatible to me. I can't imagine how difficult it is for someone in their fifties, with children attached and a whole lot of responsabilities that need to be worked out around the other person's life. 
Not to mention, not to mention, the emotional labour you have to go through in order to build a relationship. It is tiring! How can someone past a certain age still have the inner resources to put themselves through so much effort considering, that is, that they have indeed found that compatible person to them. 

I see people past a certain age (let's say fourty onwards) who are now enjoying the fruit of their relationship that they have grown in their younger years. It seems they are more settled. I don't know quite how to describe it... probably that you have gerown with someone throughout the years and when you reach a certain age you start enjoying what you have built. As opposed to growing on your own or with someone else throughout the years and then splitting up and then getting in and out of relationships or encounters and just ending up lost.

Brief introduction: fell in love with a man, he fell in love with me, seemed very secure about our future, promised me so many things, the whole lot. I believed everything, we had intimate contact and right after that bam! everything ended.

I know where I went wrong. He wanted physical contact, he said he was coming after a long period of abstinence, so he really wanted it. I don't know what happens in the male's brain in this context, but he definitely started seeing me more enhanced than I actually am. He put me on a pedestal and sang love songs to me. AND I LOVED IT. My ego loved the attention, the compliments, everything. So I kept feeding this instead of stopping it and taking it slowly. I started lresenting myself in such a way that would feed his imagination. Then when his erotic desire was consumed, of course there was nothing else left. He didn't develop the desire to know who I was as a person because I didn't direct things in that way. I was all about ""look at me how beautiful I am"", ""look how well this dress fits me"" and all that.

What I have learnt us that compliments may be flattering to a girl's ego, but I didn't know back then who was talking. By this I mean to say that it wasn't him as a person who was talking, but rather his sexual desire. None if us knew this and it is fine. It is a lesson for me to learn and to reconsider my dating techniques.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi ladies, I know this could be a sensitive topic. But I would really appreciate it if you ladies can offer me some good advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm 22 years old this year. I came to study in Canada from an Asian country. In high school at my home country I was considered a funny, smart and above average looking person. My English was very good and my all friends were very jealous of me. I also had plenty of girlfriends in high school. These experiences indeed have boosted my confidence and opinion on myself about my appearance. Back then I really dreamed of being wild in university, like hooking up with different attractive women from everywhere. Be both the hot smart guy in my university.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my actual experience in a Western university in Toronto totally made me feel down and confused about myself and what to do next. I had so many first dates with attractive strangers, I had courage to walk up to any girl in my school to ask them to go on a date with me. But I still find it hard to get laid, I have only got laid several times with slightly good looking women on tinder. And my tinder matches are getting fewer and fewer each month til I stopped using it.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I thought it was because of my fashion style, so I went on to spend some efforts onto finding myself some good looking outfits. But it was still hard, so i thought it was because I was too skinny without muscles, so I started keeping going to workout every other morning. I have also spend days going out to night clubs with friends. But eventually, none of what I did improved my luck with beautiful women. I just don‚Äôt know what I did wrong. I have never received proper PE back in my high school but I managed to find my own path. I honestly feel very proud of myself not playing video games and have so many hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

So I feel really down, especially when seeing a 6 feet tall white bulk footballer had it so easy with a really hot white girl in my school. But I never had anything like that happened to me even though I tried so hard to improve myself. And it is also a hard topic to talk with parents or friends cuz people would just say I‚Äôm horny. But I know everybody wants what I am pursuing.

&amp;#x200B;

So can somebody tell me what I can do about this?

So fast forward, we started talking and I get to knw tht he is nt frm my place and he only comes here sometimes for his work &amp; this time he ws here cause of his mom‚Äôs surgery. He asked me to come meet him
at his current location but i couldn‚Äôt make it since it was really far from my place. But I did offer to meet somewhere in the middle and he said that he cannot leave his mom alone for long hence it won‚Äôt be possible(which was totally understandable) so we planned of meeting before he leaves to his hometown at a common point(which didn‚Äôt happen) and two days later he told me that he has already left. Now, he is asking me to travel to his hometown as our first date, meet him(he said for like 2-3hrs)&amp; whenever he gets urgent work he will go back to get it done &amp; that I explore the place(which is a different place altogether for me cause I haven‚Äôt been there and have no friends there) alone when he is busy and can‚Äôt be with me. He also tells me that he is looking for something fun &amp; interesting and is a very romantic person, and likes his partner to be one. &amp; once he even asked me if I was romantic. Yesterday when we were talking on a call he said things like- ‚ÄúMy top checkboxes in the list of things(that he wants to do with a partner) are related to physical stuff, I find you sexually attractive, it will be hard for me to control if I see you and we are not engaging in physical things and that he doesn‚Äôt like to be controlled either.‚Äù He even asked me if ‚ÄúI am good at it‚Äù which I felt was a really odd question. There was another instance where he didn‚Äôt reply to my messages for two days straight &amp; when I told him that it hurt me and was insensitive of him to leave the conversation in the middle he said that not to get attached to him and it shouldn bother me if he is replying or not and he doesn‚Äôt want to take the responsibility of me getting hurt. I am not understanding what the guy is actually trying to achieve because any serious relationships wouldn‚Äôt start off this way and moreover he wants me to go over to his place, can‚Äôt promise me that he will show around the place and that I spend time with myself as long as he can‚Äôt make time for me.
