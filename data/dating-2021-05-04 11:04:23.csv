&amp;#x200B;

I have been out of relationship for the past 5 years now. And although I have been trying to meet new people and putting myself back into dating again, I have not been very successful. I have been using dating apps since 2 years ago, went on few dates but always end up with guys who are looking for casual/FWB relationships or just   
do not have connection at all. The last time I went on a date was probably last year (which have been 8 months ago since) and it lasted for about 3-4 months since he was not looking for a relationship at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have yet met someone thru dating app and we have been talking for a little over a month now. We have had great conversations, however, we haven't have met yet either irl or through a virtual date. I do not even remember him asking me out in that sense. I am not sure if he was interested in me romantically or is just up for great conversation/friendship. I know that a month is a short period of time to be expecting to figure that out since he was also coming out of a long term relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

There were few times when he seems a bit flirty though but I don't want to assume he was flirting. It can be that he is just teasing in a friendly way. He is a sweet, very considering, thoughtful guy at that. It is going way too well that I am quite sacred this will turn out to be another flop.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice? Thank you",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4s995/i_27f_need_advice/

I figured it should always be upfront and honest about some stuff but I feel like maybe it's too soon. I get vibes from them that i said too much. Are there some obvious ""dos and don'ts"" of first date conversations I should know about? 
An example is I had a girlfriend for 3.5 years. I don't tell them about her specifically just the fact that I dated women too, because I've noticed some guys aren't ok with that. So I want to make them aware. Should I not bring that up though even if they ask about my past? I don't want to seem like I'm hiding anything so I just want to be honest if they ask questions.

It's easy for me to go a couple times in a night, 4-5 times a week. He would be happy with 2-3 times a week... in his last relationship he said he was 'lucky to get it once a month'. 

During the first few months we were doing it like bunny rabbits, and as the months went on, it balanced out naturally and turned into a slower, more intentional type of intimacy. However, I notice at times I feel a little bit like ""the horny one"" or ""the pushy one"" in bed when I start to feel him up and he asks if we can wait until the weekend or says he's too tired. It's not often that he does that, but I find my ego does get bruised a little bit and I wonder if he's just not that attracted to me. I don't want to be needy but I do enjoy sex with him. He is always snuggled up to me in bed so its not like he's cold to me  or anything, he's just not up for sex and would rather cuddle and sleep.

He brought me flowers the other day and we do a lot together, whether its cooking or being active or snuggling on the couch. He's attentive and sweet and very caring towards me. Super physically affectionate, and not EVER rough or self-serving in bed. We have good variety, and make each other laugh so when we do have sex its very satisfying. It's just not close to being as frequent as it was with other partners. 

I'm just not used to being with a man who isn't a raging horndog.

I‚Äôm young and I have the desire to make that happen in my career even though it isn‚Äôt an active concern. These are long term plans.

Fast forward 6 months and I've managed to acquire a total of 4 matches, 2 of whom unmatched me instantly upon receiving a message from me. Now I'm not only just as lonely as when I started, I'm also aware there's something about me that is extremely undesirable or unattractive and I'm too autistic to work out what it is.

16,n4tk2k,1620147969,Am I right to see this as a red flag?,"So I (30M) have been messaging/video calling this woman (28F) for almost 3 months now. Unfortunately , being in the UK, we've had to take things slow because of the strict lockdown rules.  plus we live about an hour away from each other, and I don't have a car (but she does). Generally we don't test while we're working, but we do send several texts to each other almost every day. Sure there are days where we don't text as much, but there are also days where we text a lot more than usual.

About a month ago when some of the lockdown rules loosened, I asked her out on a hike, since it was a mutual interest of ours. She agreed and it felt like it went really well. But since it was a while before the lockdown rules would loosen further, and there wasn't much else we could do if we met up again. As such, I was holding out before asking her out again. 

However, one weekend she passed a comment that her weekends are really boring. I saw this as an opportunity to ask her out again. After this point, while she agreed to meet up (although her message came across as more of a 'why not' than a definitive 'yes'), I was now only receiving only one message at the end of every day. Generally when our messaging lulled of a bit, the timing of her messages were relatively random, but this time, they were consistently around the same time, late in the evening. A few days before we planned to meet up again, I messaged to see if she was still keen to meet up. However she said she was busy this weekend and thought I was referring to the following weekend. I brushed it off and over the weekend we didn't message much.  

Now that the weekend is over, she seems to be messaging me as consistently as she was before I asked her out the second time. I can help but think that she might not be interested in actually meeting up anymore an the she's just messaging me to help past this time.

For the past few months, I tried to change that but I barely got any girls to talk to me. Like I would try to send conversation starters but no one would ever respond. This got to me and eventually I stopped using them

All of this caused me to develop a fear of dating. Not just online, but in real life too. I had crushes throughout the years in person, and when I was rejected by each of them I took it ok. But now, when I think about going back onto the dating sites, I think about how I don't have a lot of pictures of me, that the ones I do have suck, that I have no way of getting better ones, how my height (5'5"" and a half) and my average looks put me at a disadvantage, and how I barely got to talk to any girls and the ones I did get to talk to dropped the conversation. And then I just don't bother.

I've already been through a lot during 2020, and I'm only starting to get my feet back under me, so I'm probably not ready for dating yet. Right now, I'm just focusing on myself, plus I'm trying to build up some muscle. But even now, with all this self work, it's hard to imagine thinking of any progress being made in this field. People said that the only way to get better at dating is to practice, practice, practice, but that kind of hit me where it hurts. ""And exactly how am I supposed to practice when no one ever talks to me, huh?!"" Kind of like that. I'm even afraid of studying the ways of flirting sometimes. I don't know why. It's just whenever I try, sometimes I'm stopped by some kind of fear.

I know I just need to focus on myself for now, but it's clear I have some wounds to heal. I've developed a habit of shutting out any form of media or anything even related to dating, because I can't deal with the jealousy of watching others who have succeeded. So yeah, I need some healing. But I don't know how to go about it. Any confidence I once had in myself has been shattered and I can't help but be pessimistic about the whole thing, especially after the months of torture I had to go through with the dating apps.

23,n4uspi,1620154089,"I am interested, and sort of seeing, two very different women...","You can see from my other posts - but basically I am 28 year old male going through a divorce, etc.

OK so when the divorce became clear and agreed upon in principal in February... I started trying to talk to a girl I knew through a mutual friend. I didn't know her at all but we were in a group chat together and I hit her up separately and we began talking a lot for never having met. I found out soon that she's only 22, but there still seemed to be a lot of interest. We talked for a month or two fairly consistently but it never got romantic besides flirting, and we hadn't met.

So after the divorce stuff starting going through and I had my place to myself, I got on tinder. Went on a few dates but nothing really interesting. Then I met this girl and we had a ton in common, a ton of mutual interest, and we were both pretty direct about liking one another. she is older than me , 4 years older, but she was also going through a divorce, has a kid like me, etc. So much more mutual ground. 

Ok so around the time I met the girl on tinder, the younger girl wanted to meet up finally. We went to the dog park with our dogs for a few hours ,talked a bunch, and seemed to hit it off at least to an extent, but nothing romantic going on I didn't think. I thought she was extremely attractive, even more so than I could tell from her social media. 

After that things became more serious with the girl from tinder...we were talking more, we started seeing each other a couple times over the course of a few weeks, and we hooked up and stuff. The only thing I really disliked , although it may make me look shallow, is she was a bit more out of shape than I expected her to be from her online presence. She said she was having a hard time last couple years with depression,etc. And was working on getting back to her normal weight. Her pictures and stuff show she has an athletic figure, but age and some weight gain I suppose. She still has a really pretty face and some nice features to her and I was still attracted, but as someone that has always been with smaller girls I guess it kinda was an adjustment for me.

Since that meeting we have talked non stop. We have talked about becoming exclusive at some point if things keep going well. It has only gotten further and further now that it's been about a month since we met.


Ok so now the younger girl, after I didn't talk to her for like a whole week as I was focused on the tinder girl, last weekend wanted to go get drinks with me. She invited me out. I didn't know what to expect since the last meeting was ambiguous. This time was more Intimate -  eating dinner together, getting drinks, etc. We hit it off again in terms of getting along. I was suppose to see my friend but she insisted I stay longer with her. I drove her in her car to another location to get more drinks(alcohol hit her a bit harder). We never got intimate like kissing but she did start to get kinda touchy feely. Stroking my arm, putting her hand on my leg, hugging me when we left. I'm still not sure what her intentions really are. But since that meeting she has been talking to me even more. She gave me more ways to contact her (her number, instagram, etc) . And yeah she's already mentioned meeting up again more than once

I'm in a bit of a pickle with two very different situations. I'm a bit more physically attracted to the younger girl, which isn't a huge surprise. And it feels like we have a good amount of chemistry. The older girl is definitely really cute and we have an extreme amount of chemistry. But it also feels like it's moving super fast. I could see myself dating the older girl moreso for a variety of reasons...but right now I think I'm more attracted in general to the younger girl. As of now I want to keep feeling it out.

I just read something that absolutely affirmed in my mind why suicide is the correct choice and has always been the right choice. Just read what I read and tell me I am wrong, I want men in particular to read their odds and tell me if this is worth living through

&gt;I'm obsessed with dating &amp; relationships. The trend I'm seeing is exactly what you're citing.

‚Äã&gt;Tons of men competing for a limited pool of women. The male-female ratios on online dating apps appear to be getting worse over time. As in, I am willing to take bets, that there will be more males per female on the apps in 2025 vs 2024, 2023, 2022, etc. As time goes on, there will be more and more men available for fewer and fewer women.

‚Äã&gt;You're right. We are in a transitional period right now. Meeting your SO used to be done primarily in person. COVID also hit the world pretty hard, and closed lots of churches, schools, and public spaces like bars, gyms, etc, where people used to traditionally meet their SO. The shift to online dating apps (OLD) that was accelerated by COVID lockdowns limiting the in-person venues for romance, and it's going to continue driving more people online because the more women turn to OLD apps, the less will be available to meet their partner(s) via traditional in-person venues.

‚Äã&gt;What's this gonna look like?

&gt;men who are trying to meet women IRL, or in community settings SHOULD experience a harder time meeting single women who are available to date as time goes by. I expect to see this get worse and worse over time as the taboo-ness of OLD apps fades.

‚Äã&gt;you pointed out that a strategy for men is to limit the number of available suitors that women have here:

‚Äã&gt;The play of the male with average attractiveness is to keep the hierarchies as local as possible.

&gt;It's already harder than ever to limit women's options, and I expect it to get harder and harder for men to meet single women at church, school, work, bars, gyms, libraries, parks, etc. as time goes on because more women are going to OLD apps for convenience and filtered ways of weeding out men.

‚Äã&gt;TL:DR - Dating's going to get a LOT harder for men, soon. Great time to be a woman.

And more

&gt;lots of online dating apps stopped publishing the info on male/female user numbers on their sites because they don't want to tell men that they're competing with 93 other men for every 1 woman they see on the app who's not a bot, hooker, or LARP.

‚Äã&gt;I think more and more women will start to prefer to meet their SO on dating apps, because the apps make it much easier, faster, efficient, and safer to reject men. It used to be the case that men approached you IRL, and you had to reject them to their face, which opened women to the risk of violence/harm or social stigma. It's now possible, through the OLD apps, to reject men easily with a simple left swipe, before he even knows you saw his profile. This requires no risk to the woman, and won't hurt anyone's feelings and is safer IMHO.

‚Äã&gt;It's much easier for me, on Tinder, to hide my profile and only the men I swipe right on, get to see my card. This makes is SO easy to reject undesirable men. I don't have to think about it, text them, I don't have to call them. I just swipe left and they never even know about me or see my card. It takes a lot of the pain of rejection out of the equation by not even showing me to the men I don't want. It's safer for me, too. Since I now don't have to worry about a bunch of angry guys I rejected try to find my social media profiles or stalk/harass me because I wasn't interested in them.

‚Äã&gt;because my dating life is now handled by these apps. I can feel free to put my headphones in, and never be ""open to being approached"" in public. So I can close myself off from being approached by men IRL because my dating needs are already met. I think this is a huge, enormous benefit of dating apps. I'm now closed to meeting men IRL, and can feel okay with just putting my headphones on and ignoring men IRL.

&gt;I can't be the only woman to see these benefits and enjoy them. I expect OLD apps to get more popular with time

Although I don‚Äôt speak for everyone, I see a trend here and I know how to help. I see post after post about how dating (especially online) is unfair to men. You say women want this and that. Women are shallow or they want money or height or bad guys or good guys or sex or whatever. Just stop. 

If you want an actual match with a real woman that you could spend the rest of your life with, you need to become a feminist.  Yes I can tell when you resent women. No you can‚Äôt hide it from me. The thing is, I‚Äôm smarter than you think I am. Telling me I‚Äôm wrong about what women want is a turn off. Acting like a gentleman when you secretly resent me is a turn off. There are women who disagree, and I bet those are the ones on tinder currently competing for guys with  8 packs who spend 12 hours a day in the gym. So take your pick. 

My husband is my husband because he had no expectations around sex. We open up to each other emotionally. He‚Äôs an actual feminist who would proudly say so to anyone. I feel empowered and respected by him and he feels empowered and respected by me.

If you knew half as much about women as you pretend to, you wouldn‚Äôt have as much trouble as you do. So read about how you can support feminism as a man, and be serious about that, and maybe you‚Äôll find your person.

Here the last story (I need advice, please)","I've met a guy on Reddit out of nowhere: we didn't have expectations at all when we started to talk (and still don't have) and we both felt a lot of chemistry since the first messages. I must say, I chat with a lot of people daily so I am used to it, but I rarely have such a connection with them (if you know MBTI type, he's an INTJ - cold and charming like Sherlock, and I'm the overfeeler artists - the INFP). We used to chat everyday, and he started to open a little bit in compliments and phrases like ""I missed you, you're so different and interesting"". He's still cold about expressing himself in a deeper way, but I still try to tease him mentally and sometimes I show my sensitive soul trying to feel him better. But I've understood his style, so I'm always sarcastic and mentally challenging/creative/charming while i try to grasp him, so never too sweet or diabetic (it's not the time to show full emotions, I have to be patient with him). I feel he truly appreciates me like a person (he often says that to me, in many different ways), and he - even if in his cold and smirky way - often shows me attraction signs like long/mentally intense text conversations and cute words. Once I was feeling very very bad emotionally and he said: nodoby who has feelings for you can never forget you, you're too unique and special. He was so serious. I know he's sexually and mentally attracted to me, but I'd like to get into his emotional sphere as well ü•∫ I started to be more independent lately, and things were going well because I don't give him pressure, I keep the conversations creative and misterious. Yesterday I said to him, while conversation started to become interesting: I have to go. He: Why do you think I'll leave you go? Me: I have to write now üòâ We'll text tomorrow. So... I felt that he wanted me to stay, I can assure that it was a very exciting conversation. Everytime I text with him I feel a lot of sexual tension and feelings not because of sext, but because we have matching minds. I don't even know if we could develop something more, even because he's pretty far from my home (not too much actually, like 4/5 hours distant), but I want to feel it as much intensely as possible. I'm an high sensitive person who loves emotions and passion (both mental and physical). So, the problem, is that he is too unavailable and rational, and today, for the first time, he became suddenly cold in text. From one message to another, not from day to another. I really think he's a bit of a strategist because he's overly confident about himself. I fear he's a narcissist who can't be truly connected with another heart. What do I have to do: Be patient? Leave him? Act hot and cold like him and play mental games? Thanks in advance.

Ik that‚Äôs a long time but we both agreed to it since we didn‚Äôt know the best move for us due to past relationships. But for the past month we have been talking about finally making the move to officially being bf and gf. And one night I was telling her about my new job and how I meant new ppl. Later I hinted the fact that I was going to ask her to be my gf in the near future and she said ‚Äúno comment. I‚Äôm still thinking about it.üòÇ‚Äù and I politely asked ‚Äúwym‚Äù and told her it was like she was sending mix signals and that I‚Äôm confused about everything now. She took it lightly and told me she just feels like I‚Äôm in a higher level of life and that there‚Äôs more experiences for me and that maybe it‚Äôs best if me and her were just friends. After she told me that she told me she was going to sleep. So the next morning I asked her politely again to explain more and if we could talk about everything bc she didn‚Äôt make an official decision bc in her word for word text she kept saying ‚Äúmaybe, I think‚Äù but then she ignored me that whole morning and txted me later that night telling me the truth and that she didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. So as most would expect I‚Äôm sureü§îI was angry about that. I didn‚Äôt release my anger on her tho I just told her I was mad at her and I need a few days to think about all this in her pov and I didn‚Äôt want to talk to her. Now she didn‚Äôt take that lightly, also understandably. And she was mad at me for that. So when I came back she told me she didn‚Äôt want anything to do wit me and still didn‚Äôt explain anything but said we will talk about it tmr(today). And this morning she told me that we were officially done and she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me at all anymore. 

So we have argued 3 times since we have been talking and only 2 of those arguments were bad. We never insult each other or yelled but we would quit talking for days and eventually work everything out, each time was my fault honestly. Although the 3rd time we argued,  this was the one that wasn‚Äôt too bad, but she told me if we argued again she was done wit us. And the incident i‚Äôm discussing is the next argument: when i told her I didn‚Äôt want to talk to her for a few days, and she got mad about it. 

So this morning she told me ‚ÄúI said if we argued again I‚Äôm done wit this‚Äù and that‚Äôs y she said she didn‚Äôt want to be friends or have anything to do wit me anymore.

So there‚Äôs the story wow it‚Äôs a lotüòÇsorry.

On Saturday, my friend me to go to Topgolf with her and some friends this week. I accepted and she told the guy who was planning the event that she invited me. Then, on Sunday, after mass, we everyone was talking, and I met the guy and he was talking about Topgolf.

I was so exited to go. However, after going through all the names, he realized he could only have 12 people and that he accidently allowed 14 people to come. We tried brainstorming ideas and to see if maybe we miscounted and if there were some maybes. I asked him why it had to be 12 and he said that it was because they got a discount if they had exactly 12 people. This turned out not to be true when I called Topgolf the next day just to see if he was accurate. Anyways, when he realized everyone said yes, he turned to me and asked me if I wouldn't mind sitting out because he made a mistake in saying yes to too many people. He said that it wasn't because he didn't want me to go. I unwillingly agreed because I didn't want a fight. However, I was upset. 

My question is this, is this considered rude or is it ok since there was too many people? Although he could've allowed more than 12 to go as there is no limit.

I am afraid of destroying my friend group. She is friend with all of us and I worry about ruining the experience with my friends. We all went to primary school together. That suddenly she would date me, and be friends with them. Am I overthinking?

He doesn‚Äôt text me regularly or treat me like a gf; basically he‚Äôs hanging back letting me do all the work. The only thing that keeps me pursuing is that he obliges sincerely in person. He pays for me, is affectionate/kind, listens, asks questions and actively listens.

Based on his in person behavior, I decided to finally ‚Äúbreak‚Äù the break and tell him my intentions. I told him his actions and awareness have made me happy, I miss him, the new behavior makes me want to be with him again, and that I want something serious. I told him I can‚Äôt continue to meet up otherwise. I said I want to discuss our previous problems and go from there, if he is interested in the same. He said he has been having fun with me too, and that he wants to come to my town at ‚Äúsome point‚Äù. Basically it just sounded casual.

What bothers me is i texted him this 10 days ago and got no reply about being serious and talking about our previous problems. He basically just ignored that part. I feel blindsided. I thought I was being wise confessing my feelings after taking some time to judge his in person behavior. 

I‚Äôm confused if this is just a reflection of his pattern from the beginning: he can show up for me but can‚Äôt say what he wants. To his own admission he says when he shows up that is what matters most and he has a very tough time discussing feelings and being vulnerable. He often seemed insecure if I even liked him that much, but I confirmed that with my texts. 

I‚Äôve also pretty much accepted maybe he‚Äôs just over the relationship  and  Seeing me casually  because it‚Äôs good company too. He doesn‚Äôt want anything serious. 

The third option is he just doesn‚Äôt know what he wants.
In either case we cares a lot about each other and I thought he would at least dignify me with a response. I have left the conversation hanging at this point and haven‚Äôt followed up. He knows what I want and how I feel now and the ball is in court.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4y0n8/feeling_blindsided_confused/
54,n4y17b,1620161796,"How I [22F] communicate clearly with my love interest [23M] about what exactly is making him apprehensive in this situation? Particularly since my love interest is introverted, shy, and anxious?","**TLDR;** I think my love interest may be interested but that he's apprehensive about something specific. I want to create a space where he feels comfortable to open up to me about it, to see if there is anything I can do to help him feel comfortable. I want to talk to him and figure out if it's a particular reason, or anything I can do to help him feel comfortable. He's shy, anxious, and overwhelmed easily, so I don't think he would bring it up himself. Please only answer with suggestions on how to word this, not input on the situation itself. 

My love interest recently got out of a relationship. He sort of seems like he's interested in me, but I didn't want to be too hasty with making a move because I want to give him time to heal. I ended up telling him I liked him, but I never got to clearly communicate that I was fine with going with the flow and was in no rush for dating or commitment. 

One night we were about to hook up, and there was a lot of hesitation between us for different reasons. I think we were both concerned about misinterpreting the situation and hesitant to make a move. After we got past that, he was also hesitant because he said he couldn't stop thinking about me and my close guy friend that entire night. He said he felt like something was going on between me and my friend, and if there was he would feel weird about pursuing me. I've also had other people mistake my friend and I for hooking up/being together when we're not, so I get where he was coming from. I reassured him that nothing was going on between us, but I wasn't sure if he fully believed me. 

After that day, he still reached out to me to make small talk but I sensed apprehension from him. I had a strong gut feeling it was one of these reasons: 

* He thought I was trying to tie him down/jump into a relationship while he wasn't over his ex yet, and got overwhelmed. He didn't understand that I was okay with giving him time to get over his ex.
* He was still worried about my guy friend.
* He thought we didn't have sexual chemistry because of all the hesitation.

Or a mixture of all of the above. If he's interested but something in particular was holding him back or causing anxiety, I want to know. But knowing how he communicates, you need to be very direct with him for him to understand the question and be specific. So if I asked him, ""Was something making you anxious?"" he might reply with something like ""Hmm, I don't know"", and it wouldn't help. But if I ask ""Was XYZ making you anxious?"" then he would probably be more clear. At the same time, I don't want to sound like I'm created a bunch of theories or like I'm interrogating him by asking him one-by-one which thing it was. And that's the dilemma. 

 I've heard the whole ""If he's interested he would let you know"", but I tend to like introverted and/or anxious guys and sometimes they don't let you know and you have to help them feel comfortable to talk about certain things. He also gets easily overwhelmed.

That‚Äôs usually when he stops texting her the day after sex or slowly fades out after expressing more genuine interest before sex. I think there‚Äôs some misunderstanding here because I don‚Äôt believe that all these men are actually lying. 

I think men will say caring and committal things to a woman before sex because he‚Äôs actually interested in her in that way... before sex. If a man loses interest after sex, was his interest fake in the first place? As a man, I seek a woman who I‚Äôm attracted to. If I meet a woman and we hit it off and we‚Äôre having a great time, I may seem like I‚Äôm going to enter a relationship with her. I may even start making future plans with her. Now if I have sex with her and it‚Äôs not as good as I hoped, am I responsible for keeping those plans? Am I expected to stay with her just because I‚Äôve already said things? I think that I am not. Today we have many women literally painting their faces every day before leaving the house. Yoga pants have been invented that sculpt a woman‚Äôs butt to a certain form. So when I get a woman in bed it‚Äôs often not what was advertised so to speak. 

I think it‚Äôs a little ridiculous to get upset that you‚Äôre ghosted if you‚Äôve lied about your appearance in such a way. As a man, I can do little to fake how I look. Women have a multitude of ways that she may look entirely different after I unclothe her.

75,n50h99,1620168083,It's been three years.,"It has been three years since the love of my life committed suicide. 

We met during summer camp six years ago, when I was seventeen and she was fiveteen. We had our first kiss on that camp. As it turned out later we were living few blocks from each other. We started dating. There were some ups and downs. We broke up for multiple times but always ended up together again. 

She was the spark of joy my life needed. She was always so energetic, goofy almost. I was always a loner, an introvert. I used to have friends but never seemed to able to keep them for long. We were the exact opposites, she had so many friends, so many better looking guys hit on her, but she somehow fell in love with me. She made me feel things I didn't knew even exited within me.

She would always plan our trips or organize different events. We've had some great times at the zoo, camping and other stuff. 

Sex never played a big role in our relationship. We would talk hours and hours during the night about our plans, about the world, with my hands around her waist, head resting on her shoulder.

I was struggling with depression at that time but I didn't want to upset her so I hid it from her. I know I shouldn't have done it. I felt like she deserved the best, not some depressed loner.

It turned out she also had depression, even worse than mine. How could I not see it? She was hospitalized a couple of times before we met. Her parents told me that she was doing much better after we became a couple. They were afraid that if they told me about her mental problems, I would leave her. I don't blame them, they tried their best to help her.

It's been three years since. I'm twenty three now. Finishing my bachelor's degree. I've had some partners then, but nothing came out of it. I just feel like I'm betraying her. 

I still watch our goofy videos every night. I still cry looking at our pictures. I still dream about you every night. I still love you, Amelia.

Only thing is that we were both in committed relationships.

We both recently got out of our relationships, I broke up with my girlfriend and she got broken up with not too long ago either. We had chats about each other‚Äôs breakup, she feels sad about hers but respects the decision of her ex-boyfriend.

Last weekend I had a party at mine, she ended up joining with some friends. Again we started talking to each other most of the evening and things became quite flirty, a lot of physical contact, eye contact etc 

We ended up talking in my room, when she mentioned that a few weeks ago she kissed a guy that asked her out on a date as she was curious what it would be like to kiss someone else as she‚Äôs been in a relationship with the same guy for the last 3 years.

We continued chatting, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think that I was curious about kissing someone new too. I decided to go in for the kiss, we started making out quite aggressively and eventually got to 3rd base which she initiated. We then returned to the party, stayed quite close and very flirty.

As the party went on quite late, we ended up having lunch with her friends/flatmates at a restaurant, before everyone went home and she stayed over to sleep. We didn‚Äôt have sex, just cuddled and kissed before falling asleep. 

The next day I had plans, so she woke up and we kissed each other goodbye. I texted her to ask if she got home safe, to which she replied ‚Äúyes, thank you for asking‚Äù, and I left it at that without us texting since (this was 4 days ago)

I‚Äôm now wondering: should I ask her out on a date? Or wait for her to text me before I make the next move?
On one hand we had a fun night together and get along great, and clearly there is some physical attraction between us. Our conversations are also very flirty (joking about how we‚Äôll fall in love with each other, how she‚Äôs going to invite me to her home town etc).

On the other hand, we both recently got outside of relationships and a date might be too early for her. Maybe this was just a fun hookup/rebound as she likes the attention, as from what I‚Äôve heard she‚Äôs always been a quite flirty person.

What do you think? Should I just accept this night as a bit of fun in my life as a single person, or ask her out on a date? Should I take the next step to text her even if she hasn‚Äôt reached out since when I asked her if she got home safe?

79,n513hs,1620169804,How do someone become obsessed with the other in a relationship? I have some stories,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask questions and discuss, but I guess so, since I didn't find another ideal place, sooo...

How someone of the relationship becomes obsessed with the other, even if its a bad relationship? I thought about this a lot after last sunday hearing my cousin talking to my mom about my aunt (his mother): She was born in the 60's or smtg like that and started dating back there in the end of the 80's or so, the dude (my uncle) was a truck driver that had some plans for the future in his head. At the time they met people liked him and he was well received on our family, but over the years people started to hate him, and for good reasons:

\- He left the driver job and became a Construction Worker but after some time he quited and decided to never work again and know it's been like 5 years or so he's jobless so my aunt is the only that works on their house

\- She buys his fights with people no matter his side (Example: If we were on family barbecue and people started talking about n\*zism and how bad it was, even if my aunt were jewish, if his husband tells he ""kinda likes n\*zism\*, she changes her opinion and argues with the ones that calls n\*zism a bad thing because her husband defends so it's a perfect opinion that can't be discussed, only accepted).

\- He got agressive through the years and beat the heck up of my cousins and my aunt sometimes

\- He basically was responsible turning my aunt into the poorest person in my family. She won some high value inheritance through her life and was basically rich, but then spent all the money to this guy to pursue his dreams, that all failed, but she insisted on working to get money to pay for his failled dreams, and now they barely have money to eat.

\- Speaking on not having money, he still tries to achieve his dreams, but since they're broke and she doesn't have money to give him, he's not even ashamed of asking my aunt to call my relatives asking for lend money. My mom knows that she gives the money to her husband, so one day she replied ""I won't give you the money, but if you want send me the payment bills that I help you pay without any doubt"", and then cut the call in my mom's face...

\- All my family except my aunt thinks his ugly as fuck. And after he left his job he only got fatter and out of any good manners. He speaks loud, burps, don't shower or brush his teeth, and stuff like that. 

\- She already said that she loves him too much, EVEN more than his son. She said to my cousin one day ""You know I'm a powerfull woman, that I'm fearless and would die for you, already protected you from every demon in this world and I love you so much, but if it's a life or death situation including your father, I'm sorry, but I'd choose him...""

\- But I think, the worst of all, he don't like my aunt... He says she's ugly and only stays with her because of sex, and even tells her he calls her names and despise her in front of people, and he cheated and still cheats on her with several other women, but she even encourages him to do it. He had a children with one of this women some time ago and all my aunt said was ""Well, if you are happy it's fine, I can even help raising this child by working double and sending his mom some money""

\- To end, all my family already told her ""Look at yourself, where's your self-respect? Look where you are now, by him... Why don't you break up with his jerk?"", but all she replies is ""If we break up, I'll definitively cheat on my new boyfriend with him""

I mean, she's basically his slave, but what no one understands is **WHY?** He don't have ANY upside, he's annoying, ugly, bad husband, aggressive, broke, junkie, don't have any good manners, don't work, I mean, NOBODY likes him except my aunt, if he had at least 1 positive point to sustain their relationship we could talk, but it's probably the WORST relationship I've ever saw, so why she keeps on with this guy? There are other people that hit on my aunt (because she's pretty), but she don't give up on this piece of shit. 

Worse than that, except for my aunt situation, I have more 3 friends on abusive and bad relationships that don't break up and are devoted to their dates: The first one is a girl that has a boyfriend that cheats on her but she simply loves him too much to let him go. The second one was actually my girlfriend for a year, till someday she started talking with his ex-bf (abusive agressor that used to beat the hell out of her and not let her have a cellphone or computer) and then out of the blue they came back together, and a dude friend of mine likes a girl that treats him like shit, and they broke up 4 or 5 times but they get back together 1 or 2 days after breaking up once again... and the worst part is they basically date only online, they never saw each other... he could simply stop texting her and fine...

I mean, why this abusive bad obssesive relationships keep on? How can people fall in love 'till they're basically slaves of their couples no matter how bad their relation are? Why people humiliate themselves like that? I simply can't understand what's goes on their minds, why would people go through this bizarre situations that fucks your psychologic situation if there's lots of other people that likes them and are prettier and wanna makes them happy for real, the opossite of their actual boy/girlfriends? How can they create this bonds with this assholes? I mean, it's impossible in my mind to think this could happen to me. If I were on a bad relationship like that, I'd just bye bye because I know there's other people that like me and wanna make me happy, so why carring this dead weight people with you that only sinks you down?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n513hs/how_do_someone_become_obsessed_with_the_other_in/

A couple months ago I was going to the dog park (with my dog) most days, and tried to make it a point to talk to a new person every day. I'm very socially awkward and have never been much of a people person.

I typically would try to talk to women, not only for romantic reasons, but I also just don't typically like men, especially when women aren't around. They just weird me out.

I don't really know why I didn't really have a desire to talk to her. I started a new job where I have to interact with people more, I recently moved into my own place away from my old roommates, and every time I've tried talking to women before, they don't seem interested.

I don't know if it's one, none, or all of those things that just discouraged me from wanting to talk to her. I've also been using OLD on and off for 5 years, with no luck. I know that girls have been attracted to me in the past (long after the fact) and have been told I'm 6-7/10, although I don't like ratings. I'm well aware that my awkwardness plays a large part in why I'm single, I just hit a wall sometimes and don't don't feel like trying anymore.

Thanks for reading if you read all of that, have a nice day.

Good looking men..do you always look in the mirror?

I spent the weekend with someone I have been getting to know/ dating. This was the first time we spent more than 24 hours together. We got a hotel for 4 days. By day 2, I realized how many times this man looks in the mirror. 
Every time we passed a mirror in the room and throughout the hotel, or saw a window, he would glance at his reflection. 

I was very much turned off by this as he seemed to be very much into himself. 
He is an attractive man but seeing how many times he looked at himself made him unattractive in my eyes. 
Besides this, he has some good qualities that seem very caring and kind towards me. 

Is this just a quirk to overlook ? 
I have dated attractive men in the past but never came across this situation. 
Kinda weirded out by the whole thing. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I look at myself in the mirror and pose as well, but it‚Äôs just not a subconscious behavior I don‚Äôt realize I am doing.

Is this a red flag or just a quirk I should let go because no one is perfect.

92,n52nsz,1620174335,I came across as needy and way more interested that I actually am on my second date. Should I see him again or move on?,"I recently moved to a new city and decided to try a dating app since it has been just so difficult to meet new people and I was feeling really lonely. And I went on a date which might actually have the weirdest date in my life. He was polite and I did like certain qualities of him, but there were no banters, flirting, etc at all. I even said ""I make great lasagna! I could show you next time!"" as an invite to gauge his reaction, and his reaction didn't look that enthusiastic, which I took as a ""no next time""

I honestly didn't think there was ever going to be a second date and didn't text him after the date. 2 days later, he sends a follow-up text asking if we are we still on for the weekend.

Well, I was surprised that he even texted and was a bit confused why he thinks we're meeting up this weekend, but I decided to give it another chance. For our second date, he came over and it was a lot more fun than the first one, for sure.

The only thing is: I got really drunk and I totally embarrassed myself. (I just can't believe how drunk I got) I don't remember everything, but definitely said a lot of embarrassing things, coming across as needy and definitely way more interested that I actually am. Like how I honestly didn't think there was gonna be a second date since he didn't look very enthusiastic, I even told him he can just drop by after his work this week (OH MY GOD...I guess the lack of human interaction in this new city totally turned me into a total cling monster...) And after a long make-out session, I said ""there'll be more next time."" (Again, OH MY GOD.)

Today, he wrote me if I wanna meet up some time this week or next week. (Which of course was expected given how I behaved last time...)

I'm not sure if this is something redeemable and I should give this one more go or if I should just move on, given how I messed this up big time and got off on the wrong foot.

Second time around, we went to an expensive restaurant outdoors, facing the water. We were both dressed up really nice (nails done, make-up, nice clothes (spring dress, button shirt, name brand Chelsea boots), etc.). We had steak, seafood, and 2 drinks each. The bill with tip came out to around $160!!!!!! We split the bill so I winded up paying $80!!! She picked this restaurant after I had suggested another one but she said it was too expensive. We definitely spent more money at this place than we would have at the place I suggested. I most definitely thought this time around was a date because of how formal and expensive it was. I don‚Äôt think I spent this much in a single restaurant besides the one we went to in my life!

While we were eating, I asked her her opinion on a controversial topic related to her career.
