Interested in this person at work. She's working as the coordinator for new hires we have so she's not often around. Most recently last week but will be more scarce as time goes on. 

My gut says she's interested in me but no direct words have been said from either of us. I'm trusting my gut on this one though.

To the question - is that weird? I could just wait until the next time I see her but that's not often and it'd be even rarer to catch her not busy and make time to chat.

So I used to be hung up about height, but it's not on my mind so much these days. Dating isn't either. But some of the reasons i thought about it a lot was because of my past experiences: Girls place me in the friend zone when meeting them for the first time. They do it in a fun/ joking way but the intentions are pretty clear. Lack of matches on online dating. I know some good looking short dudes who struggle with OLD. They don't lie about their height. Being compared to boys or called 'cute' in a demeaning manner, the same way to a puppy. Being told explicitly by 2 girls i was on dates with, they couldn't see us together because i'm too short for them. (5'7 here). But whenever i brought it up in the past people thought i was exaggerating. A good friend of mine did admit several months later that i was right, because he started dating too and saw how superficial a lot of it was. But it came back into my mind because i heard something interesting last night. 

Two girls were talking in the restaurant behind us. Before anyone accuses me of eavesdropping, it was loud enough to hear it. The subject they were talking about turned to dating and how one of them was seeing a guy she liked. The 2nd girl asked how tall he was, and the first girl said 5'8, not much taller than her. They didn't outright insult him or anything, they even funnily said short guys are where it's at and he's a short king and stuff like that. But then it turned into some light mockery of how short of a height 5'8 is. Their opinions seemed to be mixed, but It seems no matter how cool a guy is, being short undermines it a bit. Short guys, what have your experiences been with dating especially online?

I like the idea of a relationship, but.. it scares me thinking of the time and effort I have to put into it.  How can I have a girlfriend, study for school, hang out with my friends, parents, and still have time for myself?  Having time to myself is the thing I enjoy the most.

Unfortunately, I’ve been talking to this girl for about a month, but I’m going to end it because the very thought of a relationship is terrifying.

After the breakup, a reunion, and then another breakup my eyes were opened to what I've been told my whole life was my issue, and what I never understood until earlier this year:

I'm scared to be alone. I fundamentally think (thought) another person completes me. I become attached to individuals with major red flags because.. personal trauma. I'm exploring it in therapy.. and I think awareness is a solid first step.

I've mentally shifted into a state where I'm ready to be alone forever, and not fear it, because god if I end up dating another dude with anger management/jealousy/addiction issues I don't think I could handle having my heart broken. I give so much of myself to these relationships but maybe I shouldn't be doing so. Maybe I should be guarding my heart a little more closely.

I've learned emotional unavailability, though the challenge of it has always appealed to me, is at worst going to go nowhere, or at best, going to end in a relationship where I learn that it's a cover for deeper trauma that will also hurt me.

I'm trying really hard not to give a shit what men, or anyone thinks. I'm trying really hard to be my best self, though I don't always succeed.

For the first time in my life I'm staying away from the apps, from the quick fixes to loneliness, from the quick fixes to validation. I'm diving headfirst into these fears of judgement for being single.

I'm realizing I've been using sex all wrong.. pretending like I didn't care about the emotional aspect, pretending like I could keep it casual, denying myself the real connection that has always been what I was after, if I'm being truthful. 

So what's left? Just me. Just moving forward. As my attempt at my best self.

Up until about a month ago, she hadn't messaged me once. About 4 times in the past 4 weeks she sent me small talk, which I responded to in a normal platonic way. Well anyways I don't know if it was her messaging me or what but I began to feel that I had made a mistake. I looked through our texts and realized I had been for the most part selfish, thinking that she didn't care about me while in reality I had stopped caring about her as well. 

So last week I messaged her and apologized for what I had done. She thanked me and said it was ok. About 3 hours later that night she texted me again about a memory we had together, full of enthusiasm, and we started loosening up and texted each other for about 30 minutes straight. I asked if she was free this weekend and she said no with one word, and then I said ok well let me know if you are free and she never responded. 

2 days later I texted her again, and mentioning our conversation from the other day, and explicitly mentioned how I wanted her back in my life. I know this probably wasn't the smartest thing and I don't usually do things so rash like this, but I really loved this girl and needed to hear a definitive ""no"" before I was turned away, against my better judgement. 

Well she gave it to me, and I haven't heard from her since. I know this was the right thing to happen, as I clearly was not mentally ready for another relationship with her, as I was still hung up about our first one, and that this ultimately might be a good decision in the long run, as we hadn't worked out once before. However I am currently absolutely heartbroken and devastated, probably like she was when I broke up with her. Did I do something wrong by asking her out too soon again? It seemed by how she kept small talking me and how she messaged me about our memories that she was interested again. Did she play me into getting her to talk to her again just to reject me?

One had mentioned how he felt like I was ""his person"" and the other had casually mentioned that he hoped I would be his girlfriend soon when talking to someone else while I pretended not to listen early when we started seeing each other, but things just... didn't work out. I tried to tell myself that I was fine without the label and that it didn't matter if we used the boyfriend/girlfriend terms or not, but it did (and I guess still does) bother me.

Additionally, neither of the two guys I'm focusing on here posted about me on social media. I know it might be a dumb thing to care about, but they didn't even do that coy thing where you take a picture of the plates of food at a restaurant to put on your instagram story to show you're out with someone. I don't have any selfies with either of them, either. (That could be partially my fault because I'm not one to instigate that sort of thing because I'm self conscious due to bullying when I was younger.) So as far as ""photo evidence,"" it's like we never dated. If they were just the types of guys who didn't use social media, I wouldn't care. But they each had photos of them and their exes / of just their exes while out on dates on their social media. They've each found other people to date after me and have since regularly posted photos of these women and have referred to them as their girlfriends within captions/posts and aren't afraid to express how much they love them (words that were never said to me, but that I hoped and waited for). It just makes me feel so temporary and disposable and like they never truly saw things going anywhere.

Rationally, I can say that maybe they just didn't value me as much as I deserved or we weren't right for each other, but it just hurts to look back and feel like I was holding on to hope for something that would never happen. I feel superficial for caring about the social media thing, like it shouldn't matter. But as someone who struggles with rejection due to past trauma, it really hurts me to feel so inadequate. I just feel like I was missing something that other women have, like it was &gt;me&lt; that wasn't enough, not a lack of compatability or life goals not being in alignment or whatever else causes relationships to naturally end.

This feeling of inadequacy holds me back in the sense that it's very hard for me to put myself out there. I have dating apps, but usually decline actually meeting in person after talking for a bit because I don't want to struggle to feel worth it again. I also laugh off advances when out in public or lie and say I'm not single even though I definitely am. 

I'm not sure how to reframe my thinking to be open to finding love, let alone a relationship, when the fear of rejection and not being ""good enough"" is always in the back of my mind. 

Main question(s): Has anyone had similar experiences? How would you move forward? Am I being completely ridiculous? Is it all in my head? 

Any advice would be helpful, and I appreciate you taking the time to read this far.

I have bad social skills, especially when talking to girls and have no money to afford a car and cant get a job for personal reasons.

I also have a huge problem falling in love with someone quickly when we have some things im common or when we live near each other.

He then asked me what the stupidest thing I've done while drunk is. I'm horribly lightweight and my tolerance is 1-2 drinks. If I go above that I get tired. I've never been drunk. I explained this to him. I told him I enjoy socially drinking, it puts me in a good mood, but that I've never gotten drunk. I also emphasized that I would not judge anyone for being drunk as long as they didn't hurt themselves/anyone else-and in his case I was happy he had a good time!

But he kept pushing me over and over, not believing me and then ridiculing me for not being one who gets drunk and in his words, ""does stupid things"". 

He then told me a story of how he got suspended in high school for participating in a cheating ring. He laughed, I laughed. Bear in mind we are 25, so this was a while ago. He then asks me if I've ever done anything like that-if I ever got detention or suspension. I answered truthfully-that no, I hadn't. He asked me why and I told him I just never did those kinds of things in high school.

He judged the hell out of me for these two things. Told me it's bad I wasn't and am not a trouble maker.

He invited me over tomorrow but stated he had work the next day very early (6am) so he “couldn’t stay up too late”. I replied/offered saying I wouldn’t sleep over/wouldn’t drink at all so I could drive home at night so he could get a good nights rest before his early shift. 
 
This is kinda annoying for me because I live far, and was wanting to have a glass or two of wine with him but I’m not comfortable driving even if I’ve had a sip of alcohol (light weight). We also are not meeting up until 4 pm and I hate driving in the dark so unless I only spend a few hours with him I’ll be driving in pitch darkness for an hour. Driving an hour each way to hang out/have sex for a few hours without cuddling in bed after doesn’t sound so great to me. I’m not sure why I automatically suggested not sleeping over. I felt like he was hinting to me that I shouldn’t sleep over or something but now I just almost want to reschedule. 

Do you think he may have meant that I could still sleep over and leave with him in the morning? Is it normal/common for men to leave for work early and let the girl sleep in/stay in their bed and let themselves out on their own or is that not a common thing for such a new “relationship”

Tl/dr: I want to sleepover at his house  but felt like he didn’t want me to since he works early.

However, when we text, we only talk about class and homework. Whenever I try steering the conversation elsewhere into something more personal he just ignores it. Not even kidding, he just straight up ignores what I say and NEVER asks me any personal questions.

However we do joke around a lot (but it’s about things that happen in class) so we are very friendly with each other.

We live about an hour apart, and we met in the middle for drinks. I felt very drawn to her, and she was quite obviously attracted to me too. Absolutely effortless date. She was making me laugh all night, I was making her laugh all night, she straight up invites me to stay the night at her apartment, we have sloppy wine sex, we wander around the city drunk at like 1am, we go back to her place again and pass out. I wake up at like 6am brutally hung over, I decide I should leave, I kiss her goodbye and I drive home.

A few days later (after not hearing anything from her) I call her again and ask when she's available for a second date. She quickly and enthusiastically says that she's completely open the following weekend. Great, so I set a definite time and place to meet and she agrees. The next day, she texts me while I'm at work saying that she totally forgot that her second Covid shot was that day, and we should reschedule. I told her to let me know what her schedule looks like and to get back to me with the days she's available. She hits me up in the middle of the week on Snapchat, I ask if she's available Friday night for drinks and she says she's travelling back to her home state for the weekend to finish shipping things to her new place here, but that ""she's totally open next weekend:)""

While she's on her trip, she sends me a super sappy/flirty drunk Snapchat in the middle of the night while I was asleep. When I woke up, I replied with a similarly flirty Snapchat, to which she never responded. In fact, it's the last thing she has sent me. I thought maybe she was a little embarrassed for coming on that strong or something, and I didn't send her anything disrespectful or demeaning in my response. In fact, it was basically a mirror of what she sent me, so I didn't think too much of it.

Four days ago, I knew she was back from her trip, so I shot her a message like ""Hey, hope your trip went well. Are you still free this weekend?"" She opened it like 12 hours later and hasn't replied. She has, however, been opening my Snapchat stories within 20 minutes of me posting them every time.

I had just gotten out of a relationship with a guy. He wasn’t loyal. It took me longer than it should have to get the message that I deserved better. Nevertheless, I finally did and broke things off myself. I was single for a while. I ended up dating this girl and it’s the biggest regret of my entire life. This girl wasn’t very good looking tbh but hear me out. She was someone I had been friends w for a while. She expressed interest in me, and I was like hey why not? This will be a good time for me to experiment and see if I do actually like girls or if I don’t. (I was ab 16 at the time) I dated her and I was upfront ab how I like to take things very slow and just test the waters. This girl ended up talking ab marriage, wanting me to meet her parents and even attacking my passion (acting) and saying I was horrible. I know this was SOO stupid of me but I ended up forgiving her for that. Then she started to isolate me from my family. I tried expressing to her that it wasn’t working while we were in the car one day and she got mad and told me to get out the car. Eventually she got over it and took me home. I then broke things off over text. The whole thing lasted ab 4-5 months. Which I don’t feel is that much time in the long run but I guess maybe that is? Idk I’m embarrassed it even happened at all. I kept the “relationship” private for the most part. I only really posted ab it on my private snap story and a few people I worked w knew. I wasn’t parading it on Instagram and all my other socials. I know ofc not all girls are this way but I don’t think dating them is for me. (That’s not based on this experience alone it’s just because I don’t think I can be with a woman) I feel SO ashamed and so embarrassed that I dated this person. I just want it to go away. Is this normal? Im not trying to be rude at all and if anything im way too forgiving. more than I should be.

Right now in this world gender roles are very strong and men are still expected to pursue in everything which is the biggest glaring hypocrisy right now in the gender debate


Most relationships would not form at all if the dude did not pursue

A lot of girls have a version of pursuing that really isn't pursuing and probably still would not make a relationship happen if the guy did not take the reins.


Two out of the three of my past girlfriends liked me first but even still I will steal the one that have to ask them out

It was easy to sense that they liked me and I rather would have not like to ask them out because I've been bombarded by so many messages on what not to do

But it all worked out but something I always found insulting is that guys get two conflicting messages

On one hand we're told that women go through all these types of struggles and experiences and as men we should make them uncomfortable.

And yet at the same time if a guy wants to find love he has to go out of his way to be vulnerable and not only make himself uncomfortable but potentially future dates

There is no way for a guy to know what mental level a woman is on especially when he's out in the world trying to find love

Of course most dudes who are social savvy will understand the signs of a girl is not into them but then again girls are also taught to be hard to get

And I'm not blaming the girls because I don't want to take away from any of the real experiences

But I remember so much of my youth of being bullied by the same girl so used to complain all the time about being cat called. These girls were the same ones who were expecting dudes to operate out of the 1950s model of manhood.

Do everything and pursue first and be stoic and make sure she's all right.

So many girls same to want this and at the same time completely crap on it


And once again just because some girls say that a guy acting like a jackass is a turn off, doesn't mean he's a turn off for the other 50 girls and that right there is the biggest problem with modern dating

So many women are complaining about the 10% of men who are horrible, well completely shutting off the rest who have their best interest at heart but are also open to their experiences.

The reason why I never dated until college was because all I heard from my female family and friends and coworkers was every single horror story they had with a guy.

Everything from his clothes to his choice of words to his personality will be picked apart and that did not make me too Keen to start dating.


That is until I started dating and realized just how much women varied in emotions and opinions

But the trick is, the jerks don't care already if the woman is uncomfortable or not and that's why they do so well but it's also why they make it hard for the good guys

As a guy it feels like you're having to prove your innocence first when you date a woman because she's trying to figure out if you're crazy or not which is warranted but also not at the same time

so far I have been cheated on and abused by women but that does not give me the right to put every woman under the brush as if she is somehow going to have malicious intent.


My last date was an older woman who literally said ""I'm gonna rape you.

Now granted this woman is not a rapist and she is an older woman at 40 something and I am still quite young at 24.

From her perspective I guess she was trying to be jokey as she is my mother's age XD

But I never took it that way and I knew she didn't mean it seriously nor was I in any situation to be raped.

(Assuming she also finds him attractive)

(I mean, perhaps they would say yes if the *right* stranger asked them out, but I've had acquaintances like this and that seems to be really rare for them)

But from what I've observed in these acquaintances over the years, 9 times out of 10 this type of woman will only eventually date a guy if she was the first in the friendship to catch feelings (or she thinks she was), since it's generally a turnoff for her to be friends with a guy who clearly likes her.

The thing is I definitely agree with the sentiment that it's shitty to become a girl's friend when what you really want to do is date her. You end up in a dishonest friendship and you both get hurt in the end.

So should I just avoid this type of woman if I'm attracted to her? I feel like I could only potentially catch her interest if I wasn't attracted to her and genuinely wanted to be her friend for a while. Which is paradoxical since in that case even if she caught feelings for me I might not ever become attracted to her.

I do have platonic female friends, but I don't foresee them catching feelings for me nor do I like them like that.

I've been there guys. I've experienced being ghosted, stood up on dates, rejected, and looked over because I don't fit some sort of standard. I have spent months dwelling on what I'm doing wrong or why am I being passed over. However, we shouldn't be dwelling on such things but focus on improving ourselves. You can't control a person to like your or love you. You can only control your choices or how you react to their decisions. I didn't realize this until I started researching stoicism. The philosophy idea is something that should be utilized in addressing these issues. You're being ghosted, good, time to move on and spend your time on something else. She chooses someone else over your, good, no more spending money on dates and now you can spend it on yourself.  She rejects you, good, more time to improve yourself. (Yes, for the ladies, replace she with he.)

Take up Stoicism. The philosophy idea will only build your character. I no longer have troubles with rejection, being looked over, or being afraid of never marrying. In the end, it's your life so live it well.

But then she messaged me the next day telling me that she thinks we're incompatible due to being on different schedules and that I came off as wanting something more serious than she did. She also said that I was a great guy and that she thought I was an amazing person.

So here I am now, 0 for 2 with a dozen no-responses. The sad thing is that this is still infinitely better than how it usually goes for me... I just feel so demoralized. Every time I care about a date, I either get told I'm a great guy, but they don't think it'll work or I'll just get ghosted. 

I wish I was able to be happy alone. I've got everything else going well for me, but not having someone to share my life with (in a serious or casual way) just sucks. I miss cuddling. I miss having someone to share little moments with. I miss everything... I know breaking up with my ex was the right thing to do, but times like these make me wish I wouldn't have.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,806469,public,self,Why does dating have to suck so much?

I don’t actually need a relationship to be happy. I’m perfectly happy with the way I am now. Sure, there’s a couple things I could change, like working out and stuff like that, but I’m fundamentally happy with myself.
I make people laugh, I can help them with homework, and I’m generally a likable guy.

The younger person wants to benefit off the wealth of the older person, and the older person just wants love/affection/sex from the younger person to fuel their ego. 

I understand it a bit more if you meet irl, but through apps its kind of unjustifiable. Women say they want a guy whos more “mature” and secure even though there are many people their age or even in a smaller range that fit those qualities. Guys say they want a girl who’s inexperienced which is really just a way to manipulate the girl into staying. 

Honestly it seems a bit awkward because the younger person is most likely fresh out of college living their life on their own for the first time. The guy could be making up for missed time for when he was rejected by girls at that age. 

No ones wrong or right, I just feel like its a glorified exchange of good/services. It just seems weird to have it normalized.

Just date people your own age damn

We’ve FaceTimed and talk pretty much all day and have both told each other that we caught feelings. She’s sweet, genuine, and just an awesome person to talk to.

Recently, I noticed she was acting more distant and almost shutting me out, so I asked her what was going on and she brings up her ex. I won’t go into too much detail since it isn’t my place to say, but essentially her ex was a man-child and she just isn’t used to someone like me who’s nice to her. They ended their relationship a few weeks before we started talking.

Then this morning, she tells me that she isn’t ready to start talking to someone new and needs some space. Given that she recently got out of her relationship, I understand that this all happened pretty fast, but I just don’t know how to handle the feelings I have. I know that I like her, but I’m confused about how she feels for me now. She’s told me that she’s invested in me, has feelings for me, and would reach out when she’s ready, but I don’t know if I should keep holding on to something that MIGHT happen, or just move on.
