I joined this r/ again because I started dating again.  I have a new attitude since the pandemic ended, and surprisingly to me, , my calendar is chock full of dates with high quality, smart, and accomplished women.  So, consider this a public service announcement.

*Your first sentence in your bio really matters to a quality man who reads bios.*

This is the sort of man who you want to attract.  Someone who has enough brains to 1) read and 2) care what you have to say.  So, kindly keep that in mind while you read on.

In another thread, I commented that I would insta swipe left on a womans bio if she wrote certain things because they implied frustration and a bad attitude.  Here are a smattering of pretty typical posts that I swiped left on just today.

&gt;Seems as though I need to put it bluntly that if your hitting me up for booty calls don't bother; I'm not a prude but lately this is what I've been attracting on here.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm a workaholic and I......

Got it.  No booty calls, but not a prude.  Works big hours.  You'll have to be flexable with your life because she can't be with hers.

&gt;I will not give you money.  Please don't try my patience.  It will not end well for you.

I'm sincerely curious what she would do if I asked for money.  Is she threatening to kick my butt?  Not that I would ask anyone for money.  I have my own money. I digress.

&gt;So, I did meet a guy on here, but he turned out to be a game player and was a narcissist, so no narcissists please!

This is probably my favorite one, as this lady is advertising that she's already prime to be manipulated by a narcissist because she's already fallen prey to one.  All they have to do is run the standard narc game on her and she'll fall for it again.

But here's the kicker:

&gt;Fun loving, easy going woman looking for the real thing.

Oh wait, I swiped right on her.  Anyone wonder why?

Why I'm writing this:  I'm focused on having fun, living my best life, and finding like minded women who want to do the same.  I was not always like this.  I was married for 20 years, but went through a scorching divorce, and had enough trust issues to fill a warehouse as recently as six months ago - and gave up ever dating again.

Then I fixed my attitude.  Because you can't catch bees with vinegar, you need pollen.  Your first sentence can do the same.  Or it can alienate good men who otherwise might swipe right.  Your choice.

Y'all be safe out there.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,53764,public,self,"Hey Ladies!

Yesterday, had a great conversation with a very nice woman. We had previously exchanged a few text messages. She has a weird work schedule and would get back to me about when a good time would be to meet in person. 

I had a scheduled zoom meeting at 1130am and our conversation was reaching that time, so we had to stop. During our conversation, the person I was meeting over zoom texted me to ask whether we could meet 30 minutes later, which was fine with me. 

I figured I should thank this very nice woman for our conversation, so sent her a text at 11:38am doing just that. Said nothing about the 30 minute delay because I thought nothing of it. 

So now my online dating paranoia is such that she had a problem with the time when I sent the text. Did I lie to her? Was I ignoring someone at work just to text her? 

Haven’t heard from her since and I didn’t necessarily expect to (neither of us are really into the random text exchange thing) until she worked out her schedule. 

If she changed her mind about me during our conversation, that’s all good. But if she changed her mind because of a misinterpretation due to the timing of a text, that would suck.

However, there was one person in particular who I told I was talking to a therapist, and she said she thought that was a good sign because I feel comfortable asking for help.  I also saw a profile on a dating app recently that said she considers it a good sign if her partner has a therapist.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,53778,public,self,Is it a red flag or a good sign if you have a therapist that you talk to on a regular basis?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oousfj/is_it_a_red_flag_or_a_good_sign_if_you_have_a/,some_ads,7,,aa73f354-275f-11e9-9763-0ed84ca6f39e,Question,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't have a ton of experience on the apps, just a few brief periods here and there in the last 3 years since my LTR ended.

I was reading through [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/omzz0a/standards_too_high/) about standards, and I feel like I meet all of the mentioned ones except I'm curious what women my age feel about my job status.

About a year and a half ago I quit my office job to become a carpenter/handiman of some sort.  I've just always loved working with my hands and being stuck in an office was sucking my soul, and I happened to be in a unique financial situation so I quit.  I have lots of savings, no debt, and my expenses are very low, so I initially took some time to help my parents do some remodeling on their home.  Then I started remodeling friend's bathrooms and doing work for friends of friends, and building this and that for people...  And recently I've stumbled upon a niche that I think can give me a good steady income.  I made a website for it and I'm about to start advertising locally.  All work so far has just been word of mouth.

So I'm curious to get some honest reactions to that.  How does it sound?  Does it worry you?  Is it impressive?  Lol, I honestly have no idea.  I don't seem to have any shortage of work being offered, but I get that it's not a paycheck and there's no 401k matching, etc., although I still contribute to an IRA and I pay for health insurance.  I figure if it starts to not work out, I'm not worried about securing a job if I need to.

I'm not sure how to advertise that.  Is ""entrepreneur"" a scary word to women looking for a partner?  I figure some people use that as some sort of code for being between jobs, so I worry that's how it will sound.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,53778,public,self,Entrepreneur: Good/Bad?

Until I met him. Then Everything changed. I’ve been dating a man steadily for a month now. We spend every moment possible together. He is an absolute dream. Checks every box. I’ve never been treated with more respect and kindness. He’s very attentive. Very loving. We have a vacation planned and yes, it’s moving fast but at this point in life, you either know or you don’t. We have a great time together and up until yesterday I had high hopes this was the man I have been waiting for. 
We have had discussions around an ex-girlfriend. Someone he dated for 18 months. It came up that she still reaches out to him.  So last night, I asked the question. Here’s how the conversation went:
Me: are you sure things are over with this woman?
He :Yes
Me: When was the last time you had contact with her?
He: a couple weeks ago.
Me: I guess the real question is, why does she still have access to you? If it is over, what is the point? 
He: well she kind of has to. And it’s not simple. I need to talk to you about it. 

My stomach literally begins to churn. I have to excuse myself. Regroup. Be calm. Patient. Listen for the answers. Then make a decision. 

Me: I’m listening.
He:  I bought her car for her so she could afford the payments and insurance. Her credit is not good. She makes the payments to me. I told her I want nothing to do with her and if she skips the payments, I take the car. I was just trying to help her out of a bad situation at the time. 
Me: (trying to thoughtfully and slowly digest this information) For how long?
He: 4 years. 
Me: whoa. That’s not a small deal. 

So here we are, trying to forge a new relationship, and suddenly I realize there’s a third person who will always be a part of it. At least until the payments are finished. I understand he has a big heart, wants to help out and this happened before he met me.  He didn’t have to tell me. He was honest. I appreciate this. I am struggling with the fact that, naively, I had him on a pedestal.  He was honest but I am completely scared of getting hurt. I am afraid the open line of communication between the two could get complicated.  She sounds manipulative and I can only imagine how the damsel in distress will play out. 
He says he wants nothing to come between us. He promised he would be open and honest with me about communication with her.  The only alternative here is that he payoff the car and give her the title and cut off all communication. That would costs him $10k. I would not ask him to do that but he asked me if that’s what he should do.  I said it’s up to him. Even if he isn’t with me, this follows him for four years. 
For me, I feel I deserve to be in a relationship that does not have this type of lingering issue. 
I honestly don’t know what I am asking from you fellow Redditors, except am I wrong to feel this way? Should I forget about it and trust it will be the way he says it is? Or should I ask that he come up with some alternative to get out of the situation?",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,53785,public,self,He bought her a car,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oow9bt/he_bought_her_a_car/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We discussed things the last time my anxiety ran rampant and thought things were fine. Until I was triggered during what I thought was a milestone celebration for us and was going to define the relationship.

I tend to jump to conclusions or speculate if I feel my partner isn’t wanting to spend time or talk to me for example :

* being left on read when texting
* not giving a time when we can talk if she's catching up with friends (but stays on the phone with me for hours when she's not busy)
* not making future plans
* telling me about other plans she can make instead of spending time with me

Every time I get into a romantic relationship, especially if we’re not exclusive or have labels, and I start to feel ignored (whether imagined or real), I freak out. Negative thoughts and emotions flood my brain.

She's well aware of my past and my tendencies. So, today, when I started looking for reassurance and validation and expressed that I need that to feel better about things between us because she isn't willing to have the DTR talk, I was told "" this is too exhausting and I’m not sure if I want to continue down a relationship path with you"".

I responded by telling her that I’m not a bad person, That I feel a lot of shame and guilt with my anxiety. I told her that I was scared to lose her. That I had a biological response to a real experience.  That this was my coping mechanism to help me survive for almost 45 years and that need some help from her to feel more secure about things.

She responded -  ""It shouldn’t be only about JBow’s fears and insecurities and making him feel reassured. It should also be about what I want and need in a relationship and how I want to be treated.""

Part of me wants to try to mend things, but part of me wants to let go.

After being divorced and working on myself these very issues for the last 10 years,  I’ve learned it’s not as easy as going to therapy and “fixing” myself. I find that when my needs for external validation/ approval/ reassurance aren't getting met, my brain goes into “fight or flight” mode to protect itself. My brain *believes* it’s going to be left or cheated on again and my body starts reacting.

I realized that if I keep going the way I am, I’ll eventually push someone who I really care about and that I would never find a partner I'd be happy and content with. This ugly truth hurts.

Then she said it’s best if I lose 5 lbs. Just in case. She said “ you have a nice body but five pounds is something everyone needs to lose”. 

My mother told I have to always be out and about. You never know whom you’re going to meet!

I know I will never figure it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dated this guy in the past. If you met him, you would think he was Mr. Wonderful. A total gentleman (but not really when you look at the red flags), very chivalrous, my parents LOVED him and he treated them so kindly, would bend over backwards to do things for me, was always doting on me - making sure I had eaten enough, buying me things I needed, and on and on...He was also quite good looking and had a very strong masculine presence, which I just melt over. 

Now for the red flags. They would be difficult to list because many are nuanced in his behavior and things he has said. I will start with...

1. When I first met him, he seemed to want to attach himself to me like INSTANTLY. He could not wait. He texted me NONSTOP all day long. He would text me, asking me to spend my life with him (I've only know you like one week, buddy) and constantly telling me how beautiful he thinks I am - like in an over the top way. 

2. I felt like he was interrogating me in order to glean as much info about me as he could and I felt uncomfortable and like he was staring a hole into my head. 

3. I felt fearful around him at times, like maybe he was thinking about harming me in some way. 

4. He would say to me ""I could eat you alive"" like all the time and I kept thinking ""maybe he just doesn't know how that saying actually goes??"". At the same time, I felt super uncomfortable - like fearful....and I don't usually feel like this around men. 

5. He would lie about something and then later give me some weird excuse that I knew was an excuse and try to explain away that he actually lied. 

6. He was always trying to get me to tell him I loved him and to commit to him verbally. It was a trap kind of thing. 

Anyhow, you get the picture. Even after knowing all of this, I would still spend time with him from time to time. In part, he really was great company and I would just explain away all the really weird stuff. Please do not judge me. In addition to this, I was intrigued by the whole thing. Like I wanted to figure him out. 

So, after not having seen him in quite some time, I stopped by his place to visit the other day. He asked me if I would like a glass of wine. I remember thinking upon entering - ""I hope he isn't planning to do something to me"". I thought wine sounded like a nice idea, so I said ""sure"", but I was watching him like a hawk. He goes into the kitchen and reaches for an already opened bottle. There is only enough wine left in the bottle for one glass. He pours me the glass. You know what I was thinking, I am sure. I wasn't going to drink that wine. It amazes me because I know that HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING!!!! Suddenly, he gets this weird little smirk on his face and says ""actually, Let me give you a glass of THIS wine."" It was an unopened bottle and he pours me a glass. 

I KNOW I need to stay away from him, so please do not lecture me on this. I know that the curiosity thing lands people 6 feet under. I know it. It's like he KNOWS that I know what he is thinking.

Old Hollywood celebs who are dating women less than half their age prove the point and are usually met with a reaction of barely hidden envy (by men) or moral outrage (by women).

Yet could it be that the dynamic is changing?  Inspired by an earlier post, the question whether it is ok for women to date younger comes back so OFTEN in this sub, and is always answered with overwhelming positive reponse from women:
- Dozens of women commenting they indeed date younger, often MUCH younger: 10 to 20 years and they love it.
- Many women confirming they are being hit on by young guys in their 20s
- Most women who date young say they see this mainly as casual, romance, sex but rarely for LTR

Online has made it a lot easier for 20 year olds to get in touch with 40 year olds and vice versa. In real life I dont meet college age people through friends, hobbies or even work, but on a dating app people of any age can just slide the age bracket up or down.

So has OLD become the great equalizer here? Men will still look for younger women, but unlike IRL, online they cannot reach or match with them unless younger women actively set their filter to (much) older men. And very few women do. Outside of Hollywood I personally dont know any guy in my friend or work circle who dates younger, at least not 10-20 years, perhaps 7-8 years max   but even in those cases they all met previously IRL, not online. Online most of my matches were always within 3 years up or down (even when I had filters set to much lower LOL). I believe on OLD it is much more rare for men to succesfully connect with younger women.

But for women it seems it has become both easier and more accepted to date younger. May be most women on OLD look for a relationship, bur for those who seek casual or sex there is no shortage of potential candidates of ANY age. Then why on earth would they NOT go for a 20-year younger, fit guy? I met quite a few women on OLD who were totally transparent to me that they were having casual sex or FWB with a much younger guy. Men would do the same if they could, but there is a lot more ""competiton"" on OLD for that. Of course if you want a relationship as a woman then OLD in general is more difficult.

Interested in getting the views of this sub on this topic:
- Do you feel there is still a negative stigma attached to women dating younger, or is it becoming more acceptable?
- Older men dating very young women - is this even still happening on OLD? How do people react?
- Is OLD revesing the trend and will we see more women but fewer men date young?",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,53843,public,self,Men dating younger versus women dating younger,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/op9q70/men_dating_younger_versus_women_dating_younger/,some_ads,7,False,628375fa-4425-11e9-9805-0e7c3aad8200,Discussion,0fbd3a04-26b1-11e9-8d4f-0e0410a403b6,dark,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought the entire thing was about getting to know people (or setting up a date) but - nothing.

One guy literally complimented me on filling in my profile so thoroughly but didn't follow up with any reciprocating information or asking anything other than how long I was on the site. The one question I asked him - there is a profile question ""would you read a book to your SO?"" And he answered ""a cook book"" - so I asked which cook book, and he replied ""you decide"". He sounded witty in his profile, but the conversation is just ""meh"". 

The horn dog (sorry guys, but he's not even hiding it) who just wants to get I to my pants is more fun to chat with than this. I'm actually tempted, because he sounds like a good time. But I am sort of looking for a mental connection too.

I'm not a people person/great communicator myself, so all this effort leaves me exhausted. And I wonder if the ice is just a bit thicker, and I need to chisel away at it a bit more, or if they're just not compatible to my style of communication and I should save my energy for different prospects.

Well, in my experience, being so excessively touchy on the 1st date is a bit off putting and I feel unfair towards the girl. So, I came up with a new way that I have found to be quite successful: I ask her what her comfort zone is throughout the date

I have found my last 2 dates very successful. These are the key steps  
1. **I keep the first dates short:** 1 hour. We get coffee, and later go to a park before I walk her to the subway.   
\*Note: I act totally normal. I don't try ""kino"" unless it's natural. No stress on breaking any touch barrier. I just am respectfully getting to know her.

  
2. **I find a bench:** When sitting down, I will exaggerate sitting far away \[due to covid\], but I also ask to make sure if she would be comfortable sitting beside her. This is also a key gage of interest. If she says no, she saves face due to ""covid"" or simply being honest. If she says yes, this is an indication she may like me.  
3. **Before ending the date, I ask if it's ok to hold her hand while I walk her to the subway:** Maybe it's because we have been openly talking about comfort, but I usually go 1 step more and politely ask if I can grab her hand for a 2-3 minute walk.

It was a little awkward because she’s the Mom of my nephews fiancé, and we had an instant attraction to each other.  

  We met that night, and ended up making out in the kitchen lol.  We got busted by her daughters, and have kept in touch ever since lol.  

  We have a good vibe together and always have.  She’s the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever hung out with. 
  We texted and Snapchatted almost every day for a couple years.  

  We’ve kissed probably 20 times, and had sex twice. 

  The problem is, Ive always had a bad crush on her, and I’ve never been quite convinced that it’s mutual.  

  I know she likes me, but she doesn’t make that extra effort to reserve time for me.  

  I told her that I think we’d be a great match in person, and told her that I’m crushing on her.  She’s told me that she likes me also.   She’s never said much more than that.  

  We’ve both dated other people while we’ve known each other, but it didn’t last.   I really don’t know how to proceed.   I’m more comfortable with this woman than any others I’ve met.   She’s beautiful so she constantly getting hit on.   

  I feel like she’s putting me in the friend zone.   I’m a single Dad, and I’m not in a huge hurry to get serious anyway, so I guess it’s fine.  I’d really rather just be somewhat casual, but not see anyone else though.   It would be cool if she would want the same. 

  Should I tell her this?   I feel like if I put too much pressure on her she might pull away.  I suck at being single.  I think she might also be scared of seriously dating the uncle of her daughters fiancé.

I’m 47F. Was married &gt; 20 years. Needless to say, I don’t have a lot of experience to begin with and it’s a whole new dating world. I don’t think I know how to navigate it at all. 
Context: I’ve been communicating quite a bit with a guy lately. We’ve only been on one casual date but have been talking or texting every day since which is very unusual for me. We finally landed on a second date where I would go to his place for dinner on Sunday (tomorrow) - he wants to cook. Yesterday was incredibly busy. I wasn’t responding to texts or calls  all day. When I called him at the end of the day there was definitely tension, despite the fact that I addressed my tardiness and he supposedly understood. Later I checked in by text before bed and he said he’s bothered but will get over it. I asked if we should check in before I come for dinner on Sunday just to make sure the air is clear so we can have a pleasant evening.  He responds that “it’s fine as of now but (he’ll) let me know if something changes.” Obviously that response doesn’t sit well with me. So I’m supposed to sit around and wait till he lets me know if he needs a raincheck? It’s extra awkward because he’s supposedly hosting me as a guest in his home. I said it’s totally okay if he needs that time but I kinda need to know what my schedule is. There’s no rush to date #2, so maybe we take a raincheck / reschedule for now?  He responds that if I don’t want to see him I can just say so. He said it’s fine already and isn’t going to beg. I don’t know about you but that’s not how I typically make someone feel welcome. I haven’t responded yet as I just saw the new response but obviously it’s too awkward for me to go over now. 

So I’m gathering the following trends and am just stumped. I’m not saying guys should have to do all the work by any means, but it feels like we have to shoulder all the burden of engagement and not even have the pleasure of feeling wanted?:

- Guys prefer the girl make the first move. Incredibly hard for many Gen X women, but fine.

- Guys prefer it if the girl ask him out. If not, the girl needs to make sure the guy KNOWS she’s interested in order for him to bother approaching. 

- Guys won’t make it obvious he really wants to spend time with a girl. If she wasn’t to hang out with him she needs to let him know. He’s not about to beg for her attention. 

- Guys shouldn’t compliment a women too much.  She’ll either get a big head or think you’re objectifying her. How sad. 

Well I’m not shamed to admit I miss the days when as a woman I would feel wanted, desired and sometimes courted a little.

Every decision I've made in my life, was either in pursuit of romance or out of love for my partner. 

For whatever reason I settled down with a LL and low-intimacy partner, and for whatever reason I allowed myself to be in a marriage for 25 years with very little romance, intimacy or sex.

By some miracle, my wife cast me out last year so that she could pursue a different life without me, and although I am resentful of the way she treated me at the end, and surprised I allowed myself to be with a intimacy-challenged person for so long, I was so relieved to be free to live my own life. 

I didn't think there was a romantic match for me, and wasn't sure I'd be ready to date again for a very very long time, but for a variety of reasons jumped on the dating trail sooner than expected. 

Eventually I met the most loving person (53HLF). Like me, she loves romance, touch, kissing and making love. Like me, she believes in being kind to your partner, of trying to do little things for them in the name of love and romance. And I am just so happy with her.

This morning I woke up early, and was working when she called me back to bed. We held each other and talked for awhile, then I started gently caressing her. She moaned, said that felt so very nice, and for the next 15 minutes I just caressed her until she fell back asleep. 

So much of me feels sad that I didn't meet my SO when I was in my 20s. Such a life of love and tenderness we would have had. But more than that, I'm just so grateful we found each other in our 50s, after we'd given up hope of finding a romantic partner who liked romance as much as each of us did. 

So many romance stories focus on young people falling in love. But what about people like us, who are older, on our second or third go-round, and have given up on finding true romantic love, and then like buying a winning million dollar lottery ticket suddenly the unbelievable happens -- we find someone like us, and fall head-over-heels in love, and discover that feeling is just as magical at age 52 as it is at age 25. Maybe more so, because we've had enough life experience to know there are very few fairy tales out there.

Anyway, I'm feeling so grateful this morning, that I found my romantic SO at age 52. Here is wish you find your match, too (note: not everyone wants the same thing -- e.g. my ex would do well to find someone who wants occasional/rare sex and is intellectual and makes a million dollars a year; that's not a personality flaw, it's just what she wants; her flaw was in how she pushed me and treated me those last years of our marriage).",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,54027,public,self,So Grateful I Found Love At 52,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oqsxwn/so_grateful_i_found_love_at_52/,some_ads,7,False,e06d24a4-275e-11e9-9b74-0e6a6c05416c,Casual Conversation,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So…. I 35F have been online dating someone (45M) in England since March 2021. I haven’t met them yet, but we have made plans to meet September. I live in the West Coast of the U.S. 

I thought it would be a good idea for me to focus my attention on 1 person 3 weeks after talking with him because…

1. I heard a rumor online that dating culture in the UK has people dating / talking to 1
 person at a time. I was getting a good vibe from him around March and April 2021, and it didn’t feel right to continue online/ in
Person date or talk to other guys when I’m mostly interested in the one (long distance UK guy).

2. I thought online dating someone monogamously would keep me from getting too latched on and prevent from being too codependent

Anyway, it will be 5 months of online dating in a few weeks.

He has been texting me every or every other day and I try to text everyday. The last time we spoke on the phone was about 3 weeks ago. We use something like line/kakao/Skype/WhatsApp. After the first 2 weeks, I tried calling about 1x a week. No
Pick up.

He said he usually looks away from his phone when he is off because it’s connected to work or family group chats thru whatsapp. He said he has also been feeling super tired from work, or work has been extra busy, or he’s over slept for work, also has mentioned health issues. Etc etc. 

I know we haven’t had an official title or anything, it has been a mutual assumption that we are just talking to each other only and no others.

I just feel like people would make time when they really want to.

Once in a while we joke/ talk about what it would be like to be married. 

I’m just needing more. I sent him a message Friday night trying to come off as light but also asked him finally.. why is he talking to me, are we in a relationship and knowing what it is would help make sense for me to catch feelings when we haven’t spoken on the phone for 3 weeks.

I’m just feeling really down and rejected…

Before this I was in a brief relationship that was a train wreck (other person was unstable). And a long relationship before that.

All I want to know is that this current guy I still
Interested. If he isn’t, I’m not sure what to do… I’m turned off by the idea Of starting over superficial small Talk with a slew of new faces on apps. I would rather wait it out painstakingly with this guy who seems like he is slowly ghosting me. 

I don’t know what to do and I just feel like shit. Moments like this also tear up some scars from the long relationship I had (ended over a year ago). 

I think I might also be sexually frustrated. I haven’t had sex since January. 

Words of advice/ encouragement are appreciated.

Tl;dr:
I am 35F (and have a lot going for me, could easily get dates but choose not to) I chose to be faithful and loyal to someone 45M I had never met in person but had made long standing plans to meet in person this Fall.

Opinions on this.
The story behind my question at the bottom...
Dating a guy for 6 months. It’s great until he unexpectedly pulls and go silent and needs space. All of a sudden I am having to adjust with no warning from 🌶 to really distant. Not ghosting. He doesn’t give me heads up when he is dealing with his emotions (not about me but life circumstances) leaves me confused. I finally said to him I wanted to know so I knew it had nothing to do with me and then he can take the time he needs. That landed us in an argument and my flight or fight mode kicked in. I got annoyed he got annoyed and this has happened before. We are still trying to get to know each other at this point. I am traveling a lot so time spend is not a lot. He then went on to say he couldn’t sustain this As he couldn’t give me what I need when I won’t give him the space he was asking for. True I didn’t back off cause I wanted him to acknowledge to meet me half way. We had been through it one time before where I clearly stated my needs. 

I felt he broke it off and I said okay - if that’s what you want we shouldn’t waste each other’s time. But told him I was hurt by the decision. Then I deleted him from Instagram (I felt blind sided and did a drastic thing). Then he proceed to keep the convo and ended up saying we could talk about it when his daughter was back home with the mom. That’s before he realized I had removed him. The next day he had deleted me off Facebook which I rarely use. Three days later (no contact) he said it was infantile and extreme how I was acting and that he wasn’t doing this again and said good luck with everything. He had in the past warned me that that behavior for him is a red flag. I did it one time earlier in the beginning after a few dates because he flaked on me and I literally told him to shove it. We got passed it and 95% of the time he has been great and consistent and stepping up in tempo. And then this. 
Question:
Why is someone so triggered by that?? I am baffled. 
Besides the fact it was a little of an overreaction but he knew I was 
Hurt. I replied to that with a little explaining a little note to how he feels he can self protect his way but there’s no space for me to do it and wished him love and light in his life. 

Personally I would understand my reaction when you’re dealing with someone who’s hurt.
