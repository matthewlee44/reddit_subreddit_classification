2,q3wbyq,1633694589,Visiting the city of my love interest--Am I creepy?,"Hi.

So I (F) was talking to this guy for a solid 2 months straight. He lives in another state but we were supposed to meet up in between when we encountered some miscommunications and any plans to meet fell through. 

I wanted to meet him so badly that I decided to go straight to his city myself--but I didn't tell him that's why I was there. I solo visit cities and love to explore anyway, and I did make that a large part of my trip there. I'd describe the trip as him being my intention, but my expectations for meeting him were low.  In fact, I did a couple things by myself and didn't reach out to him asking to hang out. I let him reach out to me, and he did, and we had a fun time in which we spent half the day together and the other half I explored the city on my own which was fun.

The next day, I asked if I could leave my dog at his place (I'd never been before) because I had to check out of my hotel room by 11 but wasn't done exploring his city. He also indicated that he wanted to meet up that day. He agreed and gave me his address. When I left my dog with him, he told me he was busy that morning but we could hang out later. No problem--I went and explored the city some more by myself for a couple hours. 

I came back to his place and asked if he wanted to go anywhere. He didn't indicate that he did, but it wasn't creepy on his part to want to hang around his place either. I enjoyed spending time with him so much, even just chatting, that I just kind of hung around and he didn't seem to have a problem with that. Even after I left his city and went back home, he said he didn't have any issues with me hanging around for most of the day until it was time for me to go.

Basically, I went there with a laissez-faire attitude but my intention behind the trip was still to see him in person finally, even if for coffee, while also taking time for myself to explore. I would have been disheartened if he didn't want to meet up but it would have been clear that he didn't care about me after all and it wouldn't have been a wasted trip.

3,q3wu0a,1633696492,Should I date someone whose divorce isn’t final?,"Long story short: a married guy (39 M) I’ve (36 F) only been friends with through social media with for about 5-6 years asked for my number this past January. We’ve never met in real life, but he’s always seemed kind and cool from me our public interactions on Twitter. Over the years through Twitter and FB I’ve seen him get engaged, married, and have children. 
So when he asked for my number a few months ago I was blindsided bc as far as I know he was married. He explained that he was separated from his wife who had recently cheated on him. He expressed how interesting and nice he’d always felt I was and assured me that his marriage was over. I in turn told him that I wasn’t comfortable exchanging numbers with a man who ultimately is still married. I deleted all my social media shortly after in January and hadn’t heard from him since. 
Fast forward to two months ago, and he found me on match.com and reached out to say hi. He asked to take me out and exchange numbers and I agreed. We went out yesterday and I learned that the divorce isn’t final. It seems like his wife is the culprit with destroying the marriage but obviously there are always two sides to every story. They have three children. I’ve never dated a man with children or a divorcée, so that is why I assumed that by the time he msgd me on match that his divorce was final. I assumed things were finalized bc he had created an actual dating profile with the intention to date. 
He’s already expressed that he wants to see himself with me and date toward a serious relationship. He seems like a very nice and down to earth person, but I’m strongly thinking of turning him down and ending communication bc he still is married. However, the advice I’ve gotten from friends is quite different. I’ve been told by the few people I’ve reached out to that all divorces are different and are most times held up due to financial burdens married people may be facing. They’ve told me that I’m being too idealistic in a very gray world. So that is why I would like to get unbiased feedback from people outside of my friend group that aren’t distracted by their strong want and desire for me to finally be able to go on double dates with them smh lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3wu0a/should_i_date_someone_whose_divorce_isnt_final/

12,q3xji5,1633698933,A few harsh truths about dating I’d love to impart upon anyone who listens.,"
&gt; No matter how great your personality is, no ones going to want someone who doesn’t take care of they find physically repulsive

As much as people here will say looks don’t matter, being attractive doesn’t make a difference, and that being ugly isn’t that big of a deal. Looks matter. A lot. If the person doesn’t find you attractive it’s going to be a lot harder to get them to like you. If the person finds you ugly? You’re SOL buddy. 

Take care of your appearance. Luckily unless you’re ugly like myself, you can easily go from plain to good looking just by putting effort. Eat right , if you’re fat lose weight, work out. Take care of your hygiene, dress good, it’ll help so much.

&gt; There is a chance that you will die alone. Never knowing love, a virgin, by yourself.

This is a sad but true reality. A lot of dating is simply luck. Meeting the right people at the right time in the right place. There’s simply a chance it won’t happen. Then what are you to do? Never once be happy, always craving what you won’t have? 

Of course not. Learn to be happy by yourself. Accept that you might be alone and find satisfaction in yourself so you don’t end up depressed if you never find someone.

&gt;The friend zone doesn’t exist, it just didn’t like her as a person and tried to weasel your way into her pants through friendship.

I’ll be short with this one. She didn’t friend zone you. She wanted to be friends with her, you made her think you wanted to be friends with her. She didn’t want a relationship that’s all that happened. She’s not the bad guy. End of story.

&gt; Your sexual history matters especially if your a woman.

In a perfect world it wouldn’t. But the world isn’t perfect. Most guys care because we’re insecure. I’ll fully admit I’m too insecure to be with a woman with a history. I’d prefer to be with a woman that doesn’t have a bunch of guys to compare me with. Especially if she had a lot of casual sex. We all know what the guys that typically have casual sex look like and I really don’t want to be compared to that because I know I will not measure up.

&gt;Lastly, if you’re a guy, you need to be better than average.

I don’t think I need to elaborate much on this. Being average as a guy isn’t enough. You need to stand out. Average is mediocre for men. It’s not good enough. Do what you can.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3xji5/a_few_harsh_truths_about_dating_id_love_to_impart/

15,q3xp4b,1633699465,How can I(M25) be less obsessive over someone?,"FIRST HALF IS QUESTION; SECOND HALF IS CONTEXT 

I have had a very unsuccessful dating life this past year (though, I wouldn't exactly describe the rest of my dating life as ""successful"" either) and after a lot of soul searching, I have pinpointed a big reason for that is because I am very intense. I fall hard and fall quick, and I expect a lot from people very early on. I'm working on it. Unfortunately, I'm not there yet which is a problem because now there is a potential love interest. 

Now, when I lay out all of the facts (I will list them shortly) and look at the situation objectively, everything leads to her being interested but that paranoia is nawing at the back of my head and I am filled with guestions and doubt on a daily basis. And yes, I think about her every day which seems like a disporportionate amount of deserved attention for the amount of time she has had in my life. I have a history of dates never actually happening because of, or what I can only assume it to be, having too high of expectations too early. Aka, I REALLY hate being left on read. I understand that this is desperate and obsessive behavior which is a problem that needs fixed. What I can't seem to figure out is how to kick this habit. What are some methods to have less obsessive tendencies? (This covers the more general version of my question. The rest of the post will be dedicated to the details of my current situation if you are curious to know more) 

I met this woman, let's call her M, in a park because she has a cute puppy and I wanted to pet him. We got to talking but we were both interested in other people so I ignored the urge to make a move. She grabbed my number and we texted platonically inconsistently a couple of times after. Nothing crazy. We hung out randomly a month later and had a nice time. Hung out again a month later on a whim and had a nice time. The difference this time was, we were both available and I was head over heels the entire time and being the most socially awkward version of myself. M was saying a lot of things that could probably be seen as obvious hints but I was intentionally ignoring them because I didn't want to ruin a potential friendship (again). Thankfully, I didn't keep up with this plan because I lost all willpower when we were pationately hugging each other goodbye. We already had a plan to hang out again so I just asked her if she wanted to make our next meet-up a date and she said yes without hesitation. We haven't had a full conversation since the last we hung out and our date isn't for another 4 days. But the reason why we haven't been talking a lot is because she is a very busy woman (has been since I've known her so infrequent/late texts are normal) and she's on vacation right now. What makes me really uncomfortable with myself is that it's only been a week since last I saw her. I literally thought it had been almost a month before I looked though our texts while writing this post. No exaggeration, I was upset she wasn't texting me more and question our potential future (WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ON AN OFFICIAL DATE). I want to get this emotion in check but, more importantly, I really don't want to ruin this nice thing I have going. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Sometimes they even forget my name after multiple meetings (like what?). Often I feel like a commodity in the dating market - as if even mildly attractive women have such an abundance of good options that I'm just another dude they could get at their nearest supermarket/gas station.

Help!

hello everyone, I need some advice 

I met a boy online who lives in a different state, we kinda rushed into dating after barely knowing each other, we were dating even though we had only communicated through text, I had never called him, FaceTimed him, etc. so I guess you could say we were e-dating

We dated for two weeks and then broke up, while we were dating though it was barely a relationship (we used to text and that was it) once we broke up I felt extremely insecure and a few days after our breakup I turned to this dating app for validation (not for romance but just bc I liked the compliments) 

Two weeks later my ex had asked to get back together, I was super hesitant to say yes as I felt like I was not ready for a relationship, also he seemed like he was not serious at all (during our relationship I had asked to call him but he had cancelled on me) he had also put me and his girl friends on the same level which I thought was messed up, overall I was super insecure but he convinced me to get back together with him

Once we had got back together I went to deactivate my dating profile and noticed I had a new match and message that read “you’re beautiful” and I responded saying “aw thank you” to the message, the guy had also asked for my snap and I gave it to him, I never flirted with the dating profile boy and I never wanted anything with him, we probably had three very short convos max and none of them were flirty, we were talking more as friends, I blocked him after a few days bc he kept snapping me and I didn’t wanna lead him on

I never thought anything of this encounter I had with the dating profile boy as I never wanted anything with him and my bf and me were not serious at all at the time (we also had not discussed any boundaries at the time (what we think is wrong/right)) 

Things were going extremely well with my bf, I fell in love with him, we started getting serious (calling everyday, talking all the time) 

Three months later and I suddenly feel extremely guilty for responding to the other boy on the dating app, although I NEVER flirted with him, I know I shouldn’t have responded at all and should have just ignored the message. 

Why do I feel so guilty now when at the time I felt I was doing nothing wrong? What should I do now to stop the guilt? I feel like if I tell my bf now he would be extremely upset since I’m telling him about it three months later? 

Also I would like to mention that my bf flirted with another girl while we were dating and things were serious so he is not completely innocent either

20,q3yabz,1633701449,Ghosting is the ultimate form of gaslighting in relationships,"Here's my story real quick, for context: 36M, not much luck dating my entire adult life.  Been on plenty of dates, had my fair share of experiences, to be clear.  But I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer than 3 months since I was 21.  The last two women I've dated...man, they really got to me. 

The first one, we met on Tinder and hit it off well, met up fairly quickly and had constant conversations going.  Great chemistry, the likes of which I hadn't felt in years.  Good vibes, positive, uplifting on both ends.  Felt like teamwork, which is an ideal marker for me.  It was consistent for about 2 months, then poof.  Nothing.  I figured she just needed some space, so I gave it to her.  No questions asked.  She eventually talked to me again, and it was a complete 180 in her behavior.  Went from something that could be seen as the beginning of love, to something that could only be interpreted as hate.  Out of nowhere, and without justification, she spewed vitriol, made accusations about me that were totally ungrounded in reality, insulted me to my very core, then left.

The most recent was a long distance thing.  We'd been friends for a few years, through an online D&amp;D group (roll20).  We used to stay on voice chat after sessions and chat all night, and then she disappeared for about a year.  She came back, and it turned out she had gone through some heavy shit.  We started talking again, and it was a mutual thing, we both began to initiate something more than just friends.  We would plan ""internet dates"", where we'd meet up at a certain time to play games and talk, or stream a movie together, video chat, or just hop on the phone til 5am.  We talked about building a future together.  About seeing each other in person, and what needed to happen in order for that.  We were really building something special - again, as above, it was positive, uplifting, respectful, hopeful, and *mutual*.  At the beginning of September, she encountered a situation.  She went silent on all forms of communication for a week, then finally came back to tell me what had happened.  Her home was broken into while she was home.  She was beaten to injury.  Her phone and computer were broken.  I was there for her as much as I could be, and it motivated me to close the physical gap ASAP.  Until we got to a point about 3.5 weeks ago, where I told her I was ready when she was, the only thing I had to do was buy a plane ticket.  She was excited.  The next morning, she sent me a message still expressing excitement over it.  I missed her message and responded an hour later.  It's been almost a month.  I don't know if the idea of meeting scared her, or if something terrible happened again, or something else.  None of my messages have even been opened since that last morning.

It doesn't feel right, given our history, to just write everything off and move on.  But for weeks I've been in a constant state of limbo, not knowing if she's safe and healthy, not knowing how to feel...I wake up every morning with a different set of emotions to process through, and none of it is good.  I feel heartbroken, I feel betrayed, I feel angry, I feel depressed.  And honestly none of it is directed at her, as much as her disappearance.  It just doesn't add up.  I've tried as much as I can to find information, short of crossing lines into ""privacy concern"" territory.  I want to remain as respectful as I can, but I need something to go on.  Needless to say, all attempts have returned nothing.  Every few days, I send a message or leave a voicemail.  Not anything too clingy or desperate.  But just letting her know I'm thinking about her and I hope she's okay...while not too far in the back of my mind I'm worried about her being dead in a ditch somewhere.

This shit has me feeling crazy at times.  I'm questioning everything about myself, about all my relationships, about everything I've done with my life.  But there's a part of me that knows this has little to do with me, and has more to do with her.  It just doesn't help, knowing that.  But I want to prove to her that I can be patient and consistent despite the turmoil...that I have the emotional capacity to process through all this.  She's disappeared before...she's always come back.  But not knowing how long to keep my heart on hold...man that is difficult.

I wanted to end this post with a diatribe about how disrespectful, inconsiderate, and cowardly the act of ghosting is.  I wanted to make the point that is one of the most existentially ""gaslighting"" things a person can do in a relationship.  And to an extent, it is true.  But more than anything...it hurts, and if you care enough, it keeps you in a sort of stasis of emotional stress for an indefinite amount of time.  It is hell.

I just need her to communicate.  Even if it's a quick ""I'm okay, but we're over"".  Or an ""I'm not okay, please be patient"".  I need to know how I should feel.  Not knowing how to feel is a terrible torture.

23,q3ykus,1633702374,Dating story with some needed advice,"This is a story about my last long term relationship. I was 22 years old and about to graduate from undergrad and inter a graduate program. During the interviews for acceptance, a lady who would be my girlfriend saw me. We never spoke. I didn't know this until two months later. I am a really talkative person so I assumed we did. A couple days later, she sent me a friend request and we began talking. Eventually, we went out and started dating. She came to my holidays which I was not to going to invite her to, but she invited herself. As time went on, we were both getting ready for the graduate school and decided to live together. The graduate school was in my hometown and I wanted to move out of my parent's house. I was apprehensive to moving in with her, but she thought it would work. As things moved forward, I started to feel like I was responsible for cleaning the place. If I did not it would become extremely messy. She decided to buy a bunny, to my protest, which made things worse. 
Eventually, we started school. I was passing, but started hating what I was going into. When we first started dating, she told me that she was attracted to me going into the same field as her. It was one of the first things we talked about so I ended up staying this time. As things got worse at the school, the teachers, began yelling at the class. Eventually, this led to a friend of mine for two years committing suicide. The months after this were a blur. I felt trapped in a bubble at this school. 
We made it to the holidays. My family wanted to take a trip to try and help me. We decided to go to LA and regretfully I invited my girlfriend. They covered most of her costs, but food and transport around the city. The trip went horrible. Anything family wanted to do she didn't. This ended with her convincing me to be late to a ball game I was excited to see with my brother and dad. I regret this deeply. 
When we got back, I spent time with her family. She made me the jester of their gatherings. She always pointed out every little thing I did different than them. 
School started back and after a month I quit.  I reconnected with my friends and things improved for me. Our relationship did the opposite. I was in favor of her chasing her career, but I started to ask if she would try to do her residency in two years from now in an area we both could finish our schooling. She told me I could come with her if I wanted to, but never said whe would make sacrifices for me. She became a lot colder to me after this. When we were together she would sit on her phone, sex became less frequent and more uniform, and she quit showing physical love, which was my love style. 
After months like this, she pulls me into a therapy session I thought was about her. This turned out to be couples therapy with the therapist telling me I care too much. I became more clingy after this, trying to kill fire with gasoline. I only became more nervous when she began telling me her dad was calling me a jackass. I wish I had ended things there. This made me more insecure I gained a 100lbs during this time. I was previously at 200lb, I have lost most of the weight now. I began to nervously ask her if we were okay. I again became really clingy. My grandfather ,who I had a really close relationship with became sick. She was on rotations during this time, but was coming back on the weekends to sleep all day.  Eventually, my grandfather was moved to a hospital where he contracted covid. My dad and aunt also contracted it from him. He lasted a little over a week and then passed away. This was devastating to me. I went to visit my grandmother. I wore a mask and washed my hands after entering her house. My father had recovered from covid and had visited her a hour earlier. My girlfriend was made it touched the same doorknob as him. She  worked in a pharmacy with many people coming in and out, but apparently this was way worse. She decided to stay at her aunts and go shopping at the mall and thrift stores. I blew up on her. We had a really bad fight. I said some mean things. I was a mess at the time. She accused me of not caring for my grandfather and a day later we broke up on the phone. We never spoke after this. Over the relationship, I had spent most of my savings on trips she had wanted to go on and meals she wanted. She never offered to split bills and expected me to cover her shopping sometimes. She did split trips with me. I dated a friend after this, but I was just used to make her ex jealous. So first off was I in the wrong in this relationship? She always told me I was the problem.

30,q3z23y,1633703828,"Men, stop simping, it's making men like me worse off.","Women are constantly judging me and picking literally any man (especially lesser men) over me. 
What do I mean by lesser men? Men who are clingy, men who are needy, men who are scrawny, men who are players, men who are drug abusers, men who choose not to cook or clean for themselves be it from upbringing or enforcing antiquated gender roles, men who are unemployable, men whose only hobby is video games, men who are misogynistic, men who are effeminate, men who have no drive, men who cannot budget...I can go on and on about men who women have complained to me about. 
And frankly, I get it. I get why they choose them over me. I don't approach people in general let alone women I'm interested in. And this has led me to a life of sexual repression that I only see as ending in violent rage, which is why I take my loathing of society out in my taekwondo training. 
That being said. I am clearly a mess that women have no business being with, because my anger at not getting laid or being desired has been deemed a larger disqualifier than any of the traits I listed above...I say all that to vent, but thats not the point of this.......I've noticed an overabundance of posts and comments talking about how awful, one sided, and unbalanced the dating world is in women's favor. I know it, you know it. Everyone who is anyone capable of critical thinking understands that sex, love and affection are handed out freely to women whereas we as men have to be ""the best option"" for a woman to even consider us. (I know a lot of women and some men like to argue this point. You're wrong.)
.......I would suggest to you that one of the largest creators of men's miseries in the dating world are men themselves. But not all men, the man who are doing the most damage are the players, the rapists, the neckbeards, and the simps. We all are aware of the damages that the players and rapists play, and the neckbeards no one wants to date. But I don't think enough people are actually considering the damage that simps are doing and I'd like to talk about that now...... in my opinion one of the greatest things people get from a relationship is emotional validation. It used to be that women had to enter monogamous relationships to get access to the emotional validation from a man. But now with the onset of social media and dating apps women now have access to this emotional validation at anytime she wishes, and is no longer required to be monogamous to attain said validation. This causes a thirst so to speak in the mail dating pool a desperation that forces their hand into offering emotional validation unwarranted. This causes a cyclical circumstance in which women become inundated with emotional validation, to the point that they become desensitized to it, which leads to more and more men acting more and more desperate and handily offering said validation, which leads to more and more women becoming more and more desensitized causing more and more men to resort to simping. Do you see the problem here? Women, just as you are not relegated to offering sex to a man that you deem Unworthy of you, men need to stop offering emotional validation to women they deem Unworthy of them. I know that a lot of people don't like hearing things like that and that's fine. But as someone who was rejected by every woman he ever wanted until he was 27 years old that bitterness led me to take a critical look at the way men and women operate. What I have found is that men who are assertive, show sexual intent, while not offering emotional validation is the key formula to any form of romantic / sexual interaction with a woman. 
And that makes sense, a lot of women prefer to be with a man that has plenty of options but chose her over his other options. Men who offer unwarranted emotional validation lift the veneer from their Intentions by self-sabotaging. I have learned this the hard way. Buy simping, men offer women unwarranted emotional validation, get nothing reciprocated for their efforts, and perpetuate a cycle that is desensitizing women, making men weaker as a result, and ultimately leading to the complete dissolution of inter-gender Dynamics as evidenced by the existence of the incels or the female dating strategy folks. Men, I understand that women are frustrating, possibly even more than you do. But that is no excuse for you to indulge in misogyny, or even worse, indulge in simpdom.

She usually sends them after the transaction and i hate that.

47,q414b5,1633710078,One week since breakup and still extremely resentful of her,"I know it’s gonna take more than one week but of all people I’ve dated, I’ve never felt so played and like the relationship was one sided. Since the day we met, she made it clear she didn’t feel respected by previous partners and felt used and I made it a point to be as respectful and kind as I could possibly be. Nevertheless, by the third date she would give me these just terrible, graphic details of her sexual past that I felt like was common courtesy that you don’t do that in a relationship. In past relationships we’d touch on it briefly and move on but she kept talking about other dudes she blew before me. Even after telling her it made me feel insecure she would just keep doing it. 

Well we broke up over that. Her dealbreaker was that even when she “explains it” I don’t hear her. Like understand maybe you didn’t feel respected by these people but I feel disrespected by you for bringing it up even after I said I didn’t like it. I would make dinner for her everytime she came over, I’d perform oral on her for 15-20m at a time knowing she loved it, I’d buy her little presents and do what I could to make her feel cared for finally. She did none of that for me. She’d tell me all the oral she used to give and wouldn’t spend more than 3 minutes at a time on me. Made me feel so stupid and I cannot believe her dealbreaker is that she needs to keep being able to talk about previous sexual experiences to me.

I know she won’t cause she doesn’t think she did anything wrong but Jesus I want a text from her so bad telling me she knows she was wrong. I just don’t understand how someone’s dealbreaker is to keep talking about your sexual past to your partner even when they say it hurts them.

48,q41ble,1633710681,Do I ask about the ex?,"Hi everyone I’m a 28F and matched with a 32M on a dating app a little over 3 weeks ago. We’ve had 2 dates since then and have another one planned for tomorrow. We’ve spoken pretty much every day since we matched. He’s been really kind to me and I can tell he’s putting in effort to get to know me. 


Yesterday, he told me he was meeting up with a friend and jokingly said he was worried he was going to get yelled at because he was supposed to walk away from a relationship a couple months ago and he didn’t. So he was basically waiting for the “I told you so” from his friend. I didn’t ask any questions as he changed the subject. 


For some reason, my mind immediately went to “I’m just a rebound.” When I know I don’t know the full story. I guess my question is, should I bring this up the next time I see him? On one hand, I feel like I don’t really have a right to this information as we’re still getting to know each other and haven’t established “what we are”. However, I don’t want to waste my time and energy on someone who is just using me to get over their ex. I also don’t want to scare him away by asking questions when really I just want to know where he’s coming from and if he has dealt with everything that comes from a break up, if he has the capacity to be dating right now, etc.

52,q420mt,1633712718,"Ex has Borderline Personality Disorder, has since gotten help - we started talking again (after a year) and feeling hesitant - any advice?","Hey y'all, first timer here

In 2020 I dated a girl with borderline personality disorder (then, undiagnosed) who wasn't making the effort to get help for their issues. We were together for 4 months &amp; our highs were very high, but our lows were very low. It was emotionally abusive when her BPD kicked in, but I've since come to terms with that trauma. Shortly before we broke up, she tried killing herself and failed. I still cared for her, but understood she was detrimental to my mental stability. We met up one last time (&amp; ended up having sex), then parted ways.

A year has since passed and I've done a lot of growing - I feel very in control of my life and on top of what I have going on. While I was swiping on tinder last night, her &amp; I happened to match which definitely stirred up some old anxiety/discomfort.

We've started talking again and she seems like she's taking more initiative in proactively caring for her mental health &amp; making better life choices (both for herself &amp; how she interacts with people).

We've both established that we're not looking to rush into any romance and genuinely did get along with the exceptions of her BPD flare ups - so we'r be open to re-testing the waters and just enjoying some time together without any clear end goals in mind.

My thoughts are that although people can change, the dynamic between two people often stays the same (not in all cases, but in some) - seeing as this persons mental health was the biggest factor in any negative experiences we've had and they've since sought help to better care for themselves in that capacity - then it may be worth revisiting (very very slowly) to see if things feel (or at least momentarily enjoyed). I feel really conflicted, but ultimately open to seeing how things go and so I'm turning to reddit to further flesh out this situation before I make any firm decisions.

Would love to get some thoughts - thanks &amp; happy friday!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q420mt/ex_has_borderline_personality_disorder_has_since/

Solution? Stop having sex with men you don’t know so soon???

I would also ghost you, because there’s nothing to explore anymore when you already gave everything so EASILY. 

I’m also tired of men complaining about being the one having to make the first move… “It gives me anxiety” they say. 

You’re just WEAK. Imagine you being a f adult, AFRAID of a “no” from a girl. Why so WEAK?

I've (F30) been on the dating apps for about a year (Hinge, Bumble, Tinder). The one consistent problem I run into is men who drink a lot. I have no problem with an occasional drink but I personally don't want to date someone that drinks every night after work or goes to the bar every weekend. I'm very into fitness, the gym, working out and healthy living. So naturally, I look for men that are similar and even then, it's still a big problem. I just find it extremely unattractive and it's made dating extremely difficult. Does anyone else experience this or do I just have bad luck? I'm at a loss.

For example, the last guy I dated said he wasn't a big drinker. Yet, every activity we did had to involve alcohol. Going hiking or boating? Better pack a cooler full of booze. Going to a restaurant or movie theater? Have to go to one that serves alcohol. The list goes on.

I felt bad because I had already spoken at length with him all week on what I thought was a deeper personal level, and I know I would be let down myself if come time to meet someone, they flaked (having been flaked on a lot lately, I know that feeling, but at least I could give him an honest reason.) After I told him, he reacted better than I thought. He asked if I wanted to be friends still, but the part that really got me is how he said he has a friend 6 states over that he met through Bumble who he regularly video chats with still, so it was no big deal.

At this moment, I realized that my gut feeling about him being way more extroverted than me was probably right, and the reason this guy made connecting so easy is because he is the type of person who is social with everyone.

Facial hair, deep voice, masculine, you can see where I’m going. Average looking man. Would you date that? And I’ll throw in some surgeries, since that seems to be a main influencing point. Just top surgery, no genital reconstruction surgery.

84,q44pxc,1633720681,I like him and I feel like he knows it. I feel uncomfortable and want to end the friendship.,"So I have a friend (M27) from college who I've (F24) had a crush on for some time now. There's a vibe in the air every time we hang out, and my feeling is that he knows that I'm into him.

He recently sent me a text thanking me for getting him some tickets and he used a heart emoji at the end. I answered back with a heart emoji. Which feels like a really bad move from my side.

And now I'm here panicking, because what woman sends heart emojis to their male friend unless she's interested in him? And now I'm afraid he kind of knows I'm into him. 

I want to end the friendship and never contact him again. I've made a fool of myself. Can someone help me out of this mess?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q44pxc/i_like_him_and_i_feel_like_he_knows_it_i_feel/
85,q45157,1633721621,"Threes a party, fours a crowd.","My S/O and I are expecting our first child together! We live in a different state than our family which means that if we do not travel to see them or vice versa they wouldn’t be able to see our baby. 

My step mother has already stepped up and said she would make the trip down here to be a support system for us as i lost my mother at a young age and my S/O mother isn’t able to maneuver around like she once was. 

My S/O mother is 64, and she has been through hell and back, she is a breast cancer survivor, she’s had a few attempts at heart surgery, and her legs are held together by bolts and screws. 

She is the sweetest lady i know and i know she cannot wait to see and love her grand child, the problem is it take two people to help her get up two steps due to her limited mobility and when she does she is so out of breath she needs oxygen. 
Another problem is me and my s/o live in a apartment right now while saving up to buy a house when our little one gets her, we unfortunately are located on the FOURTH floor, which is about 40 or so steps. 

His mother insists that she be here for the birth and to help with our little one but it’s just not feasible. She won’t be able to get up all of those steps let alone down then when it’s time for us to go to the hospital, and on top of that she needs a special type of bed to sleep in that she can move and adjust due to her issues. 
We only have one guest room which will be occupied by my step mother, my step mother offered to sleep on the couch but the guest room bed is to high for my S/O mother to get in and out of. 

She would just be in the way and it would be stressful for me as i would be trying to learn how to be a new mother. 
I don’t want to be rude but it’s just not going to work for her to come to us. 
I know my boyfriend wants his mother to be apart of the moment as would I but it would just be more work for us to try to take care of a newborn and his mother. 

I’ve tried to explain all of this to her and she still says she’s coming anyways. My S/O hasn’t said anything he just looks at me when I try to tell talk to him about it. 
I even told him that we could take a trip back home after our little one was a few months old because she still had to meet my father and my mothers side of the family. So of course his mom would meet her just not as soon as she got here. 

We are getting closer and closer to my due date and i don’t know what to do. I want to put my foot down but don’t want to be disrespectful.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q45157/threes_a_party_fours_a_crowd/
86,q4544g,1633721869,New to dating..advice?,"Hi everyone. I am a 24F who is new to the dating scene (reasons = strict parents, trauma past, insecure, was focused on having fun). I have been actively going on dates for which the most part I am enjoying.

This past week, I went on 3 dates with 3 different guys. I am going on a second date with the 1st guy but after the 2nd two dates I am a little confused about expectations/if I am doing something wrong.

Both of the dates with guy 2/3 were good. We had drinks or food, natural convo for the most part, and spent over 2 hours each. Both of the guys seemed to be interested as they would complement me frequently, verbalize they were having fun, find reasons to touch me, etc.

At the end of the dates, they typically walk me to my car and we hug/I say thank you. I honestly avoid eye contact at this point and head out my way. I don't know if guys expect to kiss on the 1st date??? But the past two guys have not texted me after the date? What am I doing wrong that they seem so interested in real life but not enough to get back to me? It's not even that I am 100% interested in them but it is making me a little self conscious that I doing something wrong.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4544g/new_to_datingadvice/

24m kissless virgin Autistic and wasn’t diagnosed until 16, I had 0 friend until I was 20, like I literally had never made a friend until then. As a child on top of autism I never got the chance to develop social skills at a time where it’s crucial you develop them then and there. It creates a cycle.

No one wants to be with the weird guy, so he gets less chances to learn, making them weirder until they’re too far gone.

I’ve been in therapy close to a decade trying to undo this but it can’t be undone fully. I’ve been told by multiple therapist I will a always be different to an extent, and that’s not attractive, the “just not always getting it.” Isn’t something women want to deal with.

I’ve made friends and I’m content with my social life in that regard. But I’m simply too unattractive on top of that to ever have someone find me attractive. I’m ugly, and 5’6

I’m hygienic, work out, put myself out there, tried all I can socially, but it’s all for nothing.

That and statistically women don’t want to date someone who society deems a child (if you havnt dated or had sex get at my age you’re a freak of nature.)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q456s8/what_can_i_even_do_at_this_stage/
