He literally doesn‚Äôt talk to any other girls in that class but me and we don‚Äôt even sit next to each other! This man went out of his way to talk to me.

This dude is like OBJECTIVELY good looking and could probably get any girl he wants. He‚Äôs tall, blonde hair, blue eyes, muscular, and tan. Literally looks like a male Hollister model.

He is a million times out of my league. Like BY FAR. I‚Äôm a short brunette Latina and am not really in great shape (I‚Äôm skinny but like skinny-fat if that makes sense lol). I barely wear makeup and most of the time look like shit when I show up to class. There are WAY hotter girls at my school.

6,ps4a4y,1632173324,He asked me to be his girlfriend but I dont know yet...,"So we have known each other for a really long time, we went to the same school until last year. We were always in the same class and got along pretty well, but we didn't really hang out or something like that. 

~ one month ago I asked him if we wanted to do something fun because we had not spoken for so long. Since then we have met 3 times. 3rd time was yesterday, we were there all day. Of course it crossed my mind many times that it could lead to something a bit more than friendship. I thought about that pretty often, but had no idea that he thought about that as well. He never really 'flirted' with me or anything.

So when we drove back home, there was a little silence and all of a sudden he asked me if I wanted a relationship with him. I was pretty shocked and told him that it was a bit too soon for me to say if I really wanted that. I like him and I feel really comfortable with him. We think the same about a lot of things and have a lot of the same interests. However I just don't know if I'm in love with him. I also don't know if im sexually attracted to him. I have never been someone to fall in love so fast, it takes a lot of time. I felt terrible after I told him that. I have no idea what to do. I really don't want to lose him. I just want to take things really slow and find out if I'm in love with him, but It feels unfair to keep him waiting. Or am I fooling myself for thinking that I can still fall in love with him?

After that I didn‚Äôt try online dating again until mid-August where I met this new guy

I just don‚Äôt want to be making the same mistakes :( I‚Äôm really into him but I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to get hurt again as I‚Äôm finding texting similarities between him and the guy from April.

There was a time when work was really slow, and he and I were the only employees at the time, and we were talking for about an hour straight. We were talking about the high schools that we went to, and he asked me what I like to do for fun. I gave him a couple of my hobbies, and he would say things like ""I like doing that too!"" or ""I need to do that more!""

Before, I would usually be the one coming up to him and asking him questions. They would be simple questions such as his weekend plans. However, I stopped because I didn't want to be the one always initiating the conversation. For the past few days, he's been the one approaching me and asking me questions about my weekend plans. While he does talk to other female coworkers, I'm the one he speaks to the most. Is it possible he's interested in me?

Another thing I forgot to mention is that there is a day where it is really slow, so there's only two or three workers for the entire day. I start early in the morning, and his shift always starts closer to noon. However, he comes in about 30 minutes to an hour after I come in and will be on his computer.

Not from the US. Also, sometimes I get anxiety when a stranger calls me, so I would need to work on feeling comfortable with giving out my info.

She‚Äôs just not my usual type, but i wouldn‚Äôt mind to have a FWB, and I‚Äôm just trying to see the best way to do that.

Im not sure what she‚Äôs looking for, but she‚Äôs been wanting to text everyday, she asked me to hangout this week, I told her the weekend would work better, and so I‚Äôm guessing she wouldn‚Äôt want something casual. On the other hand she sort of casually mentioned that she got out of something recently so I think maybe she would be open to something that‚Äôs not serious but I don‚Äôt just want to fuck and that‚Äôs it, which is why a FWB seems to be the right move. 

We‚Äôve made out a little bit, I‚Äôm guessing if I had my own place then it‚Äôd be easier to have sex, but we both live at home so I‚Äôm just curious how we could even have regular sex, although I have a big suv where I‚Äôve taken out the seats in the back and fooled around with girls. 

I asked her if she wanted to go to a bar and I‚Äôd invite my friends and my friend usually lets me crash at her place (it‚Äôs a female friend whose pretty nice), and that‚Äôs if she agrees to go home with me, which is of course not in my control.

And so the dilemma here is that I‚Äôm trying to not act boyfriendy, but at the same time I‚Äôm trying to not be too casual so that I don‚Äôt scared her away and sex isn‚Äôt even a top priority tbh, some regular physical affection would be nice and I‚Äôm still relatively inexperienced so I just want to explore things with somebody.

I was thinking maybe after our next date, maybe if we have sex or when we go out next, I could be like ‚Äúhey I just want to be upfront from the start and I‚Äôm not really looking for anything too serious but at the same time I‚Äôm not trying to be super casual,‚Äù and then ask her where her head is at and what she‚Äôs looking for. 

And so if I do this I run the risk of severing my chances of sex, and so I‚Äôm sort of just trying to go with the flow but I‚Äôm trying to not be a douche bag, but my selfishness is getting in the way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ps5o2e/how_to_establish_a_fwb_relationship/

Almost didn't swipe right on them for that reason.  

However, we ended up chatting through the app and she agreed to meet me for a date.

27,ps5zft,1632178895,23F and Single. Why?,"I don't know what I am hoping to achieve by this but here it goes. I typed this out as an answer for another post 'Why do you think you don't have a boyfriend/girlfriend?' OP specificed not to mention preference, standards, doubt, self-esteem etc and I came up with this. Posting here because subreddit just seems appropriate for this.

Hi. I am 23F. I've never dated anybody. 

I had a crush on my desk partner when I was in the 6th grade. There's no story there. I moved to a different city the next year and naturally got over the crush. 

In my new school, I suddenly garnered a lot of attention for being the new kid. I was culturally very different from the rest out there...I developed a slight crush on a guy but I knew it wouldn't go anywhere. A year went by fine. Found out everybody disliked me, got bullied, had to do projects separately because nobody picked me...the usual jazz. Started disliking the environment and couldn't wait to get out. So no story there either. 

When college came in the picture - I was in a girls college. Goes without saying didn't really know any guys at the time. Social circle was all female and might I add some lovely, intelligent girls they were. I've found life long friends from there. 

Guy - 1

When I was in the first year of my college I reconnected with old friends from my city through Facebook. Enter an old classmate. We spoke over the phone, texted... all that. In my head I'm speaking to an old friend. In his head he is flirting with me. I was more than happy to stay friends with him. But only a friend. On and off for the next 3.5 years he kept trying to get me into a LDR but I wouldn't budge. He pestered me repeatedly even after me saying a clear 'NO'. Sometimes I tell myself he wasn't a 'bad guy' and genuinely did have a heart for me but he clearly didn't understand consent. I did have feelings that I could've explored more but I didn't have the mental energy for a LDR and there were red flags that I couldn't ignore. Sometimes I doubt my decision but more often than not I'm glad I put me first.  

Guy - 2

I attended a 7 day workshop where I met this guy and oh my god instant connection. We connected on so many different levels. Same interests, likes and dislikes. I could've sworn things were looking good. We exchange contact info and bam radio silence for about a year. On occasion I replied to his posts or stories and vice versa. But nothing other than that. I don't know what went wrong there. When I revisited next year he asked a friend of mine if I was single (friend told me later) but by that time I had moved on!?! 

I got on a dating app about 2 years ago now (on and off) and I haven't been on a single date. I don't swipe right as much or even regularly for that matter. And on occasion that I do match the guys make me uncomfortable, ask intrusive questions 20 minutes into the conversation, wanna sext, are only on the app for hookups (not wrong, but I am not looking to hookup) or straight up ghost me.

Guy - 2

The guy from the workshop? Yeah, found him on the app, we matched. We talked like how we used to and the usual banter but he made no advances and neither gave me any opening. We still have that chemistry and I can sense it (could be just me idk) but now it's at a point where the boat has sailed and he is better off as 'Somebody I know' I guess. 

Guy - 3

Last year I matched with a guy he was respectful, asked the right questions...showed interest in what I had to say and all that. A week later he asked me out on a date. I happened to mention that I've never been on a date through dating app and he comforted my mind by adding that it would be just like meeting a friend. Sweet attempt on his side but I didn't need that because I wasn't nervous for the first time. It felt right. I wanted to go on a date. He mentioned in conversation that he was about to move to a different city in about 4 months. Fair enough. I wasn't expecting a long term commitment. I just wanted to go out and have fun, get to know people. I was 22 dammit. The conversation went on for another week pretty smoothly (the date hadn't been set yet - scheduling issues) and when the topic of past relationships came up I mentioned that I had never dated anybody that infact this would be my first ever date. Boom. Radio silence. 3 days later I dropped a text again guessing he must've been busy or everything you usually tell yourself when you know you're about to be ghosted. I didn't text again but I gave it another week hoping to get a text back but nothing. I unmatched him. 

Guy - 4

I matched with a guy last month. Been speaking to him since. He is a smooth talker...knows how to hold a conversation. I am on the fence about the guy. Not really sure. Our conversations are great.  But here's the catch...I mostly ask all of the questions and keep the conversation going...he does too but on occasion. I say our conversations are amazing because he responds to all of my questions and eventually enquires about me too. Not sure if I should be considering this good conversation. He is an ambivert just like me...so I guess him not wanting to open a barrel of emotions on day 1 makes sense. I've never received a text from him in broad daylight. He says he is an night owl and functions his best at night. He hasn't made me uncomfortable when we text late at night or tried to sext...except for this one time but when I mentioned I have boundaries and am not comfortable, he stopped. I am the one who's always texting him first. I did mention it to him twice and both times he said that he will. This one time he asked me to stay awake because we wanted to talk more and said he'd text me in 30mins. No surprises there. He didn't text me. It was pretty late so I just went to sleep after waiting for about 50 minutes. I've been sacrificing my sleep to speak to him. * Hits myself on the head * It's been a month and he yet hasn't asked for my number. We still still chat on the dating app. I asked for his Instagram but he isn't on the app. He has mentioned he would be moving to a different city in about 3 months. (Ahh how life comes a full circle xD) So I'm guessing his disinterest stems from not wanting long term commitment. But neither do I. Now that I've typed so much...the guy seems sketchy idk. I have dual emotions about this one... I've never had such long conversations with anybody else and there's just something about him and I can't stop myself. ü§¶ Sane advice is much appreciated. Even though I think I know which side the scales are tipped. 

My friends always tell me that overall I am quite a catch. I know I'm attractive, I know I hold a very high standard... I know all of that. People quite often have also told me that I'm very intimidating to approach and come off as arrogant or brimming with attitude the first time somebody sees me. Heck most of my best friends have told me that they'd assumed the same. I am quite the opposite btw. It's starting to seem like nobody's interested or somehow it's me who's the problem. But I don't know what to make out of this. 

I also know that not everything has to have a timeline. I just wanna go on a date with a nice respectful guy and and have a wonderful time. Hopefully before I turn 24.

So that is why ladies and gentlemen, I'm single.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ps5zft/23f_and_single_why/

29,ps65tg,1632179474,Struggling to date post college with no experience," TLDR: Quiet, introverted guy who failed at the college dating scene, and has been rejected his entire life, is trying to find ways to start dating.

This will be long, please bear with me.

I am a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug this summer after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and introversion/slow to open up.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, you just dont meet many people your age after school it seems.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

Slow to open up. I have a hard time being flirty with girls before I am friends with them. I dont want to use the term demisexual (as I am not that), but I can relate to those people and that idea of needing to be close to someone before moving a relaitonship beyond a friendship. I also dont want to use the term friendzone, but it honestly feels that way most of the time. We become friends and then after some time, I think about asking her out as I start to develop feelings, but she only sees me as a friend. I have lost quite a few friends this way and frankly I dont want to lose any more and I feel broken because of it.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"". I have been also told that I am too genuine for my own good.

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

Getting out more - over the last month I have gone out to the local ""downtown scene"" with friends on a somewhat regular basis. Trying new restraunts, shops, etc. and generally getting out more. Though, I just feel too young for that croud (surrounded by young families mostly), and too old for the college scene that exists.

Meetup - none exist in my area for things I am interested in, so I made one. A short hike to the top of a popular hill for the sunset and astronomy viewing. No one showed up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

Thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ps65tg/struggling_to_date_post_college_with_no_experience/

31,ps67x0,1632179664,Is this girl interested in me?,"Hey everybody. I could use some insight right about now. I used to work with a girl that I think is literally perfect, and on her last day of work before leaving for school I got her snapchat. We snap very often, maybe 30-40 times a day, and we are mutual best friends on snap. The only problem is that I'm not sure if she is interested in me, or just being friendly. Here are my reasons for thinking that she may be interested in me: 1. She has a snap score of over 1,000,000, and she somehow snaps me the most out of all her other friends. 2. She responds to my snaps more than I respond to hers. For example, I sent her a pic of the dashboard of my car with my bluetooth showing, and she responded saying ""I love your music taste"". She also regularly comments on pics of food I send her, saying things like ""I want that"" or ""That looks so good"". 3. Every once in a while, I'll receive snaps from her that are different than her usual snaps. For example, a few days ago she sent me a snap with her clearly with no shirt or bra on, but only showing the tops of her shoulders with a super cute pouty face. She also often sends selfies of her making the kissy face. 

Sorry for the long post, but I don't want to send a flirty snap if she isn't interested. She is coming back to work after the semester, and I know she really likes her job and I don't want to ruin it for her or make it awkward. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.

First date was amazing, he did seem reserved and a little shy which he admitted to. It was at night at a bar and we spent almost 6 hours together getting drinks, talking, and walking by the shoreline. We kissed and it ended up being such a good date. Second date was at another bar but we ended up going to his place because we couldn‚Äôt get enough of each other. He made me a drink and played piano for me and I sang for him which was cute. At 2:30am I said it‚Äôs getting late and said I‚Äôll get an Uber but he didn‚Äôt want me to leave. I ended up sleeping over but nothing happened. He was very respectful and we just cuddled and kissed. We text every day with a few good hours in between each text but the man is the absolute worst at initiating plans. I asked him to hangout for the weekend but he said he‚Äôs up at his friends cottage but that he‚Äôs free during the week. No date or time. So that made me a little frustrated. He is more reserved than other guys I‚Äôve dated in the past which throws me off because I can‚Äôt read him but I don‚Äôt want to discredit him because he‚Äôs shy/reserved. I suggested a dinner date and he texted this morning in an enthusiastic text telling me the days he‚Äôs busy with family (we have a holiday packed month) and meeting clients for work. He said he‚Äôll know on Wednesday for sure and asked what we‚Äôre making. Thoughts? I‚Äôm getting a little frustrated because if he‚Äôs not interested I‚Äôd rather him be straight up.

36,ps6lnr,1632180994,Bit of hope in the dating wasteland (esp for people with a long drought or social anxiety!),"Reading through here tonight saw a bunch of references to how depressed people are reading the dating horror stories on here so I figured I would share a happy one and also about how like, you can have nothing going for you in terms of dating momentum and wind up in a kind of good situation. (TL:DR - Happy story from ""online"" dating during COVID) 

So I'm 31. Without going into too much detail, most of my twenties was completely derailed with a parent getting critically ill. I had to move in with them and take care of them. During that whole time the illness was very touchy, more or less ""life and death"" and I was in survival mode between working full time and caring for the parent. I dated minimally, didn't really take care of myself and ate poorly and my weight crept up quite a bit. Sadly my ill parent passed away in my late 20s, and after grieving that, which sucked, it was like waking up from a long slumber. All the sudden I could think about having fun for myself, even dating, 

Of course, at that point I'm a) very unhappy with my weight and appearance, b) haven't really dated much less had sex in almost ten years, and c) literally have no idea where to start. All I have heard is that the apps are terrible. Not even knowing where to start, I didn't make many organized attempts to date before - naturally - COVID hit! And I wanted to be really careful during that and all the stories I heard about trying to DATE during COVID sounded even worse than the normal dating s@#$show. So anyway more or less was willing to punt on that. 

By the way I've had *opportunities* to date this whole time and was popular enough and dated plenty when I was younger - not a virgin by any means - but still! Realizing you haven't been in a relationship for like ten years it is hard not to feel like a defective mutant. I'm reasonably OK looking and have a good job, people seem to find me fun and funny enough but I really had this mental block when I even wanted to start thinking about dating. Mostly just about my weight and not feeling attractive for whenever sex would come up again. 

Well here's where all this negative stuff kind of turns around lol. Because dating wasn't on my mind, used COVID to start working on myself. Began running. Have at this point lost 40 lbs which definitely affected my feelings about sex and self-image for the better. But without even thinking about dating, just doing things online and following my own interests, I happened to meet someone awesome. We wound up talking more and more, then every day, then video calls every day, couldn't get enough of each other. I'd never done LDR and wasn't even into that idea, but because of COVID and us living in different places and vaccines not being available at the time, we discussed a ""visit"". I was SO NERVOUS. Like I had not dated or anything in so long and yeah, just felt !!!! but long story short, my current significant other came for a ""visit"" and here we are living together seven months later. All my worries, feeling like a mutant because of not dating for so long, they vanished when they showed up on my doorstep. It instantly felt like, not to be completely cheesy but like the pure elation/rightness  of like a first love (even though it wasn't, I have had other serious relationships when I was younger). So anyway, yeah like doing everything wrong, feeling like crap about myself, during a pandemic, from opposite sides of the country, managed to find a great person and we are very happy.

Anyway all to say, and things I wish I could have told myself when I was so churned up about feeling un-date-able and anxiety ridden: No one is defective, if you want to date there is absolutely someone out there for you (although it may take work to find them, lol). Annnnnnyway, figured I'd share as a bright spot in all these gloomy posts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ps6lnr/bit_of_hope_in_the_dating_wasteland_esp_for/

Feel like I just wasted a part of my life on this,"We hit it off on the first day of school, started talking over 2 weeks or so and then started dating officially last Friday. We had a really great first date and I was looking forward to a relationship with this girl. Cut to yesterday we were hanging out again and she seemed distant. We talked about it and communicated how we felt and in the end she said we should go on a date to a place she likes this weekend. Now today in class she barely makes eye contact with me or talks to me which I notice and ask if she‚Äôs holding up ok and she says she‚Äôs fine. Then as class was getting out she said that we needed to talk. I kinda assumed she was gonna break up with me but it still kinda hurt.

45,ps76th,1632183068,How do you meet people?,"Hi, this is a bit of an obvious question but I'm at a loss trying to think of how I can actually meet someone that would want to get to know me. 

I'm a 22 year old man, looking to meet women. I've never really had any close female friends, and outside of internet friends I don't have any whatsoever. 

I'm an introvert and a virgin, my life basically consists of going to work them coming home. 

Ive been lonely for as long as I can remember, but everywhere I go and everyone I meet, nobody ever wants to put forth any effort into allowing me into their lives. I've tried but never get anywhere with anyone. Everyone else is always busy with their lives, and don't care about me. Nobody has ever invited me out, and whenever I invite someone else they don't want to, of are busy. It's like I've got the plague or something, and it's always been this way.

The older I get, the more my inexperience shows, and combine that with the fact that I'm not really all that ""fun"" of a guy to begin with, nobody is asking to spend time with me. I'm the guy that nobody hates, but nobody really likes either. I guess I'm just invisible to everyone...

How the heck do I meet people who actually want to put effort into relationships? I don't want to touch any apps, I shouldn't have to condense myself into a brief description of how ""affable and fun"" I am to be around and why you should ""choose me"" and I don't want to take any dumb dancing classes, or anything like that that I have zero interest in, it'd be disingenuous and creepy if I did that, plus I want to meet women in my own age range. This to me
basically seems to mean I'm screwed unless I approach strangers on the street...(which is a great way to fail)

It tears me apart thinking about how hard it is simply to meet people, let alone meeting somebody that actually likes me, that'd be something to behold.

If only I had friends or family that could introduce me to folks but I'm basically completely alone in my life, which is doing me zero favors. Nobody wants to spend time with the weird loner, and that only exacerbates the problem since I'm basically a walking red flag. 

I don't want to be alone forever, how do I meet a like-minded similarly aged woman that won't be turned away due to me having a past filled with bad circumstances? I feel like it's a losing battle, really I just don't want to feel so lonely all the time but apparently even that is a red flag because I'm not ""comfortable being single"" when I've been single my whole life. 

I guess at the end of the day you can't give me any answers outside of ""take a class"" or ""pick up a new hobby"", or just tell me to get on OLD, or look on ""meetup.com"" or something like that. It's a whole mess, I wish I could've just had a normal life so that I wasn't such a freak, but if I dont do anything and just go back and forth from work then I'll wake up one day and be forty and still be alone",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ps76th/how_do_you_meet_people/

51,ps7ejl,1632183795,"Not feeling ""an elusive thing"" after a very intimate and passionate couple of dates","
I (M40) had come out of a very long term relationship earlier this year and started on-line dating. After a few dates with various women, I met one (F36) with whom I really got on well. We met, got a drink, and really clicked and had a good conversation. As it turned out, she was off back to visit her family in her country of origin for a month, just a couple of days after our first date (we're in the UK, she's from Europe originally), but we both agreed that we'd like to keep in touch and see what happens when she gets back. 

So, we were WhatsApping pretty much every day, getting along really well and having a good laugh together. So much so, in fact, that we arranged for me to meet her off the train when she arrived back last Wednesday, and we ended up going back to hers and spending a very intimate night together, which was lovely, and we both enjoyed greatly. 

Anyway, after I went home the next morning, we exchanged a few messages again, and she sent a couple of quite steamy texts relating to the previous evening; but then followed it up a bit later with ""let's take things slowly, OK?""¬† I mean OK, we already had sex, but I can respect that, so fine. 

So, we texted more (and again, she instigated a couple of sexual conversations during these exchanges), set up another date for Saturday, and again when we met up, we couldn't keep our hands off each other - it was all very close and loving, and again we went back to her flat and had a lot of very passionate sex - but not just sex, again there was a lot of intimacy and affection there too. Constant eye contact, physical touching, lots of cuddling, good conversation and laughter. In short, everything seemed to be going just great and we were both feeling the same thing.

Then yesterday, after I'd gone home, she texted asking me ""...can you dial it down a little? You‚Äôre lovely and we‚Äôve had a couple of nice dates, but we really don‚Äôt know each other that well yet. please let‚Äôs take it slowly. and don‚Äôt freak out if I don‚Äôt text for a while"".  So OK, I gave her the space she was asking for, despite feeling the burning missing sensation of starting to fall in love with her.

Then this evening, the bombshell.

""I‚Äôve been quiet today and yesterday and I‚Äôm sure you can sense why. I‚Äôve been thinking about these past few days. And I hate doing this but I‚Äôm going to have to rip the bandaid off.  
I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt feel that we‚Äôre a good match. I sense that you might feel differently and it‚Äôd be unfair of me to lead you on or waste your time. 

You‚Äôve been absolutely lovely and caring and attentive and sweet. you haven‚Äôt done or said anything wrong. It‚Äôs simply that my heart‚Äôs not in it. 
I‚Äôve really really enjoyed our time together. But I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôll go anywhere from here. 
I wish you all the luck and the good things in this world and that you meet someone soon who deserves all that you‚Äôve got to give - and reciprocates"".

Now of course I respect her prerogative to feel however she feels, but I'm so confused. Every moment of our last two encounters seemed like the exact opposite of what she wrote. I feel like a teenager who's had his heart broken for the first time all over again, and I just can't reconcile the level of shared intimacy with this message. Any insights anyone has about this situation would be appreciated- I just want to try and understand what happened.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ps7ejl/not_feeling_an_elusive_thing_after_a_very/

54,ps7mc5,1632184541,My boyfriend (27 m) and I (25 f) made it official this weekend by telling everyone that we are together.,"This weekend my boyfriend Tim (27 m) and I (25 f) made our relationship official by telling all our friends an family that were together. We‚Äôve actually been seeing each other since July but we‚Äôve been kind of discreet about it.

I‚Äôve known Tim for most of my life. His sister Amanda (25 f) has been my best friend since we were in kindergarten. I guess I‚Äôve always liked Tim. We‚Äôve always been like buddies but I always thought he was cute and especially in high school I cursed on him pretty hard. We never got together because Amanda would tell her friends that Tim was off limits and it would be weird for one of us to date him.

Fast forward to this summer. At a Fourth of July party Tim and I shared a kiss. After that he and I started seeing each other pretty regularly but both of us went into it thinking it was more of a fling than anything else. I guess you could say we‚Äôd agreed to become FWB. 

We spent one day together that made how I felt about him change. It was just us hanging out and he took me to a craft show I wanted to go to. Then we had dinner and just talked. I realized just how funny and kind he is and how he made me feel happy just by being around. Then he gave me a peck on the cheek when he dropped me off and somehow that peck was nicer than all the real kisses we‚Äôd already shared.

So I ended up telling him how I felt about him. And he shocked me by telling me he felt the same way. Then he gave me a kiss and told me that I have been his dream girl for a long time. So we decided that we wanted to be together and we had to tell everyone but especially Amanda.

Which we did this weekend and she was really surprised at first. She thought we were joking with her. But after she overcame her surprise she just said that she  wanted whatever made us happy and made us promise not to hurt each other. After that we both told our friends that we were together. It feels good to be able to say it out loud that he‚Äôs my boyfriend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ps7mc5/my_boyfriend_27_m_and_i_25_f_made_it_official/

I went to his place, and immediately we had a great connection, both personality wise and physical wise. We continued to see each other to mid June, when he had to move back to his home state. During that whole time, we texted 24/7, texted good morning and goodnight, had the pet names (baby, darlin, babe, sweetheart etc), slept over at his place frequently, he kissed me on the forehead, physically VERY affectionate in innocent ways, told me multiple times he had a ‚Äúmajor crush on me‚Äù, and all that.

We continued to text back and forth after he left state, I really left it up to him at first and he initiated texts for the most part so I took it as a good sign. About a month ago, we were texting and he said he fell in love with me. Of course, I was in shock and just acknowledged it and sent back something flirty as per usual. About a week later I had expressed similar feelings and he kind of shut down after that. Didn‚Äôt really text me anymore, went from every day to once every few weeks. The last time we talked I had texted him some good (to me) news about my job and he said he was very proud of me and all that, but that was the end of the conversation. My question is, do I believe that he truly has feelings for me and just has commitment issues or do I go the route of believing I just got played?

60,ps7seb,1632185139,I'm probably going to be single again by Friday,"Hello, I've started date this girl on this year January and I really thought she was the perfect girl for me, ours tastes were very alike, we shared the same wish to become married and have kids, we were all lovey dovey and shared a lots of happiness and fun times, we were very supportive to each other and we barely fought or when we did it we just talk about, it all looked a dream until this august.

Late august she went into a trip with her dad and sister and she was so different since she came back, she was so cold whenever she talked to me and often tried to put me down, on this last weekend we talked a lot about how we are both feeling and I told her how I was feeling bad by the way she was treating me, she said she didn't know if she still loves me and she often feels bad by being with me, she told about all the dreams and needs she left behind to stay with me and how it was killing her, she told she couldn't focus because being with me was more important and she was blinded by it, I was a distraction to her career, she also said she can't live in a monogamic relationship and she knows I don't like being in a non monogamic relationship, she can't find herself staying with just one guy for the rest of her life and how neglecting this was hurting her, and all that she told me before was like a persona so she could feel loved.

I want to keep being supportive to her, even if she let me aside to focus on her career, but I want to stay her in all good and bad moments, I'm not asking for her to choose between her career and me I just want her to learn how to conciliate it, I'm not sure about a non monogamic relationship it's not what I want, but I really want to stay with her I'm deeply fallen in love with her, she told that I don't know her real self and I would not like it, she told me about lots of things she have done in the past and how unlikable she should be to a person like me, about some of the other guy she had something, but I want to believe it's just a way to make me move away from her, maybe she is scared I get to know her real self and things gets even worse, maybe she's just tired of me or can't stand me anymore and is pushing me away.

This last Sunday, 09/19, I asked her if we should broke up if she can't see a future with us both together anymore, she replied asking for us keep some distance from each other and not talk until this next Friday, 09/24, and see how we both react without getting in touch with each other but it really seems we are going to break up when the day comes.

I really love her and I really want to stay with her, like I said I'm too deep in love and I don't know what to do if we break up, I don't even know what to do anymore, last Sunday I was crying almost all the time, Today I saw a few photos and a letter she wrote me, I can't help but feel a heavy heart whenever I see anything which reminds me about her.

I don't know how to deal with it, it haven't even ended yet but I'm feeling way worse than all the other two broke up I had with my two ex-girlfriend.

84,ps9vg2,1632192620,I feel like dating apps and site just aren't designed to work.,"Maybe this is partially a me thing because I've done nothing but read good things about Hinge on here and other subreddits. Details about me: 27/M looking for a woman around my age to potentially marry. I live in a medium-sized town in the South in a smaller metropolitan area, so there may not be as wide of a dating pool within a closer range, but it's not like I live in the middle of nowhere. I've used many sites and apps before to no avail.

I downloaded Hinge back in like January or February, I've gotten only a few matches every once in a while. I often go days if not weeks without a match and I run out of swipes just about every day without getting a match. I just tried purchasing the full membership for the time being to see I could find more opportunities, still not much. What's bizarre is that I keep seeing the same profiles I swipe left on over and over again, and there are barely any potential matches that seem like a good fit for me. Even the ones I do get matched with, they're either too far to meet or neither of us seems all that interested.

What's also infuriating is that I see plenty of good matches in the standouts section, but I can't click right on them unless I have a rose. Many them look exactly what I think I want, but I never get matched with them.

I picked these three questions to answer on my profile: Typical Sunday, Two truths and a lie, and My most controversial opinion is. I try to be funny and authentic and positive, so IDK if that's a turn-off.

Honestly, it just feels like more of the same for me. I've never had a girlfriend and I've only been on like 2 or 3 dates in my whole life. I've used dating apps since I was 19, several of them, and none of them ever work for me, free or paid. I've been on two dates all this time through OLD, and neither of them led to a second date. I'm so tired of never having any opportunities or experience to help me find the one. I've made no progress in this area of my life and I'm already 27. 

And all I hear from people is the same cliche ""oh don't worry. You'll find someone. There's someone out there for you."" How am I supposed to know that's actually true if I don't know how to date or build relationships because I never get opportunities to? I'm trying not to lose hope, but it's so hard.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ps9vg2/i_feel_like_dating_apps_and_site_just_arent/

88,psa0ty,1632193188,"Limited Options for Meeting People (Also, is something wrong with me?)","My (26F) first relationship was five years ago, with someone I knew at my first college. He was in a couple of my classes, then one day we ran into each other by chance in the school library, and from there we were inseparable. I was very in love with him, but our relationship was unfortunately co-dependent and emotionally unhealthy. At the time, we were both battling severe mental health issues. I had recently been sexually assaulted by someone else at that same school only a few months prior to meeting him, and as a result had horrible PTSD, while he had long-term, treatment-resistant depression. After only 6 months, he broke up with me over a text and didn't really give a reason why. I was completely heartbroken, and didn't get over it for about 2 years. 

Since then, I withdrew from my first college and re-applied to a new one. My school program now is online, which is ideal for where I am academically--the online program accepted more transfer credits--but is awful for dating and making new friends. Due to the nature of how I'm studying, I simply cannot get to know my classmates outside of the discussion boards, which are purely academic. 

About 3 years ago, I decided to try dating apps, and honestly I have not had any success. I've tried Bumble, Tinder, Facebook, Hinge, and OkCupid. Of those, I've had the most luck with Facebook, surprisingly; I dated a guy for 6 months from there, but we weren't compatible emotionally or sexually. (We actually never had sex, because he never wanted to.) There were other issues at play, but essentially we just weren't the right people for each other. 

Besides that, I haven't had anything from a dating app last more than a few dates. I've never been in an unsafe situation, thankfully, but usually I'm just not compatible personality-wise with anybody else I've met. There were some people I connected to well enough to have sex with, but I always got ghosted afterwards. I've tried not to let it bother me, but after years of being ghosted, my self-confidence is pretty low. I'm wondering now if I'm the problem. Am I ugly, or boring? Do I have poor social skills? Am I bad at sex? Or all of the above? It got to the point where I deleted all my dating apps. It's been exhausting to put myself out there without anything working out. 

I can't meet people at work--I work in a retail store, and most of the other employees are either much younger or much older than me--and I'm not comfortable going to bars, because I don't like drinking. (I can't drink anyway, because of a psych med that I'm on.) 

I know I don't need a relationship to make me happy, but I feel like it would significantly help, and it would definitely improve my confidence. I've been hooking up with someone recently (that I met here on Reddit, of all places), so I don't need sex, but I am really lonely. It would be so nice to cuddle with the same person every day, or fall asleep next to someone that I love. 

I guess my question is, what are my options here? Do I deal with the loneliness and stay single until I can graduate from my bachelor's program, and hopefully meet someone in grad school? Or are there still ways for me to meet people outside of school, work, and bars?

93,psad8k,1632194424,Did she reject me or should I ask again?,"I (23m) finally spoke to my crush (22f) of four years. I don't know her that well, but I could instantly tell we were really similar, turns out we are. We had a good 15-20 min conversation when I ran into her one on one, she was genuinely interested in asking me questions and even asked personal questions. I've given her a hint once via DM, and she told me I'm really sweet and seemed to really like it.

Later that day, I sent her a DM. I had errands to run on Tuesday (tomorrow) and wanted to pass time before I got busy, so I offered to go get lunch with her as a way to pass time. My intention wasn't a date, just for me to get to know her more. She ended up telling she's going to be out of town that day, but that's it. She didn't offer up to change the day, which made me think she just made up an excuse. Maybe she thought I'd offer to change the day, maybe she was nervous, or maybe she thought I only wanted to get lunch on that specific day only. 

What makes me believe her response is that we're both on the same athletic team, and I see her daily. If she said she's going out of town, that means she'd have to miss practice. On top of that, it means that if I accidentally ran into her the day she said she'd be out of town, she'll know that I caught her in a lie. Plus she could've easily said ""I have work that day sorry"", ""I'll be busy"", but instead she chose a high risk response (in the case I run into her).

I really like her and really want to ask her again, but people have told me that she rejected me and that I should move on. What should I do?

also, usually when a girl rejects someone I noticed they say sorry or try to be nice, but she literally just said ""I can't I'll be out of town that day""",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psad8k/did_she_reject_me_or_should_i_ask_again/

Thank you for reading my profile. First of all, let me say I am happy my smile is enough for you to want to get to know me. If you do I would love to hear from you and that's only if you are interested in meeting in person. Also, if you are married, separated, or financially unstable, kindly go ahead and click on your next match :) 
I‚Äôll try to be brief,(no promises!), but here it goes...

We will get along well if you are attracted to outgoing, no drama, ‚ÄúNYC gal with a spice of Eastern Europe‚Äù type of lady who absolutely loves life and all it has to offer. 
I equally enjoy been on beaches or mountains or springs, big cities or small villages. Discovering new places or activities makes me very excited. However, nice and quiet evenings in watching a good movie and cuddling suits me just fine as well.
My biggest dream is to spend Christmas in Europe. Have not fulfilled it yet, so maybe we can do it together. 

I love to work out a good bit and a member of Orange Theory Fitness for several years now. Taking care of myself is important to me, but I don't consider myself a high-maintenance woman. It's not a problem for me to just jump in jeans /shirt and go for whatever calling my name. Even though I am not a huge sports fan watching a game on TV or live sports events with good company can be very engaging and fun for sure. 

Moving to Florida from NY was the right decision and I am glad it all work out for me. I love it here and the past 7 years were pure joy. With a move, I gain a great job and fulfilling friendships with wonderful people who are like family to me. I am also a mom to a beautiful, independent and very smart 8 years old girl. If you have kids or not and enjoy being a parent I would love that joy with you, but would not be open to having a biological child at this age. 

It comes naturally to me to be able to see the best in people and I thrive on seeing people's different strengths and using them to create the best of any situation. I may not show it all the time, but I am very perceptive and I believe that is a trait that makes me successful in many aspects of my life. I am not perfect and try to be understanding to the certain extant. I hope you know that I meant.

I love pets and animals, but don't have one, because letting them go after the time it's just heartbroken to me. I was completely insane when I was rescuing the squirrel that live by my home. The result was great and he is still a happy camper and comes around when I have my morning coffee.

My life is wonderful , but I am missing the special person by my side. The significant one. What would I like in a man? Fun is very important, but I am also attracted to a kind,responsible, grounded guy that has respect and tries to live up to the good qualities that make a person balance. Mental maturity and knowing what is your next step is important to me. 

If you like what you read I would love to hear from you. Let‚Äôs enjoy life together :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psajdb/created_the_profile_for_old_not_sure_which/
