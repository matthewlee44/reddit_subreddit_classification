This self-proclaimed ""azsh0le"" started changing the narrative almost immediately afterwards, to make it look like I pursued him when it had been mutual. One isn't a bad person for rejecting a person, but there is a way to be honest that's not unkind, and I believe he KNEW what he was doing was unkind.

anyways before i even had a chance to process what happened or really react he was chastising me to be ""civil"" to him. but then proceeded to insist we be friends and act like I was rude and unfriendly for trying to avoid him and not act like nothing happened. I feel i was being civil towards him but i was limiting interactions. i was afraid if i had to be around him i'd do or say something i regretted. so i simply tried to get away from him.

one day after a while we spoke on the phone at my request. I thought the conversation was between me and him about what happened, like for me to get ""closure"" or whatever. the next day i unexpectedly run into him in the student lounge. he was with about 4 people I didnt know. to my astonishment, i overhear him telling these strangers about our conversation, repeating some of what we talked about verbatim. (part of me thinks he wanted me to hear) I was mortified. I ended up leaving and relocating somewhere else.

a little while later there was a big get together and he was there with this friend of a friend who i know he had hookedup with, and he kept coming around and showing up next to me. i told him repeatedly to go away. my friend observing this said it looked Joe thought it was ""a game"" and kept coming right back. I was drinking and this was the only time i'd say i was ""uncivil"" towards him. after that Joe started inviting me to get togethers (WTF?). I eventually wrote him an email saying i thought what he did / was doing to me was sh!tty and blocked him altogether and that was sort of the last interaction. i ran into him here and there very briefly.

anyways but that was pretty much it. it's now almost 3 years later and i was with a mutual friend. the mutual friend said that Joe still talks crap about me. in fact that I blocked him and was standoffish was apparently a source of great amusement to Joe

anyways. i actually used to really like Joe until the rejection, but i started to view him as this terrible person. once I got rejected it would be hard for me tobe around him even though he clearly displayed a lot of negative qualities because i'd be constantly thinkingabout how this person had deemed me unattractive or not good enough for him. so much so that he reframed the narrative because he regretted it so much. Being around him made me feel bad about myself. but I feel I was still ""civil"" to him.

and why was he telling everyone about me? this is mortifying. i died when i overheard him sharing our private conversation with strangers. i regretted talking to him at all. if he was telling these stranges all this stuff, clearly he was probably telling our mutual friends and everybody else. our mutual friend recently confirmed that. part of me wishes he would just be nice about it. is he simply a bully? he doesnt find me attractive or else he wouldn't have been so regretful about this. anyways i just dont get it. i thought by now it was in the past.

TL;DR: guy made me feel unwanted, unattractive and he regretted getting involved with me, but then demanded that I be friendly towards him, while he meanwhile talked crap about me to anyone who would listen. He is still doing so apparently 3 years later. what is his problem and why can't he put it in the past?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,800329,public,self,is it weird that this guy would not move on even though he rejected me?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmlnzn/is_it_weird_that_this_guy_would_not_move_on_even/,all_ads,6,,,

We went out a few times in a casual, undefined capacity for several hours each time. We have been texting every day since we first started talking on the app. We have a ton of common interests and a mutual friend as well. On the third hangout session, I asked her what she wants from this and she said she wants to be friends because I'm moving to a new city in a few months and COVID makes it hard to be in a relationship. I told her I agree cause I am moving in a few months (I originally got on the apps to just get more experience and meet new people post-vaccine anyway) but I kinda have feelings for her and I don't know what to do. Should I tell her? Should I just suppress them and keep hanging out? Should I distance myself?

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I got back into online dating a couple months ago after getting vaccinated and wanting to just get out there and meet new people. I am moving to Los Angeles from Seattle in August to go to grad school so I wasn't looking for anything serious and just hoping to just get back into the dating mindset.

This was basically my mentality until I met the woman in question. I messaged her on Hinge referencing a specific niche comedian who she also coincidentally happened to know of. We talked for a bit and found out we have a lot of common interests in standup comedy, hip hop, activism, etc. We hung out and got boba tea a couple days after our initial message conversation and she was really cool! She's honestly like my ideal woman in many ways and the more we talked the more we found that we have in common. She's a comedian, hip hop DJ, worked in a library, does activism/nonprofit work etc. all of which align a lot with my interests and work that I've been doing. I also really like her kinda shy but really funny personality. We also found out that we have a mutual friend.

After this initial meeting, we texted back and forth basically every day. It was mutual. Like I would initiate some conversations and she would do so as well. We had a second hangout session that ended up taking up the entire day. We went to a couple parks around the city, went to get tea, went to a video store, ate lunch, and then met up again after I went to work for a few hours and got dinner, drinks, and went to this board game spot. It was all really fun but never really discussed whether we were ""dating"" or just hanging out.

We continued to text basically every day until we met up a third time and similarly hung out for like several hours. Towards the end of this, I asked her what she is looking for on these dating apps. She promptly said she's looking for a long-term relationship. I said I'm probably looking for something similar but then asked her how she feels about me specifically. She felt bad answering and asked me if this would change the nature of our relationship to which I responded no. She said that due to the circumstances of me moving in a few months and COVID making it hard to date, she would like to just be friends. She then apologized and said she doesn't want to ""friendzone"" me. and said she would like to have more opposite gender friends. I responded by saying that I kinda feel similarly and it wouldn't make a lot of logical sense to get into anything long term if I'm moving to a new city in a few months. She said that I can talk to her about dating advice if I wanted and asked me She said that she found it really amazing that we have so many common interests and really enjoys spending time with me.

The problem is I think I was lying to her. Like I do enjoy spending time with her and would be psyched to be her friend but I think I have feelings for her. I know it's rationally not the best choice but I feel like there is a romantic chemistry that I feel towards her and I am worried that if we keep hanging out and texting all the time, I'm only going to get more and more enticed by her. I was considering telling her about my romantic interest and asking her out on a real date. I was going to ask her if she would be interested in me romantically if not for the logistical challenges of dating, and saying that I want to give this a chance for now and seeing where it goes. She has already said she wants to be friends and I promptly agreed with her on that so it feels weird bringing this up now but also weird to suppress my feelings. What should I do about this?

The other point is that if I'm only going to be here for a few months, I already have a ton of other friends I want to see. If there isn't a chance for romance, I don't know that I should spend so much of my time and energy on this person because I have so many other friends I want to see before I move and not a lot of free time right now cause of work. I feel bad cause I did promise her our relationship wouldn't change but I just don't know that I can invest ample time into someone if it's just for another platonic relationship. I don't know if that makes me an asshole and I don't want to stop being her friend, just might dial it back a little bit.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,800479,public,self,Should I tell this girl who wants to just be friends that I have feelings for her?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmnf42/should_i_tell_this_girl_who_wants_to_just_be/,all_ads,6,,,

However, in December 2020 we decided to breakup - being together 24/7 during a pandemic which allowed us to do little else besides play XBOX, watch Netflix, and make love created a lot of co-dependency so we decided to take time to ourselves and become our own people again. This ended up being really healthy because we both got our lives in order, slept around, and I realized that I really cherish her and want to experience life with her. Now that we've reconnected we've started to have sex again and act like a couple. We have not had the ""what are we"" talk yet, and I want to be proactive about addressing that.

The caveat here, as I'm sure you can tell by the title of this post, is that I would like an open relationship. By this I mean I want to have Lucy as my main partner (the person I take on dates, celebrate holidays with, comfort when she's down, and give priority to over other women), but I also want to continue to explore my sexuality outside of our relationship (casual encounters when out/traveling). This is something I have thought a lot about and with healthy, open communication and pre-determined rules and boundaries that make us both feel supported, I know we can make it work.

The trouble is, I'm not so sure how to approach her with this. I feel very suffocated in a relationship where I'm only allowed to be with and make love to one person. I like being free in this way, especially with a sexually repressed past and a very high sex drive. I'm scared that if I tell her this is what I want she's going to say no and I'm either going to sacrifice my own desires to keep her in my life (because seriously, she is such a great woman and makes me a better man, this is not just me saying this, she's the real deal) or tell her that I just can't do monogamy and we probably aren't compatible in that way.

I'd love some general advice on this, and here are a few specific questions:

1. What's the best way to bring this up? (in person or a thoughtful letter, her place or mine, etc)
2. Although she's a great woman, she does struggle with her self image and taking things personally, how can I approach this conversation in a way where she knows my desire to explore sexually is in no way due to any shortcomings on her behalf?
3. (Future-tripping here): If she is adamantly opposed to the idea, how should I respond?

Sorry for the long story

Summary: Should I reach out to a girl that rejected me as I saw her recently and can’t get her out of my head before we all leave for college in the fall and since I may move states in July? Would moving on be the best move instead?

I am male (18m) who recently graduated on may 27th 2021 . I want to reach out to a girl (18f) who we’ll call Ava. Back in Junior year she was the new student at my school and as the year progressed we had a lot of mutual friends. My friend who we’ll call Daniel(18m), was friends with her various classes while only had one class with her. Ava and I were on the same team for a club too.

So around homecoming season 2019 we went as a group with Daniel and her friend. Ava paid for my ticket and I paid for hers at a different school’s homecoming later on. Ava asked me to hangout around October-ish but I couldn’t make it due to family visiting. Around Thanksgiving break she asked me if I wanted to hangout again and we went out. Originally, I had a whole great plan on going to this downtown area where there are restaurants and places to walk. Also it was when they were going to turn the Christmas tree on but my parents made me change it to roller skating when I don’t know how to. It didn’t go great and didn’t talk as much but we had some laughs. I went to her house to work on a project and her older sister was there. Ava mentioned something about Daniel and her sister says.”ooooh Daniel” in a teasing manner and Ava tells her to shut up. One time at practice I saw Daniel texting her and she called him babe over text. Now Daniel has never had any intentions with her and sometimes detested her and ignored her. But I suspected she liked him but I ignored it.

She showed up to a couple of my soccer games but nothing else really happened. She got her drivers license and we saw each other even less since the class we had was a free period. Fast forward to February 2021 and the club we were in had a competition at a hotel for states. We saw each other for the first time in a while before getting on the bus to get there. She called me over to sit with her but at the whole time there it was really tough.  We went out to the area where there were restaurants because she wanted to go eat with me at this one place but it was closed. After walking for a while we decided to walk back to the hotel and a girl from another school was lost and recognized us from the competition. She asked us if we could walk with her back and as we did she asked us questions about what school we go to, etc. Then she asks if me and Ava are a thing and Ava says no. She then asks if we are working towards being a thing and Ava says no. We get back to the hotel and I asked Ava if she meant what she said and she said yes. I dropped contact with Ava as I needed it. 

Ava hits me up 2 months later in May asking how I’ve been and if I’m still moving away because I was going to but after graduation. She asks me if I’m getting early release( where I leave school early) senior year, what time I would get out and saying maybe she’ll see me around there. She texts me three days later saying she liked doing the club with me and thanked me. There months later in august she asks me if I’m doing virtual or in person classes. Only asking that. A month later in September she asks me if I’m doing the club again only. And that was the last time we talked in 2020. She said happy birthday to me on snap after seeing my story in 2021 and I saw her again in person at graduation rehearsal.

 I haven’t been able to get her off my mind lately after seeing her again and now that it’s summer and before college and I may move in July, I want to hit her up again.

why women find me attractive and not him is that I am very secure in myself.

The problem with this advice is that confidence comes from an early age and gets built on. When I was in my early teens, girls would hit on me, and from there I sort of built up confidence.

I've met way better looking, more polished, wealthier guys who utterly fail and totally lack confidence with women, and the only thing I can think of is that they lack the internal validation from their formative years. I think this further compounds and makes the issue worse.

I need some realistic advice on how to stop acting  a fool for my friend's cousin. I NEED TO get RID of these feelings I have for him. 
I have a best friend of over 18 years, I practically know all her family members and she mine. I've known this particular cousin for about 8 years but haven't really spent much time with him until the last 5 years. I know of his Exs and past relationships etc. He is currently single as well for a while just as I am.... however for the past 3 years I can't seem to stop thinking or talking about him. I don't really think that I want to have a crush but I can't seem to shake the feeling, I've tried hating him but that doesn't work.
To make matters worst he knows that I like him so when I go to visit my  friend and he is around he would avoid me if we alone and rarely talk to me when others are around and then another time he would do the opposite, which confuses me. 
He is always quite a gentleman around other ladies... My friend says she think he sees me as a little sister.. but he hasn't blatantly said so to.em or even acted in that manner because he would sometimes say certain things you to.ke that you wouldn't say to a sister, especially if we are texting.
He used to give me hints as if he liked me but then when I confronted him he wouldn't give me a straight answer and just acted as if he was oblivious to all the texts he would send me when I am home or the comments he would make... which left me confused... 
If I try to avoid him he would always come around and say something funny or something he knew I couldn't ignore.. BUT THEN HE'D GO BACK TO GIVING ME THAT COLD SHOULDER, that sometimes make me feel unwanted and unattractive... ps. I've seen his exes and they aren't all that...
Some one told me he might be intimidated by me...
Once this guy asked me for my number and I told him about it and he was annoyed and talked trash about the guy....

Pretty much how it always went is a girl would start to come around, I’d be hella interested and start to get the ball rolling for perhaps something more. However most of the time I shot my shot it was literally always the same answer. Sorry we’re just too close of friends(not a good excuse at all in my mind) and then they’d literally go and date someone else from my friend group.
There was one girl I was in a relationship in from Target between 2017-2018 for a year and some change, and it was fun. Have no regrets we’re still friends, and she gave me an honest to god shot. All I ever wanted out of any of the girl friends that were in our friend group was a single shot at a date. But literally every time I tried I would always get my heart broken beyond belief.

It’s not that I don’t love myself. I meditate everyday, I take care of myself spiritually, and I truly think I’m worth being in a relationship. It’s just after that happening to me so many times it’s hard for me to even function anymore. 
The last time something like that happened it was around 6 months ago, and a friend of mine who I legit loved as a brother tells me that the girl he’s been hyping me up to shoot my shot with and tried to help me says my crush is into him and he’s into her. I responded respectfully, said I was happy for them and quit two weeks later. Only hung out with him once since and all I could think about was that moment. Today I finally left the group chat I was in with that friend and unfollowed him on all social media. For the past few months I’ve been saying on social media how I completely regret working there, and how the shit memories were in no way worth any of the good ones.

He took me to his hotel room instead. I became scared and used the restroom in his room and said my goodbye.

So I wondering if there is any resource that covers a basic, basic outlines of how to even date someone to help me ""just do it"" and skip the years of common beginner mistakes. Not looking for those cringy pickup ""game"" manuals, etc. Like how do I know someone is even interested. How do I make people interested when I have the body language of an expressionless serial killer. What do you actually even do on a date and how to plan them, etc. The more basic the explanations the better.

Anyone know of a good resource collection like that, other than just reading through related subreddits like I already am?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,800824,public,self,Emotionless Robot Seeks Intimacy,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmra3t/emotionless_robot_seeks_intimacy/,all_ads,6,,,

Many boys tend to be a little machismo when dealing with their feelings. They arrange everything for girls and want to create a responsible and considerate image of a good man in front of girls. Think about all the itineraries for the date, such as where to go, what to do, and so on.

In fact, dating is a matter for two people. Both parties must have the prerequisites for understanding each other, such as what she likes, what she wants to do, and what she hates. These are all important prerequisites for preparing a perfect date.

2.Overrepresenting oneself

When dating, boys sometimes express themselves deliberately in order to improve their good image in front of girls. For example: places he hasn't been to, things he hasn't eaten, boys want girls to feel that he has them, and if they want to gain a sense of admiration, he will try to pretend to be himself, so that he will appear fake during dating.

The right direction: Don't express yourself deliberately, keep your own style and frame, just go for a normal date.

3.Physical contact with girls on the first date

I want to have too close physical contact with a girl on the first date. Few girls can accept it. Physical contact with a girl will increase the intimacy between you, but this behavior is the most difficult at the same time in the upgrading of the relationship. It is also the most important step. A slight improper treatment will change from ambiguous to indecent, and his image in the minds of girls has plummeted from then on.

The premise of physical contact is that you and your date have established trust and comfort. On this basis, some of your close behaviors will create an ambiguous pink atmosphere. To put it simply, it is to consider how far your relationship has progressed, and consider girls' acceptance of intimacy behavior.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,800829,public,self,The 3 most disgusting behaviors of girls in dating,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmrd37/the_3_most_disgusting_behaviors_of_girls_in_dating/,all_ads,6,,,

We studied together three more times and met up for dinner (and then went for desserts after dinner) after our finals.  I might have played myself when asking her out for dinner though because I asked if she wanted to ""hang out"" after finals. 

I recently asked her out again to exercise and we had brunch after exercising. We had a good time every time we met, but nothing flirty or touchy really besides some (non-sexual) teasing. On both the dinner and the brunch, she didn't mind sharing food and even drank from the same straw - not sure if this says anything but I probably wouldn't share a straw with my friends. I think she quite enjoyed spending time together since she asked if I wanted to exercise together again next week.

When I am with her in person, it seems like she's interested, but she seems a little hot and cold over text. She recently added me to her close friends list on Instagram, initiate random conversations occasionally (basically sending ""Hey, wyd""), and we would sometimes have long convos over text, but other times she would not respond to my texts for a few days, even though she has been online, which would make me think she's uninterested.

I really like her personality and I think she's quite cute too, but I am not sure what to make of these mixed signals. Do y'all think it is worth asking her if we are friends or if we could be more?

&amp;#x200B;

Something to note: 

I am from a rather conservative country, and my friends commented that I was ""moving quite fast"" when I asked her out for dinner so quickly after knowing her.

I (21F) went for drinks and a walk on Wednesday with a guy (24M) I met on Tinder.
The drinks and walk bit went really well. We had great conversation, lots of fun, and there was definitely some chemistry. We ended up at a lookout in a park where he proceded to make out with me. I didn't see it coming and I kind of freaked out inside but went with it anyway. A couple minutes later I told him I had never been in a relationship before and then he figured out that it was my first kiss. (it was also really bad so he just knew hahah oh god)
We spent the next two hours talking and making out. I didnt feel entirely at ease with all the kissing and tried to signal it, but he just found my inexperience kinda.. cute? Towards the end I started to feel more comfortable though.
Also, his hands were all over me and although I enjoyed most of it, him touching my stomach and sides made me flinch massively. I have a history of childhood verbal abuse, some threats of physical abuse, that type of stuff. I didn't feel comfortable telling him about this, so I just told him that I didn't know why I was flinching and laughed it off.

I messaged him the morning after our date and told him that the pace was too high for me and that I had been scared to set my boundaries. He reacted positively, told me I shouldnt be afraid to tell him to stop and he said he went too quick as well. I thanked him for his positive reaction and asked him to elaborate some more on why he thought he went too fast and now he's left me on read.

I really don't know how to feel or what to do. I don't feel taken advantage of, but I'm disappointed in myself for not telling him to stop or tone it down when I didn't feel at ease. I was so concerned with his feelings and opinion of me that I let this happen and it's just gross.

He has been on a few dates on tinder and has found a Filipino girl in her early thirties, she has a job in london in healthcare and earns a substantial amount more than my friend who's on minimum wage.

6 weeks after meeting, she is now pregnant. His family and myself are very concerned about this as he only had a mental breakdown last year, hes quite simple and easily influenced and 'goes with the flow' without truly looking into things long term.

So hes got this girl pregnant, she wants him to quit his job and move from his home town to london, leave his family and friends behind because she does not want to quit her career.

We told my friend this could be a be a bad idea,  he does not realise the costs of living in london, financially hes terrible at budgeting and lives at home with mum and dad.

He will be away from his support system which if they moved down here, he would atleast have some support and so would the mother and baby. 

Essentially he would be alone with a girl he just met, who is saying to him to bring her parents over from the phillipines to life with them, my friend was not happy with the initial 6 months she requested and he agreed to 2 months (which no doubt will be extended due to how soft he is)

I ran through all the costs and expenses of living in london and the pros and cons of moving away from home but he is just absolutely hypnotised by this girl, who seems to know what she wants and will not compromise.

It just FEELS like such a weird situation for this girl to  just get pregnant with a guy she just met without considering his own life, financial stability and long term commitment.

The other day we were talking and he randomly told me to go over there late at night and last minute. I told him I would find that weird and the next day he kind of just brushed it off and said good morning. Now we’re making plans to see each other for the following day and I just mentioned to him that he threw me off by inviting me over last minute and late at night. 

He basically went off with a million messages on how he can’t do this anymore and that he’s over the fact I think he is just trying to sleep with me and maybe the next guy I won’t think like that and blah blah and basically said good luck. So I apologized for making him feel that way, tried calling him and he did not pick up. He messaged me after asking if I called because he was working out. I told him yes, I wanted to talk but sorry for bothering him. 


He hasn’t replied (this happened yesterday) and haven’t heard from him. I kind of feel guilty if I really did make him feel that way because I didn’t mean to, but I also don’t think I did anything too wrong.

 **Context:** Well, I've met twice with this girl. We're both very into each other and we're in this stage, when you are more than just friends but you are not an actual relationship (she doesn't have much time because of her studies) 

Cut to the chase, this is our 3rd date and I think we have about 4/5 hours. I want to surprise her, it doesn't need to be expensive or luxurious. I thought about taking an ice-cream and going for a beach walk. She has had a bad and long week due to the exams and even though she hasn't finished yet, I want to see her happy and relaxed, although just for a few hours.

I need some advice dear redditors, as I said, the plan can be very cheap, my intention is to surprise her and have a good and (¿romantic?) date

Cheers:)

now for some reason the last few days she hasn’t seemed nearly as interested and i think it’s because i tried to play it cool and act like i wasn’t super into her. anyway, i don’t want to ultimately fall into the friend zone. 

what should i do? i was thinking maybe subtly asking if she had a boyfriend as a way to make it clear i like her.
