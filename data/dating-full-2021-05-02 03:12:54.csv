I make my intentions clear from the beginning that I personally, am NOT actively looking for something casual and would prefer something more intimate. They however, are the ones who say tend to bring up sex talk and then ultimately decide they can’t commit to someone like me on a level of like a real relationship... 

To be clear, I am never the one that brings up sex/sex talk. It’s always them. I reciprocate, go with the flow, ask for permission if it’s something they’d like to do, and proceed or not proceed based on what they tell me. We then end up having a fantastic time. 

However, that isn’t what I really want long term. Long term, I want to be able to give myself to someone wholly. Emotionally. Not just physically. To talk to them and know they want to be in my company, just waiting for sex or something else.

I’m tired of seemingly always finding those women who are; just out of a relationship, still getting over someone/need a distraction, or are just plain *emotionally unavailable*. 

Then again recently, being told I’m not quite relationship material for them (maybe it’s my age?) but they would like to have fun with me until either of us find someone more suited for each other emotionally. 

Don’t tell me to get therapy. I’m in therapy already and working on a lot of different things with my therapist. Don’t tell me I need to be content with being alone; that’s useless. I’ve already been alone for far too long (feels like). I’m in a place where I feel like I’m finally stable enough to be a solid person for someone, I have a steady job, I’m responsible. 

I know I’m ready to actually have a solid relationship with someone, but once again, when I’m actively looking for a connection to build into a relationship, no one is available enough for that to happen. 

Vent over. 

Edit: I’m in my early 20s. I have a hard time connecting with others my age due to trauma growing up which has always made me feel leagues older than I am (one of the things I’m resolving with my T). This in turn, makes me feel the need to seek out older partners by more than a few years because it feels like I have more in common with them than those my age.

We didn't talk for about 5 months after this. I messaged him about 2 weeks ago, and we seemed to get along at first and I was making flirty jokes and trying to see where he was at about that. I told him I didn't want to meet up until I got a vaccine, and it seemed like he was ok with that. He was asking about some of my mental health issues, and other things..

Don't approach romantically, but friendly. Just ask a simple trivial question about him. 

If this man is single, and finds you attractive, he will naturally find a way to see you again.


Even as a man of confidence in talking to women, I still don't approach women unless I see a good reason to in that moment. Even if they take my breath away, a lot of the time I won't because of social normalities.

I know a lot of good men who approach women even less than I do (by a lot).

After a 3 week delay of meeting (due to covid), we finally got to go on a dinner date. Prior to the dinner date, I was in his town at a tulip festival (we live about an hour and 20 mins apart) he was at work and I was literally 2 mins from his work, so I stopped by.  

Dinner went great and he paid (I offered to pay for myself, because I’m not in it for free dinners or anything) he told me it was fine and he’ll get it. 

Then we walked around the local park and then we drove to the beach (because it was like 5 mins away)
I could tell he wanted to kiss me, but it had been SO long since I had been physical with someone, I was being so awkward about it and avoided it. 🤦🏼‍♀️ we got back to my place because that’s where he met me. He told me to stop what I was doing and to come here, I knew then I wasn’t gonna be able to avoid it any longer. He grabbed my face and kissed me, best kiss I’ve ever had. 

I have been on a handful of other dates and none of them resulted in this.

We’ve got a second date planned, not really a date…. I’m going on a random road trip over the weekend and invited him along, he said yes. So I’m looking forward to that. He will meet a couple of my friends on this, because I’m traveling to just go have dinner with them.

I like him, but he’s sooo much younger than me. BUT I am trying to live in the moment and just go with the flow &amp; not self sabotage.

How does the demographic of living in a bigger city influence your dating life?

Now I live in countryside, but considering the country I live in (Belgium) , everything is quite urban with a lot of small towns spread around. So it's not exactly the middle of nowhere but it's not a City..
I'm quite happy here but it's quite hard to meet a girl here, now with corona it's even worse. I've a some catching up to do in my dating life so I'd figure I need change something at age 26. 

Anyway, I've never lived in a big city before so I don't know. What factors come to play, any advice or experience to have bigger chances to meet more single girls ? Does it depend on what city, exactly where in city..? Maybe the city life attracts the people who also want to date? I guess some people would rather date someone who's living more close so distance is a big thing.

5’6” (5’8” with kicks lmao)

I feel like dating isn’t supposed to be this fucking hard but I have nothing else to compare it to since I’m not white, or tall, or both. I only have my own lived experience to compare it too.

Indian men are reported to have the lowest match rate on dating apps along with black women. On top of that, we all know the stories of short men being written off on the basis of their height. This is because of our genetics. Idk what the fuck I’m actually supposed to do in this situation.

I need more practice talking with women but according to reddit there’s never a fucking perfect time to talk to them. “Don’t approach them at work, on the job, while their shopping, with their friends, join a club to meet new people but don’t join a club just to meet people” wtf am I supposed to do with this schizophrenic advice? I need experience but experience comes from exposure and that means I need opportunities. Being short and non white makes it so I have less opportunities to practice.

As a shorter guy you have to compensate. It’s the only way. Have to make up the deficit. But even then there’s a struggle. If you don’t try to overcompensate to overcome the racial and height barriers you’ll be ignored, but if you do try and they recognize that your doing it, they’ll say you’re less attractive for “trying to hard”.

Not only do I have to show them ‘oh I’m not like those OTHER short guys’ but I ALSO have to demonstrate ‘oh I’m not like those OTHER creepy Indian dudes’. This is more than a hill it feels like a fucking mountain.

“But think about from the women’s perspective yet hey get hundreds of matches”

I understand and try to empathize but at the same time, indiscriminately swiping right on literally hundreds of girls only to get like 3-5 matches, all of whom will ghost you at some point fucking sucks. 

I need more practice talking to women romantically, I’m fine in non romantic settings. But ffs how can I get that fucking experience if I’m literally radioactive. I feel like I can’t message a girl too much either otherwise I get hit with the “creepy Indian guy in the DMs”, another fun story they can laugh about with their friends and say ‘oh yeah that happened to me too lmao’. Do you know how much this fucking sucks? 

Please don’t give anecdotal evidence “oh I know a guy, I heard about this one guy, not me but” please it literally doesn’t help. Because it comes off as delegitimizing.

I heard about a study which stated shorter men basically needed to massively out-earn their competition in order to date. Something like by 100K? I have to literally be in the one percent of earners? South Asian men are the highest earning minority group in the U.S. but it’s still easier said then done. It’s an arduous task in and of itself. Years of education and studying.

I’m tired. I hate having to put in so much effort in order to overcome being immediately written off. Running, lifting, studying, public speaking, comedy, fixing old acne scars caused by stress genetics and bullying etc. OLD is horrible for my self confidence and makes me feel unlovable. Like I did something wrong and can’t fix it.

I’ve always wanted to go out on a date and stuff. It always seemed so fun. Idk what to do.

I read/reached out/experimented ( don't worry the experiment was more like an Exel spreadsheet of its Emotional pattern and such ) and Did so much about how to care and support someone with BPD but it made me more anxious knowing about the possibilities and how we can both react to each other, I tried my best to take care of it but at the same time I'm scared, it hangs a lot with the opposite sex of it itself, That, it makes me want to go and see what is going on if I'm not there, Especially reading about how the possibilities are higher for someone with BPD to cheat BUT then again ( Not all X's are Y's ) And to think that we both go to different college and different workplaces it makes me feel rotten.  


Some said that it is better to just end it and go our own paths, but we really like each other ( and by we ""I"" really like it more ) - I don't want this to end like that -

He said he is open to a relationship but not with anyone (same). I ended up thinking that he was a bit too forward in the kindest way and I had gotten out of a relationship a month or so beforehand. We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6 pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again. A few days before our second date, he asked what I was up to one evening and offered movie night in PJs.  


Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. The date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver. We have been in contact via social media a bit since.  


I'm just unsure whether he should be the one that expresses what he wants in person or do I mention that this is what I'm after. He works till the evenings throughout the week and weekend so it seems that I can only see him after work hours.  
He reached out asking how I am, days went by and I started to think that I didn't like it how I wouldn't know when I was going to see this guy again and that if it's not meant to be, it's all good. Immature but I sent him a text saying that I didn't like it how our two dates consisted at just his house and that I'm often left not knowing when I would see him again, I said I don't have expectations around texting.  


He said he would talk to me the next day as he had a lot on his plate and he is sorry for not mentioning when he would like to see me again in the manner it deserves. I knew the answer wouldn't be good so I deleted him off my social media. He sent me a very rude message the next day saying I was immature, we ended up calling and he said that he thought he would be open to a relationship but he thinks he cannot provide what I would like. I then said to him that I've only met him twice and I'm unsure myself but I do like to know when I'm with someone if they would like to see me again such as 'this was great, when are you free next?' and weirdly he said he felt the same with me. He also said something along the lines of that he doesn't hear from me for days and is unsure of how I feel. He said forget the relationship talk, that he likes me and thinks I'm cool but he asked what my expectations were regarding texting and said he would like to see me again. He said we don't also have to be sexual when we catch up, we can be friends or anything.  


The next day I said I would like to see him again but I would not pressure him but I understand if he doesn't as I don't want to waste my time. I apologised for blocking him. He rudely responded and said ""I don't want to deal with this f\*\*king bullshit right now, **name**. I said I've been accommodating enough and to not contact me again. He replied saying 'f**\*** off, mate' and blocked my number and on WhatsApp. I noticed this morning he unblocked me.  


**TL;DR** guy that I would have liked to have seen again has proved to be quite unstable. Unsure whether I've done the right thing but not ever going to talk to him again. We unfortunately are very similar and have similar interests. I've noticed that he's been blocking a lot of people on his Instagram.

I'm 19 and will be 20 in june.

*Currently not studying because I didnt get accepted into the art college I wanted to study at and not working but still looking*

Ever since I moved I now go to this tabacco shop thats super close to my house...like a 45 second walk, to either get snacks for when I have the munchies or anything caffeine related like a rockstar energy.

Every now and again when I visit...I see this cute girl that looks around my age working at the till, I dont see her every time I go to get stuff but when I do shes the one that rings me up for my things. 

Shes about my heigh but slightly shorter, (I'm 5,7 so perhaps shes 5,5 or maybe 5,6) long brown hair, and always has a very adorable black dress on or a black top.

I dont know how to describe it perfectly but I feel like perhaps theres a spark?...maybe...?

She would touch my hand while grabbing the can of monster or rockstar energy drink to ring up...smile very nicely...complement my hoodie that I wear and say ""have a nice smoke session"" ...very kind of her. She most definitely smelled the weed off of me while I was infront of her haha.

I'd say thank you and say I like her cute top or complement her pretty dress (but I'll be honest..without looking at her directly because of my shyness)...then I'd say thank you and bye...then be on my way.

I would like to ask her out but I dont really have the confidence to do it...plus the language might get in the way...you see I live in Spain and have done for about 16 years now I can speak Spanish ""fine"" and read it perfectly but my confidence and ""mental hangups"" do hold me back and I'm shy like I just mentioned....so I decided to ask reddit and see what are my options. And or what's the best route of asking her out. 

And what's the best advice, plus I wanna hear what everyone else thinks because I'm honestly curious. 

(Btw any questions relating to this post, or me or the girl herself, please ask away and I'll give my best and honest answer) * I promise*


This is what I had in mind on how to do it:

I was thinking on drawing her a picture because I'm a artists and I like to draw alot, lots of creepy art and very dark style and dark sense of humour.
I'll write a little note aswell saying something like...

""hello, I see you every now and again behind the counter you look and seem very interesting, *(insert my instagram name here)* maybe perhaps we could have a chat on Instagram and grap a cup of coffe together? Your under no obligation nor presure to answer. Message me if it's all good. Have a lovely day!

I'd give her the drawing and note in a small red envelope then immediately go home and hope for a reply from her.


Is this a good idea? What other way could I achive this?

It wasn't too full on, this app. I tended to get loads of messages  and asked out -over 3K. Take those numbers with a pinch of salt. I'm really particular in what I want, It was hard finding a guy that was my type so I couldn't agree to date anyone except 1 guy who was my type. 

If you genuinely want something serious then unconditional traits and chat is really important. 
I think people forget to establish what each other wants..is it a.. hook up, serious relationship, fun... What is it because it makes no sense entertaining men that just want fun when you want a serious relationship!! 

Profiles-
You get people who write the bare minimum and people who write paragraphs. 

Huge paragraphs leaves nothing to the imagination. It tells me you're well written. Do I really value someone as eloquent? Possibly not.. You're a good human, but do I want to date you?  Probably not..
If someone being well written is your thing then go for it. The way you write as well, can make it seem like you're friendzoning yourself. The way you write doesn't do it for me, I don't want to feel like I'm messaging a lecturer. 

Unconditional traits:
I think everyone has a type, things they definitely want and things they don't. No matter how superficial it is, if you can't see yourself looking past it then you should keep it as a filter so you don't waste your time with people you definitely aren't going to pursue. 

I personally believe you should get the unconditional out the way no matter what it is, so if it's religion, or any other things. If you ain't seen the persons picture possibly a feature you don't like physically. Height ...weight ..anything.. that's the only way to sieve through what you want and don't want.

So I'm the type of person who tends to know what I want, physically and. I also know what personality I want from a guy. 

I usually determine the personality based of a vibe and reverse psychology so I can get a feel of his character. 

Chatting-  
Be subtle when you're trying to figure out someone is your type. Be quick to determine the unconditional so you don't string or lead them on

Some people prefer to be friends and be really goofy initially, some people not. I rather have a spark or a build up to a spark . Usually I do this by conversing and judging you in my mind. I personally can't be attracted to someone I'm goofy around, I need to love you before I do that..

I also look at the way they talk and react to things that give me an idea of what they're like in person. 

Online dating is casual-
There is no need to go into depth on your profile. If someone really wants to get to know you based on your profile and pic then they will. 

The conversation should just flow. I can't stand being in an interview. 

How we chat to each other can be a deterrent.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,749817,public,self,Online dating isn't a job application..,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n33i2f/online_dating_isnt_a_job_application/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

She ghosted me after our first hang. Hurt a bit at the time and for some reason left me with the question of what if and all these lingering feelings toward her. 

Ran into her again earlier this year where we chatted and I asked her out again. I know, it was not the greatest idea, but I guess a part of me needed to know if she truly wasn’t interested in me or there was some other reason that she ghosted me for. 
She actually said yes when I asked her out. But then reneged later in the week. Lol I know, clear and obvious signs that she isn’t interested but this crush I have on her blinded me and I agreed to hang out with her later on. 
The first time we hung out, I felt that energy and feelings of enjoyment (crushing hard!!?!?!?) and she gave me a kiss on the cheek when we said goodbye and mannnnnnnnnn.... the next few days I could not stop thinking about her. 
Next hang was good. Delved into more emotional and personal layers, getting to know the deeper part of her and that’s when I told myself that I’m really start to like her. 

So, I told her that I have a crush on her. 
I figured it’s probably a little obvious but I needed to know where I stood. 
She said she’s sussing it out and interested but yeah.
Flat and dry response I guess. 
Just enough of a thread to hold onto, but I think deep down I knew, she wasn’t into me like I was into her. 

Anyway she was keen to hang again and I figured this is final d day. If she is weird and awkward or if she is cold and distant, I’ll know for sure. 

Saw her again today!!! Good and fun time but again nothing to go off. Several times where I wanted to kiss her, but I didn’t want to force anything and make her feel uncomfortable I guess. Maybe I was too timid but I wanted to give her the right space and not force anything. 

Right before the day ended, I asked her if I could kiss her and she declined. :(
I did also let her know that whilst I like talking to her and hanging out, I am not just interested in being friends as I definitely do feel some type of way about her and if she doesn’t feel the same way, that’s totally okay but I guess I need to know. 
She said she wanted some time to process but she gave me a call on my drive home and let me know that she doesn’t feel the same way.


So as I lay here in bed, I feel sad that it didn’t work out and that she doesn’t feel the same way. I do feel proud that I was open and honest but that doesn’t bring me much comfort at the moment.

I am 23F, and I am loooking for someone special. Maybe a special friend or something more.

I am Asian but I have zero interests in Asians so please help me. I want some affection. I wanna be loved, although it might be a long distance relationship. But I promise I will try to be the best girl and make you happy.

About me, I am from an Asian country. I am 23 years old and working as a legal assistant.

I am kinda introvert and I will be honest, I have some mental health issues (like many others)-PTSD. I dont like meeting people and prefer staying at home.

I need some motivation in life, so thats why Im writing this post.

To limit the number of messages I will get, if you feel you are fit with these criteria, feel free to send a message to me and tell me something about you rather than ""Hi"".

I don't know what I'm looking for. Just see what happens:

1. You are American/Spanish/Italian (prfered)
2. You are 25 -37 and have a job.
3. You are passionate and like showing your affection.
4. You don't care about money too much.
5. You don't lose interest fast and know how to forgive.
6. You are motivated and willing to learn and thrive.
7. You dont have any serious mental health issues
8. MOST IMPORTANT: DONT CHEAT ON ME, if you get bored with me, just say you wanna stop.

I am looking forward to hearing from you guys. Guys are the most beautiful gift GOD granted to us.

We went on few generic dates and had long phone calls,I met her sister,friends and even planned some trips in future.We are both single for a year now.She is league above me(She is lil bit popular and I was popular for being complete Idiot across schools and she probably thinks that too) and she even told me when we met first time that I am cute but not her type.
I am no better,when I complimented her I shut it off as fast as I can cause I was never in relationship before and don’t know how to progress further.
We are having fights all the time and even had one last week so I want to confess everything when we meet up again.

My (25m) partner (25f) and I dated from October of last year. At first, everything was great- we saw each other every week, we talked all the time, shared the same life passions/humor, and so on- it felt like for the first time, I really clicked with someone. I'm a second-year med student and she's a PA student, so we didn't have a ton of free time, but it seemed like we enjoyed the time we shared together. We are in a lot of similar circles (mentors and whatnot). We were also able to share war stories and our traumas. She was the first person I ever said I love you to, and she told that to me as well- I let myself imagine a future with her. 

*She has a lot (and I mean a LOT) of trauma, but for the next 5 months, I was supportive, caring, and the perfect boyfriend- I did everything possible to make sure she felt comfortable, and she appreciated it and let me know. I helped her through her insecurities about our relationship, about being cheated on in past relationships, and put up with her flakiness and refusal to make plans in advance because she was really busy. I even made special curry powders from scratch so she could share in my people's food... but she's never tried them.*

*In March, we had an incident where I made a mistake (see prior posts for context), and spiraled a bit. Since then, she's treated me like absolute shit. Saying it was ""a good thing"" when I spiraled so I might have an idea of how she felt, saying she needed time to work through things but that she still wanted me, but also calling me when she needed emotional support. Saying things like ""think of someone other than yourself"" when I talked to her about how I was feeling, attacking me and devaluing me as a person because I told her that talking through conflict with a partner helps both people move forward. Lashing out at me when I suggested that she should discuss what happened with her therapist (not a boundary in our relationship to that point)*

*Dropping the silent treatment on me, then eventually explaining that it was her plan with her therapist so I could focus on studying... but she never told me that. She's lashed out at me when she was upset. Obviously that makes me feel shitty, and she didn't respond when I called her out on it in a text (I think I said ""I'm your boyfriend, not your therapist,"" and she never responded). At this point, we haven't talked in almost 6 weeks, but we still haven't had a proper conversation about breaking up (which I think might be inevitable at this point), and I'm not sure where we stand. I'm also in my dedicated period to study for the board exams (a huge deal), and I'm just a giant ball of anxiety. I don't want to break up now, because I think it'll just stress me out more.*

**It kind of sucks that after I made one mistake, I was dead to her. She repeatedly emphasized the importance of communication in a relationship, but has essentially refused to communicate AT ALL... while at times saying that she wants to talk more, and will talk to me after boards. It is incredibly frustrating.** 

**I'm also starting to realize (thanks, therapy) that she's been manipulating me throughout our relationship- in many, many ways, and that I looked past a TON of red flags without realizing it. She's said things like ""I'm a bad partner"" when she's flaked on plans (and I reassured her she wasn't), or made me think we had plans and later told me that they never existed, or made a big deal about Christmas or birthday gifts she never tried to give me.** **She's been gaslighting me constantly and I'm just now realizing it.**

**Objectively, I know that its not my fault that I was taken advantage of, but right now... I feel guilty and kind of blame myself for falling into this trap. I feel guilty that I have let myself feel pain that wasn't mine to bear, and that I let myself be walked over and didn't advocate for myself strongly enough early in the relationship. How do I get through those feelings of guilt? I'm trying to be kind to myself and mentally move on, but I feel hurt and really shitty. I know I'll advocate for myself more in future relationships, but other than that and focusing on the boards... what do I do?**

I spent a lot ( A LOT ) of time questioning whether I was just a lesbian who felt the need to mask my queerness with a bisexual shield. I'm very straight passing and so it's easy for me to fly under the radar. However, I came to the conclusion that though there isn't a label that best describes my attraction towards people (bisexual is too limiting, pan just doesn't feel right for me, these are all my own opinions on labeling myself not the labels themselves) I still know I'm attracted to multiple genders - including cisgender, heterosexual men. I haven't dated or been with a man since I came out, and to be honest the thought of it kind of scares me.

I’ve been dating this man for about 3 months now. I’ve meet his friends, but he has yet to meet mine. Last night I hosted a small bday party for a friend (we’re all vaccinated, and it was about three couples). I asked my guy on Sunday to come and he didn’t confirm yes or no, just asked what time. Thursday night I decided to ask again. He didn’t respond again. 

So last night all my friends are asking if he’s coming, and I still have no idea. I finally just ask him what the hell was going on and he says “sorry I forgot my grandma had a thing and I had to help her clean her basement. I didn’t know I’d be there this late”. Could be true, but to me sounds like a story. It’d be one thing if he’d said he wasn’t sure if he could make it when I originally asked or even said he couldn’t go at all. 

But no, he literally waited until I called him out to give me an excuse. 

Can anyone give me advice on what to do from here? Can I straight up just tell him what he did was rude? Sure, maybe he has anxiety about meeting new people in a group setting but that doesn’t excuse the way he went about this.

I have been single for 5 years already. I started going on dating apps like Bumble and Tinder to explore and go back to the dating scene.

Then a month ago, I matched with some guys including this one (24M) on Bumble. So this guy, amongst all my other matches, he’s the one that really vibes with me. We have the same interests and values and I really enjoy talking to him. I’ve been in this app since last year and this is the first guy I genuinely clicked with.

I am just TIRED of the cycle of failed interactions I have on dating apps so I decided to cut off communication with my other matches and stick to this one (also because I am quite busy and cannot concentrate on talking to so many guys lol). However, I am not sure if he is into me the way I am into him.

We haven’t met in person as we have just started talking recently and the pandemic situation in my country isn’t getting any better so our only form of communication is through chat. He takes so much time to reply to my messages (like 3-8 hours). We also do not do the usual greetings coz he really takes so much time to reply that I end up falling asleep and replying the next day lol. He says he is busy which is understandable as we are both working professional. But it’s getting dragging for me coz we haven’t even cracked on some personal stuff or got to know our personalities. Except for one time that he casually brought up about his ‘ex’ who used to study in the same university as mine. And this ‘ex’ was a guy.

Yeah, so I figured he might be bisexual. I don’t wanna pry on him so I haven’t really asked him about it coz I want it to come from him. I want him to initiate the convo when he is comfortable. Anyway, it’s fine by me and I never really have any issues if he’s bi and this is beside the point actually, but yeah this is like the only ‘personal’ thing we have only talked about for weeks now. The other topics are just very casual talking about how’s our days etc. I feel like I’m inside a supeeeeeeeer slow burn fiction with the way this “dating” is progressing.

To be fair, he is still replying to my messages and he doesn’t seem to lose interest but I get anxious that maybe I am just assuming things and he really is not into me at all. I am not sure if I did the right thing which is focusing on this guy and cutting off my other matches. But like, again I’m tired of seeking other guys anymore and I just can’t bring myself up to interact with them again. I don’t know I’m also confused with myself and maybe insecure coz I just don’t want to end up getting my heart broken after being single for so long.

That’s all. I just wanna get this off my chest coz it really confuses me and I don’t know how I will get this uneasy feeling inside of me.

So I’m 22F and I think I’d like to get back into the dating pool eventually, but I feel rather worried about that prospect since I don’t really feel that attractive / deserving right now.

A year - year and a half ago this guy I really liked asked me out. We went on a handful of dates and it seemed to be going well, until the covid lockdown started. Then almost right away, he started ignoring me. I should’ve left him right then and there but because I didn’t really know what was going on and because I was inexperienced (he was my 1st) I kept hanging on to hope.

He broke up with me a couple months after that, and one of the things he told me was he didn’t feel for me as much as he’d felt for his ex. He told me that he’d been extremely physically / sexually attracted to his ex and not really that much with me. 

That really stuck with me. It’s been a while, and I got over him a long time ago, but I feel a lot less desirable and a lot more insecure now. What he said about his ex being more attractive still pops up in my head quite often and I feel jealous looking at other couples. I feel so petty admitting that, but it’s true. I tell myself I don’t deserve that because no one will ever be attracted to me physically. I’ve also started to belittle myself for not having a BF / being a virgin at my age.

I would really like for the negative self-talk to stop because I feel like it’s impeding on my daily life, so I’m wondering if you guys have any suggestions.

We’ve discussed kids, marriage, culture, religion, our parents’ feelings about interreligious/intercultural/interracial relationships ...Overall he is a really great candidate—I’m allowing things to slowly develop and I’m comfortable with my own feelings for him at this point (I can be anxious and/or sometimes get too excited) and happy to see where it goes. However, last time I saw him, I found a list on his desk (I wasn’t snooping... My name caught my eye) and I found a few groups of female first names written on a paper, including my own. One of the names was underlined, one of them had a dot by it, one had a big X by it, and mine had two dots by it. No clue what this means and won’t try to guess... but it’s kinda on my mind now because we aren’t hanging out on primetime nights and it makes me wonder if he knows he likes one of the others, but is continuing to see me until they DTR because more sex&gt;less sex. Now obviously as I said, I realize we are BOTH multidating and he hasn’t seen my list... and what I’m feeling is not jealousy. It’s simply... wanting to know where I stand. And I guess I would need to do the same in return. And truthfully I’m not ready to DTR, and do not expect he is either. My concern chiefly centers around the markings next to the names and a possible ranking situation. And I’m not dating for FWB.

Should I ask him about it? If he knows he is going a different direction, I assume I will eventually hear.

Even if I am watching a TV show and think ""Wow she is cute"" I feel like I am doing something wrong by even just googling her name even though this is something that I am pretty sure everyone does(?)

We’ve been talking a few months, but only started hanging out pretty recently (thanks, virus-that-shall-not-be-named!). I like him a lot, and I’m pretty confident things are going well. I’ve only dated one person before, who was a bit of a hermit with only one (also male) friend.

Okay. So the guy I’m seeing has a fair few close female friends. Guy friends, too, but that’s not super relevant here. And (sue me, yes I had a Facebook stalk) these girls are so . . conventionally attractive? Like genuinely super pretty, seem super nice, in a way that I know I’m just *not*. I’ve always been painfully insecure, and whilst I’m getting slowly better with it, I can’t help but feel anxious whenever he talks about his friends, or how great they are, or the banter they have. I also know that most of his female friends had a stalk of me on Facebook once he told them about me, which makes me more than a little self conscious 

I suppose I should emphasise here that I *know* that this is a me problem: I don’t expect him to change, or stop talking to anyone, or anything like that. I know, logically, that I wouldn’t even be in the picture if he was interested in dating any of them. This is fully my own insecurity messing with me. But I guess I’m just asking if anybody else has dealt with this before?
