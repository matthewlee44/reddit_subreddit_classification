I really loved my last boyfriend, and he was a great personality match, but we had too many incompatibilities (e.g. wanting to live in two different and VERY far apart places) for the relationship to work.

Of the dates I've gone on (mostly from dating apps), a few of them I went on just because I felt I HAD to go on dates even though I wasn't interested really. One guy I really liked, but he ended up ghosting me, which sucked. For most of the guys though, we'd go on maybe 2-3 dates and there would be sort of a mutual indifference where there just wasn't anything really there. I especially would like to find someone who shares my humor and can make me laugh, which has been tricky.

I'm starting to think maybe I'm just not someone who is really compatible with others, and I'm meant to be alone. This makes me sad, but I feel really discouraged about dating these days.

I'm an older female aspie, and I'm a bit lonely. I guess this is just psychological loneliness because many of my needs are fulfilled, just not the ones for self-esteem and self-actualization. I've been thinking about playing the dating game (not an actual game, just dating people), but I'm plagued with doubt about my own perceived self-worth. I'm not super-attractive, and I often play that up by not really doing anything to make myself pretty. It takes a lot of work for some women to make themselves pretty and in this society, it's mostly not even seen as real effort, just a sign that the woman is taking care of herself. It's short-hand for believing you're valuable even when you don't feel like you are, and I think it's kind of silly. I know the way society is trying to make me think about it, but I just don't like it. Plus, this kind of goes back to self-confidence. My self-care skills are somewhat limited. I can let myself start looking like a mess without even realizing it, and I always feel like I miss steps when concentrating on my appearance. Plus, like I said, to me it does not matter outside of the perceived societal expectations, so why should it matter to a potential mate?

Ideally, I'd like to find a creative guy who's good at what I'm not good at. Maybe someone who works in marketing or something or who has a successful YouTube channel. I'm pretty sure those kinds of guys are looking for eye candy, though, so I'm willing to settle for a guy who just has the potential to be one of those cool people but isn't yet, kind of like me.

That said, though, I'm willing to date all kinds, regardless of appearance. I know appearance can be changed. It's a person's personality that matters.

A lot of the advice on this sub is a repackaging of this timeless, infuriating, piece of shit advice. It used to make me angry. Then, after ""being yourself"" what comes next is the classic ""it's either a fuck yes, or a no"" screen to reject lukewarm interest. 

However, as I met more girls with a ""fuck yes"" attitude towards me, I noticed that my approach to dating had unconsciously changed drastically. Honestly, having encountered some success, if I had 10 seconds to give myself from 4 years ago a one-liner piece of advice, I'd say repeat the dreaded ""be yourself"" and ""it's either a fuck yes, or a no"". In retrospect, these pieces of advice seem incredibly insincere - but after going through some growth, and given just one sentence to communicate, I'd probably stick to them. Take a look at /r/wowthanksimcured. It's a subreddit dedicated to poking fun at ""wholesome"" lines of advice for people going through depression/hard times, like ""eat healthy, work out, spend time with your friends"". Versions of ""be yourself"" would fit squarely in that sub. But honestly, there is a lot of truth to most of the ""insincere"" pieces of advice on that sub, but what's missing is the context, and the months and years of growth that the quick one-liner really encapsulates. I wanted to share some of the context that I think may help with the common ""be yourself"" advice. 

* Be the best version of yourself. 

Early on, not gonna lie, I felt a lot of ""if they can't handle me at my worst, they don't deserve me at my best"". What if I suddenly got sick and fat? Would I want a partner that would leave me in my time of weakness? Do I really want someone who wants me for muscles I put on, style I develop, and wealth I accumulate? I want someone that wants me for me. This sort of thinking really sabotaged me, and I felt a lot of resistance and any ""improvement"" felt like selling myself out, conforming to societal expectations and just improving in order to get laid. What if ""myself"" was a cheeto guzzling shut-in? I wanna be me! 

I'd sit down and think about the things you genuinely enjoy. Hobbies that light fires in your eyes, and things you could talk about endlessly. Become the best in that hobby, so that you can be proud of how good you are at it. You like painting warhammer figurines? Be the best figurine-painter in your area. Meet figurine-painters in figurine-painter clubs, and have cool figurine-painting dates! 

But at this point, even this is a somewhat non-uncommon extension of ""be yourself"". You may feel some dissonance - ""What if I don't have any hobbies like that""? ""Is figurine-painting really gonna help me with dating? Are there even girls in figurine-painter groups? Are there even figurine-painter groups in my area???"". Let's go deeper. 

* Some parts of yourself are more useful for you in dating.

I used to tell everyone I'm an introvert. I read the classic ""Quiet, the power of introverts"" book, and self-identified as an introvert everywhere I went. I looked for introvert partners, or otherwise an ""extrovert looking for an introvert"" types. Really, I vibed with all the ""social battery"" memes and loved the stories of the couples ""who were comfortable and lovingly sitting in silence"". However, I noticed that if I went too long without socializing, I sunk into a depression. Diagnosing this was incredibly difficult - before every gathering I'd feel anxious, and even at the gathering after a while, I'd be screaming internally to leave, and after I'd feel a wave of relief. Even as an introvert, socializing was something I needed, and ultimately a part of who I was as a human being - albeit a part of myself that was weaker than most people's. Realizing I needed something that caused me a lot of anxiety in the past was an incredibly dissonant thing for me - and 4-years-ago-me would have scoffed at the idea of ""enjoying"" something I was so afraid of. 

Objectively, ability to socialize, a fit body, a sense of fashion, and humor are some examples of qualities that are useful for dating. And like me - you may feel that these are qualities that don't really describe you, and feel like there's no part of you that embodies one or more of these characteristics. You may feel like you're faking it when you work towards one of these qualities. I personally resented that qualities I didn't really care about nor possessed were so ""desirable"". But these qualities are ""desired"" for a reason, and seeing that reason, and understanding why it was desirabl, sometimes necessary for natural human existence and something that could be enjoyed took a lot of self aware mental restructuring. Which brings me to my next point.

* Watch others who are ""being themselves"" and slaying it. Try to understand why they enjoy ""being themselves"". 

Some time ago, I learned my rando roomate was a huge gym bro and party animal. I immediately unconsciously didn't like him, and thought he was a vain prick. When I was in zoom classes, I'd hear him having sex in the room across mine. But he ended up being quite the friendly guy, and somehow managed to drag me to the gym with him. I'd listen to him talk about deadlift form in the car, as he ranted about how it was SO important in preventing injury. He'd talk about being really proud of his hamstrings, and he that he considered his body a nonstop project he was always working on. And one day, he made a comment about how I had really nice biceps despite never having worked out. And that really got to me. **I** had nice biceps? I found myself low-key doing a lot of arm work. When I walked I found myself flexing my arm and thinking, damn I do have nice biceps. It became a point of pride, and something I looked forward to working. And this was a gateway workout of sorts - I found myself then finding little moments of pride in achievements at gym, and one day I found myself passively just listening to gym podcasts. And like Alex had said, a good deadlift was suddenly looking lowkey kinda beautiful. What the fuck had I become? 

* What ""yourself"" is is flexible. 

I realized I was really pigheaded. Firm in my beliefs of what ""myself"" was. Unaware of what my needs were as a human being. On the lookout for some magical partner that would love ""me"". Judgemental of others that were ""selling out to get laid"". Through a healthy dose of growth, I've discovered that ""myself"" was a flexible thing that changes slowly over time without myself realizing it. If someone came up to me and asked for a one-liner advice for dating / self improvement, it would be ""be yourself"".

Thanks to those who stick around.)


I (21M) have fallen in love only once in my life and this happened just 3 months ago. I didn't know many girls in my life, but I also never really liked any of those that I knew.
But 3 months ago, me and my 3 schoolmates started going to a new bar on daily basis (and we still continue to do so), where I met the waitress that I developed a crush on. I never felt those emotions before in my life and I didn't know how to react to them. I lost a lot of weight and couldn't sleep anymore, making me miserable. I did nothing for these past 3 months. I didn't study, didn't attend exams... I knew I couldn't ignore my responsibilities anymore. I had to ask her if she had feelings for me so I could finally breathe, doesn't matter what answer she would give me.

I asked her if she had any interest, and she said that I was a nice guy but she didn't like me that way. I accepted that quickly. She didn't like me. It's time to move on.

She was mean to me from the start, but I always thought we had a playful chemistry, always roasting each other. She would always joke how she would never go out with me, but I always thought she was saying that because she wanted to hide her true intentions in front of my friends. I didn't think she would be telling the truth because that's a little cruel. Every time when friends left the bar to go smoking, she would joke ""dont leave me with him alone!"".

I always thought we had great chemistry. We would both laugh while roasting each other, having a good time.

On her birthday, her friends even arranged a little blind date for shits and giggles, inviting all 4 of us guys to be the dates. The event was badly set up and she immedeatly knew who each of us were, but played along.  Already on the first asnwer she said that I'm not the one. But again, I thought she was into me and she was mean to hide the sharade from everyone.

There is so many of these little things that happened but I swear to god I genuenly thought she liked me, as she was extremely friendly to me. Always. She said mean things but it always seemed light hearted.

But after the rejection, I quickly moved on. As I knew my fantasy was an impossibility, I lost crush on her. We decided that this would never be mentioned and we would continue our life as if nothing happened.
And so we did.

But now, nearly two weeks after rejection she still says these mean things. But now that I know she jokes about the truth, it's killing me inside. I don't have a crush on her anymore, but it still hurts. A lot. Just today my friend said he looks terrible on pictures and the waitress suggested he should take a photo next to me (as if I'm that ugly he would look good next to me). I'm just so hurt.

I'm starting to hate her from the bottom of my heart. But no, it's not that easy to just get her out of my life. I wish I could walk away but doing so I will waste half the day in the dorm alone.

She is the only woman I ever liked. She is not my crush anymore, but I am still hurt. And the hardest thing of all is  acting like I'm happy in front of both her and my friends. I laugh at everything, but on the inside I just crave the sweet release of death. (to be a little dramatic)

There is so much more that happened, but I don't want to write a second bible here. If anything is unclear, I will respond to the comments.

What can a man in my situation even do? Getting her out of my life is impossible. This is a small town and I can't just leave. The bar is also a hotspot for everyone in town to meet.

I have tried to help but he tells me im just a bother. and past two months he’s been putting his friends or video games above me as well as saying that I’m  too needy bc I wanted to talk to him for a little bit. He has said multiple times that we should break up or things along that but then take it back and says that it’s a reflex when he gets mad.

2 months ago, we went out to dinner and talked for 3 hrs on first meet up. We were in contact via Instagram messages. Then we talked on the phone to buy tickets &amp; see the Spider-Man movie. The day before movie I asked if he could stop sending those IG video reels politely, it was a bit overboard. On day of movie, he said good morning and I replied with a wave emoji. He normally would continue the conversation via Instagram but doesn’t message again until he said he was waiting at the theater. I was not as bubbly as I was on first meet up , I was very quiet (not against him). He was annoying me during the movie, he’s the type to laugh and make noises when something exciting came on. He nudged me during the movie and asked if I was ok because I was quiet and I said yes. At the end I told him thanks, he said you’re welcome and he said drive safe. When I spoke with him on phone day before movie, he told me that he talked about me with his friends but after movie he sent a message just now saying that he wasn’t really feeling it from me and it’s not going to work for him. I was more upset that he beat me to rejecting him, I would have done it if he didn’t. Flash fwd to a month ago, he sends me a dm with an inside joke, I just left him on read again.

What to do?

So, I am dating a girl. 

I tried holding her hand to gauge her reaction. She let me but she did not hold my hand on her own. She does not initiate the goodbye kiss. She told me that she is oblivious to romantic cues, that holding hands comes as an ""unnatural"" gesture for her. She continues to date me, like proactively. But she also told me that she does not know yet were and if this is going in a romantic direction. On the other hand she also told I am not the problem ( like she does not do those gestures with other men, so i believe that's the way she rolls) That she does not rush but prolonging too much will not do any good. Dates are great. She told me quality time is her love language, physical touch not at all. Maybe gestures of affection ( i don't understand how affection and touch can not go hand in hand). But she told me her sex drive is higher than average ( I asked her that). 

Last date I wanted to do a step back and wait for her to start initiating things, but I am realizing I will wait in vain. I don't feel it to even kiss her on the lips if she is not proactive, but on the other hand I realize everyone is different and I might as well try and kiss/sex and see how this pans out, worst case scenario she rejects me. 

My biggest gripe here is that she is in between, not all in but not refusing either. I don't feel like going the next step, but she is super cute and hot, but if she does not give me something, I might even not feel like doing it but maybe it will be awesome?

I have a friend she’s a year younger than me (17M) and is a sophomore in high school. She and I met last year on the set of our school’s radio play we did in place of an actual play. She and I hit it off almost immediately and became best friends almost immediately. I got to meet her whole family and been invited to a few parties at her place and every time, she ends up being closest to me. At school, she walks with me to my car and will give me a hug before I go. She loves to read my writings and is always so excited to hear my ideas, and I love reading her writing and watching her act. Last weekend, she stole my coat and wrapped herself around my arm while we walked across the University campus our drama department was performing at for a convention. She complimented my voice and says it was “soothing.” Now, that I’m quarantining after testing positive a few days ago, she said she missing me and just wants to hug me again. 

A few months ago, I met her boyfriend and he’s a very nice kid, but I haven’t seen or heard her say anything about him since then.

It’s getting a bit difficult. We had a bit of a rocky start to our relationship because of them hooking up with someone else early on - we had just had our first date and definitely weren’t anything close to exclusive, but it didn’t sit great with me.

I made a conscious choice to look past that because they told me it was an old hookup and bootycall, and to be fair that night I went to a party without them and they told me they assumed I would be hooking up too . 

Fast forward to now and it’s been a beautiful six or seven months and we’ve almost moved in together at this point, I stay at their place for work a lot (3-5 nights a week) and we love our mornings together and talk about getting a place and what we want our careers to look like. We say I love you constantly. We’ve met each other’s parents.

But sometimes they tell me about how kinky their past has been and it’s not really a turn on for me it’s just like…. Sort of gross? like it makes/made me look at them a bit different and I’m having trouble dealing with it. I haven’t brought it up because it doesn’t seem like something that can be changed really on their end. They told me the stuff and now I can’t unhear it… so I’ve kind of figured I have to deal with it internally. 

It’s a weird situation I haven’t been in- this partner is the first I’ve ever been with who’s more sexually experienced than I am. And I was fine with it until I got some of the details that made me cringe.

If I was blind to the details of their history I would be happy as a clam…even knowing they had more partners than me by a lot, but it makes me wonder if they want that kind of sex from me? And it makes me wonder about the rest of our compatibilities. 

A caveat: I graduate college in may, and I have a job that will likely promote me to full time when I do. I live with my parents and they have their own place, and when I go full time my partner expects me to get my own place. I’d rather move in together. I get that they think it’s too soon, but our conversations about the future seem insincere if they don’t want to move in together at this point (or more accurately in another 4-6 months) It makes me wonder what the hang up is and I can’t help but feel like it’s partly the sexual chemistry or lack of. It sucks because the sex is great - it just feels like there’s a level they want to go to that I don’t even find attractive. I find that level …. Unattractive in the nicest phrasing possible. 

TLDR: my romantic partner used to have what I consider gross sex and it’s a turn off for me and I’m having trouble getting past it. Also, their timeline for living together concerns me.

I replied  ( 11:00 AM) :cool, How's 3 PM on your end?

 Didn't hear back til 5 ish.. I  politely replied: Let's hang when you are back from LA, be safe &amp; have fun. 

 Not a cricket... On Wednesday he send a text: How are you? To which i replied : Out here slaying dragons. How are you?

....... Nothing

Then Friday/ today  he sends a text :  googly eyes..... To which i didn't answer

Romantic connections take TIME to develop. 99% of the time you shouldn’t be expecting to fall in love with a total stranger from a dating app after a quick 2 hour date. 

This is problem with dating now a days is everyone is looking for instant gratification instead of actually taking the time to get to know one another. Now if the person did something wrong or super creepy then sure, let them down easy; but if you actually had a somewhat decent time then go out for a 2nd or even 3rd date.

My backstory:

I fell in love. Like as hard as you can when you're 17. Had the time of my life. Didn't cheat but I was an asshole, I know. We broke up. If I could change my behavior I would. It wouldn't have lasted till the end but I feel sorry still. Young, dumb, etc. Ended in very good terms. I just became something I didn't want to be and they felt the same way. Became an asshole without regard of other beings feelings. Wouldn't write this if I one of us felt different. Couldn't handle this kind of love at that age. Completely my fault. Can't blame depression or anything else - I'm just an asshole.

Couple of years go by.

I'm turning 24 this year. I figured I'm not a ""relationship type"". I can not sustain interest in one person for a long time. I started having one night stands 2 years ago. I hated it. Having these ""walk of shames"" every weekend. Tried having FWBs. Not my thing.

I used to say ""Women do not get along with me, I don't get along with women"" 'cuz it waa my truth. But from my very limited experience: Women like me and I like women. A lot to be honest. Both ways.

The HOW:

I always make sure that those women who sleep with me know what's up. I always say before the conversations lead to something else that I'm not the type of guy you build a family with or that I'm not that good of a guy. I thought that me making this clear would tell these wonderful women my intentions and would lead to them to understanding that I'm not looking for anything else than sexual relations.

No, the complete opposite happens. I haven't had ONE one night stand or a date that would not result in these women liking me more than I do them. I end up being the asshole even though I make sure they know what they're getting into.

These sexual relations usually last a month or two and usually kind of simultaneously. I ALWAYS TELL IF THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE. I can't decide if I'm more annoyed at myself or them because I told them. I feel so fucking bad telling these beautiful women that I'm not looking for anything serious. Usually (not Always) they cry or make a scene. I feel even worse after that. I feel like I'm being an asshole although I'm just speaking my mind. Although I already told them what I'm about.

The question

How can I make sure this doesn't happen anymore? How can I make sure these wonderful women don't have to feel bad because of me? I'm trying my best to be the adult who tells what they're looking for. AND I always tell them that. Still, I end up feeling like a bad guy. I hate myself for telling them I'm through with them. How can I make this easier?

So been dating him for over a year now and 6 months of it being ldrs. We’ve (20M)(21F) had our ups and downs up it was a nice relationship. 
Even though one of my love language is quality time, which being having to spend time only the two of us and having some sort of “us” thing he’s okay with not having those. He’s fine with it if I’m around him while doing other stuff (like be on call and do whatever ). So I’d watch him play games and stuff but he would never put effort in having an us thing. He’d always say I only want to watch movies irl with you. But I used to love out movie dates. We haven’t done that in 8 months since he said he wants to take a break from it for a while. He won’t listen to music with me. The only time we have “us” time is when he wants to jerk off on call. Idk if it’s okay to feel like this is a deal breaker for me. I’ve been talking about it to him, told him straight that ‘ I want more quality time with you. I want ‘us’ thing like we used to. It doesn’t have to be movies but I wanna do more than just look at you gaming or talking with your friends or you sleeping. It’s not my way of quality time and I don’t feel satisfied how we spend time. I feel like I haven’t had quality time since June(months ago )’

Which he responded with ‘ it’s hard coordinating all of it into our lives with the time difference and me working ‘ which I totally understand but I’m not asking for us thing every day. He has time to play games at least 3 hours daily. He’d play up to 6 hours sometimes and all day on off day. I told him I just want us to do something for like 30 mins a week only. He always seems hesitant when I talk about these stuff. Makes me feel like I’m asking too much. He watches movies with his friends, play games , listen to them vent, listen to music with them but won’t do any of those with me when he knows I love those too, except gaming which I tried to play with him in the past. 

When I think about us having smth compatible, it’d be our sexuality but he does it too much with me which I don’t want when I don’t have the quality time I need. We have different religions, I’m an atheist and he’s very religious. I don’t want kids, he wants one. He eats meat and I’m vegetarian.

Context - 
29F matched with 26M on a dating app - instant connection, talked everyday. FaceTimed for 3+ hours, met up and spent great time together. Kissed.

Background - 
After ten days, he said that he wanted to get exclusive which seemed a bit fast. Prior to this, he had had only 1 serious relationship and  slept around a lot due to travel and was struggling with a potential UTI at the time and was honest about it. I let it all go because I don’t judge people and also because he was super attentive, sweet and emotionally open towards me. 
I told him that although I like him a lot I would like to know him a bit better before getting exclusive with him although I’m not talking with anyone else. I also made it clear I’m looking for a serious relationship and don’t prefer sleeping around casually.  He agreed and said he wanted the same thing. This didn’t change anything between us and we would talk every day on phone. We even mean to Valentine’s plans together.

The trigger - 
Two days ago we were speaking on the phone and I found that they were a lot of silences in between and I was trying to fill them. So after the call, I, in a very civil fashion asked him, “hey-  did you did you feel that we kind of ran out of topics to talk about today? Or is it in my head”. 
I was trying to open a dialogue for communication and to understand if this is just not in my head. 

His reaction- 
I think this made him react in a very weird way. He said he might not be the right person for me because he thinks I want an engaging man. He said that we made too soon. And I just could not believe it 
. So I told him that if he wants an out,  he can just say that instead of deciding ego is the right kind of man for me. After this, he flip-flopped and said that maybe he should just look for friendship with me and then he says no, he wants to be in a relationship with me and work towards it.

Then he asked me if I was still good for our V day date and I replied with, “more than the date, I’d like him to assess what he really wants here” because what he was saying was very frustrating. Before this he had been a very sure person and I don’t know what made him behave in this bizarre way. 

So he says he’d like to work on friendship with me and goes to sleep and makes a comment about how my dog won’t ever let me down??!!! . By this point, I was raging and sent him a long text about how I’m trying to openly communicate while he’s playing with my emotions and giving up on this. 

And guys… he didn’t even reply. Just blocked me. Like that. 

My side  - 
At any point I was not trying to trigger him. I just wanted to have an open dialogue and get his feedback if I could improve and fill in the gaps. I also told him that I’m very interested in the things he likes and even though I don’t know a lot about them, I am willing to learn. I don’t know what made him lose it. What hurts me is that after all the exaggerating words about how much he likes me and wants to be there for me (he used to say things like, “this is your new normal”. “I would never give up on you”. “I’d never sleep without resolving an issue”)  , I just can’t believe he blocked me without closure. I’m hurt and don’t know how to deal. Was this all a clever ruse to sleep with me? Or did I make a mistake by being honest with him? Should I confront him? 

Tldr- Guy with history of sleeping around says he wants a relationship with the woman who has made it clear that she wants a relationship and does not sleep around in a casual fashion. He is attentive, emotionally open, and very nice to talk to. However, one day, our conversation triggers him to lash out  in a very unpredictable manner and he eventually blocks me without closure.

Venting plus need advices 

So been dating him for over a year now and 6 months of it being ldrs. We’ve (20M)(21F) had our ups and downs up it was a nice relationship. 
Even though one of my love language is quality time, which being having to spend time only the two of us and having some sort of “us” thing he’s okay with not having those. He’s fine with it if I’m around him while doing other stuff (like be on call and do whatever ). So I’d watch him play games and stuff but he would never put effort in having an us thing. He’d always say I only want to watch movies irl with you. But I used to love out movie dates. We haven’t done that in 8 months since he said he wants to take a break from it for a while. He won’t listen to music with me. The only time we have “us” time is when he wants to jerk off on call. Idk if it’s okay to feel like this is a deal breaker for me. I’ve been talking about it to him, told him straight that ‘ I want more quality time with you. I want ‘us’ thing like we used to. It doesn’t have to be movies but I wanna do more than just look at you gaming or talking with your friends or you sleeping. It’s not my way of quality time and I don’t feel satisfied how we spend time. I feel like I haven’t had quality time since June(months ago )’

Which he responded with ‘ it’s hard coordinating all of it into our lives with the time difference and me working ‘ which I totally understand but I’m not asking for us thing every day. He has time to play games at least 3 hours daily. He’d play up to 6 hours sometimes and all day on off day. I told him I just want us to do something for like 30 mins a week only. He always seems hesitant when I talk about these stuff. Makes me feel like I’m asking too much. He watches movies with his friends, play games , listen to them vent, listen to music with them but won’t do any of those with me when he knows I love those too, except gaming which I tried to play with him in the past. 

When I think about us having smth compatible, it’d be our sexuality but he does it too much with me which I don’t want when I don’t have the quality time I need. We have different religions, I’m an atheist and he’s very religious. I don’t want kids, he wants one. He eats meat and I’m vegetarian. 

We’ve talked about not having kids and he’s fine with me being an atheist and I respect him being religious. We’ve talked about me not helping with meat dishes and stuff. They all might work out but I feel like I’m forcing it sometimes but it also feels like it’s worth all the hard work.

Because of how much he doesn’t care about my type of quality time,I don’t see any compatibility in us anymore but he keeps saying I’m the most compatible person he has found and doesn’t want to let go when I tried to break things off. I can’t even go meet him or close the distance for a few years. He’d say he’s okay with it then would say stuff like “ you know if you had 10000$,you can come here and we can struggle together’ 
Idk if I’m being wrong but I feel like he’s being selfish and only sees his needs and wants like wanting me there just because he went there and not even wanting to wait a while. He would push me and pull me many times. Sometimes acts like I’m his whole life and then would be like ‘ I’m sure other dudes will be better for you I hate how I can’t wish you to be happy ‘

I was so wary of him at first. For months he chased me. When I wouldnt initiate much, he was the one who kept pushing to talk more, saying he wanted me to talk to him more. Saying he thought he was annoying me. Felt like he actually wanted to get to know me. Finding all these things we have in common. They're things that really help me feel like myself (I was guarding those in the first year to protect myself). But he kept finding more and more. Commenting on the art I make, thought we shared values, humour. Getting emotional, telling me when he was sad too.

And its so fucking hard hard because those things we had in common, they were all like my main ways I even cope. They are the things that made me feel like myself.

And now I cant even play it. Sharing these things meant so much to me. Anime as well. Cant fucking watch it. I cant make art cause he was always commenting on my works and being really supportive.

When I was pointing it out that we found all these things in common, he wasn’t even acknowledging any of that. Feels like he doesn’t even care even tho he kept finding things. It clearly didn’t even mean as much to him. I feel so stupid. He doesn’t seem to want to admit that

And  my first job I got into was at a 5 star resort and the management was Hella shitty, I was burnt out everyday and it only lasted a month and a half. During that time my girlfriend told me that it's not gonna work and I need to get out of there.
  So I did, and after a few weeks more and more weird arguments started. And she has cheated on me before but I've forgiven her. More over I was just star struck about how she told me to take a break after an year of our relationship. And she comes back a few days later and tells me that she did it with another guy and I was heart broken. I begged her to stay and she didn't, thus I left her. Dated someone else on the get go. I didn't know I got myself Into a rebound and once I did I told the new girl to give me some space. Two days later she already started datin another guy.
   Now I'm just dumb founded. I've been there for these people and when I'm at my lowest they just decided to leave me just like that. I'm not saying I didn't have feelings for the new girl. I genuinely loved her, and that's why I didn't feel okay about the fact I got into a rebound. A few weeks past by and I asked her after a lot of complications. What actually happened ( my previous girlfriend ) and she told me that she just fell out off love and didn't want to hurt me. Instead she just demolished the whole building I was working on. For almost two years I've been bustin my ass open for her and she just screws me over. And I just knew she found someone else. 
  Since then my mental health and everything has been so messed up ever since. I don't know what to do. Even if I try to improve my life ( exercise or eat healthy and eat atleast three meals ) I keep relapsing and messing myself up. I don't know what to feel because I keep feeling a lot of emotions. Especially when I do the things that keep me alive. Anyone got advice for a pice of shit like me.

Hello beautiful (and handsome) people of Reddit!

I met my (30F) boyfriend (28M) almost 7 months ago. We have been officially together and dating for almost 4 months. The relationship is great! We make each other happy, we really care about each other, and all the other good juicy relationship things.

For background purposes: I live in south central Maryland and met him when he was living in DC. He moved in October to northern VA. From the start of the relationship, he stated that he wanted to take things slow. I, having more relationship experience, was okay with this. This is his longest relationship where I have been in multiple relationships of varying length with the longest one being 5 years. We have had many a conversation about what is the right amount of time to spend with each other. He's fine with getting together once a week and he told me if I needed more to let him know. I was fine with once a week earlier on, but as we have known each other and been exclusive for several months, I let him know I needed more. We compromised at a minimum we would see each other once during the week and once on the weekend of every week (it usually ends up being more). He doesn't have a car so nine times out of ten I go see him and not looking to do the 45-minute drive (one way) more than a couple times a week. I have  cats and my own things to do at my place.

ANYWAYS . . .

Valentine's Day is coming up and so is my birthday (February 18). Even though my birthday is super close it Valentine's Day, I always like the two to be separated as opposed to one combined celebration of the two. When I asked about celebrating Valentine's Day he was very sour towards the holiday, but that is not what this post is about and a whole other post. 

I will mention here that for our first Valentine' Day together, his parents are coming to visit. Not just for the day, but from the Friday before Valentine's all the way through President's Day weekend. His mom's birthday is on February 15. His parents like me. His dad likes to ""bust my chops"", but I have met them on more than one occasion and they both really like me. 

So, my boyfriend texted me on Monday saying that he was looking at his calendar, and with all the events going on that week, I was essentially asking to hang out for more than half the week and that was making him feel congested (his wording, not mine). I asked to hang out Super Bowl Sunday, Valentine’s Day, Friday (my birthday), and one day on the weekend. For as long as we have known each other I thought he would be excited at the opportunity and “excuses” to hang out with me that much in one week. Obviously, that wasn't the case. To make a long story short, today we decided to hang out Super bowl Sunday (and we're making tiramisu as a surprise for his mom's birthday), he made reservations for Valentine's dinner on Wednesday (since the restaurant was already all booked for Valentine's Day and his mom's birthday being on Tuesday), and then we will figure out hanging out for my birthday (my parents are coming up on the weekend to go out to lunch and he agreed to join us). 

On a call with my boyfriend and his parents, his parents reassured us that when they are visiting, they are not there to get in our way and if we want meet up on a certain day and do something or go somewhere that that would be fine. They wouldn't even mind if I was there when they got there on Friday.

After his parents left the phone call, he said despite what his parents said, we are still sticking to the days we planned to hang out. This meant that we would not be hanging out this week (and it wouldn't hurt getting to see him ON Valentine's Day). I mentioned that I wasn't happy about that and it would be nice to see him one more time before his parents got there. He replied, ""Why do you push me like that?"" Then followed up with, ""You're clingy."" I replied, ""That's not clingy."" I continued to say how I understood that it wasn't going to happen. Then he said, ""It's hard to say no to a cute girl, with big puppy dog eyes. I mean big ""kitten"" eyes (because we like cats) and who has a prefect chest (although he didn't say ""chest""). I said I was using open, honest, communication to share how I feel. Then he said maybe we can use open, honest, communication to get to a healthier place. I asked him what he meant by that and he said he didn't know and that he wasn't paying attention (sometimes he will start playing video games while we are talking, I don’t mind as long as he can hold and continue the conversation) and that he would talk to me later.

To summarize, am I clingy? 

Tl/dr: I am I too clingy for wanting to hang out with my boyfriend one day during the week before his parents get there and on Super Bowl Sunday, Valentine’s Day, my birthday (Friday) and a day during my birthday weekend while his parents are there (when his parents said they are not there to get in our way)?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158501,public,self,Am I clingy?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sqhyuf/am_i_clingy/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I met this girl two weeks or so ago and we have been getting on pretty well it seems up til now.

She was flaky on some plans yesterday. I was going to go to her dorm for a little bit, chat, and help her set up her room. Then she texts me and asks ""Hey, can you come over later?"" I ask what time and it takes her two hours to respond.

Although it wasn't anything major I still planned on getting to her dorm in a reasonable amount of time, I could have called my parents and gotten other work done, but I was too worried to do any of that. Apparently one of her friends called her in a panic and she was consoling them, which is fine to me since I believe in always taking care of your people first, but then she told me after that situation her roommate took her out for dinner and that she had just gotten back, and that felt disrespectful.

But we still spent time together that night about 4 hours later than planned. We went on a run together, set up her room, and had some tea.

Now, for the second part. For about a 4 days we have been planning on getting together this weekend. The plan was to go for a long walk on the beach and then relax and watch a movie at my place with some wine and her favorite snacks. But today she said in passing that she plans on doing nothing the whole weekend. When I asked her directly about our plans this weekend, apparently she needs time for ""self-improvement,"" i.e., meditation, fitness, and avoiding alcohol, but she still ""might"" come. Then she stated that she ""might"" be bipolar or depressive, asked for me to not tell anyone, and I was very understanding since I've dealt with many people like that in my life. I told her ""We don't always have to drink when we're together and I am always here for you."" We are both military and bipolar disorder is a fast track to becoming a civilian so I guess what she said is a sign of trust. But in this situation I wonder if it's just a creative way of being a flake.

Although she did seem down today, this morning she was not as energetic as normal, so I guess she is going through something. But my way of fixing that with the other depressive people in my life is distracting them, taking them out to do something nice, and just keep them talking. She isn't much of a texter either which is fine but it will be hard to get her to open up about what's going on if she decides to lock herself away this weekend.

Anyways if she doesn't come this weekend what should I say to her? 

If I'm going to get in a relationship I want good communication and I want to make it clear that is an expectation of mine. Plus I wonder if I am being a bit too harsh in my mind for the first situation since we did end up getting together again that night. If she is going the depressive route tomorrow, I plan on dropping off some snacks at her door and then I'll give her a third chance next weekend, does that seem reasonable?

I wanted to come home to someone and see their face, talk to them, hold them, ask about their day or plan a fun day together. 
But it doesn't matter If you are smart, pretty, funny, fit, normal.

But I realized, love doesn't exist anymore like it use to. People so easily dispose other people, they go on apps and find someone new for causual dating or hooks ups now. People don't want simple  cute dates or just to spend time anymore. 
People want accessible, easy, convenient to help their needs and urges. 
No love involved anymore. People don't value or want kind, warm hearted People anymore it's outdated now. 
Relationships are meaningless and no longer needed. No one doesn't do that anymore.

I learned that love is pain, people just want to physically/mentally abuse others or scam them and waste your time by exploiting your vulnerabilities. 
There's nothing to love anymore, people just settle for anything, it's mostly lust and friendship, nuy no actually love. It's been an illusion to believe you are wanted and make more kids to bring in the world.

And people say ""you'll find someone,"" or 
""There's plenty of fish,"" 
Is like saying, ""there's food in the fridge, but nothing to eat,"" or telling a homeless person, ""there's plenty of houses,"" they don't understand, dating was easy to them.

I will be alone, even surrounded with people I'm still alone and should just accept my loneliness, be a hermit I was destined to be.

It crushes my heart everytime I think about.
Like a painful ache just squeezing it. My heart just doesn't  want to accept that reality. My heart wants to connect, feel loved and care for, but it doesn't understand  that people don't do that anymore. People want to abuse or hurt us
No one wants us

No other heart beat to lay next to or listen too. That warmth we crave so much, doesn't exist anymore in this cold world. There's no other fire to be next too.

So, I (23F) matched with this guy (24M) on hinge around mid-December and we sent back long paragraphs of messages about once a day for 2 weeks. Finally, it got to the point where I wanted to know if he wanted to meet up so I asked him out and gave him my number. 

I didn’t hear from him for a week on the app, but it was over Christmas so I didn’t read too much into it. We then set up a date for early January. 

It was nice, we talked and had a good time. He walked me to my car and I initiated a hug since he seemed a little awkward/shy. Before he left, he asked me on another date and I agreed. He did say he had a busy week and was going on a work trip so I knew there was gonna be a gap between dates. By the time I drove home from the date he already texted me that he had a nice time and mentioned the second date. 

So I continued to text him the week after the date, but his response time slowed even though the texts were still lengthy. I knew he was busy but I was also worried he was losing interest. I then texted him the week after the date asking when he was leaving for his work trip. He said he was leaving the same morning and that he hopes I have a good week. 

I chose to stop texting him then since he was going on a trip and I didn’t want to bother him. I figured he would text me when he got home but he never did. He sent the last text but we both just kinda stopped texting each other after his trip. 

Fast forward to now, it’s been almost a month since our first date. There’s still interest there on my side but I’ve been a little scared to reach out. 

So I guess I’m wondering if it’s worth reaching out to see if he’s still up for the second date. Would you respond to someone after a month of no contact? We didn’t leave things on bad terms, it just seems like there was bad timing in the way. Guys, how would you feel if a girl reached out about a date after not talking for a month?

If we match on a dating app, and I stop responding, don’t go out of your way to find my social media accounts. Respect the other person’s privacy and move on, try to connect with someone else instead.


I matched with someone on bumble a few days ago, didn’t feel much of a connection and I stopped replying but actually ended up deleting my account as a whole. And I didn’t think of “deleting” my match with him prior. 


I just received a follow request on Instagram, and it’s from the same guy. My Instagram handle is NOT on my bumble bio. My first and last name are not posted on my Instagram, just a username (and it’s a nickname), and we didn’t exchange numbers.


This kind of behavior is honestly really creepy. Some of you need to take a better hint that usually no response= no interest. That shouldn’t be an opportunity to further go out of your way and find someone. Don’t search people on other social media outlets and try to intervene when the silence already speaks volumes.

I do try to avoid eye contact with them if I see their head turn towards me, I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable. i did have a girl tell me I looked good last year, but I think i'm pretty average.

anyway, i'd like to do something about it, ill try to keep it simple, but i'd like to provide detail.

tldr at bottom tho

* Girl one is the girl i'd definitely like to go out with. A lot of common interests, same sports, same classes etc. Plus, she's really pretty.  

   * She was glancing at me last semester (definitely at me, she would do it even when i was sitting alone), so i talked to her in class a few days, asked for her number, but then she didn't text me back.
   * I wait a couple of weeks, and now she is looking over more frequently.
   * I can't talk to her now so I text again, and after she was pretty much glancing at me any chance she could get, plus messing with her hair a lot.
   * I didn't get a chance in class to talk to her before the semester ended, but I eventually found out she couldn't text me because of her parents from a mutual friend.
   * Said mutual friend made it seem like this would no longer be an issue this semester, I just don't have a class with her anymore.
   * I do sometimes see her around the halls, and I have seen her still glance towards me, not every time but definitely looking at me, i'm usually alone. Problem is, she's always with at least one of her friends.  


1. does it seem like she was/still is interested? 2. If i get a chance to talk to her again and it seems she still wants to talk to me, im planning on asking her out. But, it's the middle of winter so I have no good ideas. I'm not a coffee person, but what is something like a coffee date or a good idea?

* girl 2 I don't really know yet, but she sits one desk in front of me, one desk to the right in one of my classes. The thing is, this girl is insanely attractive. I've seen her instagram, she does professional photo shoots, sometimes in a swimsuit, and she's like A list movie star kind of attractive.  

   * For the first few weeks of the semester she didn't say anything to me, I didn't say anything to her.
   * One day last week, she ends up talking to my friend who sits in front of me. I guess she must've noticed me, because later that period she quickly glanced over her shoulder multiple times, and when she got up to get ready to leave, she stood where she could face me and looked at me maybe 3 times as she walked past.
   * This week, she was only in class twice. The first day, she talked to my friend maybe a couple of times, but each time i'm pretty sure her eyes glanced towards me a few times when she did so.
   * Later when we were working on an assignment, she turns around in her seat to ask me a question. My friend answers first, but she just straight up ignores him and waits for me to answer. It was also a really simple answer too, she probably didn't really need to ask.
   * The second day, she doesn't talk to me, but there were multiple times where my friend and I were having a conversation and she looked directly at me, even when she wasn't part of the conversation or I wasn't even talking.  

      * I've never really had to flirt before, what do I say? she's also more popular than me, and I don't really know her yet so I don't really know if it's even gonna work out. Also... what the hell is she doing why is a really pretty girl trying to talk to me lmao
* These aren't the only two that seem to glance at me, for instance there's a girl in my math class and a club i'm in, she glances my direction really often during club meetings, and often when she's doing so I'm standing alone waiting, so i think she's looking at me.  

   * during math, she sits a few rows in front of me. She does turn around to talk to her friends, she could be looking at me then but idk for sure, it's pretty normal for her to do that. She has come to check answers with me during group quizzes, and i haven't noticed her do that for anyone else.
* In my history class, there are like 3 girls that sometimes look towards the back corner where I sit. There is a kid in front of me who kinda might block their view, and a whiteboard with the week's lesson plan on it to the right, but that board is in front of me, not in my corner.  

   * one girl looks over her shoulder where see might see the corner where i sit for prolonged periods of time, but i've seen her glance towards me multiple times when waiting around before class.
   * another girl who occasionally turns her head, but also spent a whole counselor meeting repeatedly looking at the table I was sitting at (I was sitting alone)
   * another who occasionally looks towards the back corner, though when she was presenting something to the class once, we were sitting in a big circle and made eye contact with me multiple times. I was looking at her because I was listening, otherwise she looked at the teacher, or her notes.

I guess my biggest question is why i'm interesting enough that multiple girls seem to want to look at me. I definitely don't think i'm ugly, but I also definitely don't think i'm super attractive, and I don't often put myself in a position to draw attention to myself.

tldr:

part 1 girl who used to stare at me no longer in my class, I asked for her number, got it, but can't use it because of her parents, I wanna go out with her, what should I do

part 2 really pretty girl glancing at me more than normal, talks to my friend who sits in front of me, but sometimes glances at me when doing so. One day completely ignores friend to turn around and talk to me, and since then she directly looks at me when I'm talking to friend, even when i'm not talking or she's not part of the conversation, what should I do

part 3 four other girls glancing in my direction, feels like they are looking at me.

I have usually been pretty lucky when it comes to dating women throughout my life, all my ex girlfriends were slim to average in size. As I got older, I came to accept that I do like very curvy voluptuous thick and BBW type ladies. When I go to work or shopping for groceries or hangout with friends, i'm looking around and my eyes are scoping the big butts, after that it goes to their face. I for the life of me have not been able to hook up or date a super curvy lady, i'm not sure why, it seems they tend to be married or maybe think that it's a prank or a fetish. Perhaps it is a fetish in my part that i'm obsessed with a woman's big behind, but that's not the only thing I want. I would like to be friends and hangout and do fun things.

I would like to hear some advice of where I could better my chances of finding a curvy lady to hook up or date, i'm open to both. The online dating stuff is difficult because Tinder for one doesn't let you filter by body type, so I get 20-50 slim ladies before a thick or bbw profile appears. I have had some nice conversation in person, but something happens and we never get to hangout, I feel like i'm cursed, man this sucks. So like I previously stated if anyone knows where I can find some very voluptuous women, I would highly appreciate it.
