I'm curious how that works.

If you are a woman, would you feel no emotion about it if men were asking you your weight or waist circumference and then casually ghosting and rejecting you on it?

He act like he gotta leave the desk when I come in the front door.

Here is the kicker, he spent from February to last Thursday staring at me. Walking past me trying to catch my eye. I would know he is staring from that overwhelming feeling of being watched, turning my head and seeing him 
pretending to look away. He is stalking my social media post. Having his friends try to catfish me online but I always caught on to it before I got invested.

I‚Äôm not sure what to make of this crazy situation. I just found it funny that I was getting some rejection signals today from a guy I have no interest in dating. What a childish person and game. 

I call it rejection signals because he was making like he didn‚Äôt want to speak to me or look at me. But I legit had no intent of talking to him anyway. I only speak when I have a gym questions. That is like once every full moon.

A while ago I met this girl on a dating app. We hit it off, honestly the first week I slept for 2-3 hours a night since we were always in a video call.  
I told her I'm planning to comeback to my homeland some time Q1 next year, with a week vacay planned for November and 2 during the Christmas holidays in between.  
After some time things started to get stale, sadly I already fell in love with her.  
Anyway she ""ghosted"" me twice, rather, we just weren't talking a couple of times for a couple of days since things had gotten stale. Third time I felt genuinely ghosted and without much wait I deleted her socials after 2 days of silence.    
Problem is I still feel like the potential connection is there and it's just the actual physical meeting that's missing. I feel like I've killed the chances the moment I deleted her socials, however, I truly am in love with her and so I've been thinking about showing up at her doorstep and asking her out there and then. If it's not happening, I'll move on with a definitive answer.   
Question - am I really that desperate of a blind fool and this is just simping at this point, or should I give it a go? I feel like in either case it's a win win since I'd get the closure needed.    
P.S.

2 days ago she starts getting distant. I didn't text or call her. However I'm a pretty routine guy so she knows where I am at usually. She shows up with her friend 2 days ago where I'm usually at with my friends and sits around. 

We say Hi. I notice the vibe is suddenly off (Like yesterday when we went out it was completely the opposite) . Whatever no problem, I didn't say much. After abit, she said bye and left with her friend. We messaged each other the same night after that and things started going back to normal. 

Yesterday, nothing. I didn't text or call her and neither did she to me. Again, she knows where I am at usually. She showed up alone last night to where I was again. 

I greeted her, noticed the vibe was off again. Didn't say anything after. She sat away from me. After some time I walked over to her and said to come sit with me. She said she wanted to be alone. All right then. I didn't continue the conversation and left it at that. 

As she was leaving she came over to say bye (just out of courtesy I assume) but it was pretty cold and like the 2 weeks between us didn't happen at all. Straight went from a close relationship to a we bare ly know each other kind of scenario. 

I didn't contact her. I don't think I will because experience just tells me not to. I think I've been clear about being pretty open to her but she seems quite distant and closed off right now.

I'm a late bloomer, I'm in my late 20s and only started putting myself out there recently. I met someone also late 20s, we've hung out a few times and have been intimate. We've been seeing each other over a month, once a week/two weeks. He has made it clear that he does not want something serious, he's focusing on his career right now. As for me, I'm open to both casual and serious. I think. I like the fun and intimacy. I don't like it when he doesn't reach out for long periods of time though. I know myself, I can get needy (although I don't show it and stew in my own neediness) and I get in my head when he mentions his women friends, one of whom he's sleeping over at this week for a trip. When he talks about them though he always says, it's not like that, or not in that way. Still, I know I really shouldn't feel like this because things are casual. He's very respectful though, he buys dinner and cooks for me, and always reminds me that I don't owe him anything.

I'm trying to figure out if it's a good idea to keep this thing going, especially because some of my needs aren't being met- consistent communication and caring if I'm even alive those days we don't talk to each other. At the same time though, I do like spending time with him when we do, he's attentive, he's affectionate, it's nice to have some fun and intimacy in my life right now. Ultimately I'm seeking a long-term serious relationship but since I can't find that right now, this set up seems pretty good? I'm new to dating and I'm not looking for marriage right off the bat. In the back of my head though, I'm asking myself if I'm wasting my time. I dunno. To add, I'm not good at seeing multiple people, though I probably should get better at that. 

I know I have to talk to him about how I'm feeling, we're pretty open and talk about anything. In the beginning he told me he won't be sleeping with other people once we start but I don't know if that's still the case, I'll bring it up. I think we just both need to be explicit, especially me.

I was at a party this weekend and I was with a group I didn't really know, so I was just drifting in and out of the dance floor with one of my friends who doesn't like to party. Suddenly a girl who's about my height comes over and starts talking to us and she seemed particularly interested in me. My friend is way better looking than me and I was used to girls coming up to us and then focusing on him so I was a little confused as to why I was suddenly in the spotlight. Eventually, one of her friends came over and pulled her away and said that she needed to go to the bathroom (I was used to friends of girls I was talking to 'saving' them) but later she came back and we started talking and dancing together. The party was really dark and we were getting really touchy with each other, I was enjoying it a lot and so was she but the whole time in my head I was kind of projecting my own insecurity onto this girl. I am not ugly but I'll be the first to admit I'm not anything special: I'm of average height and I have trouble socializing with new people. If I ever got anywhere with a girl it was always short-lived and one-sided.

I had never had a girl act this way before toward me without me even trying and I started to doubt if this girl had her own issues and I was the best she could get. She was fit and she wasn't gorgeous but she wasn't ugly either- based on just her appearance she easily could've gone for another guy in the party. And it wasn't one of those ""take one for the team"" situations that happen between two groups (when one person gets with the ugliest from the other group so the other people can bag the attractive ones); I was pretty much alone and she had friends that I didn't meet the whole night on the other side of the club.

These thoughts started to creep back into my head as I would see the friends I came with give me an apathetic look when I expected them to be encouraging and/or proud that I had actually found someone who liked me. I eventually left with them and with her number, although I probably could've gone farther if I had wanted to.

The next day we follow each other on Instagram. She had a fairly high follower count but when I went to check on her recent posts they had less than 10 likes each (some of her older posts had hundreds of likes though?). This has made me even more suspicious and reluctant to follow up with anything. My friend who I came with has been hyping me up and encouraging me to start talking to more girls so I am really confused that he seems to not even care that I DID get a girl and probably could've taken her home if I hadn't psyched myself out. I am starting to wonder, like I said, if there is something about this girl that I don't know. As you can probably tell I pay way too much attention to detail sometimes, so feel free to reality check me if I sound paranoid.

I was kinda unnerved at first cause he was wearing sunglasses and I was like uhhh that‚Äôs weird? But it was all good. So he came in and smiled directly at me and walked to the corner to look at some stuff. And after I finished ringing up those girls, he came over with his stuff that he was gonna buy. And again he smiled at me and said hello. So I scanned his stuff and just followed the usual process of everything. And after I gave him back his things he thanked me like really sincerely? And he told me to have a great night and stood there for a second smiling at looking at me and then walked out. And he was cute so I was a bit happy. And ever since then, he has been at the mall either every weekend or every other weekend. Every time, he will walk past my store multiple times and either will slow down and look in directly at me or slow down but just walk past the store. About a month ago he looked over his sunglasses and smiled at me and then two weeks ago, I had been shopping after work and I turned the corner and was texting my friend, and when I looked up I had realized that I was walking right towards him and he was sitting on theses couches. My eyes got really wide and I started stumbling AND HE SMIRKED!!! Like?

I'm a college senior this year and have been living at an off-campus townhouse. FYI, and I am sorta ashamed about this, I have never dated anyone before. I live with 5 other girls and our neighbors are some sophomore guys who are all in the same frat. I have been pretty stressed about school recently, and as a result got pretty drunk three nights in a row this week (some memory loss from each night, but never got sick). Our neighbors seem very friendly and their frat has a rep for being friendly and one of the ""better"" ones. They have introduced themselves to us multiple times and have repeatedly invited us to their parties which they throw pretty often. 

So on Friday, I got drunk at my club's karaoke night, went to a bar after, and finally went home. I heard  our neighbors outside, and made the wonderful decision at that moment to finally talk to them and introduce myself. So...I actually think I have pretty severe memory loss from that night because I do not remember what exactly I said, but one of the neighbors told me later that I was really gone. Apparently, another guy came out of the house and invited me in, as I think I was asking to see their place since I hadn't yet. So he invites me in and they're throwing down and I dance with this guy, get up on his countertop at his suggestion (rip) with other girls, and I somehow got his snapchat and number but I don't remember asking for it. I remember him getting a little touchy with me but nothing inappropriate. Then I decide to head back to mine and he walks me out.

On Saturday morning, my hungover ass texts him saying I vaguely remember dancing on his countertop and I also thanked him for walking me back. He said I was a lot of fun to party with and that I should come to their parties more often. Then later in the day he texts me saying he still needs a partner for the fifth and a friend party they're throwing that night, and asks if I'd be interested and I say yes. I go over that night with our bottle (he's only 19 so I bought it) along with pretzels and gatorade, and he insists on venmo'ing me even though I tell him he doesn't have to. Then we zip tie our wrists and start drinking and chatting. We finished our bottle, he was definitely hammered, and I was trashed too but not as bad. We were kinda leaning on each other and getting close and I remember telling him he was cute and he responded that I was cute too and that he thought I was cool. Then we were staring at each other, and I leaned in and we ended up making out a couple times. And then one of his roommates says party's over because they need to call 911 for someone, and then the guy I'm with drunkenly tells me he wants to see me again. So I head out back to my place and text him to tell me if he needs anything, but it has now been two full days and I haven't heard from him.

My friends were all telling me not to text him at all until he reaches out. I was concerned for his state and for the 911 kid's state but listened to them and didn't text to check in. Is there nothing more here? Should I just accept it as a one-night thing? I guess my naive ass thought he was at least a little into me but I guess this is just a typical frat guy thing.

One of them was feeling down because of an ex. The night started off great, we were helping him out clear his mind from that and listening to music and giving him advice. It was going good... until the other friend also fell victim. He then started to remember his ex too. 

And then it was me. For the longest I thought I had gotten over her. ""I finally moved on"" I told myself. Thought I was finally ready. But then I started wondering how was she doing? What's up with her life?  Did she had her ""glow up"" like my friends exes? Is she... in a happy and healthy relationship were she's happy? And I thought and thought through out night... until I asked my friend to see if he could find her profile. 

Just like in the movies when the protagonist friend tells the line ""you're not gonna like it"" he told me to brace my self. Saw her profile. Happy she was, with someone. I started breathing heavily and felt like my heart sunk right out of my body. It was then that I stopped lying to myself and accepted that I'm still an emotional mess that hasn't gotten over her. What makes it even worse is that it's on me... the breakup,  and the fact that I couldn't recognize the one in a million type of girl that somehow at some point ended up feeling something for me.

I don't know what to do. I'm one of those type that believes in ""your one true love"" and that someone out there is your other half. So I live with the fear that, what if she was the one? That 1 of 1? Impossible for me to be back with her so did I just abandoned that one person? Will I stay alone forever? I'm scared of that. The thought of meeting you're one true love and that you were too stupid and immature to sustain a relationship and to get over the tough patches and letting her go to be with someone. 

I could go on and on but I think I said enough- well to at least to make me feel a little bit better. It's good being part of a community were people got your back, that could be going to something similar.

I don‚Äôt have any doubts on him except for the fact he hasn‚Äôt made it offical yet‚Ä¶ Now I‚Äôm someone who really doesn‚Äôt see the difference between being exclusive and dating at all but I know that some people do. 

I would have assumed he thought we already are in a relationship but i know this isn‚Äôt the case because the other day when were at a party someone asked in front of him if this was my boyfriend and I looked at him and he smiled and shrugged and i felt super on the spot and just said it was new. On the trip back home I told him I didn‚Äôt know what to say when that person asked about us and that I find the in between stage of dating and a relationship so awkward and he kind of shut it down and just said is that he doesn‚Äôt find that weird at all.

I really do think he does have super good intentions with me and does really like me and isn‚Äôt just playing around. I think he is just making sure and taking his time before he takes that next step (which i know some people have to get their head around) but it just makes me a bit nervous.

I know none of you are mind readers but basically just need advice about why you think he‚Äôs taking so long to make things offical with me? I know a month and a half isn‚Äôt that long but its definitely long enough to me to know if you want to be in a relationship with them considering how much time we are spending together and how i know neither of us are seeing other people.

I also don‚Äôt want to raise it with him because I also want him to want to ask because when he wants me to be his girlfriend not just because I told him I wanted to if that makes sense.

My point is that if you have a problem, maybe try using that thing in your skull, you know, that brain of yours? People here seem to be crying over lame shit when they likely could fix it. Take a good look at yourself. Ask yourself, ""Would I date ME?"" I would date ME but I would also have to ask myself why I act the way I do sometimes. Stop being overly petty and fix it.

I‚Äôve always thought about having a partner, I‚Äôm sure the companionship would be cool.


There‚Äôs just so much things I want to do first though. So much things I want to do for myself. It would be much, much easier to follow up on these personal goals alone. I don‚Äôt feel ready. I want to grow into a better person, when my state of mind I will settle down. 


My friends tell me if I‚Äôm going to wait until I‚Äôm ready, I am never going to be ready. I‚Äôve met so a handful of nice girls who genuinely cared about me, and I passed up on them because I wanted to do some more soul searching. My friends said I am foolish and may never come across such girls again. 


Another reason I wanted to wait out (but is a bit less on the moral side), is because I wanted to have sex with more women. I feel like after I‚Äôve had enough sex, I genuinely believe I will have no desire to cheat on my girlfriend. It‚Äôll be a ‚Äòbeen there, done that‚Äô sort of thing.

Been called ugly a lot for one. That always stings a little. Friends told me that confidence outweighs appearance, so I thought ok, i'll build up my confidence!

Got rejected a lot. Most people said it was because I wasn't their type, which I understood, or just flat out said ""ew"" or something like that. The ""ew's"" hurt, a lot. But I kept trying, cause what else can you do? 

Then one day I actually asked out a friend of mine who was really kind and pretty, and she said yes! I was over the moon. But she changed her mind after she showed me to her other friends, and they told her she could do better. She told me that she fought to keep me because I she thought I was caring and funny, but ultimately she agreed with her friends. That was...I didnt know what to think.

Then I got a girlfriend! She felt like a great person at first, but slowly became really mean-spirited. She liked to subtly poke fun at stuff about my appearance that I was insecure about, like how I don't smile with teeth cause my crooked jaw makes it look weird, and how my nose is big. She also talked a lot about how her ex had a huge dick, and was really gifted in bed and told me she'd be impressed if I could outdo him. There was a lot more than just that, but the general jist is that she really didn't respect my boundaries a lot. Or at all, really. Every time I tried to build one she'd shoot it down like some kind of twisted emotional Fortnite.

Since then I've had a couple people express interest in me, but it wasn't anyone I felt comfortable dating. By that I mean they were pretty young compared to me(I'm 20) and it was just really uncomfy.

Thing is, even if someone was interested in me, I'm so scared of being the ""ugly one"" that I'm not sure I'd even go for it. I don't want people to tell my partner they could ""do better"", I don't want my partner to think they're settling for me, I don't want my picture to get laughed at in an all girl's group chat again, I don't want someone to look at me and say ""ew"" ever again. I almost feel sick imagining any of those things happening.

Despite my insecurities, I do have some degree of self confidence(in things other than my face) and social skills(I was adopted by a wild pack of extroverts and over time became one of them). I generally try to be respectful of everyone I meet, and I love making people smile and laugh.

Ofc it's not anyone's obligation to date me because of those things! But idk man I just can't keep anyone happy. I get it, at the end of the day I'm just not their cup of tea.

Our waitress was cute and very friendly with us but I'm old enough to not read into these things - after all its their job to be nice and friendly. So let me start by saying that 99% of the time I would never hit on a waitress just because she's being nice. However, as the night progressed she started hanging out with us more and drinking with us. My two female friends convinced me that she's into me so I started flirting with her a bit - something I wouldn't normally do. She flirted back - but again, its her job to be nice and friendly. 

At one point one of our 24F friends wanted us all to get one last drink and the other one complained and hesitated about the price of the drinks. The waitress suggested I buy everyone drink. I have no issues buying my friends drinks from time to time and I'm definitely better off financially then the 24F friends, but I didn't like the pressure I was being put under to pay for my friends drinks so I politely refused to pay for them. Something felt off about it. We ordered the drinks anyways though even though I didn't want to drink anymore.

Around the same time this was happening the waitress and I discussed going on a date and I joked around that I would take her to a cocktail bar (because she works at one) and she said something along the lines of, ""Are you gonna pay for my drinks when you wouldn't pay for your friends'?"". I told her of course. I've never not paid for my dates drinks even if they were terrible dates. No one could possibly accuse me of being cheap.

Anyways after we ordered our last drinks the waitress was far less friendly and didn't come talk to us as much. After we got the check, I asked for her number and she said she had a bf. 

This didn't come as much of a surprise. In fact I felt relieved that I wasn't stupid enough to be manipulated into paying for my friends drinks to impress a waitress with a bf. The guy friend that was with us thinks she just wanted us to spend more money on drinks and thats why she encouraged me to pay when there was hesitation from one of the girls.

Meaning he improves his outfit, his physical presence, his mental and physical fitness. Despite his best efforts women still reject him (true story, don't ask me about details please, I am not willing to give more information than this since it would simply reveal the person I am thinking about).

I am especially in interested in how women are viewing this friend of me? Despite his best efforts he is still viring in his 30s. Is he a red flag? If yes, can you explore on why he is a red flag?

My curiosity stems from the fact that I am in similar boat only that I am way worse off than this friend. Seeing this friend having no success kills any motivation in me to try to become attractive for women. It seems futile. The whole ""improve yourself"", despite common sense telling me how important it is to improve myself seems futile alltogether.

To the story: 

I(26F) have free access to my bf‚Äôs(31M) phone through my iPad due to trust issues, frankly. I read a convo between my bf and his friend/closest colleague(38M) at work. The colleague knows about my bf and me, and we never met but made plans to meet soon. The colleague refers me as ‚Äúfiance‚Äù in earlier convos.. but we r not in that stage. 

Anyways, the text convo goes like this:
Bf: -sends workout photo-
Friend: -compliments-
Friend: -sends a four letter word in Korean- (literal meaning, ‚Äútransfer‚Äù but socially implicates ‚Äútransfer to someone else while meeting your gf‚Äù)
Bf: -changes convo- hey you never told me about your gf
Blahblahnlah

I read it, and just felt disappointed. I always talk about how good of an influence my boyfriend is to me and you know, ‚Äúdefend‚Äù him when people speak ill but that rarely happens because my friends all respect me and my love for my bf. So, it‚Äôs just disappointing he would let someone who he is close to‚Ä¶ say that and just ignore it?

From the videos and pictures he has sent me of himself as well as his social media, I find him very physically attractive so I was very open to the idea to just sleep with him - also because he is only 22 which is a bit young for me as a 25 year old‚Ä¶

He however mentioned that he would like to see what our vibe would be and go from there but i made it more and more clear that I wanted to have fun. From his way of texting and flirting with me I have been somewhat intriguied with this guy. Hes witty and charming. My heart flutters everytime he texts me and theres always a rush. I feel like there might be more to this guy than I thought; its also what my gut tells me. 

After 2 weeks of texting, we recently made plans to meet up. Suddenly he texted me late at night the day before our scheduled meetup and asked me what I like in bed. This lead to a very steemy sexting session and I was suprised how well he was able to nail exactly what i needed to hear to get me super horny, it seemed like our fantaties where very in zinc and he had just as much desire for me as i did for him. He talked abot how he wanted to do it everywhere with me for as long as possible in every position possible.

The next day we where scheduled to meet he didnt show and he told me he fell asleep at his friends house after smoking a few joints of dope. 

I was super upset initially but now im sorta thankful because i dont think i want to just sleep with this guy anymore I might want something more‚Ä¶

This situation is weird entire time and I know that everyone will tell me I am crazy and I should let it go, and believe me I am trying, it‚Äôs just difficult. So the story is, last year I had a bf, but we were together for like a month and then on and off for like half a year or even more. In that time when we were on and off he once met my best friend and later he texted her about her origins, which are specific, and they didn‚Äôt ever talk again after that. All the time while we were on and off I would from time to time bring that up, and say how much it bothered me that he texted her, on which his response was always that he didn‚Äôt like her truly he was just interested in her origins. We stayed on fine terms all this time, but last time that we saw each other which was about a week ago we drank coffee, and after that he completely changed. He started being rude and inconsiderate. I understand that he doesn‚Äôt have the same feelings as he once had and that is completely fine with me. Last time we talked over a phone which was three days ago he was so disrespectful and rude even tho he was the one who called me. I told him over the phone that I don‚Äôt understand his behavior and what is going on, we had a little fight and I blocked him on everything. He called me few times, and texted me on his friends phone but I never responded. Today he sent a follow request to my best friend from the beginning of the story. Is he trying to get to me because he knows how much that bothered me in the first place or has he always had feelings for my best friend. I know mostly that people will tell me I am crazy and I should not care about this. I am definitely done with him now, but I am just curious to know, try to understand me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1098472,public,self,Why did he do this?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qg5e9z/why_did_he_do_this/,all_ads,6,[],text,t2_9nfz2owi,False,False,,,,

So this is a big change. I initially thought she was in her late 20's at most, she is youthful, rides horses and does another sport (which is how I met her). I'm deliberately leaving out details because I don't want to expose myself.

I haven't brought up dating because frankly this is very new territory for me and it's still \*very\* early days, I've only met her a couple of times, but both times we went out for drinks after our initial afternoon together with a group of people we train with. 

It's obvious we both like each other, she always asks me questions, how my week was, teases me, laughs at my terrible jokes. I reciprocate but also act a little blas√© to her approaches because frankly I'm a little nervous (which is new to me because usually I'm pretty confident!). I just want to empathise how refreshing and amazing it is when you meet somebody who isn't afraid to make moves, the entirety of my dating experiences I've had to initiate almost everything, she is subtly forward and I \*really\* respect that, it's also attractive af, especially when she's doing it infront of her friends.

There is a party going on next week, we are both going, she brought up doing my makeup (halloween), then I said we should turn it into pre drinks as well, she agreed, so now I'm going to hers first for pre's with a friend of mine and 2 of hers.

I want to take it slow, should I text her, if so should I keep it casual?

We went on 7 dates in total, all of which were unique and so much fun, with some of them being incredibly romantic. We texted constantly, conversation never stopped, and the sex was great, it truly felt like she was going to be the one. It seemed like she felt the same way too.

I asked her to meet up again for our 8th date, but was sadly and very surprisingly greeted with ""had a really good time hanging out with you and I‚Äôm happy we met, but I‚Äôm not feeling the connection turning into something more"" - it was a huge bummer.

It's hard to comprehend, we had so much in common and had such an amazing time together. I am so surprised she didn't feel the same way I did.
