17,mjzqc3,1617554386,Was I love bombed?,"41F. Met 39M OLD. Talked on the phone twice before our first date. First date was a month ago. Got along really well and had a lot of fun. 


Lots of texting in between first swiping and meeting. Nothing too flirty or out of the ordinary. Lots of questions, found out we had a lot of similar interests. 


After the first date, was very flirty. Nothing overtly sexual, more, 'I really like you' 'Can't wait to see you again' 'You're amazing' etc. 


Second date. I spent the night at his place. Again he was very complimentary, talking about taking a short trip together. We had sex, and had breakfast together the next morning. 


Now, he is still texting and making plans but not nearly as often. We were texting multiple times a day, now more every other day. He has been traveling for work, which is where we were originally supposed to take a road trip to and spend the weekend. He cancelled due to not having enough time. We haven't been able to see each other in person, but have had one phone call and one Skype date over the past two weeks. 


He hasn't been nearly as flirty or open as he previously was before our second date, but is still talking to me. Less questions, less compliments. He is returning home today and we have plans for an online date tomorrow, that he asked for. 


He doesn't believe in dating multiple people, so I dont think he has met someone new or is breadcrumbing me. I see two possible options:


1. All he really wanted was sex, and now he's less interested now that he's gotten that. But why would he still be making plans with me? 


2. He has described himself as wanting a relationship but hesitant to commit. He could be getting cold feet and backing away because he possibly sees potential with me. 


Either way, I'm not really sure what to do or how to proceed. I feel confused. I've been divorced for 2 years after a 12-year relationship so I'm fairly new to the dating world.

32,mk2xot,1617564297,Update to getting a weird vibe off planning a date,"Last week (I think time is melting together at this point) I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/mfzk4o/getting_a_weird_vibe_off_planning_a_date/) about getting a weird vibe while I was trying to plan a date with a woman from an app. The gist was that she was that she didn't ask any questions but would answer. Then asked me out but did not confirm for a few days, then disappeared for a few days. Then came back. I figured she was not interested but had trouble saying so.

So come the day of the date, I texted her to confirm. And she replied that she had completely forgotten because she was so busy with work and asked if we could do this tomorrow. Being ""busy with work"" seems to also be a bad sign, but since she suggested the next day, I figured she was serious. The next day is rained so we ended up going out this weekend lol.

On the whole, it was a really nice time. She definitely seemed a little quirky, in a good way. I mean, I figure I'm quirky too, after all I have a reddit account. But basically, her communication style via the app seemed to somewhat make sense given how she seemed in person. The conversation was really easy and the lulls weren't awkward. There was less ""flirting"" then I am used to, but hey those situations didn't work out so who knows. Also, I think that some people may feel awkward with being flirty so it's whatever. As long as she didn't actively tell me to go fuck myself, we could talk.

She ended up inviting me over next weekend or suggested my place in the future. So, it seems like she's interested. I'm definitely game. It was just a first date so you never know. This is just reinforced my idea about OLD that it's all total bullshit and you don't know anything until you meet the person and see how they act. Because I would have sworn that she was either too anxious to meet up or just texting me for fun, out of boredom, etc.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/mk2xot/update_to_getting_a_weird_vibe_off_planning_a_date/

Maybe it's a men thing but when a woman is interested in you and shows it you are like HOLD ON IS IT YOUR EVEN REAL, She REALY LIKE ME!!! 
For me it's reflected with fast message responses, good morning messages, video chats, asking about me, being in good mood with me, etc.

It's such a big turn on to me that I don't see the other disadvantages that we won't fit. I fear that it won't work in the long run. We have too many gaps on the basic views on life and hobbies but on the other hand being liked by a woman is so rare and feeling so good to me that I don't know what to do.

39,mk5d3y,1617571862,First time trying for the OLD,"Help. So, I’m ready to date but it’s been a really long time. Like a decade. 
I’m fit. Relatively good looking. Tall (&gt;6ft). Mid 30s.

I want to date again. I’m going to try these apps for the first time ever. Tinder first... but I have no idea, maybe I should do another one?

I don’t have ANY photos, and so obviously I know I need photos before making the account. I have only the selfie I took today and they ain’t gonna work...

I’m nervous. For one thing, I don’t have abs. I went online and found sites about “how to get good pictures for Tinder”, and holy $&amp;*% all the dudes have abs and take shirtless photos. Like the advice is basically “be stunning” and “have a fantastic body.” 

My body is aight. I’m not fat. I lift weights and run and go to gym. I don’t have abs, but I’m fit. 
Also, I’m not a photographer. I just have my phone. I don’t have friends that i can be like “bruh take photos of me for my dating profile.”  I’m considering hiring a professional to make me dating pictures for these apps. 

God, I wish there was an easier way to meet women. I don’t understand these apps at all. I’ve been single for many many months now out of my own choice and to work on myself (last one was insanely toxic and don’t want that again). Now Im ready, but I am worried I will get no matches and then be like “okay I guess I’m just single now.” Plus I feel like if I go in with bad photos I can’t change them later and expect the girls who already swiped the bad way to see me again. I’m not a fireman!

I guess my question is: how do you get good photos? I have none. Should I hire a photographer? Should I put phone on timer and model-runway out in front of it and kick a ball? It all feels so fake.

Tinder is not my thing. Had one coffee with a catfish and have lost interest in tinder since i find it not engaging at all. 

Ive had few one night stands and a fb after our divorce but all the action has been happening after partying so i havent been intimate soberly all this time.

Anyway since im still processing the divorce and feel like i lack dating experience ive just let things wait and put my energy in friends and hobbies. Im quite confident in how i carry myself normally but going on dates feel kinda nerving to me. What comes to the divorce i think im in a stable state and im ready to start dating at least casually. My thought has been that im not gonna search for anything, i want to meet someone organically that actually makes me feel like i want to take her to a date.

Well it happened yesterday. I went partying and met a girl and we clicked straight away. We didnt do anything sexual, we just talked and hanged together most of the night. I told her about my background and how i havent really been interested in dating but she made me feel like i want to get to know her.

Now im thinking what should i do next. Everything is closed because of corona so i dont have any date ideas besides going for a walk or watching a movie or something. Personally, i find it easier to get to know someone while doing something together, not just drink coffee and chat for an hour. 

Fact that she was interested in me and she was ok with my background and had also divorced last year eases my mind but still, having no dating experience makes me overthink everything.

44,mk6956,1617574645,How to handle discovering guy has a criminal record?,"Ive been seeing this guy for a few weeks. He has come to my house so he knows where I live. He told me openly about how his ex technically kidnapped their child and he finally found her and is going to court to get custody this week. He even told me about how she had made a fake rape accusation against him and how it got dismissed. It seemed like a pretty clear cut case of a bitter ex alienating him from his child for years. 
But last time we hung out he went to show me something in his phone and I saw the last thing he’d been doing was googling himself, which was odd to me. Later on, I googled him to see if he had been worried about something coming up, and I found his mugshot and criminal history, which included a charge for strangulation and assault from way before the year he said they split up, and also a violation of a restraining order from less than a year ago (whoever it was against their name doesnt show so I dont know if it was his childs mother or what). I feel really uncomfortable now.
He seems like such a nice sweet guy and has never made me feel in danger at all, but I also have kids and don't feel comfortable seriously dating someone who has that on his record (even if he was just scared to mention it, gave me his reasons and I believed him innocent, I would be worried my childs father would look him up down the road and cause issues with my own custody?) 

I dont know if I should bring it up and hear him out, explain my line of thought, or just make an excuse to back out of getting to know each other since its so rude to look up someones background, and since maybe he could possibly be dangerous? I definitely dont want to ghost the guy though, and dont want to mess him up mentally right before he has court for his custody case next week either.

I told all of the women I saw I wanted nothing serious because I am focused on my art and my art career and making it happen for me.

When we started messaging and after I got her number, deleted the app and told myself if this isn’t anything of substance then I won’t date for a while until I make it (in the art world).

Well expect the unexpected because we clicked when we hung out. Second date she invited me over , she cooked for me- everything flowed smoothly. I even wondered and brought it up how odd it was how well we vibe and click. She agreed.. things have been going really well. 

We’ve been seeing each other 3-4xs/week, sleep overs often at either her or my place.

at this point in my life i am not looking for anything short term or anything that I know will end in a few months. It’ll just take away energy from making art and working on all that..if there is potential in it then I’m all for it. Which I do see..

I’ve told her this. I told her how I feel. How I’m really into her, see potential, etc. and she says she feels
The same. We already had the exclusive convo and not seeing other people..However she has said some things that made me a bit weary..like “I don’t want you to think of this being forever because nothing is forever..like what if on two years it doesn’t work out” - why would you say that? I don’t get it.

She says she is the type to take things slow and see how things will feel but rarely speaks about how she feels. I had to pull teeth to hear her say she likes me and she sees potential. Her actions say a lot- often initiates texting, offers hang outs, the way she’s affection/intimate w me shows me she’s into me. She told her mom recently she kinda likes a guy. She wanted me to meet her friends so I did...however piece of me is just...unsure? 

I know she has work stuff going on, possible career transition and I’ve heard her mention the possibility of moving out of state, etc. which I’m not fond of and don’t want to get involved with someone if that’s the case but it’s still up in the air..

Idk - everything just seems too up in the air for me. I need a little more certainty I feel. With how focused and driven I am on my art, I can’t have more uncertain going on with my emotions..and I really do like her. So its like an internal push and pull...which I don’t want to be going through..

Also- thoughts on this- she hasn’t added me on her personal IG , although twice she said she will..she mentioned she has pics of her old relationships, ex bfs etc in there and wasn’t sure if I was ready. Is that weird? I kinda always found it weird when folks leave old pictures up of exes- I get the past is the past but are you stuck back there? Not sure- everyone perceives things differently.

I dont like to sleep with another person in the same bed, although I do have a high sex drive. I am childfree as well. 

I think being a woman, and expectations around women being more giving, maternal, craving intimacy, putting themselves on the line etc, works against me and many men find me weird for wanting these things.

 However in my relationships with cis men I always found I did a bit more of the housework, emotional labour, etc, and research seems to confirm this trend. I still want emotional support, sex and intimacy but cohabitating does not appeal to me anymore, especially as I have already been there and done that.

I’m hoping someone might review and offer some suggestions, or you just want to browse pics of some random person. Typically my profile looks like this, just cut down to fit whatever the word cap is. 46M, Canada. 


**
Lift weights, run, ski, hike, sports, outdoor activities. 
5k fun runs, inflatable obstacle races, costume runs, concerts, events in the city. 

Board games with friends, read all sorts of genres, love astronomy, and other nerdy science stuff. 

I enjoy cooking and baking. Steak Diane is my favorite  as I love the brandy flambé. 

Teen kids. Dog. Cat. 
**



I also volunteer but I’m not sure about adding that. I volunteer for several reason and dating isn’t one of them. 

I’m hoping to find a woman that’s active (like +3 days a week), enjoys the outdoors, up for stuff/not a home body, willing to try stuff like board games, cook together, watching a movie, going to the local observatory and science center for their adult nights. But also does their own things, hobbies and friends. And most importantly a compassionate person. 

For prompts I usually have “celebrates odd holidays”. And I list the books I’m currently reading, I might have a 3rd one but nothing standard. 

I feel as if my bio is boring, like I’m #7 out of 451 men that all look roughly the same with the same, or similar interests. I feel that condensing it all takes the flavor out, so to speak. It amazes me that I get a match, but I’m not sure how to make it better given the word count. 

I know pics are everything and unfortunately I don’t feel that I’m very photogenic (or I’m delusional 😳). Here’s some [pics](https://imgur.com/a/mYVEcoP), they aren’t in any order. It’s snowing today so I haven’t tried getting more. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.
Edit for formatting.

Second edit. I’m having trouble with formatting, but the bio is just between the asterisk. The rest is for context.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/mk7ke0/bio_review/
51,mk7uju,1617579961,Any new good dating sites besides the usual suspects?,"I am curious if anyone has had any success lately with new off-the-radar dating sites (i.e. besides Bumble, Tinder, OKCupid, Hinge, POF, Match, Zoosk, Coffee Meets Bagel, The League, etc).  

Two that I tried that were worthless were Mature Dating and Euro Date. I saw an ad for Mature Dating on Snapchat, but there are so many bots that message you that you can't tell who is real, and the same thing happened with Euro Date. 

One that has been working well for me is International Cupid. As a below average to average looking man (at best), I do not generate much interest through the mainstream sites (maybe a match a week if I am swiping every day and a couple of likes in my queue from people I am not attracted to), but have gotten likes and messages from users on International Cupid. Of course, the vast majority of the people I message with on there live overseas which presents logistical, financial and possible scamming issues, but it is nice to know that there may be a real person out there that is interested in you (as you can probably tell, I have become a bit desperate due to my lack of success with dating in the U.S. and am starting to look overseas).

Thank you for your time and help, and best of luck to everyone in this community as we head into the spring. Happy Easter.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/mk7uju/any_new_good_dating_sites_besides_the_usual/

55,mk9ndv,1617586198,I was just told I’m too “emotionally available”,"I would post the screenshot but apparently can’t do that on this sub. Anyways this is the context. Matched with a woman a few years ago and she ghosted me. Matched again and this was part of the exchange-

Her: You are too available which is a turn off to me

Me: I am? I need to play hard to get?

Her: I like men who are emotionally unavailable. I like guys who are really intriguing but text me just enough to keep me interested. 

———

This was just after she told me about how bad of luck she’s had dating. She’s an attractive professional in a decent sized city. I’m at a loss for words. I know some enjoy the text games and not replying too soon or not double texting. All the unspoken rules. I’ve tried to be authentic and do what feels right, but maybe this is a part of why I’ve had such bad luck myself. Thoughts?

56,mk9qtb,1617586525,Woman [36F] I’m [31M] dating is going through a lot - seems to be fading after death of a friend,"The woman I’m dating since September developed from solely hookups to more of a relationship. I wouldn’t say she’s my girlfriend but the last few months we have grown really close: lots of dates, calls, FaceTime, and nights together. We had a discussion since I was moving within a year and she did not want kids that we were fine with this situation for now. 

Recently she has been extremely depressed - she lost her job due to covid and had been doing odd jobs to make ends meet. She had a very lucrative career in hospitality and due to covid its all gone away. I thought she was handling things quite well - until she broke down and cried in front of me after yet another failed interview, hinting at mental health issues in her family with the suicide as of her mother. I consoled her at the time and then for the next week we seemed to continue our relationship, going out more especially with things opening up in our city. I also told her I had depression and was battling it and talking to people and being open helps a lot, especially a counselor

Last week she learned a close friend of hers had passed away and that really affected her. I told her to call and let me know if there was anything I could do and left it at that. From Monday until today we hardly talked - I finally texted seeing if she wanted to grab dinner, but she said she was busy as her close friend was doing a girls day with her Sunday. Also asked if she wanted to go watch a game with some friends this week and she said she couldn’t. I know she’s going through a lot and am not sure if I should just take a step back - even with all her issues before I seemed to be the person she relied on the most. Now most recently not sure if she’s pulling away from me, or really from everything (it feels like just me - she’s been out with her other friends a lot she said to get her mind off of things)",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/mk9qtb/woman_36f_im_31m_dating_is_going_through_a_lot/
