0,nmyw7m,1622211680,Stop using others as an emotional buffer while you recover from your last relationship.,"Dating someone who isn't over their ex is like taking on someone else credit card debt. You enter a relationship with someone who is still ""paying off"" a significant amount of energy and pain and you both aren't starting fresh from a zero balance. It's a very miserable start. For the partner, it feels like a massive burden to have to listen to the negative stories and comparisons and light comments about someone they don't even know. Even if those comments are meant to paint the current partner in a better light AKA ""you do xyz, my ex never wanted to do that"". 

We all have history, we all mention our past partners a few times... but mentioning it constantly and linking it to everything you do or talk about will absolutely kill the potential. When you start a new relationship it should be a fresh start, and its up to you to make sure your view on this new relationship isn't clouded by feelings from the past. Sure, you might never go back to your ex, or they might make you angry every time you think about them... but that's still mental and emotional energy being expended in areas that could otherwise be spent more productively. Your partner will feel this vacancy, and they will grow distant and disappointed the more it occurs. 

Make sure you are wholehearted before bringing someone new into your life. Otherwise you will actively contribute to the vicious cycle of emotional unavailability by making someone else feel as unhappy and unworthy as you had once felt with your last partner.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmyw7m/stop_using_others_as_an_emotional_buffer_while/

4,nmz3e1,1622212253,How do I break it off with this girl?,"So I posted a few days ago something which I subsequently deleted. 

Essentially: Met a girl on OLD, we talk a lot via snap now, I've been on a date with the girl. She was pretty, great personality, lots of common interests, super smart basically had everything going for her... Other than the fact she was very overweight, I knew she was a little chubby but it was A LOT more than expected. 

I asked if I should basically power through, to see if I can get over it. 

Most of the advice was that I probably shouldn't pursue the relationship. Which I'm inclined to agree with, especially as I could not see myself being with her romantically, past the point of kissing ect. 

I have little to no experience with this. What's the best way to break it off? I feel like she is quite invested, and tbh I am too. 

I mean there's no easy way to break it off and I'm obviously not going to call her out for being fat. Help.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmz3e1/how_do_i_break_it_off_with_this_girl/

12,nn0klm,1622216409,Left once again.,"Hi all, first time posting here and kind of excited, also just need to get this off my chest.   
So, I've met this girl back in November and December and we hit it off SO much, so much stuff in common, lots of laughs, she was super engaging in conversation, such a down to earth sweet, amazing girl.   
But back in December, she kind of dropped me, respectfully, told me that she was seeing another guy from a longer time and it's getting really serious there and doesn't want to lead me on, I respected that more so than just being left on seen or ghosted.  
Fast forward to mid April, early May. She added me on Snapchat again and we started talking, a week and a half goes by and we go on another date, went amazingly well just like the first one, lots of laughs again and she paid for my food which totally caught me off guard (Never in my past relationships/dates has this happened) and she said we will hang out for sure next time she is available.

  
We're back to just messaging each other and I can see she's super interested and she even told me she has a crush on me and I tell her the same. Come my birthday on May 15th, since she works she sends me flowers, chocolates, a stuffed animal and a little note and again, I'm blown away cause I have never had this kind of treatment before. 

  
Then the start of this week she was just off, taking forever to reply, not as engaged anymore.  
She did tell me she was feeling sad, down, depressed and stressed with an issue with her family so I kind of gave her time, but I was also confused because it was just so sudden. 

  
Come yesterday, I popped the question if that we're good and it feels like we're drifting again and I reference the time from December and that it seems like it's happening again, I also told her I don't want to add to her stress but I just want to know since I feel like I can be open with her.   
She says something along time lines of ""We're good, just that I feel like we're rushing into this way too fast to be a relationship and considering she just got out of the relationship when we first started talking, it's making her see me more as a friend than a boyfriend, and she feels bad because I'm an amazing guy""  


I told her basically ""I understand, I don't think we were rushing into it and but I get it if you feel like that, also I didn't know when we first started talking that you just got out of one, I thought you were out for a bit. I was just having a hard time reading you. Don't get me wrong I have a crush on you because you're an amazing girl, but if being friends is where we get off, then that's fine. Hanging out and being together was awesome, but I was more the one that was pushing it to be a relationship than you were, we relate a lot of stuff and it would a shame to kind of drift and unadd each other again but if we're friend's, I'm down""   


She says thanks for understanding and I tell her to take some time to clear her head, to be happy and I'm always a call/text away and then we left it at that.  


I guess I'm just confused and kind of sad, she's really cool, like checked off everything I wanted from a potential partner but I feel like the timing was just bad which happens, I do want to give her time before I talk to her again, maybe a month for her to clear her head and me to just kind of chill? not sure. But it went so well every single time we talked, no awkwardness, both times she said she had a crush on me but just bad timely I suppose.   
Thanks for letting me rant.   


TLDR: Met this girl on Tinder back in November, went on a date, went amazingly well, she told me things were getting serious with another guy, was honest, 4 months later we start talking again, we go on another date and it goes amazing again, then she feels bad that we're rushing into things as she just got out of her relationship which is making her see me as a friend and not a boyfriend and she feels bad about it, told her it's okay if she wants to be friends and to take her time to clear her head and we left it at that.

17,nn18ch,1622218215,Dating is so weird,"When it comes to dating it seems like men and women lately have very different goals.  A lot of guys only have one goal when it comes to dating; to hook up.  They will lie, manipulate, and tell you whatever you want to hear just to get to the at end result.  You have the pick-up-artist type guys who don't care about getting to know you, it's just like a game and a conquest for them.  

Women, on the other hand, spend much of their effort trying to weed out these guys and many of them only seem to have one end goal; marriage.  They will lie, manipulate, and tell you whatever you want to hear just to lock you in, it doesn't even seem to matter if you are the right guy, they just want a ring on their finger.  

Guys- you know what's a good way to ensure a lot of sex?  Relationships and even marriage.  Maybe actually spend some time to get to know someone and the sex will get better and better. 

Girls- you spend to much time glamourizing marriage because maybe you want to feel safe and you don't want to be alone.  If you focus too much on just getting married don't take the time to actually get to know someone, you'll just end up divorced and alone anyway.  

You see, the end goal is ultimately the same; to be with someone that fits your needs.  You do not have to lie, manipulate, disappear, or be a douche to get there.  If you just want to hook up without a lot of expectations, say that.  If you have a need to feel committed and connected to someone, say that.  Why does it need to be so difficult? Save yourself a lot of time, energy, and drama down the road and just be honest with each other, and with yourself. If you are honest about what you want and you both want different things, go your own way and don't take it personally. 

And one other thing:  Remember to treat people like people. Guys- women are not just something to have sex with, they are people, treat them with the respect you would give your mom, sister, or grandmother. Girls- guys are not here just to serve you, you don't need them to pay for everything and pull out chairs for you.  You can do that easily yourselves so quit acting like it's their ""duty"".  A ring on your finger isn't going to magically solve all of your problems and make you happy forever. Just put your gender differences aside and treat the opposite sex as normal people and you will probably get along much better.

He brought wine which he bought from Italy just for our date, cheese platter and crackers etc. The best date I had for a while. He is just the nicest person. So thoughtful and  considerate. He checked almost all of the boxes. I really thought this could be a really special thing.

Fast forward to last night, I asked him to come over for a home-cooked dinner. He brought wine and dessert for us to share. Everything was going great. I asked him to stay the night. Before things got physical I disclosed my hpv status (I have a post about it in this sub if anyone is interested). His reaction was amazing. I answered all of his questions, he was so understanding. We started to fool around a bit and there were no spark. We were not sexually compatible at all.

Even though he was almost everything that I was looking for, it did not feel right. next moring after we had breakfast I told him that we should not see each other again and was honest about why.

God, I feel awful. I liked him a lot but sexual compatibility is important to me. Why am I like this? Dating during a pandemic is hard. Dating with hpv is harder. And I found an ALMOST perfect person. This could have been something amazing. I know I did the right thing but I am losing hope to find someone who is just right for me.

I use dating apps to date and honestly prefer a short introductions and pleasantries, then setting the date up and moving over to real life conversations. I only like using text in between meet ups but like to keep online and text messaging short, mainly to plan meetups for the date or sex or whatever it is we want. 

The guy I'm talking to on the app right now I find attractive yes but the long paragraphs he sends me are killings me. We already have a date in place this coming week but ever since we established that he's been messaging me endlessly. My question is if we talk about all these things over the phone what is the point of meeting up in person? I feel overwhelmed talking to this guy now because I don't know what part of the long paragraphs to address. It's almost draining to keep up the conversation and I feel tempted to just walk away completely. I thrive in real-life conversations and will only resolve to long paragraphed messages and texts when there's just no other way to get to a person. 

The last time this issue occurred I told the guy I was feeling overwhelmed by his long messages and he told me he was totally fine with just holding off until we met up, It did not go anywhere after date 2 but at least he tried to see my perspective and meet me where I was without being offended. The guy before him got annoyed and threw a fit and we never met up. I want to handle it well with this current guy so he doesn't feel shut down but so I still can meet up with him and get to know him without loosing my mind first.

Has anyone else experienced this? What is the most mature way to deal with this? Why does this keep happening and how can I prevent this?

Didnt know where to put this. To be clear i am not part of the LGBTQ+ but i do support peoples rights to choose what to do with their bodies and who they date/marry.

I was having a debate with someone where the subject of transgender/cis dating came up.

My first reaction was, someone shouldnt have to disclose their medical history to partners if they dont want to. But as i thought about it, i started to think in terms of the partner. Even though i believe you don’t have to disclose medical history, i also believe that every partner has a right to know who they are dating or getting in bed with and by not telling the partner, the person is taking their right to choose away from them And that there should at least be some moral obligation in telling your partner.

34,nn33pk,1622223327,She texted me during no contact,"Hello. I will try my best not to waste your time here.

I liked a girl who works with me and knew her for quite some time like 2 years. Last year we seemed to connect in some ways and I asked her out. We had a total of 3 dates and I HAVE NOT made any move such as trying to kiss or etc since I was worried about losing her.

Anyways, our last date was in September 2020 which is when I told her I liked her and wanted to move forward. She gave me not ready for a relationship line but wanted to stay friends and did not want to lose me. I have not accepted that and told her to text me if anything would change.

**We did not text each other at all after that day. Not even after the date like how did she arrive home or etc.**

Time went by and this year she kinda started indirectly contacting me such as liking my profile picture and reacting to a few of my Facebook stories.

Yesterday I have posted a story of my taking over the mic (voice acting) and she texted me directly asking about which mic was that in the video.

I said hi and gave her a link then she asked what software I was using to edit and I responded accordingly. She told me that she was familiar with it and what I did was I just liked her message and that's it.

QUESTION (sorry for caps): Do I text her and ask her out on a date or do I do nothing about it? Do I wait for her to text me again and then do it?

Worth mentioning that losing her from my life is not the best thing and I would like to be close to her again.

We aren't dating, nor do I think we ever will for obvious reasons, but that makes me a bit sad?

I completely picked the wrong brother, which is just my luck.

My ex started off great but he quickly became the opposite of what I want. Whereas his brother is just such a good person. He's got a heart of fucking gold that my ex never had. We're like the same person and get on so well.

Also, we live together now. I moved in with him a month ago because, as I said, we get on really well, he needed a housemate, and he trusts me with him and his kid. I'm close with all my exes family and my ex and I are on good terms. 

There's been times where I've felt like his brother has flirted with me, especially when we've had a drink, he gets quite touchy and just always goes on about how stupid his brother was for letting someone like me go. He says he'd love to meet someone like me and that I'm just kind of perfect in every way.

But then he's also made passing comments about how he'd never get with his brothers ex or how it's always the good girls that are off limits and i just don't know.

He's an attractive dude and I recognise how much I'd like to have the chance to see if something could happen, but I don't feel anything romantic for him because it seems pretty futile.

My ex and I broke up 2 years ago, and even he said we're suited and he'd be a bit shocked but wouldn't mind.

I think it's more so that his brother just wouldn't  want to get with someone that his little brothers been with. (I'm 22, my ex is 23 and his brother is 30)

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Is it a completely crazy thing to even consider having something with my exes brother? It just sucks feeling like he's sort of my perfect person and I can't have him.

Like, I've always been confused about how I feel for my ex because I never looked at anyone else really. Then his brother came along and made me realise that my ex just feels kind of like a stranger now and has showed what a good man is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nn3cwt/dating_my_exes_older_brother/

I’ve never been out with a woman, I’ve honestly been trying to for years now but always get scared. I will tell a woman how I feel and they will try to pursue me but I freak out.

Not knowing whether a person is homophobic or not makes me feel anxious and I'm scared of wasting my time talking about favorite food and hobbies just to eventually find out that they are gonna be absolutely intolerable.

Besides, I don't socialize with people that much to begin with. The only person I'm truly comfortable talking to is my closest friend and we don't even chat on a daily basis. Hence getting to know a new person and the pressure to text them constantly to maintain interest exhaust me.

Yes, looks are important, there's no denying that. But chances are, if you're a half decent looking guy that takes care of himself by:

1. **Grooming;** keeping a kempt beard or lack thereof, taking care of your hair, etc. 
2. **Staying active** in any way. This doesn't exclusively refer to just exercising but having things that you enjoy doing and can be enjoyed with others.
3. **Keeping your wardrobe fresh:** Not just rotating the same 5 shirts that have been washed 400 times, wearing clothes that fit you well, and more importantly, wearing clothes that make you feel GOOD. You'll start carrying yourself differently when you walk out of the house with a fit that you put some thought into that truly matches your personality.

If you work on these things, you're already closing the gap between yourself and the more ""genetically gifted"" gentlemen out there.    
    
The dudes who are getting tons of matches on OLD aren't all Brad Pitts and George Clooneys. They're just guys who put effort into how they look and in turn, grow more confident in who they are.  
    
It hurts me to see so many guys on this sub who have basically given up because they think their looks are an anchor that's forever weighing them down.

63,nn6tdf,1622233674,Communication communication communication,"Have I stressed enough about communication yet? It’s something I see so often on this thread that isn’t taken into consideration very often. People get quite scared about asking questions or get scared about scaring people away with something that’s stressing them out when they can simply just ask a little question to ease their mind. And then you overthink it and do something irrational. Before doing that irrational thing, communicate first and then go from there! It’s the least you deserve. An example that taught me the importance of communication...

I’m dating a guy I’ve known him now for a while things are pretty Damn great. I noticed when we are together it’s amazing, but there are times I noticed he may forget things or he’ll be on his phone and I ask him a question and there is radio silence. Then with texting he’s terrible BUT he calls me instead. Now it’s taken me time to get used to this as I’ve been used to regular texters, and also other tendencies made me question things. 

Anyways he has told me twice actually that he has adhd just slipped it in but I never thought about it until I decided to search about it. His tendencies matched and so I actually just decided to ask him about it as I was overthinking does him not texting mean he’s not interested or is it to do with adhd etc?! 

Simply texted ‘can I ask you about your adhd?’ He FaceTimed me and openly said yeah go ahead 

And it just ended up being a great conversation of us laughing at how he did things he doesn’t realise and me being that girl to remind him. I asked him if he can hear me speak when he’s sat on his phone and admitted he can’t multitask and basically has low attention span due to adhd. And he even explained the texting and how he prefers calls, hence he phoned me without warning. It made me relax more that it’s just who he is

We ended the evening with a FaceTime, organising our next date and then as he knew I didn’t want to end the call he let me sit on ft for a while just hanging out doing our own thing in the background. I’ve realised He’s patient when I have worries, as we are different in those aspects, and if I never just communicated things I would’ve missed this side of him I never knew about 

His expert advise for me ‘just be like me and not think too much’ hahaha

And this is why communication is important.  It definitely helps to grow our connection knowing we can openly discuss things.

Then after 25 days using tinder I skipped it for 3 months and then started using for i guess nearly 20 days, so thus cycle repeated 3-4 times till date. I am simple looking brown 20 M, Studying in India’s elite 10 engineering college. Now, I don’t think i’ll use any dating apps in future. Because my experience was bad. My life is not interesting much these days. Atleast in college there were many friends to hangout and have fun. But, still not getting even 1 girl to date, wtf hell is my life. This COVID has affected us lot in every means. 

Give some tips to cope up with this. I really need someone to talk these days.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nn7ac7/tinder_sucks/

73,nn7tqr,1622236413,"Suddenly, I can’t stop thinking about him.","I, (21f), have been single since October. Recently, life has been alright! I have a really great therapist who has helped me with my OCD a great deal, very supportive parents whom I moved back in with last year, I just enrolled on a Creative Writing BA starting in October. Life’s really looking up. 


Last week I ended things with a guy who, despite appearances, was a complete tool. Luckily, we were only just over two months in to seeing each other so we weren’t “official” yet so I wasn’t too bummed about it. 


Since going through pretty intensive therapy, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about my first love. I was completely over him, and even had a pretty serious relationship since then. I was 18 when I started seeing him, but I’d had a crush on him for about five years prior as he was two years above me in high school and I’d look at him longingly from a distance and think how gorgeous he was. Years later, after high school we started seeing each other. God, he was romantic and not to mention absolutely GORGEOUS. I was so sure that he was my soul mate. To be honest, I still am. We were so perfect for each other and we were like best friend as well as lovers. It only lasted about six months but that was the first time I ever felt real heartbreak. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t my even shower. All I could do was stare at my bedroom wall and cry. 


Eventually, I moved on and met somebody else and so did he and I haven’t even talked to him in over a year. He’s still with his girl and seems really happy, which I am so glad of cause he really deserves that. But, recently he’s been on my mind, the songs we used to listen to together are in my head, I can’t stop imagining our first kiss in the park under the gazebo at sunset in May. God, I miss him so much. 



I did see him one last time after we stopped seeing each other. It was in February 2020, the day before Valentine’s, he’d been with his new girl a couple of months by then and I’d just started seeing my ex boyfriend. He came over to my new flat because I messaged him and told him I missed him and wanted to try being friends. He said sure, and the next night he came over when he finished work. He finished at about 10pm and arrived at about 10:20pm. We sat in my room and watched The Simpsons (one of the things we bonded over was it being both of our favourite show). No funny business. No touching or anything. Just catching up and watching TV. When he left, I walked him to the front door to say goodbye. He said, “Can I have a hug? Is that okay?” I hugged him. It was a long, tight hug and he stroke my back and my hair. We pulled away and looked at each other with sadness. I told him I missed him. He said he missed me too and then he left.

3 months have passed and we’re still in communication. Sometimes I’ll reach out to him, but most times it’ll be him reaching out to me. I would say we communicate at least twice a week. We’re both fairly busy so we tend to save the long conversations for the weekend. We catch up and see what the other is up to, but it doesn’t go beyond that.

I found her attractive and wanted to talk to her. I thought of complementing her on a tattoo on her forearm and then seeing where things went from there. But then I encountered the same problem that has caused me issues in the past: I found myself held back by a strong sense of reticence toward talking to a girl I didn't know. I don't know what it is, but it's some sort of shyness I get when I run into an attractive woman. I want to talk to her, but I just can't bring myself to do it. 

This has been a problem for me in the past. Sometimes it wasn't an issue and I was able to talk to girls I found attractive, but only in a setting like school where I started by talking to her about a club, common interests, etc then I got to talking about her as a person. It's hard for me to compliment a girl about her dress, hair, etc for whatever reason - I have no idea why. There was a girl I met in college who was really beautiful and we had common interests, and she liked me a lot. But things fizzled out when I couldn't bring myself to convey how I really felt about her. 

Argh! It makes me mad that I keep running into this problem. I need to find a way to feel comfortable flirting with women, but how? How do I overcome this shyness?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nn9k61/how_to_overcome_shyness/

People flex their accomplishments way too much. It shows they have an integral lack of understanding of interpersonal relationships and attraction. Credit scores, careers, cars, educational achievements, homeownership, etc are not going to attract the right person to you.

Instead of flexing degrees, homes, careers and money, more people should ask themselves these questions: **Are you interesting? Are you fun to be around and talk to? Do you give off positive energy?

So I (17f) was texting my boyfriend (17m) on messages and left him opened on snapchat. I didn’t realize i left him on opened, even after i went back on there because I kinda just look for the ones with the colors? Like i’m not a huge believer of snapchat, i don’t care about opened or delivered. Well, he got super pissed and asked me why i left him on open and responded to someone else. I just don’t pay attention? 
During all of this i was with my best friend swimming in the pool and then it started to storm so we both rushed to hop in the shower. After that i had to pack to go home.
Like he knows i have a short attention span and if i didn’t see the color by his name then i assumed he hadn’t responded. I didn’t even realize i left him on open. So he texted me on messages and asked me why i left him on opened. I told him i must’ve forgot to snap back and didn’t realize. He got super pissy and asked me how i forget to snap back my boyfriend. I told him i didn’t realize and must’ve forgot. He told me to not “just lie and say you forgot”. I got super upset and called him and asked him why would he accuse me of lying to him. He went on to say that he just doesn’t get how i “forgot” and that it doesn’t make any sense. 

He accused me of ignoring him and leaving him on open on purpose, (even if i texted him the whole time on messages) and kept insisting i did it on purpose. I asked him why would i even do that and he just kept going on about how he doesn’t know and that’s why he’s asking me.

Keep in mind he’s with like four of his best friends who all they do is complain about their gfs (which btw he’s ONLY like this when he talks to them) and I asked him why he always got riled up when he’s with them. I told him that sometimes it just happens.

Basically a lot of repeated things happened bc he couldn’t let it go and then he finally told me that he realized how crazy he was being and that he was sorry. And said he was worked up and has trust issues. I told him “good for you” because I mean, what can i say to that?

“Oh that’s okay you can treat me horrible and like i always lie to you bc you have trust issues?”
I have them too and i can tell y’all i’ve never accused him of this stuff. 

I just don’t know what to do because i’m heartbroken and he treated me like shit. I haven’t stopped crying for around five hours and i feel like i’m going to throw up. He’s down this before but not for awhile. 

What should i do? Am i overreacting? I feel absolutely heartbroken bc he didn’t listen to me and accused me of lying to him.

And then suddenly out of the blue things changed. She got kind of cold and distant for a couple days. I internally panicked a little, trying to figure out what was going wrong. And then she left. Ended it with one text message. 

I was hung up on her for a while after that. Then I got over it and just figured I'd never hear from her again.

But recently she got back in touch. She apologized and explained she has realized she has emotional problems around feeling close to people. We caught up a little. 

It was actually good. If she had reached out, say, a six weeks after leaving, it might have brought back my feelings for her and been unpleasant. But now, with this distance from it, it's just nice to get a little clarity around it, and to be able to mentally classify the experience a little more positively.
