Most common things you hear is ""You can do better than that"", ""At least you're happy"", and more mean stuff to say. I heard it really affect confidence of socially awkward people that landed a very physically attractive partner(The one's they thought would say no).

Our team of people in my function is spread across the country - my job is leading our function in Texas. My first week at the company,  I was 90% sure that my coworker (32M) , who worked in NYC before the pandemic but had moved in with his parents in Connecticut, had the hots for me. I like him and have developed feelings.

On Friday, our boss announced that, after 8 years at the company, my coworker crush will start law school part-time at the University of Connecticut and work part-time at the company in the fall, before leaving for law school full time.

I haven't said anything to him yet about it because I was sad on Friday and couldn't figure out what I want to say. I'm confident that he at least found me attractive and we've been flirting and it feels disingenuous to just say ""good luck - nice working with you!"" I'm in a lot of fear, though and overthinking how to approach a conversation that I want to have Monday.

I've definitely dropped some pretty obvious hints that I like him, but have also held back from talking to him as much as I'd like to, because I've been freaked out and in fear about the potential repercussions of getting involved with a coworker and regretting it. Now, that's obviously not as much of a problem, but the fact that he doesn't even live in the same state and I've only talked to him on a group Zoom once a week has also made me fear that having feelings for him is crazy.  He had previously said back in April that he didn't want to go back to NY and wanted to move somewhere warm and I had been hoping he would move to Texas because he works with our corporate leaders and our corporate HQ is in Texas. With my job, I can't leave Texas.

The way he's interacted with me over the past 6 months, doing favors for me, despite the fact that he's more senior, and messaging me in a way that my friends confirmed was major flirting, confirmed he had a crush or was at least attracted to me. He and I have been the only ones on the team who've attended our team chit chat Zoom every week since I started and has seemed nervous when we've spoken directly. Also causing me fear, however, is that someone told me when I said I was single to ""watch out for \[crush\] - he's a player"" and when I said he'd hit on me my first week they said ""Yep, could have predicted that."" After that, I leaned back a little.

I had just messaged him Wednesday to say I'm glad he's watching the bachelorette with us. He said he liked our weekly team chit chat Zoom calls and I mentioned how I really liked them to get to know everyone - including him. He responded likewise and asked me how it was going so far and if I was still glad I joined the company and I told him it's honestly been overwhelming at times but my boss is great and he reassured me it would get easier as I get more settled.

I don't know what to do - I have to acknowledge the news that he's starting law school and am genuinely happy for him - he should be doing something bigger than he currently is. I want to at least acknowledge that I'll miss flirting with him, especially since it seems like there's been so much flirting that it would be remiss not to give him the ego boost that I was into him, since I'm confident he has found me attractive.

We went to the dog park and had a really great time. She texted me after and we joked about stuff.


This past week we went to the dog park again and then got tacos and went back to my place to watch a movie. We made out a bit and got a little more handsy but things never progressed to anything further. She isn't a big texter and doesn't seem to be on her phone much even when we are together so when she is quiet with texting me back during the week to check in I assume its just cuz she isn't always on her phone.


Today we went on another date. We were going to go on a small hike but because of the weather we made a 90 minute road trip to a bigger city and hit up IKEA (always a fun date) and got ice cream. I was extremely nervous and full of anxiety before the date and I think it kind of affected my ability to be myself but also it just felt like the same vibes and connection wasn't there. She said some things that I didn't love but I also am trying to not expect someone to be perfect.  The other day when we talked about our third date plans I asked if she liked a specific meal because I was planning to cook for her when we got back from the road trip. On the way back she said she didnt realize I was planning like an all day thing but said she would come over because I already prepped the food. We hung out and chatted while I was cooking and as soon as we were done eating, I tried making out but she just wasn't really feeling it.


I am feeling really depressed. I had such high expectations for her because of how great the first two dates were. I dont know if this third date was just bad or if my anxiety got in the way. But I dont know if I will hear from her again. I feel so bad about myself and am just laying here. I will see her again to see if my vibes about her changed and if it wasn't just a one time thing--if she even wants to see me again.

Part of the problem is I was sheltered/homeschooled when I was younger, so I never was around girls much. Being sheltered caused me to develop insufficient social skills and become very introverted. I did not go to college straight out of high school; I eventually did go but took online classes due to working full time. So was never around girls in college much, either.

I recently 'broke out of my shell' and have become fairly outgoing and confident the last several years. But that has not translated into any luck dating. Granted, part of the issue is I've only asked out two girls in person because I'm not so desperate that I'm going to ask out just any female I run into. And my options are limited because I'm only around other people outside of work so often. But both times ended pretty poorly.

The first time was about two years ago, this girl was slightly older than me. Fairly attractive, and she was really giving what I thought were strong hints that she wanted me to ask her out. Kept hanging around with me 1-on-1 after group events and invited me to have a few drinks with her once. So I eventually asked her, she said yes. We went out for drinks, then watched a movie. Then, however, she tells me she doesn't want a relationship with anyone, she just wants someone to 'hang out' with. She was not interested in being anything more than friends. I wasn't too upset because it became apparent on the first ""date"" that we were not compatible anyway once I learned more about her (I put ""date"" in quotations because I don't really consider that to have been a date, I know she certainly did not). However, I was still a little annoyed about being led on, but whatever, I got over it. I also do not believe this was a rejection of me *per se,* because we still talk from time to time and I know she has not been in a relationship with anyone since and never talks about any desire to be in one. So I guess she just likes hanging out without the commitment. 

More recently, I asked another girl out. She's shy, but amicable. Very attractive. She said yes and we already had something planned, but then she texted me soon afterwards saying she wasn't ready to be in a relationship with anyone, thus the date never happened. I'm admittedly not great at reading body language when it comes to interest, but she didn't seem uncomfortable when I asked and she said yes, so I was a little surprised. I was disappointed and felt it was a little tacky on her part to say yes in person and then back out over text, but I chose to take the high road and just said I understood and wished her well (and to be fair, I know it's always sort of 'putting someone on the spot' when you ask them out and sometimes they don't want to hurt your feelings if they aren't interested). She did not respond or acknowledge my reply. Haven't spoken since. This one particularly hurt because our families knew one another, so I felt I had a chance. Perhaps that's why she didn't want to go out, though, because maybe she thought that would be weird. I might never know. They don't talk or see each other much so I didn't see how it would be that weird, but maybe I'm just naive. In hindsight, asking her out was probably a bad idea for that reason, but what's done is done. I guess I felt like I was just making excuses if I didn't go for it, and of course at my age, I'm a little tired of being single. 

I've tried online dating as well, but have had even less luck. No girl I've messaged has ever replied (though I think some of the profiles on those sites are probably inactive anyway), and only one girl ever messaged me, but she was thousands of miles away so that obviously did not end up working.

I'm definitely not bad looking and am about 6 feet tall, but I'm no stud either. I'm skinny and have a minor underbite. I used to go to the gym for a while a couple years ago, but got discouraged when I wasn't seeing much result and quit going. I planned to start again last year but of course covid hit and kind of ruined that. I've recently started going again frequently, and am more motivated than ever to put some muscle on. The underbite is a long story, but I'm doing what I can to correct that now that I have some money saved up.

Other than that, however, I think I have a lot going for me. Good job, no debt, likable personality with decent amount of friends, self confident, well accomplished for someone my age, etc. Just no luck on the dating scene. Any advice on what I should do differently? I'd really like to at least go on some dates before I start approaching 30. And is this kind of stuff (being led on, etc.) fairly common?

The other day I was on a graduation party with all my year group, everybody was 15/16/17. There was alcohol (Spain), weed, and more shit I knew I wasn’t trying for sure.  Everybody at the party drank, some a little, some more, I personally had more than most people but I’m capable of much more than them (although this was the second time I tried drinking lol) so I was in an okey state. 60/70% were boys and the rest were girls, I knew nearly everybody apart from some people who where not from our school. 

I wasn’t dating anyone and I never kissed a girl, but I was never worried about it too much. My best friend did kiss someone a long time ago, so he had more experience than me. 

During the party he made out with a girl 3 times during night, just because he shot his shot… Not like me, who even with help of alcohol was still scared/acting like the girl should make the move… 

I was speaking to this girl, I knew her for a long time but I just wasn’t a close friend, just classmates. What I know is that some time ago she liked me, and I didn’t like her but just found her cool. During the party, while we were talking she didn’t stop making comments like “oh I used to like u so much before” or “I remember I found u so pretty before” but all in past tense, I knew it was an indirect way of saying she still likes me…

During the party she was looking very good and I found her attractive at that moment, also , after school ended she said she is leaving  the town, and me too, which meant that we wasn’t going to see each other ever again probably. 

At one time, we were both alone outside and she mentioned again how she used to like me and the same sentence over again, I knew this was my moment to kiss her but I don’t know why, i really dont know why I thought she , a girl, was going to make the move… so I just said oh that’s cool or something dumb to change topic. 

Apart from that moment the same situation repeated at least once during the night, but I acted in the same exact way, which I think made her think im dumb or just not in to her.

After the party my friend asked  me why I didn’t kiss her ? As he heard how she was flirting with me sometimes and saw how I didn’t use my opportunity.

So I really don’t know why, although this was probably our last and only chance to kiss/have some fun/confess love, I acted so dumb and didn’t took my only opportunity??

I don’t want this to happen to me again… so I would appreciate some tips or some explanation from someone who already experienced something similar. 

I’m now quite angry at myself as I know I won’t see her ever again probably…",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,848093,public,self,Why didn’t kiss her??,0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3wpvf/why_didnt_kiss_her/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

I have no idea what to do and I’m feeling extremely discouraged. 

I’ve been online dating pretty consistently for three years. I have never been on a first date where I wanted to go on a second date. I have dated a handful of guys for 3-4 dates and even tried getting a little physical with some just to see if my feelings improved, but it’s never worked. I always have a fun time, there’s good convo, but just don’t have romantic or physical feelings for the guys at ALL. Even cute guys. I’m not being “picky”, there are no specific characteristics I’m waiting for, I’m very open minded. I just don’t feel anything and I cant fix that. 

This leads to me having to nicely and honestly tell a lot of guys that I’m not interested, which is such a hard convo because they usually think that since the date was fun, that it went well. 

I know I’m straight because I’m not attracted to women. I know I’m not asexual because I’ve been very sexually into my exes (but we broke up for a reason, so, no future there). 

It’s just the format of online dating. I met my exes as mutual friends and got to know them in a friendly casual environment for a while before we ever talked and hooked up. But with online dating, it seems like if you’re not immediately into them, there’s no way to casually get to know them. You are both clearly on a 1:1 date to get to know if you like each other. The opposite of casually getting to know someone by just being around them a lot. 

I haven’t met anyone at my work or hobby groups of which I have several. None of my friends have any set-ups for me, mostly because I already know all of their mutual friends.

I don’t know how much longer I can do this. I have no idea how to make it work for me. If you have any ideas at all, I would really appreciate it.

We had a fun group conversation and it turned out we had a mutual friend and some interests in common. He ended up driving me home since the friend I came with left early. I wasn't really thinking so I left quickly without getting his number or anything. In any case it usually takes me some time to develop feelings so now, 2 weeks later I'm wondering if that was a mistake. It seems unlikely that we'll randomly meet again since I'm not super close to the host of the party and was just tagging along with a friend, and also Y lives 1 hour drive away so we won't run into each other. I'm debating whether to contact our mutual friend to ask for Y's number.

The thing is that it seems a bit aggressive to track down Y like this (our mutual friend wasn't even at the party, so I'm kind of going out of my way to do it) and ask him out, when I'm not even 100% sure how I feel about him other than ""cool and nice guy."" I feel like I'll give a signal of being extremely interested when really, I'm not sure how I feel except I'd like to hang out with him more. Obviously I also have no idea how Y feels especially since our conversation at the party was mostly in a big group. (Even more so because it's been 2 weeks since we met - he may not even remember me??) Plus, if I ask him out then one of us has to commit to driving an hour each way which seems like a lot when we've barely met...

We started talking daily, about emotional things, the problems we are fighting with and generally much more than just small talk. There has suddenly been physical contact too, from small touches to long and warm hugs. She's also very flirty but I think that's just how she is. I'm also terrible at seeing the signs lol

She is currently going through a break up, maybe she just needs some support. But even then it's kind of weird to me that she's been so open with me despite only knowing me for 2 months. 

On top of that there's so many horror stories of dating co-workers. Maybe I am also just over thinking this way too much and she just sees me as a good friend. I personally feel like there are definitely some sparks. At times we just look each other in the eyes for a long time without saying anything. Time moves differently when we are together and argh I just don't know what to make of this.

Since I didn’t get any closure from this girl, I’m hoping redditors might enlighten me on what could’ve happened.

In a nutshell, my mother and I visited family friends. This girl there became interested in me, though she had little info on me to begin with since I lack social media presence. However she still contacted me via text and a date was set up. 

We’ve met a total of four times, I genuinely felt a connection. Had a light kiss, shared laughs, and made plans to visit a nearby amusement park. All in all, I had great hopes for everything since she seemed very invested in me. I also told her about my future career in aviation (which I’m working towards). She said she’d love to spend time watching shows with me, or hanging out and go on runs or take my dogs to the park with me. She even expressed happiness she experienced in these small dates with the family friends (whom she’s closer with).

I messaged her one day, and on that same day she replied and then began to ignore the last few messages that followed. After everything seemed well before, she simply stopped communicating with me all together right here.

There was never any conflict between us and we were supposed to visit that amusement park but it never happened. It just lingers in my mind because I never received an answer from her, like I didn’t mean anything. I really couldn’t fathom how someone changes night and day like this and doesn’t at least give an answer.

The only thing I could think of is she found interest in someone else (recently) but there hasn’t been any evidence of this according to the family friends. She kind of withdrew herself from communicating with them (and me) and I saw her post a selfie nonchalantly on an Instagram story, meaning she is alive and well.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,848322,public,self,Ghosted out of thin air,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o3znvc/ghosted_out_of_thin_air/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

Next day we had a short date and everything seemed fine after that she left for another city coz of her exams we texted for about 2 days and she still seemed having fun and liking me but I was always sending first so I stopped for about 5 days and she never messaged me and I was wondering that maybe she wasn't much into me at the end.
Next day I conforted her and told her I had feelings about her but she rejected me saying she hadn't time for someone at the moment and that it was not about me specifically just she couldn't give importance to someone else at the given time and that she was honest about it. i tried to play it cool and that I was ok(I fking wasn't it hurted me like hell and still does).

Now I learned from a friend of hers that she is coming back next week and that she finished her exams. What eats me is that the close friends I told the situation are all telling me that I should try again and that's how women behave sometimes. I don't think that way I believed if someone is interested enough it wouldn't rejected you straightforward and I believe what they say the first time like they really mean it and not speculate and force things.

But I am really bad at reading women and dating stuff and don't really know even if she liked me at the first place,is it worth it trying to interact with her again and how should I do it or it's pointless and I will give her free validation like I am thinking?

We had a vulnerable conversation about my worries going into a relationship etc, and he expressed that he didn’t think we were ready to hookup even though he really wanted to. 

Overall, great and honest date. He told me to call him the next day and we talked for a little. We also talked on the phone for an hour yesterday. We’re both traveling for the next few weeks so we haven’t been able to figure out when to see each other again.

I obviously thought it went pretty well with her openly expressing that she wants to meet up again. However, ever since the date she’s ghosted me.

We are both (F,M) 21.

Both in last year of college, he is shy.

\- Guy from different class came over to talk to me about my class several times. Completely random but was showing a real interest. He wasn't flirting necessarily, he could have just been nice.

\- His friend who I had never met is in my class, and came over to tell me that he was single.

\- His friends all say good-morning to me every day, smiling and sometimes laughing, again, I had never met them before, but they all know my name.

\- I took all these as little signs that he liked me, and I went over and talked to him. It turns out we both play the same game, he's super nice and now I like him. I then asked him out for dinner, and he said, ""once we're on break, we'll organize dinner"".

\- I asked him out for coffee when I saw him in the hall that next morning, and he said he had to go to class, but that we'd be seeing each other anyway, so I just left it at that.

\- He never pursued a conversation with me after then, even when we saw one another (but he didn't before I asked him anyway). We're now on break and we haven't called one another to organise dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

**My theories:**

1. All of the signs put together, I think he liked me. He's too nervous to make any moves. He's relying on me to call him and organize dinner.
2. He did like me at one point. He changed his mind after I asked him out, and he's no longer interested.

I didn't contact him again because I thought if he liked me he would, and because I didn't want to seem like I was weird and annoying him. But I am shy myself, so I know how awkward it can be to talk to someone, so I am giving him the benefit of the doubt...  What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Guy from different college course would come and talk to me about my class at random. He's super shy.

How times have changed but also what is this?

Just looking for some advice. I’m a late 20s woman and I’ve decided to stay single out of choice for the last 2 years. I was in an unhealthy and toxic relationship for 6 years and being honest I was a bit of a doormat for this person. I was cheated on , manipulated and over the years people in my life would comment on how much of an unequal relationship it was. I was chasing for commitment that never came. 

I’d finally had enough and decided I didn’t want to live life like that anymore and left said person. 
The last 2 years I’ve “levelled up” , been to therapy , worked on myself , gained confidence , travelled and excelled in my career. I’m happy with the person I have become and I’ve felt ready to dabble in dating. I’m not a casual sex dater and would prefer to get into a stable , healthy relationship. 
I approach dating as just getting to know someone usually without anything sexual until I’m ready but date multiple people as it’s really just meeting up for actual dates in public places.I like to feel like we are going in proper dates and old fashioned in the way I expect a man to court me first. I’ve struggled with dating apps as it doesn’t seem to suit my slower style. 
The thing is I’ve found a few guys now will make an assumption and small comments about how I come across as an independent woman and that I am sleeping with a few men. I’ve had a guy I went on two dates with say that I come across confident and he bets I have lots of guys. Another who I got to know slowly and had sex with as it felt right and afterwards he became distant  and made a comment about being an independent woman who enjoys sex?! (Are women not meant to enjoy sex?!) 

I find it baffling I’ve went from being an admitted doormat for a man and now I am a bit more confident in myself and much healthier emotionally , there is this assumption and some of the men I’ve met really don’t like that I’m slow to get to know them and actually dating to see what my best match is. This has meant some men I’ve met are just not for me and I’ve had various reactions to rejecting them. 
Just an example I met someone I went on a few dates with and they said they wanted to keep it casual as they weren’t in a place in life for anything else. At the time I wasn’t either so I agreed and we had a nice time and moved on mutually as life parted. A few months later I got a message from him basically asking if I wanted to be in a relationship. It was out of the blue and I was in a different country for work at the time so I said sorry not for me. I got a message back saying ah keeping your options open for other guys. 

I’m very much of the mind that commitment shouldn’t be forced and I don’t chase a man for it anymore. 

I just feel I am judged for actually enjoying being single and not in a rush which I wasn’t expecting.

I often completely lose any attraction to women I date after a few dates, to the point I wouldn't even accept sex if she paid me for it. 

Unless she offers to split the bill. She doesn't even have to split the bill, but offer it. And if she does split, well my engine's going to get overclocked. 

Other small insignificant acts of kindness on their initiative also do the trick. 

Typically throughout a date (or the getting to know process), the color and vibrance of the lady just fades away, until I'm just waiting for an opportunity to go home, annoyed that I wasted my time and money, but then if she does any small act of kindness, to anyone, that color and initial attraction returns at full force, yet rarely does this happen.  

Being polite to the waiter, thanking me for the date, saying she was glad to meet me, a compliment of any kind, and of course, splitting the bill. These would be the perfect date. 

The feeling I often have is akin to starvation. Like I've been starved of these small acts by any romantic interest. I was raised to play the gentleman, to always pay in full, to be kind in all my actions towards a date, yet doing so without reciprocation drains the life out of me. I just can't. I've recently started straight-up refusing to pay the for the whole date if she didn't at least make a gesture or show some kind of appreciation. 

I've tried talking about this to a female friend of mine, and she sarcastically responded I was just frustrated that paying for a date doesn't immediately equal getting laid. My reaction was of pure disgust. The idea of having sex with any of these past failed romantic interests was physically revolting. The imagery when my mind darted to that was of having sex with a ghoul, unclean, rotten, though on a pure physical level my previous romantic interests were good-looking though I can't even picture them in my head without feeling some nausea, just writing (thus remembering) this caused a bad taste in my mouth.

Me and my ex have been on and off for about a year and 6 months not until last May 2021. We would talk but then argue so we get cold again until one of us gives up and talk to the other person and the cycle goes on. In the last week of may, he decided to cut things off for good. He hasn't contacted me up until now and i heard that he is seeing a girl that his friends suggested even when we were still together. However i am not sure about that because when i asked the girl she denied having any relationship with him but evidences of them interacting and being touchy and sweet makes me think otherwise, also even though he doesn't contact me he posts like ""sad break up quotes and songs"" on his ig and still views if i contacted him on telegram. So im still not sure if i should really move on now even though it's been like a month because i feel like we're just taking a real ""break"" right now and we'll get back together again. However my female intution tells me otherwise because every time that i get this feeling it is always right so theres also a part of me that just wants peace and stable mind. I wanna stop stalking him and stop loving him and just wish him the best because i feel like i'm the only one still holding on and it hurts seeing him live his life like nothing happened while im here still suffering everyday for a month waiting for him to comeback. 

I feel like i don't want to waste my time,effort and feelings anymore. I want a clear mind and clear feelings. I want to give this love to someone and i always want it to be him. However i don't feel like he even wants this affection and loving that i have right now so i don't know what to do. Should i give this new guy a chance? He is so different from him, This new guy is quiet and we are more like however even though my ex is extroverted i like the feeling of always being on edge when im with him, however when im with this new guy i feel so at peace i don't know why, we've been friends for 4 years now but he just confessed to me and have been courting me for 2 weeks now, i really admit that we are more alike but that i think what makes our relationship ""boring"" because we literally don't have anything to explore unlike me and my ex we are so polar opposite so like we introduce each other on different things,people, places etc. and thats what i like most about us. However giving this new guy a chance seems so comforting knowing that i don't have to explain everything to anything because we know that we really understand each other and communication is great.

I asked her about it and she said she was mad I didn't ask about some event in her life, and also that I did not talk enough in general and she was tired of carrying the conversation. Then, things sort of snapped back for the rest of the weekend.

However, it's the next weekend again and now again I experienced the mean/angry mood. She is away so I texted her asking how she is doing and about my day. She ignored the former and commented that my days are so boring in a passive aggressive way.

Can we talk about this because it seems this is like literally a well-known fact no guy dares talk about at all because they'd just be labelled as 'ugly losers' or 'incels'.

For the sake of this discussion and scope of knowledge, I'll only be delving into straight sexuality here and to set things clear, I'm not hating on the opposite gender here as it's no one's fault but merely I just want to point out at how sometimes, treating both genders on the app as the same equally is not necessarily the same as bringing fairness.

Dating app being a simple tool of matching the opposite genders is hardly reality and couldn't be any damn further from the media's portrayal and popular misconception. And using the apps for so long... I've come to realise the apps goes kind of...in general, translate explicitly how dating is really like between genders.

Generally speaking, most girls are like queens on dating apps. They get on average far,far, far more likes than guys ever do in their lifetime. It's not uncommon for most girls, even the most average looking girls, to get 99+ likes within a week compared to an average guy almost never ever getting even half that amount for over a year on the app.

Some further research by Pew to show hard data on this is:

57% of men feel they do not receive enough messages vs only 24% of women

8% of men reported receiving too many messages vs a far higher 30% of women

I'm pretty sure the dating app companies themselves are well aware of this enormous discrepancy between genders and they do secretly take advantage of this and yet without actually acknowledging it publicly. For instance, Tinder was known for charging girls their Plus subscription at a much lower cost and CMB tends to give away free likes to women who just joined the app.

So how can anything be done about this? I wish I could do something myself but at the moment, I can only wish there'd be someone sensible enough to create a dating app that does NOT treat both genders the same. Because when you do so, all you get is an extremely loop-sided dating platform...

So basically, in order to have a thriving and successful relationship, you can’t express emotion, can’t tell her how you feel about her, and you just take everything as it comes.
