27F, 3 months ago, we went out to dinner and talked for 3 hrs on first meet up. We were in contact via Instagram messages. Then we talked on the phone to buy tickets &amp; see the Spider-Man movie. The day before movie I asked if he could stop sending those IG video reels politely, it was a bit overboard. On day of movie, he said good morning and I replied with a wave emoji. He normally would continue the conversation via Instagram but doesn’t message again until he said he was waiting at the theater. I was not as bubbly as I was on first meet up , I was very quiet (not against him). He was annoying me during the movie, he’s the type to laugh and make noises when something exciting came on. He nudged me during the movie and asked if I was ok because I was quiet and I said yes. At the end I told him thanks, he said you’re welcome and he said drive safe. When I spoke with him on phone day before movie, he told me that he talked about me with his friends but after movie he sent a message just now saying that he wasn’t really feeling it from me and it’s not going to work for him. I was more upset that he beat me to rejecting him, I would have done it if he didn’t. Flash fwd to a month ago, he sends me a dm with an inside joke, I just left him on read again. He continues to follow me on IG and view my stories but unmatched with me from the dating app we met through, I unfollowed him from IG. He removed me from IG earlier this week.

Maybe it’s because I feel like the fact that I have my v-card at 24 is unattractive.

The problem is, on a lot of the dating apps I use, it seems as though women are looking for something real. For a while, I thought I did too, until I realized that maybe I just want the sexual side of things. I believed that I should not have sex with someone unless I’m in a relationship with them (I’m not religious, although my mother wanted me to be a Christian when I was younger, and I did follow it for a little while, which might have messed up my perception of things).

But now, I think maybe I shouldn’t be so narrow-minded. If I want to have sex at least once in my life, and I’m not willing to wait until marriage, maybe I should look for casual sex and get back on Tinder, but this time update my profile with photos that are relevant, and clean up my bio a bit too.

I’ve struggled to find men I’m compatible with the U.K. I just don’t mesh with the U.K. dating culture as it’s too casual for me. Obviously not everyone is the same but cultural norms exist. 

All my relationships that I’ve had in the past 4 years have been with foreigners living in London: they are more commitment minded and actually try to court me. I find that I’m most compatible with American men. They’re similar enough to U.K. culture but more assertive and traditional. 

This leaves me in a predicament as I feel that I will probably have to migrate elsewhere to increase my chances of finding someone compatible. I’ve tried changing locations when online dating but nobody takes you seriously unless you literally live in their neighbourhood. Understandable but frustrating.

People  think you’re a scammer or a passport hunter if you live in a different country. I’m neither. I’m well educated, middle class and happy with being a Brit (excluding dating). I’m just really open minded and I don’t assume that Mr Right is living on my street. I’m willing to face a little long distance hardship if it brings me to the right person. I would be happy to move if I did find the one. 

Most guys are not open and will only consider someone local - especially Americans. Even when I state my location on my profile, guys don’t read it and get annoyed when I’m not in their neighbourhood. I would have thought with modern technology (FaceTime, cheaper flights and globalisation) people would be more open minded about dating internationally but it seems worse than ever.  People are less patient these days and are not prepared to work a bit harder to find the right person. It’s kind of like McDonald’s dating - quick cheap and easy.

At one point she asks how drunk I am, and say I'm pretty drunk. She says she’s starting to get the urge to flirt and be drunk and messy or nasty I think were her exact words.

It wasn't a joke. I can’t tell if it’s a red flag…she doesn’t really give me much confidence I can trust her when she’s drunk. Later on a guy was waving from his car through the drive through window while we were inside a fast food place…he was clearly being joking flirty at least making eyes and facial expressions. My GF waves because she’s a nice person she said. I felt a bit embarrassed. Probably doesn’t seem like much, but given the earlier comment, I just felt off the rest of the night.

I just brought it up today. Not mad or revealing my feelings, but just laughing at what we both said yesterday. She was quiet for a couple seconds, then said yeah, she did feel the urge to flirt but didn’t, and that it’s her drunk trait, when she gets horny drunk and starts talking to everybody basically. So essentially, I was right that the talking to people isn’t just friendly but a bit horny/flirty.

Which also makes me feel a bit gaslit, because some weeks back, we met up after being at separate parties and she was very drunk and and said hi to a random guy walking by us when we had almost made it to my dorm. I perceived it as flirty, and it upset me but I didn't bring it up until next morning and talked about it calmly. At that moment she denied it was flirty at all, said she was just a friendly and fun drunk. And when I said it seemed  messy and made me uncomfortable and unattracted at that moment, she basically said she didn't care it bothered me and that she can't promise she's gonna change anything about how she acts when she's drunk.

Now after this party, she basically admits the saying hi to random people does stem from a flirty/horny drunk place. Looking back at how she was completely denying it was flirty at all or how it could even give that vibe and making me feel like I was making it up in my head and being judgy about nothing feels like she was gaslighting me.

It might not necessarily lead anywhere or be harmful, but I wasn’t completely off in thinking it was flirty…So if she feels the urge to do that even when I’m there, I think it’s fair for me to feel a bit concerned about how she acts when she’s drunk, starting to talk to a bunch of guys in a way that might seem flirty and that she just admitted does stem from a horny/flirty place--especially when I'm not there.

I’ll preface my opinion on this matter by stating, my stance has NOTHING to do with controlling other people and their right to bodily autonomy. Rather, it is based on my own personal experience with an ‘exclusive’ FWB I had been seeing for more than a year.
 
I’m going to rewind to December 2020, to the moment when we were both sitting in his car outside of my house. In less than 12 hours I knew he would be on a plane flying across the ocean, to visit family for an undetermined amount of time. Now here is the important part, just two weeks prior I had undergone a series of traumatic events. In the span of 14 days I found out I was pregnant, underwent a medical termination and learnt through that process I mysteriously acquired an STI. Now picture this, someone who I spent an entire year with –who KNEW I had just undergone a life altering experience and was in an extremely emotionally fragile state; abruptly dumped me on the spot, because and I quote: he wanted to (bad f-word bad b-word) have fun! Not to mention, months later I learnt he gaslit me into believing I always had this STI because he knew all along, he hadn’t honoured our agreement. You guys, this man put on a pretty good act the entire time we were together. He lied to my face throughout it all, risking my physical health and well-being because he wanted his cake and eat it too. This guy didn’t drive me to my medical appointments, provide any emotional support after the fact and intentionally strung me along for the two weeks leading up to his departure to secure consistent sex. He then proceeded to terrorize me for a full year, by stalking me and spreading all kinds of nasty rumours online, while remaining completely unapologetic for the emotional turmoil and anguish I felt because of his actions. This singular event took me more than a year to process, and honestly, I am still not 100% healed yet. All I’m trying to say is; when rubber meets pavement, that person might not be your friend.

I (20-21F at the time) was in a relationship with a guy who is in the Navy (21-22M at the time). We were together for 15 months, and there were no problems at all. In November of 2020, I reached a really bad point in my life, and with the stress he was under from his career, we decided it would be better to remain friends. I was in my senior year of college majoring in cybersecurity. I was searching high and low for an internship so I can graduate, but I struggled so much I got depressed. It was the worst depression I went through.

He was a great friend, always supportive of me until last August where he ended our friendship. He had gotten in a relationship with another girl, and she didn't like me around, so he ended our friendship. A month later the end of our friendship, they married. 

I believe I was cheated on because our breakup was sudden, but I didn't think much of it at the time given we weren't fighting, it was more so I had needs at the time he couldn't handle. I believe he cheated on me because he was probably afraid to say to my face how I truly felt when I was in a vulnerable state. I believe he either:

A.) Cheated on me while we were together and bounced out because he might've felt guilt.

B.) They got together shortly our breakup

C.) Got together in August and married a month later in September (though I realize this is unlikely for people to get married in such a short time period).


I feel so bad now. I feel like she has something that I don't, and that I'm defective. Im in therapy for my body image issues, which Im doing better with. But now, I have a feeling I'll spiral down again knowing I wasn't good enough for someone to the point I possibly got cheated on. I don't know what to do, I feel lost.

This is a general question. The reason I ask is because of what happened to me. 

I matched with a guy and had good conversation. He asked for my IG, so I gave it to him. We followed each other and he said I was beautiful blah blah whatever. Then we got on the topic of how we don’t post enough of us on our profiles. 

He sends me a snap of him through Instagram DM. I say cute. I send one back. A really pretty pic but I didn’t use the IG camera so he could still see it unlike his which disappeared after I viewed it.

He opens it. Next morning he hearts my photo. Then unfollows me and unmatched me. I have a photo ready to send if a guy is trying to send pics bc I HATE when guys ask for a snap of me. As if I’m always ready or wanting to take a photo. 

Anyway. I messaged asking if he looked me up bc there’s one video of me where I don’t feel like I look the best but I’m always self conscious a guy will look me up and see it. I also have a YouTube but I’m proud of how I look on there for the most part.

He read the message, didn’t reply. I messaged again (I have no self control lmao) saying “Ok well that’s odd and rude but alright goodbye”. Then he just blocked me. 😂

I asked him to unfollow her because it made me uncomfortable and his excuse not to was “I know her in real life and you shouldn’t care who I follow”.  it’s pretty disrespectful to me that he would rather us break up than unfollow this girl (who btw he never likes any of her posts, and he says he never uses the app anyway) To me it’s like “well if you never use the app why are you fighting harder to keep following her than you are to make me feel comfortable?”.

We’ve known each other for a year and a half now and I love our friendship. I’m scared of ruining it if I confess my feelings and he acts differently.

I first realized that I liked him as more than a friend after 3 weeks of not seeing him at work because he got COVID. I had come to a realization that in out entire friendship we had never been touchy at all. We never hugged or anything. So I had to hold back my desire to squeeze the life out of him when I saw him at work again. I thought he might think it strange since we’ve never been like that. But the feeling of wanting to be near him and hug him has simply gotten stronger. He’s smart and hilarious and we have the best conversations. But we haven’t hung out out of work and we don’t even really text. 
Even at work people see us together all the time that they think we’re dating or married. We always laugh it off and almost even take pride in our closeness that we make it look as though we are together.
Our communication is amazing we almost even understand each other with a simple glance. We’re constantly catching the other looking and we just smile it off.

He did confess to me a while back that when we first met he thought I was beautiful and had a crush on me. I told him I also had a crush on him back then . But then nothing came of it and we continued as if nothing happened.
I’ve told him about the countless guys I go on dates with and he tells me amour girls he finds attractive from work. It’s been the norm all throughout our friendship. But recently I’ve grown more attracted to him and I can’t help but wonder if I should just go for it and tell him that I like him.
I feel like he’ll be skeptical and sometimes he’ll comment on how young and inexperienced I am. I’m worried he might think this is a school crush and that I’m naive.
He’s also a known flirt but he never quite picks someone and stick with them. Before he can really confess or make a move there is always something wrong with a girl and nothing comes of it. I’ve encouraged him to go after girl that we work with and I’ve named myself his wing woman.
I think I shot myself in the foot with that one.
I’m not sure what to do.

This guy and I started talking recently when I was visiting friends where he lives and he was showing interest even asked about meeting up to go on a date . I am actually moving back to where he lives in like 2 weeks or less. He reached out asking if I was ever coming back and I told him March. He didn’t respond after that so I don’t if he’s over it or just figured I’ll be back in March and we’ll talk then.. 

I don’t know if I should just give him my number and if he wanted to reach out then he could.. even though he told me to contact him..

I only work two days a week. On my last shift I remember sitting up at the front register when I saw this beautiful girl come in an start talking to the assistant store leader, turns out she was there for an interview. I was pretty blown away when I saw this girl. I did not have my glasses or contacts in so I could not make out any shar details, but after the interview the assistant store leader who interviewed her said to my one manager ""she is beautiful (my name) should date her""

I also went up to my one manager and sat down and said ""I have a confession to make, I think I have a crush on that new girl who came in"". Not sure if I should have said that, but every girl there that I talk to has a boyfriend, and I think they would like to see me get with someone, then this girl comes in.

It seems too good to be true. I hate the fact that I have a crush on her. I have never really spoken to her, she came thru my line after her interview but I just spoke to her like a regular customer. I feel it is unfair to have a crush on someone before speaking to them, I am just like the hordes of men that surely have the same thoughts. I feel like a piece of shit. Let alone the fact that I am a bit of a hopeless romantic. Yes, I have been with some attractive girls before, and I have reason to believe that I am an attractive guy my self, but nothing ever works out.

It has been a couple of years since I have really had any sort of romantic interactions with a girl, and probably longer since I actually put any sort of effort into it. It just makes me feel like shit. I catch feelings so quickly, and then you inevitably watch them drift away. Ever since I saw her I've been thinking about her, I found her facebook, and her best friends facebook where I saw more pictures of her. 

I really don't think she is out of my league appearance-wise, but you really never know nowadays, especially with tinder, she could be with multiple guys with more value than me every week. 

I worry that this will be like every other crush I've had where it is a fruitless endeavor, and really just a display of how pathetic I am as a human being.

Still, maybe it is a chance to actually show how far I've come since the last time I've had a crush. I really hope that I have an opportunity to talk to this girl and get to know her. Talking to an eligible girl that I am attracted to sounds like such a foreign experience to me and it scares me, yet I may be working alongside her. 

The lady who hired her came up to me after and asked me what I thought about her, and I said I found her attractive, and the lady said she hired her for me, this lady makes the schedules so I assume she might schedule us together. 

I would be so happy to just form some sort of bond with her. All of the other girls at our store seem to like me, I think I am capable of having girls not hate me, I think there are things about me that are desireable, the slim chance of something good happening seems amazing, but even then I am not cut out for a relationship. My dumbass while studying has thought thinigs like ""I would not mind providing for her some day"", just stupid lustful thoughts that I need to get out of my head.

I can't show weakness and I need to take initiative. Still, there are probably going to be weeks between the times we speak, and each of those weeks provides more time for her to have tinder hookups. That shouldn't even bother me, yet it really does. This is why I hate having crushes.

’m pretty sure that I’m either Demi or aromantic. The reason I don’t think I’m aro is because I want so very badly to have a romantic relationship with somebody. I’m 22 and I’ve only ever had 2 relationships, neither of which I initiated. The first was the normal “high school friends date for a few months” deal. The second only lasted 2 weeks before we broke it off.  The entire time, I was worried if I was actually attracted to her or not because I don’t know what romantic love feels like or what you should feel at different points of a relationship.

I think that part of the problem is that I don’t know if I ever even get crushes or not. What do crushes feel like?  How can I recognize them?

Is it ever a good idea to try to date somebody that you think you might be compatible with (shared interest, good friendship mostly) but aren’t yet romantically attracted to and don’t have a crush on?

My only attempt to get into a relationship in the past year was on Hinge and it went poorly - 2 likes in 3 months, ghosted after 3 messages - because I’m probably average looking at best and had awful hair for a while (still do but now it’s probably only meh bad instead of holy shit bad).

I normally don’t casually hook up but I’m single for the first time in along time and I’ve always had a bit of a crush on this guy and ended up shooting my shot in his DMs. I never expected him to respond but he did and it was very obvious that when we met it would be just a hookup (we weren’t texting, etc.) I ended up going over to his place and we talked for along time and ended up having a decent amount in common and he mentioned he’s in my city fairly often. We hooked up, it was good, and I slept over. I’m not that familiar with one night stands so I just sort of awkwardly let myself out in the morning and barely said goodbye to him. I was 100% expecting to never hear from him again but to my surprise he messaged me the next day asking if I had made it back to my city ok. I responded saying I did and he then said he was glad he had met up and I replied with saying the same. He read that but didn’t respond. I’m just confused why he would even bother reaching out when he never was the one to reach out before (it was always me initiating) and he wasn’t planning on continuing the conversation after a few messages. Do you think he’s just trying to leave the door open in case either of us are ever back in town or am I reading into it?

So here's the thing, I live in a country where dating apps may as well not exist. Nobody uses them, the one person I know who tried Tinder told me it's a bust.

In the modern dating world everyone is doing it online, and I'm here on the outside looking in, wondering how the hell do I find dates? The only place I hookup with women is the club, and I'm tired of always making a lot of effort for what is always a one night thing.

So what do I do? Instagram DMs can only take me so far, all the women I was potentially interested in I have DMed already with various succes. I need a way to meet new people, as it seems like my whole dating life is one big circle, oh let's go back to that one chick I was talking to before and see if something could happen this time. That'll work!

Also note that my only real hobby is watching sports, don't think I have a whole lot of women to meet/talk to about this type of stuff.

Ever since teenage I wasn't interested in girls at all I was only interested in my hobbies and what I do. I didn't go on dates and my ex was like me. I met her by accident while I was focusing on my studies in college and she was focusing on hers too we clicked very much initially but we knew relationships need time and we had goals to pursue so we ended things. The next couple of months we were both depressed, thinking about each other and our grades dropped so that decision had the opposite effect and we ended back together we just had some feeling that kept pulling us together.

She was the first girl ever that made me care. Normally, I don't care at all if I do stupid shits around girls unlike my friends/other guys but I always felt self conscious around her. She made me care about many things she made me want to become a better person everyday she made me want to stop doing stupid shits/wasting time and spend more time pursuing my goals. During the relationship few times, girls that were more ambitious/prettier than her (according to my friends not me cause I saw her the prettiest girl)  showed interest in me but I didn't care at all I wasn't with her because she was my best option I was with her because I wanted her I didn't want to look elsewhere I knew I wanted to spend my life with her she just felt right.

Anyways eventually things ended between us and neither of us was angry/had regrets and to get fast over her I cut my friendship with her I blocked her everywhere and deleted all her photos and spent first couple months depressed then I started working out on myself - distracting myself with hobbies and started thinking less and less about her then I had realizations. I don't believe in ""the one"" anymore and I realized there are plenty of good girls out there that could even connect with me better than my ex. I also understand I shouldn't compare anyone to my ex in terms of looks/feelings/connection..etc cause each love feels different and unique. 

So I got over her I found self happiness again I started putting myself out there with the primary goal of meeting new people/making new friends and when a girl seems ""likeable"" I ask her out.

My problem isn't with rejection or finding dates or comparing to my ex...etc but I just don't like anyone to a degree where I actually want them. For example I meet this girl she's nice pretty we went to two dates we had a nice time. Do I like her ? maybe to some degree. Do I want to pursue her ? No, I don't feel I care about her or what she think of me and since I don't care about her view of me even confession doesn't feel hard at all. 

This has been my experience with girls the past 6 months I went on multiple dates with multiple girls (from college - from cold approaches in public - from common friends..etc). At first it was like a new experience and I was having fun but lately old wounds started reopening and I'm feeling depressed today for once after a long while. I don't miss my ex and I don't miss ""having someone"" what I really miss is that beautiful feeling of love where I can't stop thinking about her - get jealous over her - feeling scared of losing her...etc Girls I saw feel likeable but they don't cause these feelings in me. 

I asked on discord server for advice and they told me something like no one is gonna make me as excited as your ex and that I shouldn't compare feelings and if a person is compatible with my life I should keep dating them and I don't know that's what got me depressed and made me start thinking about my first love again because primarily I don't want company or sex or SO primarily I miss those feelings of being in love and if I'm not ever gonna feel them again I just really regret believing and following these advice of ""It will happen again"" ""Your ex isn't special"" I got my hopes really up and were very hyped while I was working on myself and now they are telling me nothing is gonna feel similar to my first love I feel cheated. I came to understand the advice ""You will find someone again"" just means you will find a SO again it doesn't mean you will find a deep connection again and as I see most people are happy they have a relationship with a good person even if the feelings don't feel deep but I can't feel satisfied with that.

Sooo much time has passed and Idk maybe my ex is married by now who knows but I just really wish I knew it's gonna turn out like this from an early time so I could try really really hard with my ex before ending things. Idk ultimately I just wish I didn't meet her at all now I know how love can be beautiful it's hard to get this idea out of my head I wish I was still that person that focused on his fun and wasn't interested in dating.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Ability to protect: armed and dangerous/connections that could ruin someone else's career who threatened his significant other
2. Pedigree: how established his family is
3. New money
4. Body: I personally don't find this all that important outside of university, as a six pack abs aren't going to be able to ruin someone else career who messes with your significant other.
5. Connections
6. Looks are important so I'll admit that, but address the other ones.

Look I used to be really fit in college, kinda got relaxed about my body, overweight not fat, afterwards as I like to get acquainted with my neighborhood by impulse eating at restaurants/fast food. I do a lot of philanthropic work as a hobby and it is my firm belief that one of the most important things someone can do is leave the world a better place for future generations. I plan on making decent money, not filthy rich, but comfortably well off. I have a good education. But I have zero pickup game. I think that is my problem. I tend to let conversations die over dating apps through ""average conversation"". Does not seem to win over any hearts. So maybe I just need more female friends who can connect me with women outside of this silly dating app where I pay to video chat and girls pay nothing/get paid by gifting.

I’m 23m. I’m in my last semester of college because I took a couple of semesters off due to health issues (cancer, depression). I am cancer free now, so do not worry. I am also relatively happy. 

this semester, I met a girl in one of my classes. I walked with her to her next class after our second class ended. We ended up talking for like 5-7 minutes. A couple of weeks later, I ended up emailing her because she left our class and I had no other option. She responded that she would “love to get coffee with me”. So we got coffee this past Monday. After our mini date I ended up texting her and said I enjoyed our time together which was one hour long. She responded that she had a “wonderful time and would love to hangout again!!”. 

So now, I don’t know what to do. Do you guys think she’s definitely in to me since she used the word love twice? Idk. I’m just trying to be positive because she seems like a really cool person; and I haven’t had a SO for a while because of my depression. I honestly have never been in a situation where I needed to plan dates in order to hopefully start something with someone. I’ve been alone for quite some time now. I did hangout with one girl about 6 months ago a lot and it was because she was close to me rather than in the city which is an hour and a half away.

Also, I should mention that I messaged her last and she didn’t write anything back probably because there wasn’t much to write back. Idk , maybe I’m thinking into too much. Also… thinking too much into it again, but our date went alright. I was a bit nervous and towards the end of the date I was like alright there is no way she want to get together again but I was wrong.

She happened to be sitting next to me, and we were talking for a bit, and when she got her question (FMK out of the people in the room) she picked me for “fuck.” Idk if she actually meant anything with that or if it was just her picking the closest person in the room but still lol

That night we kept drinking and sitting together and she was getting really touchy-feely with me. We sat and talked for like an hour but she eventually left back to her place for the night.

But between that and now, we really haven’t spoke much, maybe once or twice. They were both friendly convos and she kept touching my arm. The only thing was that I realized that she’s just a touchy-feely person in general, so now idk

Last weekend our club did another party, and I sat next to her again. I was really drunk that night so I was kinda just sitting there chilling, I don’t really remember how I got into it but I know my arm was around her for over an hour while we talked. At one point she rested her legs on my legs which were already kicked up on the stool thing in front of us for like a few seconds, then put it back down. I eventually got up to go to the bathroom and since I was so gone that night I saw my other friend on the way back and spoke to him for a while instead lol. I eventually hear someone tell us that a few people including her were heading out. We went over to say bye and I drunk-hugged (which I always do) everyone that was leaving, but I think I hugged her for like 10 seconds and she was still holding on tight.

So I got a job at this dog/cat boarding place around 5 months ago and we currently have around 20 employees. 16 of those employees are women (most around my age) so when I work I’m mainly talking to women everyday.

I know this isn’t really flirting with women but it helped me tremendously just being able to talk to women. Before I got this job I rarely ever talked to a girl in public and when I did I was a stuttering mess and would be so bad at having a conversation with a women even if it wasn’t me hitting on them and just a regular conversation. The problem I had that I would put them on a pedestal so it was hard for me.

Now after 5 months I’m able to talk to women so much better with regular conversations. Since I had to talk to women at my job overtime I stopped putting them on a pedestal and just talked to them like a regular person. Now I’m not nervous as much to talk to women and it’s helped me a ton in my dating life.

So yeah if your a young guy like me (I’m 20) and have trouble talking to girls get a part time job where there’s mainly women there and after some time working there you should hopefully see some results.

We went out to our university dining hall and it was pretty fun. We were chatting about what we do for work and for fun, what we're studying, and other general stuff to get to know eachother. We walked to the dining hall together, ate, and went to the mail center so she could pick up a package before making our way back to the dorms.

Here's where I may have fucked up: at the end of the date, we told eachother that we had a nice time and shelved right in front of me and just looked me dead in the eyes. I was not entirely sure what was happening to be honest, so I kind of just looked at her back because I wasn't sure what to do. After about 30 seconds of this she went back into her dorm.

Later that night I was hanging out with a couple friends. I was telling them about it and they all said that I was supposed to kiss her. Nowhere throughput the date was there any physical contact between us because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable and when we were texting we never explicitly discussed it. Looking back now, I could see maybe that's what she was going for.

It's been about a day and we haven't messaged eachother much since, mostly because she told me she had to work this morning and went to dinner at her dad's house after.

Marriage and kids is constantly one of the first things that comes up. I've had to give up ( opportunities) because I wanted to wrap up, and she refused to take birth control.

He then started crying by telling me that he struggles with his mental health and he could not continue with his schooling because of it. I immediately felt bad, we hugged and apologized to each other.

A little backstory, my last relationship lasted about 5 years, I lived with her and her family, the relationship ended shortly before covid, and since covid I've been single. I really want to date again, but living at home is really killing my confidence. Part of me feels like I should just wait till I'm moved out, but another part of me is dying inside from the lack of any romantic interaction in over two years. I would just hate to meet the perfect match only for her to reject me due to living at home. I have friends, some of whom are women, telling me it's not a big deal and that I should just get out there, but I'm just finding it hard to believe.

I just didn't feel confident that I will eventually get one if I just ""focused on myself"".

But then recently I decided ""You know what, I'm just going to focus on working towards my dream job. But with one exception being talking to girls in public"". So since my dream job is to make video games, I decided to set my mind on learning things that go into making a video games and really try not to worry so much about women.

But there is also part of me that's like ""if I really put all of my time and energy into my dreams, is fate really going to just say hey dude, you've worked on yourself enough, here is your new girlfriend?""

idk I still feel like I need to somewhat try, but just in a way that doesn't make me seem desperate.

Is there a way I can do that? because I just don't really trust the ""work on your self and your girl will come"" quote. It just sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me. 

Though I'll still keep my mind on my dreams as well as other important stuff definitely, I just feel like I still somewhat need to try to get a girlfriend if I want one.

What do you guys think?

Also just keep in mind that I'm pretty introverted and so I don't really like to go up and talk to random strangers in public areas unless they are having a convo about something that interests me.

I tend to really like movies, super heroes, video games(as you can tell), kaijus etc.

idk maybe instead of a bar or a coffee shop, maybe I will go to a gaming convention or something like that.

Another thing that I had in mind is women that I may work with at a job, or maybe even a women who is partaking in a game that I'm developing.

Who knows.

But yeah, with all of that aside, some advice would really be appreciated.

I just don't want to end up making a few best selling games as well as owning a nice house with no one to move in with me in the future.

I would like to strategize in a way that will end up getting me a gf in no time.
