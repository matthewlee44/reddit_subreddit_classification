For context I go to a small high school and we only have like 40-50 people per grade. During my first semester I was told by one of my guy friends that I was one of the most popular girls in my grade and that he thinks practically all the guys like me. I didn't quite believe him at first but then prom rolled around and like six guys asked me (I turned them all down and went with a friend instead). Sophomore year prom came and same thing happened again (I accepted one of them this time but nothing came out of it afterwards). 

I'm a senior now and I've still never dated. I realized that no guy seems to be interested in me anymore and most of them seem to treat me like one of the ""bros"" now. Which sucks because I think now's the time that I'm really beginning to be interested in dating. 

Seriously what am I doing wrong? I've been told by friends that I've glowed-up since freshmen year yet it seems like less guys are interested in me than ever. Also I'm pansexual so I'd date girls too even though there's not a lot of queer girls in my class. I do have a friend who I find attractive though. She told me she's straight all throughout high school but recently she's been telling me that she wants to try to date a girl. I haven't told her I'm pan though but I'm thinking about telling her and maybe shooting my shot? Although seeing how she's unsure of her sexuality herself I don't want to get into a relationship where I'll just get hurt. 

Have my dating potential in my school expired? Should I just look outside of my school? What about my ""straight"" female friend who literally told me she's attracted to me when she was drunk?

*English is not my first language so there may be mistakes, sorry :)

A bit of context, during school I never felt like I fit in, mainly because I always felt very judged by my tastes. My classmates told me that I had ""little girl spirit"", that's why I went from group of friends to another group, looking for a place where I felt comfortable. 
In high school I managed to establish a small circle of friends but it just lasted until we graduated. Today I am only in contact with one of them. 
Also during high school it was very difficult for me to make friends with men (I attended an all-girls school), I met some guys at parties but nothing lasted long enough to make a friendship. 

When I entered the University I decided to ""change"" and stop being that girl who has a ""little girl"" spirit. That's when I met my (now) ex-boyfriend and made a great group of friends (or that's what i thought).
Today I remember college as the worst time of my life. I spent three years in a toxic relationship that destroyed my self-esteem and my mental health and all those friends that I thought were for life, ended up being just acquaintances who considered me ""XX's ex-girlfriend"". I felt like I wasted the best years of my life on such toxic people. 
In my senior year of college I finally broke up with my boyfriend. But it wasn't easy since he manipulated me by telling me that I was the love of his life, that he thought we were going to get married, that he missed my family, and much more.

My entire senior year of college was dedicated to cutting all those toxic people out of my life and trying to focus on myself.  I am grateful because that year I met one of my best friends, an incredible friend who has helped me a lot and who is always there for me.

When I graduated I felt lost, not knowing what to do and which way to go. All of my classmates were either finding jobs or traveling and then there was me, shutting myself away in my little bubble just hanging out with my only friend from college.
At that time I deleted all my social media accounts because it made me feel so bad to see what the rest was doing.

Then the pandemic hit, 2020 I locked myself in my bubble even more. I felt so lost and alone.  
During that period I started online Korean classes, a new challenge for me. I had a such a hard time making friends during class, even though we had very similar tastes, I always felt so insecure and I didn't feel like trying to maintain this relationship.
At the end of 2020, I finally found a job. I was very excited to finally start my career. 
In this job I met a girl, who also studied the same as me at university.  After a long time I felt like I finally met someone who didn't judge me. This girl is now like the big sister I never had haha, we even have a podcast together. 

That was a bit of context for you to understand my question. Even though I've met new people, I can't make friends with men. I can't trust them, I feel very insecure.
Since I broke up with my ex-boyfriend I haven't gone out with anyone, absolutely no one, not even going out for coffee, nothing at all. I have tried using dating apps but at the time of matching I panic and I don't know what to say.  It scares me that they ask me what I like because I don't want to be judged. 
In the summer, I went out to a party after two years or more. Although it was very nice to go out and meet new people.  When talking to guys, my mind always thinks “don't say something stupid” and I go into ""protect yourself"" mode.

So my question is: How not to let the bad memories of your ex not influence your new relationships?  In other words, how do you move on and open up to new relationships?  Four years have passed since my relationship ended.  
I know that each person is different and that each one has different times but I would like you to give me advice on this subject.

Thank you very much for reading until the end.

My earlier sexual experiences were with guys who showed their true colors only afterwards. Don’t get me wrong, they liked the sex and did want to meet up more, but it was purely for sex. 

However I felt shitty cuz they texted me much less after they got what they wanted and/or treated me overall with disrespect. That kinda scarred me and I’m scared of getting intimate with someone and to go through the same tears again. 

I’m not necessarily looking for a relationship but I don’t feel like I can do fuckbuddy or FWB arrangements when the other person makes me purposely feel like an option or just a hole to fuck. 

I’d be down to have something casual but I don’t want it to be meaningless or that the guy assumes I’m going to deliver myself to his place every time he hits me up.

I thought maybe the problem is in me, that I should just put up with the cold shoulder these guys give after sex cuz it’s nothing more than just sex and I can’t demand more, but I’m not sure if that’s healthy?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162910,public,self,Scared of having sex with new guys after dealing with a bunch of fuckboys and guys who ghosted after sex.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t7u0sv/scared_of_having_sex_with_new_guys_after_dealing/,no_ads,0.0,

I met this guy on tinder(only bc he got banned from hinge for a stupid reason) 3 weeks ago. We’ve been hooking up often and really hit it off. We decided to hang out tonight but I told him that I didn’t want to hookup. He said “that’s okay hehehehehe”… 

Looking back now, I guess that means he was joking huh. Ah, he did also ask why I didn’t want to have sex today. And I told him that there was no reason. We then continued to hang, get food and watch a movie. We also smoked but I was high first. 

I was pretty high so I was overthinking how our hang outs been going and realized that maybe he’s only seeing me to have sex. He’s always told me that we don’t have to have sex if I don’t want to. The first and last time I did end up having sex tho. But this time I didn’t want to cave. While overthinking the hang out I realized that maybe he wouldn’t have come if we weren’t actually going to have sex. And also how I may have greatly misjudged things.

Since discovering some things about myself, I think I’ve finally realised why my circumstances are the way they are. 

Being all those things in the title, means that I’m looking for something very particular, and I can’t lie I think growing up, I thought what I’m looking for now was very common and probable. Turns out it’s actually not. 

Yeah, I’m still a virgin and have never kissed a partner and never had any semblance of a relationship. 

And sure, I want to have all of those things and experience it all. 

But, what’s more important to me is HOW I experience those things, over just the experience itself. 

Sure I could just try and hookup with someone, or have a one-night stand that would essentially just be meaningless sex and just for convenience. 

However, the simple fact is, I don’t want that and I don’t think I’d be comfortable doing that. That’s not the type of guy I am. I’m not the type of guy to “Fuck and Forget” about you. 

I’m looking for a genuine partnership, where we grow as people, have an amazing bond in several areas of our relationship. 

It’s been quite hard for me to accept this, but I feel like I read/hear pretty often women who are looking for something “real”, and that tells me I just need to be patient. 

Even though, I’ll be honest, I do get desperate sometimes. Actually, quite often I just wish someone would take a chance on me. 

But I think I’ve finally established the difference between being arrogant/feeling entitled to being confident/feeling empowered. 

I know things about myself, and I know who I am, I know my worth and that should make me feel good.
It should help me believe in me, and all the good qualities I have are nothing to be ashamed of. I know I’m not perfect and I know I have my own drawbacks too, but those are nothing to be ashamed of either. 

I don’t need to have anything, certainly a relationship, in order to prove myself to myself or anyone for that matter.

Basically, I'm doing the ""right time, right person"" waiting game.  


Fast forward, I (27) was at a bar tonight listening to live music. I noticed one table of women was looking towards my table. For previous reasons listed I thought nothing of it especially considering there were 3 other guys at my table had no reason to believe any of them were looking at me. As the night continued, so did the stares, almost to the point it was uncomfortable to sit there while hanging out (seriously, we were thinking about calling it a night at 2 separate times just to get out of there).   


After we were done and I was getting ready to leave, one of the women approached me and started basically starting calling me names and poking me in the chest with her finger. From what I gathered one of her friends thought I was attractive and I was supposed to know that them staring in my general direction meant I was supposed to go flirt with them I guess(???). I basically corrected her by telling her not all men flirt with women and the way they were staring at me only made me uncomfortable. Of course, this lead to ""Well maybe you're just not man enough"" and me just paying my tab and going.  


Since then all I've been thinking about is whether I should've known and second-guessed myself. Should I have known they were trying to get me to flirt? or on a broader term, Should it be the man's job to approach women or can it go both ways?

Then this man went through a stressful life event (I wont describe in detail but it was kinda bad, but is ok now) and then messaged me and dumped me.

He said he didn't want to string me along while he ""works through his shit"". I'm just so confused. Have I been played? Is he just afraid to commit? Is he just still hurting from his previous relationship where he was cheated on? He did ask me previously if I wanted to play the field because i was new to the city (I do not). He then said he wants to remain friends; he still messages me on socials sometimes. But I'm so confused to know if this is ok. I'm very protective of myself and I'm struggling to understand if his reasons are valid or if he just wants to breadcrumb me and fuck me over.

 why I dated him for another year but personally I was already mentality broken up with him and I tried Braking up with him but he would twist it and in away where we didn't end up braking up. there was a lot of manipulation going on. 

On the day I broke up with him we had a fight, he was being lazy wanting to lay in bed when you can clearly see his side was dark dirty on my white bedsheets, it horrible and I couldn't handle this anymore. he got pissed off at me for ""waking him up"" it was passed 2pm at this time and my sister came in to make sure I was ok as we were both yelling, he pushed my sister out the room and slammed the door on her, I had it and once he put hands on my sister I screamed ""get out of my house we are done I'm braking up with you, get your shit now and get out!"" he grabbed most his things hand left as he knew he was not winning that fight as he clearly put hand on my sister. 

I stayed in contact with him for a few months after the brake up so he could grab the rest of the stuff but after 6 months of asking but he kept dragging it. I was starting to he was dragging it on so he can just visit me,  I blocked him on everything and threw all his stuff out or reused it for something else.

I forgot to block him on my business Account on Facebook that I have not using for 2 years. he messaged me asking how I was going around 2020 to grab a coffee and mentioned about my Tiktok and how I had a few followers and enjoyed my content. I saw it and ignored it but got little worried he was stalking my online content but I had no way of controlling that so I tried to forget about and hope he would forget about me, then I blocked his account. and never looked back.

Then randomly out of nowhere he joined my discord server 3 months ago(it's a public discord server on my Tiktok to let other VR content creators to join and do fun videos together.

 I didn't see him join until a few weeks ago and this is starting to get little creepy now, its been 5 years and he's still checking up on me, I don't know if I should message him to leave me as I have refused to message or talk to him but I fear this will get out of hand and he's not getting the hint am not interested in seeing at all.

The closest thing I had was a ""double date"" my friend tried to set up like 3 years ago that went nowhere. Ive tried talking to friends of friends, OLD, and even reddit for some reason. Strangely enough, reddit was the most successful because I made friends with a lot of the people who messaged me. However, I'm not interested in an LDR and none of people who messaged me were close. Still cool though. I let them know, and I still chat with some of them from time to time as friends (at least for now... its a recent thing so don't know how it'll pan out over the next few months, but hopefully we can remain friends)

Anyways, I think the main reason I can't find anyone is because of my personality. I don't think my appearance is an issue because I've been told I look above average by almost everyone i talked to (I think I'm closer to just average, but I'm pretty sure I'm at least not straight up ugly). I'm not too picky with appearance either. I prefer people who aren't chubby, but always considered personality more. Im also a Christian, but I always considered my faith very personal and would never force anyone to convert (pretty much accepting of all religions except Satanists for obvious reasons)

As for my personality, I'm an extroverted introvert. My activities are mostly introverted because I like staying home, playing video games, and dislike going to parties and clubs. I also love reading/writing poetry and writing fictional stories (mostly fantasy). However, I also love bringing attention to myself and hyping up my friends. I love being a goofball while hanging out with my friends (preferably a small group), and sometimes even in public. Using the force push on automatic doors and embarrassing my mom when we go to the supermarket is a big habit of mine that I never regret. I also randomly sing and make wide gestures in public often. Therefore, I don't really get along with extroverts because we don't share the same activities, and I don't get along with introverts because I bring too much attention to myself. My dating profiles also reflect who I am because I want to be completely honest 100% of the time and would hate to pretend to be anyone else. However, it sometimes feels like there's no one out there who is looking for someone like me. I want something serious that can potentially lead to marriage and kids, but i simply don't know how to get there without fully compromising who I am.

I (23f) just had my first date and honestly? I have know idea what is happening. I created a Hinge account like two days ago because I am on my period and wanted chicken nuggets. I wanted someone to buy me chicken nuggets. It was really kind of a joke and I honestly wasn’t even expecting for anyone to match with me but I got quite a few replies. I matched with one guy and he was really funny. We ended up talking for 5 hours and I was having a blast, he’s really funny and charming and a little fucked in the head like I am. We have the same sense of humour and we both have ADHD so our conversations can get really wild because we both always get distracted and jump to new topics at the drop of a hat. We had our first date today (we walked around, got some mini donuts and then went driving around just hanging out) and I was kind of nervous at first but we both got into the groove of it and ended up having a blast. This all sounds great right? Seeing it in writing I think it sounds good but I don’t know. I am very comfortable around him and we talked very intimately about a lot of things. We both even want the same things for our futures. It just feels a little… to good to be true? Maybe a little fast? And I am really scared. I am scared because I have C-PTSD and one of the symptoms is splitting - which is when you put someone waaay up on a pedestal and think the world of them without seeing any red-flags or you just immediately hate them with absolutely no reasoning. Am I putting him on a pedestal? Is what I am feeling real? Should I be this comfortable with him this fast? Like really… what is happening?

He gave me my first kiss when he dropped me off at home and… I am real bad at it. Where the fuck do your teeth go?! Seriously?! It’s not like I can push them further back in to my head! Also; tongues? Way more slippery than I thought. I also had no idea where to put my fucking head. It was kind of awkward but we both just started laughing. 

We were both really into each other and I am 90% sure the next time I see him we will probably have sex. We even talked about it, we both think that communication is really important. 

I really like him. And I think I can see something happening but… what if I am not ready for a relationship this involved? I have seriously NEVER done this before, and with my trauma I just don’t know if I am capable of loving someone as much as they deserve. It was like, yesterday it was just my mom and I and couple other family members in my bubble of people and… now there is this guy, who I really like, and I just… I have never had to accept someone in to my bubble, you know? All the people here are family. I don’t know how to bring someone new in and just… be okay. It’s a huge change and I don’t really know how to do any of this. I don’t know how to feel. I don’t know what’s normal and what’s not. I don’t know what’s real and what is my head just messing around with me. 

What do I do?

I’m a 20M and I’m a virgin. I’ve never kissed a girl, or held hands, or anything like that. I met a girl on Reddit last week and she’s offered to take my virginity. I can’t decide what to do. 

On one hand, I really want to get the monkey off my back. Being a virgin this late in life has hurt my self-esteem and it bothers me a lot. This girl seems really nice and patient and I think she’d do a good job of easing me into it. Also, there’s a girl at my university that I like who I’ve been making progress with lately. I worry that if I get into a relationship with her, she’ll judge me for my lack of experience, so doing this might help.

On the other hand, isn’t losing your virginity supposed to be something special? Shouldn’t it be done in the confines of a relationship instead of a hookup with a stranger from the Internet? If my future wife asks me how I lost it, I don’t know if I could look her in the eye and tell her about this… Even telling the girl from my university about it if she asks would be really awkward.

What would you recommend?

Do you want to keep your man’s eyes on you and only you?

As you may or may not already know, there are certain things women can do to hook men. The good news is that these have nothing to do with looks, but rather attitude.

Once you can get yourself in the right mindset, you’ll not only have his attention, but like a lovesick puppy dog, he won’t leave your side.

Here’s what you need to do.

&amp;#x200B;

**Be mysterious.**

Have you ever left a date feeling mentally drained, or like you knew everything there was to know about a man? If so, you probably had little interest in seeing him again.

The same rings true for men.

If you’re the kind of woman who takes over a conversation or shares everything from your childhood memories to your deepest secrets then he’s isn’t going to be compelled to call you.

Instead of spilling your heart out to him it’s important that you hold back some information, and keep him coming around for more.

Also note that this isn’t only for in-person conversations, but it applies to text messages, phone calls, online messaging, the works.

**Be positive.**

More than just smiles, emotions in general are contagious. This means that if you’re the pessimistic or self-pitying type, those feelings are going to affect your date, too.

Even more importantly, men are attracted to happy, outgoing women. Just like you wouldn’t want to date someone who was always down, nor do men. That’s why it’s so important to be positive and try to find the good in everyday situations.

Once your man realizes that you’re the one to keep him smiling he’ll become hopelessly devoted to you.

**Be hard to get.**

Now this one has been disputed over the years, but believe me, it works.

Since men are hunters at heart, making him work for your love and attention will keep him chasing you. When this happens, he’ll become addicted to you.

To do so, it’s important that you’re not “too available.” This means that you don’t drop what you’re doing to see him, and you set certain standards for yourself when it comes to making plans with him.

For instance, if he calls and asks if you want to go for dinner that night, tell him that you’re busy and suggest rescheduling for a day or two later. Even if you have no plans for that night, keeping him on his toes to see you will get him hooked.

It’s also important that you’re not always the one to initiate contact with him. If you’re doing all the texting, messaging, phoning, etc., it’ll take away from his pursuit for you. Instead let him be the one to woo you.

Hope this will help you.

Things seemed to go mostly well. We got along well during dinner and made out for a while in her room. She said she didn’t want to do anything more that night, which I said was totally ok. We made out multiple times though, and each time it seemed to go well – she played with my hair, giggled, etc. We also talked for a couple hours.

She said she was tired and should sleep early, so I said I would head home. She was nice enough to actually drive me back to my place. I mentioned an idea for a next date and she was interested, and we kissed before I got out.

The next day, I texted her thank you for having me over and said I had a great time. She actually sent me these thank you texts first after our previous two dates. She has always responded to my texts in under 2 hours, but it’s been 24 hours and no response.

Also, shortly after I texted her, I saw her at an event. It was a little awkward, and her friends didn’t seem as excited to see me. We talked very briefly, and she left when her friends walked away.

Is he teethfishing or does he not like to smile?

**Full story**

Hi There! I (woman) matched with a guy (man) on OLD about 6 months ago. He's really sweet, fun and bubbly in texts and voicenotes. However he doesn't smile on any pictures (both on the related app, on his Insta posts and on any IG story with his face, or in any selfie...).

I tried to request smiling selfies when he was sending pics, with lines like ""Loving the landscape, would be even sweeter with your beautiful smile? 😁"" kind of lines, to which he always responds with some ""You'll see it when we meet"" or others ""Haha, next time maybe"". I've sent him pics and video selfies where I smile, he complimented my smile and responded with a selfie of him with a closed down mouth.
He seems cool but is always finding excuses to cancel real life meetings (even if he constantly follows up to reschedule), and he doesn't like videocalls so I'm not insisting and we never had one.

I'm cutting things off with him and wished him the best, and to find his happiness. He's following up but I'll no longer engage. Ultimately I've been focused on sweet real life connections.

But my question is: is he hiding what's in his mouth (rotten, crooked, broken teeth or else), or does he genuinely not like to smile on pictures, or he doesn't like his smile?

I was going to wait till the end of March before bringing it up again, with work/lives sort of just being crazy right now. But this weekend I wanted to see her before she goes away for a vacation, and that doesn’t seem like it’s going to happen. I don’t want to be clingey, and I respect that she has her friends/other committments and what not, but I feel like this weird “grey area” has me super confused. I want to have the conversation again, but I’m afraid of the answer if she is still not ready for it. I really like this girl, we click well, she’s caring, funny, genuine and gorgeous to boot. 

Was out with my friends yesterday who know me pretty well, and they basically emulated “We really like her, think she’s great for you, but if she doesn’t want to commit is that a dealbreaker?” Definitely an in person conversation that has to be had but I dont even know how to start it.

Things seemed to go mostly well. We got along well during dinner and made out for a while in her room. When I started to put my hands beneath her bra/pants, she said she didn’t want to do anything more that night, which I said was totally ok. We continued to make out, and each time it seemed to go well – she played with my hair, giggled, etc. We also talked for a couple hours.

She said she was tired and should sleep early, so I said I would head home. We made out again for a few minutes, and she continued to giggle. She was nice enough to actually drive me back to my place. I mentioned an idea for a next date and she was interested, and we kissed before I got out.

The next day, I texted her thank you for having me over and said I had a great time. She actually sent me these thank you texts first after our previous two dates. She has always responded to my texts in under 2 hours, but it’s been 24 hours and no response.

Also, a couple hours after I texted her, I actually saw her at an event we both planned to attend. It was a little awkward, and her friends didn’t seem as excited to see me – usually they’ll come for a hug but did not do so. We talked very briefly, and she left when her friends walked away. She mentioned they were leaving soon.

Now, I’m just really confused. It seemed like although we didn’t do much beyond kissing (which I was super happy with anyways), the date went well. Now, I just don’t understand why she hasn’t answered me. Did I miss bad signals? Did she realize red flags when talking to her friends? Or, does she not feel the need to respond given our interaction at the event, although we did not mention anything regarding the night before or a next date.

We’ll both be out of town for a week, so it’s my plan to text her once we’re both back and invite her another date. I plan to do this regardless of whether she responds now, though I’m pretty bummed and could really use advice.

Edit:  I think one thing I’m worried about is that I have come across to strong. I’ve mentioned multiple times that I really like her (like when she asked to not do anything, and I said “I really like you and am happy to take it slow”), but she doesn’t say the same back. Also, when I kiss her, I comment on how I like her smile and that she’s very pretty. She doesn’t say anything outright like this back to me.

On numerous levels. I went through a lot of depression when I was younger, and was finally reaching a high, like I was finally getting things together and was going to be okay. Mid 2019 to mid/late 2020 was the best year of my life. Only for 2021 to be arguably the worst year of my life, continuing on so far this year. So many steps backwards I wouldn’t know where to even begin. I still think about her a lot, barely able to pull myself together. The mix of emotional pain and psychologically fucked up mess I’ve been hasn’t been great. Especially with the other stuff going on in my life simultaneously.

But I just saw a post on here, a 22 year old guy talking about having a crush and that light and happy feeling he had. And it kind of gave me this hysterical feeling for a moment. Goddamn. He’s 2 years older than me and he’s having this sparky, light hearted crush. I still have 2 years to have that again by the time he’s having it.

I’m so worried about never feeling the way I felt with her ever again, because it’s so hard for me to click with someone like that. It’s rare for me to even click with friends, let alone a romantic relationship. I’m introverted and quirky and require a special kind of introvert to pull the extrovert out of me, and I’m short enough that most people wouldn’t care to try. So it’s rare. But goddamn, as rare as it is for me, I’ve got 10 fucking years of my 20s left. A literal decade. 10 years ago I was 10, I hardly even remember that shit it was so long ago.

I mean, sure, it would've been cool if she'd said yes to going out with me, but I'm thrilled about the result.

Basically, I'd been attempting to flirt with this one cashier for months. She knew my name, I knew hers, we had fun conversations all the time. So then, two weeks ago, I finally decided to take a shot and gave her an origami flower, because we're both really into books and I didn't want to waste the paper from the book my dog destroyed. I was going to ask her out then and there, but I honestly was overthinking it so much that I spaced completely when she said she liked it and giggled. 

I tried again yesterday, with a paper vase for the flower, this time with my phone number on it. There was a lot of stuttering involved, but I managed to get out the fact that I was trying to ask her out before, here's a vase, etc . . . 

All throughout my doing that, she was giggling, and said that it was adorable, twice. Then she said that she wasn't looking for a relationship, but that she really wanted to be my friend. I know that's usually a line, but the way she said it, I could tell she was sincere. 

So basically, I asked out a girl for the first time in four years, and I got a friend out of it. And I got called adorable. I've never been called that, and it feels great. It's like, my self-esteem and confidence stuff went up from that moment instead of down. My feelings weren't hurt even by 1%. To me, this wasn't even a failure.

I'm not dumb enough to think or try anything contrary to being platonic with my new friend, and honestly, I'm okay with all this. It's a bit of relief, too. Now I can go back to talking with her about random nonsense and laughing about it, without overthinking stuff in my head. So that's cool. 

I think if she weren't stressed about school and such, she might have said yes. She clearly enjoyed the experience. All in all, it was a good day for everyone.

I might be back to the drawing board, but I feel really good about myself, and I see myself getting out there again very soon.

That there are things he would like me to work on with him before I try again. That if I give him some time I can get to a place where i can almost succeed. 

My problem is I just hate being alone, I want to meet new people and go out and have fun experiences. It’s not easy for me to make girlfriends and quite frankly I’m not sure I’m very interested. But I feel better when I get to go out and do fun things with people, I guess that might be my problem. I can’t be happy unless I have people in my life. My therapist thinks I need to learn to love myself before I can love others, abs be completely comfortable with being alone. Which I partly understand. 

My philosophy is that you’ll never be 100% happy ever. Sure you can be happy or maybe even content but there will always be problems, not everything will work out and you may even have set backs. I’ve made a lot of progress in therapy since I started about a year ago, I feel like the therapist I have now Is great and he’s really interested in helping me be the best version of myself and I believe that with his help I can achieve that. 

But it’s hard being alone/lonely, just because some guys I’ve meet haven’t been the best person with bad intentions, doesn’t mean everyone will be like that. I think from what I’ve learned so far o can incorporate that and get myself back out there. So my question is should I try my best to wait? It’s like fighting an urge honestly, or would getting back out there just set me up for failure.

We started talking and went on a first date and had a really good time! To be honest, when I responded to him I didn’t think it would really go anywhere. He’s incredibly smart, conventionally attractive, has a good job, works out, etc. I am…chubby and “alternative”, have my own place and work full time but it’s not a career. On our first date we ended it with a really sweet kiss and I felt so fluttery. I couldn’t believe that he actually wanted to spend time with *me*. I know a lot of this is stemming from my own insecurity. I’ve never really pursued people that I’d consider out of my league. Those people go on to marry other beautiful and successful people, but probably not me.  

Our second date we had another great day and walked around talking for a few hours. He called me pretty and we held hands the whole time. Eventually we decided to come back to my place for movies. Initially I had wanted to make him wait for sex, to see if he’s actually interested in me. So while we were making out I started to get nervous and asked him if this would change anything or if he’d stop liking me. He said “are you kidding? Do girls think that? If anything, I’ll like you more” (of course, not surprised) and idk I caved because I was curious and a little worried that I might never get to if I refused. It was amazing though. Like we went three more times and got food in between. I asked him “so are we still hanging out tomorrow? Or am I never gonna hear from you again?” He said “why would I never talk to you again? I already knew you were cool and [lists the things he likes about me sexually] why would I not want to see you again after that?”  

So he left and we kissed goodbye and I guess I’ll see him later today. But idk…I’m worried that this won’t go anywhere because maybe I’m not dateable in his eyes, like maybe this is just fun, which is fine but I actually really like him. He doesn’t ask much about me, like he’s never even asked what I do for work. Simple stuff y’know? But I think maybe he’s just awkward? I know I fucked up by not making him wait, and at least I can say it was kind of worth it for the sex alone. But how do I find out what his intentions are? Am I overthinking that he couldn’t possibly want to be with me when he could probably have anyone he wants?

I’m left in this constant wondering of if something happened to him, if he lost his phone or if he just plain lost interest in me. I texted him a couple times but no response and I won’t let myself text again just so I can have the slightest amount of dignity left.

To start off in no way am I trying to brag in this post. I'm just recounting my high school experience and what people have told me so I can get a bit of advice and insight on why my love life is so dry right now :(

For context I go to a small high school and we only have like 40-50 people per grade. During my first semester I was told by one of my guy friends that I was one of the most popular girls in my grade and that he thinks practically all the guys like me. I didn't quite believe him at first but then prom rolled around and like six guys asked me (I turned them all down and went with a friend instead). Sophomore year prom came and same thing happened again (I accepted one of them this time but nothing came out of it afterwards). 

I'm a senior now and I've still never dated. I realized that no guy seems to be interested in me anymore and most of them seem to treat me like one of the ""bros"" now. Which sucks because I think now's the time that I'm really beginning to be interested in dating. 

Seriously what am I doing wrong? I've been told by friends that I've glowed-up since freshmen year yet it seems like less guys are interested in me than ever. Also I'm pansexual so I'd date girls too even though there's not a lot of queer girls in my class. I do have a friend who I find attractive though. She told me she's straight all throughout high school but recently she's been telling me that she wants to try to date a girl. I haven't told her I'm pan though but I'm thinking about telling her and maybe shooting my shot? Although seeing how she's unsure of her sexuality herself I don't want to get into a relationship where I'll just get hurt. 

Have my dating potential in my school expired? Should I just look outside of my school? What about my ""straight"" female friend who literally told me she's attracted to me when she was drunk?

I've never had a girlfriend. I've been able to have the ocassional hook-up but  just find it so difficult to meet actual single women looking for a partner. Here is a history of every woman I've dated:

- #1 Had a past trauma affecting her ability to commit
- #2 Had serious mental health issues, wasn't ready for a relationship
- #3 Turned out to have a partner already (I wasn't aware initially)
- #4 Not over an ex
- #5 Tried to make me pay for everything 

I'm confident in my personality but just don't have the looks to use apps, have used Tinder, Bumble &amp; Hinge for years, got like 5 matches ever. Even had female friends help me set up a profile. I just don't get matches sadly &amp; have even tried premium. 

I go on nights out to pubs/clubs every week, usually multiple times per week. I often meet women that way but very rarely is anyone truly 'single' (as in, not got anyone they're seeing etc.)

We first started talking in September up until mid October when he ghosted me, I still don’t know why but I just moved past it. We started talking again in the beginning of December up until now. Originally he was on top of it communicating with me and simply talking to me. Even once sending me his work schedule to give me a heads up if he’s running late the day we see eachother. But then he started declining and it would be a miracle if he even texted me at all. When I would check up on him he would say he was swimming with work and hasn’t had even the chance to get rest. So I understood now it’s to the point where I feel like he’s just not interested in me. So I expressed my feelings and let him know that if he’s not feeling it. I understand and if he’s just so busy we can work on it regardless I’m all ears and Willing to listen. Even giving him the option to not respond as an answer to leave it like that. But he did send me a paragraph and so far my friends feel like it’s all BS and a bit manipulative but I honestly can’t tell so what should I do? I’m conflicted I do care about him but I know I need to set a boundary. 

This is the text : “Hey! No, don’t ever discount your words because I know how hard it can be to put your feelings into text. You have been getting the minimum from me and it’s absolutely NOT fair, and it’s NOT ok. I am SO sorry this is where I’ve let things get to. I’ve been on shoots nonstop for the last few weeks and my phone gets so inundated with calls and texts that it moves down the people I care about most lower and lower. I think about you all the time, but never have enough time to text with all of the driving and work. I’ve had no free time to do anything outside of work and I don’t want you to think that you’re not still my favorite person. Funny enough, I was just talking about you last night on set before you even sent me that text. I brag about how cool you are and how talented a chef you are and how I can’t wait for this shoot to be over to have some free time to hopefully see you. However, I know at this point, if you don’t want to anymore, I’d completely understand. Because I know that my schedule is going to to still be just as crazy with work in March and April and then I’m going to Europe in may, and… I really do adore you, but I know that sometimes that’s not enough.”

An important preface to start. Ive only dated her for 6 months. Ive had one girlfriend that I had for 3.5 years during college. And Ive probably had maybe 25-40 ish or so very short term flings (I really dont know the count) that lasted anywhere from 1 week to 4 or so months. Ive only been in love once before. And Im currently in love again, harder than my first love. I never believed in love at first meet, but with her thats what happened. I met her and we've been inseparable since. Even when we arent together, we are on the phone for hours a day. Ive dated a lot of women and have not felt so strongly towards anyone ever.

My girlfriend is a very successful business person. I love her to death and plan on marrying her and starting a family with her. However, Im dealing with some things that I dont know how to deal with.

She came out to me as a compulsive liar. Some of her stories didnt add up, I called her out on it, she broke down and it all came out a few weeks ago.

This stems from childhood abuse from an alcoholic mother. She has used it as a defense mechanism for years and I am one of the few people that she's ever told about it. She's told a therapist, her brother, and a couple of very old friends, but thats it. She was previously married and her ex husband did not know about this issue, nor does any of her ""friends""/anyone who she interacts with on a day to day basis.

Ever since she came out to me about her lying problem, she's somewhat changed her tune with me. It actually made our relationship deeper. She basically told me her dirtiest secret. She is actively trying to fix it and calling herself out whenever she tells white lies to me immediately. She's had a lot of other problems that she's fixed for herself, and I have faith that she will fix this issue. I dont expect this issue to resolve itself in 2 months, but hopefully she'll be ""clean"" of it in a year or two.

Here lies my biggest issue.

She's very high up in the business realm, like very high up. I would not be surprised if she's on the front page of the NYT or Time Magazine in the next ten years or so. I genuinely mean that. Due to this, the vast majority of her colleagues are men. She's in rich people clubs where it used to be male only and recently theyve allowed women in/women have been doing much better in their economic lives and have met the requirements to join. Wit that being said, its still skews something like 70-80 percent male.

These business clubs travel a lot. They have a lot of ""weekend getaways"" where they go to some fancy place for 2-4 days and do whatever they do. This includes business workshops, networking, and cool trips. It also includes booze, drugs and sex. Also, a large amount of them are 90% plus male, where in many cases she is the only female.

I told her that these trips kill me. Its very hard to trust her knowing that she's had issues with being honest in the past. Every time she lied to me directly, it tore my heart out. Why wouldnt she just tell me the damn truth?

I dont think she'd lie to me about anything serious, but I cant know for sure. Thats the problem with lying. How the hell do you know when someone is doing it? It takes a leap of faith and trust built up over years. A simple ""Work is calling, I need to go"" can really be ""The person Im having an affair with is calling, I need to go.""

She told me that she will cut down these trips in the future drastically. Shes been actively removing problem people in her life and is cleaning it up to act more like she's in a relationship and less of being someone who is single. There is one trip a year that she has to go on that is all male except her. Its basically a house with 9 guys and her. Otherwise, she has told me that she will start really limiting these trips, try to go to ones that I can come along on, and that the only ""male only"" one she'll go on is the one 3 day trip that is required for membership every year.

**Besides the lying part, the other thing that kills me is the male bonding. You can call me selfish, but I dont want my wife to be having late night bonding sessions with other men without me. When I am in a relationship, Im not going out and meeting new women. Nor am I going out at night or hanging out with women them without my significant other right next to me. These trips are like all day intimacy sessions with other men that are not myself. Like I understand having to work with other men. It kills me that she has to ""bond"" with them on overnight trips when Im not there. It rips my heart out**

I really dont want to break up with this woman. I love her more than Ive loved anyone else. But these trips are going to kill me if I cant trust her.

My current plan is a wait and see approach. I dont need to marry her tomorrow. My hope is that she actually fixes these issues with herself and we can have a great relationship.

**I guess my question is, am I being delusional that these feelings will eventually subside? Or that we can cut down the trips to the point where Im comfortable? Every person has issues. Is compulsive lying too much to deal with coupled with weekend trips without me and mostly with other random men? Any comment would help**

**And to add a little JP tid bit. JP says to chain yourself to whoever you marry. Every person you meet has hidden problems. The point of the marriage is to tie yourself to this person and fix those problems and become stronger together.

Since last time, I decided that I needed to put my profile into overdrive.  But-I had no good photos of myself, having actively avoided being in any pictures since I was young for personal reasons. Recluse that I am, I spent an afternoon traversing two separate parks with my phone, a tripod, and a remote clicker (Which I purchased a while back on advice from someone on this subreddit) in order to take the high-effort photos I needed, outfit changes included.  In the end, my pants and shoes were stained with dirt, but the results...oh boy the results were fire.  For starters, to test, I remade my Tinder account (I previously got frustrated + I didn't have a name on my profile.  I then dumped the best photos into the Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge accounts, and here was the result:

Tinder: I got my first actual Tinder conversation very quickly.  It didn't go well, but I guess that's how these things go.  So far, it seems like I get about 2-4 matches and/or likes per day, and I would guess that about half of those are ""empty"".

Bumble: I got a few matches, but not as many as Tinder.  Makes sense due to there being less instas.  Funnily enough, one of the people I did match with previously and get along quite well with did put their Instagram \*all the way\* at the bottom of their profile, so I guess you can't always judge people too hard.

Hinge: Similar to Tinder, I actually am beginning to feel like I need a fresh start to match the fresh pics.  I'm finding that rather than being picky, I'm essentially picking *no one*, and perhaps I screwed too hard with the algorithm and it no longer is giving me matches I'm interested in.

A few things I learned so far:

Pictures are very important.  The difference in results between good pictures and bad ones is like night and day.

Don't be afraid to match people nerd for nerd in conversations if you see the right signs, but don't go overboard either.

For the fellow men out there, I know that a lot of you might feel fed up with OLD, but if you're not really getting out there in the first place, maybe giving your profile a little push might do the trick.  You could get a friend to take pictures for you, or do what I did.  Try multiple locations that you like and will give the ""vibe"" you want to send to people.  The goal is to show people that yes, you do actually go outside and \*maybe\*, you touch grass once in a while, even.

We went out Friday night, had a drink and got to know each other (our family lives, hobbies, where we lived, things like that) fairly well over the course of 2 hours.

I then brought up the idea of going out for dinner next time. She agreed, but noted her sibling is visiting this entire week so she wants to touch base with me before she leaves (basically end of this week) to confirm a date. I said no problem and we’ll keep in touch then.

Yesterday afternoon she texts me back after I thanked her through text for a fun time Friday night and that it was fun meeting her. Then I responded to her text hours later (both of us are slow texters), then followed up by asking for her IG while leaving my handle so she can follow me.

I really don’t know why I did this! At the time I thought it was no big deal, but then in the past hour I started reading articles about how it’s a red flag to ask for someone’s social early in the stages of dating (after the first date) because it’s their private life, and how this should wait until things become exclusive, or at least after a few dates.

Some of the articles cited a study with 14K people, which suggested that connecting on social media at a later point correlates with a much longer relationship, versus earlier which correlates with a very, very short lived relationship (less than a month).

I noticed her IG is private (we know each other’s name, so wasn’t hard to look it up) so I’m guessing she wants to keep her personal life private.

I started dating a new guy and it was going well. We had a strong emotional connection, he was the most thoughtful guy I’d met for a long time. We discussed past relationships and he described most of his ex’s as loud, extroverted types. Enter my self-loathing tendencies creeping in thinking ok he’s gonna get bored of me soon. 

Anyway we were having a conversation and he basically said - not in these exact words - that I don’t have ‘anything’ (I suppose this means interesting) about me. 

Because this is something I’ve struggled internally with my whole life I got really upset and cried. He held me while I cried and apologised, saying he would never intentionally have said something to upset me and of course he doesn’t think that.

Everything is great, he is the best person I have ever met and besides everything he is my best friend too. He didn’t have a girlfriend before me, so we ran into some difficulties especially at the beginning of the relationship.

Since we were both very inexperienced at first I wasn't very open about things that bothered me, but he didn't try to set some reasonable limits either. The problem arose in December 2020 when I found out that he had kept a huge thing from me from the very beginning of the relationship. If I had found it out in the beginning I probably wouldn't have continued my relationship with him, but I managed to forgive him after a while. 

From that moment on I also opened up and set specific boundaries in the relationship and the main thing was that whatever happens it must not be kept quiet. Everything has improved since then and we didn't have any major problems until February 2022. I joked one day that he kept something from me and he admitted to me that in early December he violated a boundary I set. That boundary is not a huge thing, but it means something to me and what hurts me the most is that he kept silent for 2 months. 

I try to understand him, but I can't. And I forgave him, I really did, but every time I think about it I feel some insecurity. I know I don’t need to think about the mistakes I forgave him, but every time I think back to that December 2020 and everything from the beginning of our relationship that hurt me I feel some anxiety and pain.

But rather then feeling like equals compromising, my partner just redoes things and insist their way is better. A specific example is the bathroom closet, it was quite cluttered and with my partner aware, I reorganized it. A few weeks later they pull everything out, buy new containers and reorganize it again.

The tension comes in the way they talk about it as the way they did it was better and superior, not that they personally think it's better and prefer it more, but that it's universally better. And they are offended that I don't see that as an improvement and thank them for it. 

And I feel hurt because rather then just seeing this as two different preferences, it feels like an important thing to put down and see as less then the way that it was before (the way that I did it or have done it in the past).

Let’s just call him JC. So JC and I had an on/off relationship throughout high school and beginning of college. We kind of always thought we’d end up together, because no matter who we dated, we’d always find our way back to one another. He joined the Army after our first year of college and moved across the country, but we still kept in touch as friends. 

We have always had a strange relationship. Like sometimes we are into each other and we get along great, other times we do/say something that pisses the other one off and we go months to a year of not really talking. So JC recently moved back to the area in the last year or so, but I haven’t made the time or effort to go spend time with him. Not sure why, maybe nerves of not seeing him for almost 5 years. But anyway, I started seeing someone else during the pandemic for almost 2 years and it was serious. I had told JC about it and we haven’t been in contact since last summer. But it didn’t work out with the new guy and I ended things. 

Coincidentally, a few days later JC texts me, like I said, somehow we always find our way back to each other. He just wanted to see how I was and he ended up asking how my relationship was going so I told him things didn’t work out. So of course we keep talking and eventually get a little flirty and old feelings flood back. He tells me that he still loves me and that he’s sorry he took me for granted when we were younger, and he wants to start over and make sure we build a healthy long lasting relationship. 

So we’ve been talking for about 3 weeks now. But I’ve noticed he’s so different. Like in a good way, he’s more mature and wise and it’s kinda really sexy haha. But he’s like this new man that I have to get to know all over again and it’s weird, because I feel like I don’t know how to go about that. We have always had this hot heavy, fast-paced relationship every time we got together. And all of my relationships were never slow paced. But he really wants to take his time and be friends and build our romance and I feel lost honestly. Especially this coming from him (like I said totally new man). I’m not used to taking things slow, I’ve always wanted a slow burning romance but now that I get one for the first time at almost 25, I don’t really now how to navigate it. He’s hard to get to know and open up. Always has been, but it’s never really been an issue until now. I’m an empath and an open book, he’s more closed and doesn’t really know how to handle his own feelings let’s alone other peoples. 

Sex, passion and fun has always been our go to and now we have to really get to know each other and it’s foreign. I’m always busy with my new job and too exhausted after work, and I take the weekends to recoup and catch up on my to do lists, so I haven’t gotten the opportunity to be with him in person yet. But he says I’m rushing us and trying to hard to get him to open up to me, and I’m trying not to. So basically, I guess I need help resisting my urges or persistent ways. I can’t make him open up to me, but it’s hard when you’ve known someone for so long, but still don’t really know them. I feel like he should trust me enough to just share his life, especially if he claims to love me. How do I go against what I’ve always known, which is a rushed romance, to having a slow or normal paced one?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162928,public,self,Hot and Heavy to Slow and Steady,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t82e6a/hot_and_heavy_to_slow_and_steady/,no_ads,0.0,
