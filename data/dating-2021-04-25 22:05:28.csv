I had feelings for this guy I’ve only known for a short amount of time, and now I know he just wanted sex but I’m confused looking back. He never would even take me out, but when we hung out at his apartment he would dress me up in his jackets, show me all of his favorite books, tell me about his family/ask me about mine, kept a little trinket I gave him in the middle of his desk, introduced me to his friends, give me little kisses all over my face, and we would have tons of genuine random moments of laughter and care. After these few nights together we hadn’t gotten sexual, and he kind of tried to pressure me and I made it clear I think sex is for when you’re more serious. he acted weird and was rude to me the next morning and I haven’t heard from him. I’m just confused, were all of those actions just fake/part of an act? It’s like I’m not dumb I can tell when someone’s just trying to flatter me, but we just had so many random dumb moments even just friends would share together, so I’m confused as to if it was all calculated... guys plz explain this thinking",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myo979/was_it_all_an_act_or_a_change_in_heart/

I've met a couple of people since I started dating in Feb, he is by far the one I have the most in common with. He's intelligent, humble and open-minded. And I like him a lot as a person.

5,myotpl,1619408635,Should I ask her out now or wait?,"Hey there,

It's my first time posting.

I have been hanging out with a former co-worker I have known since last September 2020 to December 2020.

I broke up with my ex-gf of 4 years in October because she cheated on me.

I thought she was cute and reached out to her via Instagram this March.

We went on a few walks and thought she also liked me based on these observations:

she always makes time for me (eager to hang out and spend longer time)
she shares details about her family
she always asks questions about me and continues the conversation if we go silent (so do I)
she thinks highly of me (don't know why)
she asked who my type is (not sure if this is a sign?)
She went back to Japan to see her family and she comes back in July. We decided to hang out again, but I don't want to wait.

I was thinking about waiting to ask her on an actual date when she comes back, but would it be okay to ask her via DM?

                       OR
Does she even like me (maybe I am confusing it with overt friendliness)?

7,myoyno,1619409155,I (F26) am Falling in Love with my FWB (M34) but He is still hang up on his dead GF,"He (M34) and I (F26) met through and OLD app. We hooked up, decided that the sex and chemistry is good so we ended up with an FWB set-up, with the friends things as well. It has been more than 3 months now. 

Now, here is the problem. It is a long read so please bear with it. 

I am seldom sexually attracted to men, one of the reasons why I never had a serious relationship. I had some flings before but never serious. 

Before he and I started with the FWB set-up, I told him that I might catch feelings for him. He laughed at it, saying a girl like me wouldn't fall in love with a guy like him. Also, we would have disconnect since he is busy most of the days, and there would be disconnect, but let us see where it goes. 

So for the past months, everything was going well. We talk almost everyday, meet when we are both free, and usually sext or cam when not. I can say that we are more on a sexual relationship. However, we also like share about our lives, although I can feel that he is somewhat closed off. But that was fine since we are happy as is and I can feel that he cares about me more than a FWB. 

The last month though, I feel my feelings for him changing. I am catching feelings, more than I should. I began to demand more of his time and I get jealous, especially with his previous girls. I become insecure especially since he is more experienced than me in both relationships and sex. 

I told him about how I felt and he has been graciously and maturely assuring me about my insecurities and we somewhat became exclusive. He also makes more time for me. This made me like me even more, and I feel my feelings get deeper and deeper. 

Few days ago, I told him that I want to be more to him. He told me that he likes me, but he is still closed off because of his fiancee who died 4 years ago. He still has the baggage from what happened, since he blamed himself and has guilt because of her death. He told me about this early on and I really felt that he still has hang up about what happened. He said that when he met me, he was never looking for anything serious, but he is open to it sometime. 

I really like him and I am willing to wait for him to be ready again. But I don't know how. I am scared. I know this is a gamble, but I am not sure if I can deal with the risks. As I said, this would be my first serious relationship. I want him to open up for me but I do not know how. 

How do you make a guy open up to you? Should I interpret what he said as being open to having that relationship with me? What are my possible options in this scenario? 

Thank you for the help everyone. 

TL;DR: Falling in love with FWB, but he said he is still closed off but is open to something serious sometime. What should I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myoyno/i_f26_am_falling_in_love_with_my_fwb_m34_but_he/

12,myp7od,1619410102,Bummed out because date canceled / all of the sudden shows no interest,"I (23M) matched with a guy on tinder last week and we initially really hit it off. Most conversations I have are dry and boring, but with this guy we were both so invested into the conversation and I ended up texting him for over 5 hours (I never do that!!) Over the next couple days we kept texting and the conversations continued to be engaging and fun and I really felt that we were clicking. 

A few days in he suggested we grab drinks (notice not me, it was him!) and I said yes absolutely! We had a date and a time planned and I was super excited because I really liked him a lot. I texted him the night before our date basically saying how I was super excited blah blah blah, no answer - I didn’t think much of it cuz it was relatively late and I just assumed he was asleep. 

The next morning he texts me this paragraph basically saying how he needs to cancel the date because “something came up in which I can’t date for the time being” which I know translates to “I’m not interested at all”. But the paragraph was full of mixed messages basically saying how we can keep talking and that he would like to “explore” this in the future but idk... my gut just says he doesn’t care. I decided to test that theory and not text first after that day and it’s been 4 days and he’s said absolutely nothing to me soooo I think I get the hint that he’s not interested lol

Granted, I’m not like heartbroken because in retrospect all of this happened over the course of ~maybe~ a week and a half, but even then I’m just really bummed out because I genuinely thought he was into me. Usually I’m very good at detecting when someone doesn’t care or isn’t interested, but with him I did not get that feeling AT ALL while I was talking to him. 

Obviously I want to text him so badly but I know that I would come across as desperate; and I also know it’s pointless to pursue someone if that interest isn’t reciprocated.

13,myp7u3,1619410120,Is it bad that I don’t want to give my girlfriend as much attention as she wants?,"I'm a 20-year-old college student, and my girlfriend is also 20 but graduated. We live apart– I live on campus while she has an apartment about 15 minutes away– but I see her every weekend and we occasionally visit each other during the week. She often talks about how we don't spend enough time together, how we ""barely talk"" during the week, how I don't talk to her as much at night time, etc. She isn't the first girlfriend of mine to say these kinds of things to me; in fact, my two exes told me the same thing when we were dating, which makes me feel like my lack of attention/communication is the problem. 
The thing is... I'm actually fine with the amount of time we spend together, texting, on the phone, etc. I was fine with it in my past relationships, and each breakup seemed to have something to do with that. I'm a busy guy, and my girlfriend knows this, but it doesn't stop her from constantly telling me how much more attention she needs. I text her when I can, and try to spend quality time with her on the weekends, but it seems like it isn't enough, and this makes me feel guilty sometimes.
I feel like I would enjoy a relationship in which I didn't spend all my free time with my SO, and didn't feel guilty about it. But is this kind of relationship considered unhealthy? And is this desire actually a problematic personality trait I should work on, or something I should learn to accept about myself?

14,mypanq,1619410419,Looking for advice,"I'm gonna try to make this short but detailed enough to make possible for good advice.

For about 8 years now I've lived a pretty antisocial lifestyle. I have friends but we don't do anything social together, it's mostly video games and outdoor stuff that we enjoy. I don't go out to bars or anywhere there's lots of people (hate crowds). I also never went to college so that took quite a toll on my social network and general social skills. I'm not super anti social, I just prefer being alone most of the time. During these 8 years I made a decision that I wouldn't chase having a girl and just let it happen on its own, and nothing happened until the day this girl messaged me. It really did feel like someone was sending me an angel or something like that. We connected so easily.

So this girl... We knew each other in high school and followed each other on SM for a long time until one day she messaged me about a quote I had posted and also complemented a selfie I took. Eventually I asked her on a date, which was meeting at my place, going to an art exhibit, and then we came back to my place. The conversation was really easy and enjoyable since we had so much in common, and she actually stayed until 3am when she said she didn't want to leave but had to because of the time. The only bad thing that caught me off guard was that she confided in living with her ex boyfriend. I know what you're thinking, but she did seem very genuine when she told me she was done with him after 4 years. Other than that the date went really well and we kept talking through the coming weeks.

At first she seemed so interested, texting me in the morning, sending me selfies, and when she didn't text me back, she would apologize. Those were all signs that things were going really well and we were on the way to our second date... So the day she agreed to meet up after work and go on a hike, she messaged me kind of late and asked to reschedule because she had a long day which I agreed to and told her I understood. When I asked about when she wanted to reschedule she just stopped responding and I didn't hear from her for like two weeks.

I tried to reach her during these two weeks but never got a response. Then I messaged her this sort of long thing asking about what happened and that I would really appreciate any kind of feedback so I wasn't so confused. Didn't hear back until a day later when she told me she had actually been in the hospital and didn't have her phone for awhile and she had typed out a long response but never sent it and that she hoped we could meet up soon to talk about it in person.

I was super sad to hear she had been hospitalized but also relieved that the girl I really liked didn't just ghost me and actually still wanted to see me. I was feeling like garbage, and when I found that out, it was like my whole midset shifted to positive immediately. 

Shortly after all this, we were having a long form text convo and then she just stopped responding mid convo. I tried to reach out a couple of times after that but no response. I also noticed she recently  deleted her Instagram which is her only social media. Feeling like garbage again.

Ghosting is pretty common these days and I know I'm probably not going to ever see her again but there's still a part of me that thinks there's a chance her life situation(health/living with ex) is why she stopped talking to me, and that if I give it enough time, she might be in a different situation and more willing to connect. Is that crazy? I really wish I could just go out with my friends and meet a girl to forget about this one but that's no small task for me. I could go on the dating apps to meet someone but I really dislike the dating app idea and don't even have pictures to share. In my mind there were so many things that made her uniquely matched for me/things that made her different than most women and I just can't fucking seem to forget about her. 

I really want to reach out again but I don't want to reignite the feeling of being ghosted. Maybe there's a chance she actually wants to reach out but doesn't know how to go about it?

People don’t understand how many times I’ve been thought of as lame for liking music production and graphic design (before they even hear/see my work) but it’s happened a lot. I’m not out of shape, I’m on the skinny side and I’m 5’6”, which is decent for a freshman in highschool.

* Not knowing why you're not getting matches
* Too many low quality intro messages (eg. 'hi', 'hello', 'how r u', 'hello sexy')
* Too many low-effort / poor quality profiles (no bio / no photo)
* Meeting people who are low in emotional intelligence or self-awareness
* Chatting with people who aren't serious about meeting up
* Disingenuous users (eg. people promoting Instagram accounts or OnlyFanz, scammers)
* Apps being too money-grubbing (eg. charging you to see likes, read receipts/messages, etc.)
* Lack of transparency with matching algorithm / how many users have actually seen you
* Being catfished
* Bots
* Being ghosted

He was my teenage dream when I was 16 and he was 17. He was on the football team. He would try to get my attention in class but it wouldn’t go anywhere.

Then after highschool four years later we matched on a dating app. I was over the moon. I crushed my feelings and hid them because I was afraid I would lose him if I showed that I was looking for anything more than a hookup. He liked that. Especially since he backed out of a date he asked me out on when I said I didn’t want to drink. 

I thought that maybe he would like me eventually, too. But he hurt me. Physically, and emotionally. And he didn’t care. We had sex- it was my first time. He made me think it would be special. It wasn’t. 

He said he would only go down on partners when I requested it. I felt worthless. Like the girls he actually dates are worth him giving oral sex to, I’m just a body. He made me feel like I wasn’t good enough to pleasure him. He was angry, drunk and mean. I was astonished at how different he was behaving compared to beforehand. He smiled every time I cried out in pain.

The messed up thing is, I still want him. I want to be in his arms again. I want to be under him again even though it destroyed me. I want to kiss him again. I want to make him feel good again. I want to let him pick me up and do what he wants with my body again. I miss him terribly but I can’t risk losing my sanity again. It is too expensive.

24,mypsdy,1619412262,25 F Virgin,"It’s a vent and also I could use some advice. 
Hi, I’m a 25F virgin. Never been in a relationship, never been in on a real date. I know that I’m not the only one though. I had severe depression in my teens and early 20’s. I lived in a household where I was not allowed to lock the door. I didn’t have any interest in dating for a long time. I’ve only made out with 2 people. Is this a huge deal breaker for men? I’ve encountered men who were turned on by it and it was creepy but there also men that don’t want to touch me because it. I worry that I’m never going to develop healthy sexual boundaries. I had been told growing up that anything outside of P and V between a married couple (procreation only) is a sin. 

I don’t know if I want sex or not but I do want to feel physically close to other people. Are there men that are ok with just foreplay for a while? Are there people that even want to date? Getting advice from my friends has been helpful but we’re not in the same boat. 

I’m a plus size women and I’m 5’10. There has been some weird experiences. Men have asked me how big I am. That they love how big I am. One guy asked me if I had a 2 seater. I feel like everything I was told growing up is a lie. There are men who tell me that they love that I am taller than them. I don’t mind that. Literally never saw that happening. 

I thought to be FWB, you had to be friends 1st. I thought that people who engaged in this kind of behavior did so with some kind of care or human decency. Or just recognizing that I’m a person too. I have nothing against people who hook up but I don’t understand men who ask to come over in the 1st sentence. Or say that want me to sit on their face etc. 

I’ve noticed that once I start speaking sexually to men they stop seeing me as a person. Despite being a virgin I have a sexuality. I’m an adult and I may not have physical experience but it is a part of my life. I don’t understand why it is so taboo to talk about it even when we are both consenting adults with no religious quandaries. 

How do I approach telling the people I am dating about my history when there is very little? And what is there mostly abusive? Some of the guys I’m talking to are older and I fear might have more expectations. A few days ago I made out with a guy I met on Tinder. He also has little experience, but seemed surprised when I told him how little I had. We did talk yesterday but not today.  Is he ghosting me? It feels worse than him just telling me that he doesn’t want to see me again. If I had known it was going to be a 1 time thing I wouldn’t have had him over. I know that he only wanted to fool around though. He’s the the 1st guy that’s ever even been in my room.

25,myqaoh,1619414293,I think the stage between establishing you like each other and officially dating is the most nerve wrecking time I can think of in the dating life cycle,"So for me when it comes to texting I generally like to add emojis. Nothing over the top but just as a form of decoration (""hey, how's it going?😋"", ""dude, that whole situation was amazing 😱"" etc). So naturally when I'm dating a girl I want to add emojis like 🥰😘😍 and stuff along those lines. But generally you only add those when you're officially dating or you're about to make it official.

We don't text much but we have spoken face to face quite often and I definitely feel like there's a connection.

A couple days ago I found out that when they, met, my bf (who I was talking to at the time) bought her pizza for her birthday. It’s just the way they vibe I feel like he has to be attracted to her somehow. I sometimes question why he’s still with me if he’s around someone as dope and pretty as she’s is. I’ve been crying all day because i am an over thinker and idk if this is just me getting in my head or if it’s actually real. He’s always sweet to me and really understanding of any issues I have so I don’t want him to get offended if I bring this up.

We’re both in our 20’s and are both students. She seemed to find me physically attractive but doesn’t necessarily mean she was interested. After exchanging numbers I flirted non stop and she was not into it at all — I had wishful thinking and kept going. Her texts were no longer than 5-6 words and took her hours to get back ... even 1 full day before she laid my a** out ! I would send her a funny video, FaceTimed her once (didn’t pick up obvs). Before the first rejection she ghosted some for two days basically leaving me to talk to myself via text. She then nicely rejected me talking about being ""kinda interested in someone else"" but REALLY wants to stay friends. Wishful thinking pt. 2 in my head — maybe she wants me to try harder? I said I was disappointed but appreciated her honesty. I ask her out again 6 days later and she turned into a savage even called me homie and said I don’t want to be with you. I said nothing and she came back few days later to top the cake by blaming her friends for saying that ALSO she’s seeing that guy she was interested in but ""hopes we can be friends!!"" I told her I’d appreciate she give me some space thanks. I’m ready to receive all the criticism and comments on my actions I need to change. I don’t even know why I liked her so much (this happened 1.5 months ago &amp; I haven’t seen her since we exchanged numbers 1.5 months ago). Am I sick ? Do I need to get professional help?

35,myr05x,1619417301,37 and never had a serious GF before is it too late for me?,"I know it is a bad look on my part. Also yes I have dated and had sex before so it not like I am clueless. To make a long story short I give you the cliff notes of why it not all my fault but some of it is.

I did not date in high school I had social anxiety and did have many friends so i did not date. I did go to community college to learn a trade I did date somewhat but could have dated more that is for sure.

As time went on I finished college worked and date off and on again noting. I did make friends and everything was on the up and up however to make a long story I stopped hanging out with them all they wanted to do is drink and get high which is cool but getting tooold for that .  

Also, throw in that I did not work for almost two years because of the great crash of 2008 the stock market crashed, and mass layoffs I did not want to date because I was broke.  I found a job finally and moved out of my parent's home. That went well for a few years till my roommate OD and almost passed away. Then I was back to sqauer one almost. 

I had an idea of going back to college and tried to get into nursing but I did have the grades spent a few years trying to get classes done and work 40 hours a week and putting in 18 hour days 3 days a week for 3 years. Well, I did end up having the grades getting 4.0 is so hard to do when you're trying to work to pay bills.  I gave up on that nursing dream and I really wanted to get into the program. 

Oh before I forget I got my teeth fixed and it was not cheap and you cant tell that they are fake. with that being said I had to move back home so I can save to get my teeth fixed. Yes, bad teeth run in the family, and I did take the best care of them .

Right now I am just working and saving to get my own place soon I make ok money and rent is one paycheck but that life. 

Yes, I know living at home is going to kill any shot at dating and i am really moving out soon. I still looking into doing something else for work so I can make more money.

Oh, I am not fat I run 30 to 70 miles a week and training for a 100 miler in October.

36,myr0fw,1619417334,Dear women of dating sites,"Dear women of dating sites,

I had no idea so many of you enjoy shooting guns, riding ATVs and off-roading pickup trucks.  I root for your individuality and applaud your desire to whatever it is you want; after all it is 2021 and gender shouldn’t dictate what you like to do no matter how you identify.

While having a picture of you brandishing an AK47 or pointing a glock at the camera is a captivating image which cannot be ignored, this really doesn’t win you many points with some men.  If you truly have these interests, I think it’s excellent that you are sharing it with the world.  I merely wish to suggest that not every man is looking for a woman that can shoot wild game while driving a pickup truck on their way to going ATVing.

There do exist men who are looking for women who enjoy more simple activities and don’t necessarily want to have our first date while hanging off a cliff by bungee cord.

Again, I may be totally wrong and in fact 80-90% of women enjoy these activities (as they are represented on random dating sites) in which case I guess I’m just a boring guy.  If that isn’t the case however and you are posting these pictures in an attempt to attract men, I would submit that you may be losing good potential dates.

Lastly I would really like to know why so many put on tinder “just looking for friends.”  Do you really think you’re fooling anyone?

Signed,

A Man Who Doesn’t Want to Get Shot on a first date.

P.S. I am a man and surprisingly I sometimes go more than 24 hours without even touching an ATV.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myr0fw/dear_women_of_dating_sites/
37,myr6cg,1619418036,What happened?!,"So this guy and I connected through OLD and let me just say it was a good match. This was one of the few guys that I genuinely felt I shared a personality match with. He reached out to me and we both learned we have a lot in common. Things went smoothly for the first couple of days, where it seamlessly moved from the app to text.

On a Friday night, we messaged each other back to back. He offered a date and a phone call, to which I agreed to both. I fell asleep during our rapid-fire exchange, but responded the next morning that we could talk on the phone that afternoon. The day goes by and I don’t hear anything from him. Hm. 

The following day, Sunday, he messaged me first thing in the morning about how he was very busy. Not a big deal I thought,  but it did disrupt the flow of our conversation. He asks again if we can talk that evening, to which I agree. After sparse texts, he asks me 5 hours before the call if we can reschedule again. At this point, I felt disrespected but I liked him and gave the benefit of the doubt. I give him a different date and left it at that.

The messages slowed drastically. I wasn’t sure if he was just busy or if he was slow fading. I reached out in a last ditch effort to see if we were really going to be in contact. I ask if he still would like to hang, to which he said yes and that it’d be fun. He then proceeds to tell me how he’s busy for the next 2 weeks and didn’t try to come up with a day. At that point, I gave up. He tried one more time by asking when I’m free, and I gave him a time when I would be. His response was that he’d get back to me in 3 days whether he could or not.

If I go on dates with guys I don’t think ‘wow’ about, the sexual feelings never come.

As a teenager I felt attracted to soooo many guys, now it just doesn’t happen. I miss feeling attracted to people, I hope I’ve not turned asexual. 

I think I like older guys cause I’m surrounded by younger guys and I don’t think they’re my type. 

But I rarely fantasiZe about guys or strangers anymore, as a teenager it happened sooo much.

50,mysht0,1619423786,I fell in love with my enemy,"I don’t even know where to start. 
I’m not even sure if he was ever my enemy or if I was just lying to myself. 
A year and a half ago when I started my ex, I was introduced to one of his friends that I’ll just call A. 
Since my relationship was still fresh and actually started off on the wrong foot because he was already cheating I just couldn’t prove it yet, I secretly had an attraction to A. And then A met my best friend and they started to date. 
We all became good friends and even attempted to plan a double date and I even helped him come up with a cute way to ask her to homecoming.
And then he cheated on her. And of course I came into the defense of my best friend and shunned him. But he was still my boyfriends friend. A couple months later and a couple of A’s girlfriends later I had a debate with my boyfriend that his friends were crappy and that they werent true. 
We settled on proving this theory was to flirt with his friends to see if they would tell him. Some told him, some blocked me, and some didn’t tell him a thing. 
Then testing A came.
I felt wierd for doing it because i hated him and he was a proven cheater so I kind of already knew where it was going. He fell for the trap completely and flirted back. But then something wierd happened, he opened up to me and I found myself not wanting it to be pretend. I felt something for just a second until I remembered who he was. 
I sent the Screenshots to his girlfriend and in minutes he was cussing me out for doing that. And wierdly I felt bad because part of it was real. The conversations and the stories we shared were real. But I fired back and my boyfriend got involved. 
They started threatening each other and it kept getting worse and worse where police almost got involved. 
Eventually after about a few days the feud between us shut down but things didn’t end well for him. By then everyone at school knew about what he did and those dumb highschool Instagram shade rooms posted all screenshots and he was shunned by every single person. He no longer was around in the hangout spot at lunch. 
Things never got better, in fact worse. He dated a few more girls here and there but his reputation followed and he was officially labeled as a lot of bad things.
A few more rumors came out about 6 months later that involved one of my other friends and I was yet again having it out for him. Only this time I had enough of the things he would do and my guy friends including my boyfriend were planning to jump him and I’ve never been much for violence but I agreed with some convincing and was the brains of the operation. We found out where he worked and drove their only to find out that he no longer did. We asked everyone we could if they knew where he lived and they said no but we found out his bus number and planned to trail his bus to his bus stop. But then I got an idea. I went to his Instagram and carefully examined every post looking at every small detail until I found the exact house he lived in with the help of google earth. By then it was dark out and we had to find an excuse to lure him out of his house. 
And that’s when I was made to do something I didn’t want to do. 
They had me write out a letter to him, a love letter from anonymous and leave my phone number. We were cat fishing. 
Then we’d get him to agree to hang out and then that’s when they would dump him. I wrote the letter and I found myself writing some things I actually meant my friends were like ooh yay that’s good, and little did they know why it was so good. Because I secretly felt that way. 
I delivered the note and we went home.
Hours later the phone rang and I was met with A being annoyed. 
“I’m flattered by your note but how the hell did you find out my moms address and who the fuck are you?”
My boyfriend being a total hothead, cuts me off and ruined the whole plan.
A heard my boyfriends voice and went off. There was a lot yelling and me actually getting pissed off. And that’s when his mom took the phone saying “listen my son is in a hospital injured, was close to death a few hours ago for a suicide attempt because nobody can seem to leave him alone. How did you find out my sisters address”
I calmed down with his mom and told her everything.
She pulled him out of school a few weeks later when he was released from the hospital and I hadn’t heard from him in months but people still talked. 
My relationship ended months later to ironically, him cheating. 
A month after my break up I was adding people on quick add because I wanted to meet new friends. 
And I didn’t notice I had added A. He added me back a couple hours later and immediately jumped down my throat saying “you literally tried to ruin my life what the fuck do you want”
This sparked up our old feud, but it went a different route. 
We ended up finding some common ground and had a different conversation. It somehow changed into us shit talking my ex and he said “just hook up with me and he’d be pissed”
And then I actually agreed, but I said “just to be clear I still hate you, this is all lust.”

He came over an hour later and we smoked and drank a bit and as I was pouring our drinks he came up behind me and when his hands touched my hips and his lips on my neck I was immediately turned on and I knew then that yes the attraction was real. We went out to smoke and we had one of those high talks and then I brought up my previous best friend who now was just a regular friend, we grew distant. 
He broke down a bit saying that none of those girls deserved what he did and in that moment he was no longer the same guy I knew almost two years ago and I was insanely attracted to his change and I made the first move which I NEVER DO but it felt so right. 
I have kissed 20+ people and none felt like this. It was slow and passionate and when i pulled away the connection and chemistry was so real. We went inside and continued. The sex was amazing, it went on for two hours but it wasn’t hooking up. It literally felt like a scene right out of a romance sex scene. We both finished and he had to leave about 20 minutes later for work, and I felt like crap after he left I just wanted him back. 
We didn’t stop talking.

I love this arrangement because I am quite independent and find it difficult to share too much time with others. However, I've noticed that after the conversation, our dynamic has shifted. I've met his friends, been invited to hang out sessions where he is quite public with his affection towards me. One of his female friends called me one night to assure me that she was no competition and that he was all mine.

It confuses me because he was the one that told me that there's something missing in order to go for a relationship. But at the same time he seems so much more into me than before that conversation.. 

Some part of me thinks that he might also have pushed a relationship with me away due to me not really voicing how much I like him. I mean we have such a nice time together and I am super attracted to him, it's just that his lifestyle doesn't really fit well with mine. But also this he seems to be trying to change.

It's crazy bc the whole day i was as hard as a rock and purposely didn't jack off, but once we started having sex i couldn't stay hard with the condom on. It was honestly really embarrassing, but we were drinking ( i had 3 shots, some wine and a truly), I was in an uncomfortable environment and idk i dont think i had that connection with her yet. It's so wild to me that this is literally what i dream of and I had a girl literally throw herself at me yet I couldn't stay hard enough to put a condom on, but to be fair she wasn't really passionate and i sort of felt just like a boy toy or something.

I think once i gain more experience i wouldn't feel as bad, but we didnt even cuddle afterwards, she was basically like see ya later i got work tomorrow, and when i had sex with a different girl it was a completely different experience. The only real positive in my opinion is that i like the validation and i she wanted to fuck me so bad which really surprised me tbh.

I'm just so embarrassed about my dick not staying hard with the condom, i did cum on her, but i shot all the way into her hair, and i also left a mark on her boob from biting lol. I'd say it was like a 5/10 at least for me but she seemed to enjoy herself and she quivered while i was eating her out but i just find it so odd that the only way i can tell if she's enjoying anything is by the moans or the way she moves her body. 

Im hoping we could try again but it seemed like things didn't go that well but idk if im just in my head too much.

If you think people are judged on ‘the inside’ you are completely wrong.

Many people with a good personality and a good heart have suffered and ended up becoming walked over by the pretty people being obnoxiously rude to them, curt and judgemental because you can’t see past the face.

Stop spreading lies about personality and heart when you know full damn well in the real world it *does not work as simply as that*. It helps in a relationship, but most people can’t knock that door down because of looks in the first place and spend most of their lives alone and outcasted like me.

However, a week ago he told me he's been having thoughts and came to the realization that he's not ready for a commitment and wants to focus on his life. I tried asking him to work things out but he said it's something that he needs to work on by himself and that he was afraid that if we stayed together, he wouldn't be able to make enough time for me and the relationship would only get worse with me being hurt therefore he said it's best we part ways instead of me getting even more hurt.

I know her response isn't wrong but I'm just wondering what happened. She seemed so lovely and interested the couple of days before. We had interesting conversations and I don't think I said anything which might have put her off.

And I said ""I'm visiting the town (this week) so we can go"" and she was like ""yeah we will have to go"" and I don't know if she was serious about that or not.

So a few days after that I saw her again in our group meeting, I was going to ask her during the group meeting if she wanted to go see the show together but since there were other friends in the meeting I wanted to get her alone to ask but I couldn't because she always leaves right after the last guy leaves which I don't know why.

We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again. A few days before our second date, he asked what I was up to one evening and offered movie night in pjs.

Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similiar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. Date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver.

76,myw6id,1619438928,Should I give this guy another chance?,"Hi guys,

So I connected with this guy from my old high school. He’s really sweet and friendly. He still lives in our hometown but I moved about an hour away. We’ve tried hanging out 3 times and over the past 2 weeks and it never worked out. I’m getting kind of tired.

First time we tried planning something, I felt queasy but i still wanted to hang out but he insisted I stay home and rest. Second time he forgot he had to pick his parents up at the airport and third, they had a family
dinner and it started way later than usual and the timing didn’t work out.

Not a huge deal except the last two times we were supposed to hang out, I scrubbed my
whole house for him and the next time, I visited my parents and stayed with them for a day so I could see him. I just feel like I was planning things around him and he wasn’t.

I told him due to the distance and the schedule compatibility, this might not work out. Every time something didn’t work out he did always apologized and rescheduled but I already felt I was doing more and I am tired of planning and investing myself for things that don’t work out.

He said he understood how I felt and it was his fault he forgot about picking his parents up. He said he’d make it up to me and would spend the whole day with me saturday and he can try coming on the weekdays. I told him I needed space and I’d let him know what I wanted to do. He apologized again and told me to let him know. I’m not sure it’s even worth it because I’m starting to get a bad feeling in my gut.

I know he is genuinely busy but I already feel like he doesn’t care enough. I am a believer of “if he wanted to, he would” because I do things I want for people that I like or want to impress etc.

At the same time, I’m starting to think I may be reading too much into this due to my past relationship experiences (I felt like I put in a lot of effort and it wasn’t reciprocated).

He is really sweet and we have a lot of the same
interests. He’s been respectful too but I don’t like how difficult it has become to go on a date. Am I overreacting? What do you guys think?

TLDR; A guy and I have been trying to plan a date for two weeks and it was canceled 3 times on his behalf. He lives an hour away and works a full time job far away. He owned up and apologized and is trying to make everything up to me this weekend but now I am hesitant to even go out on a date with him.

77,myw86t,1619439087,boyfriend has been accused of sexual assault amongst other things. advice?," Put a trigger warning here for sexual assault and mentions of rape.

Ok. I've been dating my bf a year, I'm 21 and so is he.

Before dating me, he was dating a girl who would send him pictures of a gun and tell him how she was cheating on him (not nice at all). He broke up with her and moved back him with his siblings and his mother, in agreeance to help out with his family as his mum is too mentally ill to work, drive etc.

Long story short, one night, him and his brother's girlfriend sent flirty messages and then ended up sleeping together. He says alcohol and weed was involved and they were both over the age of 18 (the age of consent is 16 here).

They both tried to hide this, until his brother found out and when he did, his mother kicked him out of the house and his family essentially disowned him. This happened a couple of months ago whereas the actual incident was 2y ago. When he got kicked out, he told me at the time what happened and said if I wanted to dump him, he would understand. I didn't dump him, as the situation did not involve me, but is something to be aware of.

Skip to now. Last week, his mother decided to message MY PARENTS about my boyfriend, telling them he is a dangerous individual, has hit her and his 15 year old brother - which has NOT come up on police records after requesting a check, alongside the fact he had a DBS check for his job. She sat and told my parents about the fact he 's\*xually assaulted' his brother's girlfriend, before this turning into r\*pe a few days later according to his brother. His mother proceeded to call my parents and tell them he is manipulative. His brother proceeded to tell my parents my boyfriend has a substance abuse problem; my boyfriend had told me when he was younger had used dr\*gs but did not anymore and has not for a while (other than weed which I don't care about).

My parents reacted emotionally to this and were surprised when I said I knew of the alleged incident but I had been told it was a drunken mistake, which I think it was but obviously I now question that. They responded by locking my car keys in the safe, telling me I should dump him immediately.

They told me they think I am being manipulated and that I am not reacting like I would do. They do not respect my decisions, despite me talking to them and asking them to please let me come to my own decisions as I am an adult. They proceed to tell me how they can't sleep, eat, feel sick with worry - I live in their house and I'm not going to run away, which I made clear to them, I am safe as long as I am home with them. My father also demanded to know why I had been talking to my boyfriend still and that he wanted to see the messages.

I told them that I need to find out the truth to this story and wait and see if the story goes to the police/courts to find out the truth.

Not once have I ever felt threatened by my boyfriend; he has been nothing but loving and supportive to me, telling me to put my degree and my future first and to do what's right for me, that he will always be there to support me. I am very, very aware at when I am being manipulated and I will always question things that don't add up. I do not understand why he would sit there and say he will prove text messages were sent by requesting the log from the service provider, and that he will stand up in court to defend himself if he has too.

I do not understand why his mother would wait almost 2 months to tell me that her son is allegedly such a dangerous man to be around, nor why she would invite me to stay despite these past assaults on her and his brother being 2-3y ago. I do not understand why she would not message me, but my parents instead. I have spoken to her before so it wasn't like I was unknown to her.

I do believe people can change and I do not believe he is capable of r\*pe. I do believe that if someone is very dangerous, you would surely not kick them out, but call the police on them instead in light of discovering what they have done, especially when it is serious.

I can't help but feel I am being treated like a child here. Not only by his mother talking to my parents and not me, but by my parents going on and on at me to 'dump this man' and asking me why I choose to have feelings for someone with 'such a past'. I told them I am going to be sensible about this and talk to who I need to, to find out the 'truth', but I see no reason to suddenly leave my boyfriend for what could just be an exaggeration of the truth.

79,mywida,1619440066,"He changed his profile again after our second date, what does this mean?","I’ve been on two dates with a guy from bumble. For both dates, we went on a walk and got dinner. The conversation for both dates was really smooth, we mainly talked about our life and told various stories. Before the first date ended, we had a goodbye kiss. After the date, we continued to text a little about our days and he sent me pics of something we discussed during our convo.

On Saturday, we had our second date and after dinner, he asked if I wanted to go to his place to “hangout” and I said yes. At first, we were watching a movie and then this quickly turned to us making out on the couch. He suggested moving to his room but I said I think it’s best if we don’t (as I try to avoid having sex so early on). He seemed cool with it and we continued making out + cuddling on the couch. Overall, we spent 5+ hours together and before I finally got up to leave, we had another quick make out session and he said “see you” when I walked out.

Based on our dates, I feel like everything went well because there’s chemistry and we seem to have fun together. However, he’s confusing me because he keeps changing his prompt questions on his dating profile (he did this the day after the first date and the morning after the second). I know we aren’t exclusive, but it just seems weird to me that he keeps changing his profile immediately after our dates. It makes me feel like I’m just an option... 

Thoughts on this situation? We haven’t texted since our last date so I’m thinking of just waiting for him to text first.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mywida/he_changed_his_profile_again_after_our_second/

Haven't been in a relationship at 22(F) although I tried a lot, approached guys, flirted, tried to make it work but I got ghosted or they said they were not interested or it turned into a friendships and then it ended like a once in a while message that does not get answered. And oh yeah, now that pandemic also is sabotaging my chances for more than a year because this online stuff has gone wrong for me. Just after a few texts they start making sexual remarks. I can't base my attraction just on pictures either. So you know what. Screw it. Really screw it. I am going to just completely forget this whole relationship part: I don't care anymore. I don't care if people say I'm inexperienced and crap: I know myself very well and I had enough difficult times in my life to find out who I am and what I need. I really don't give a damn anymore about society trying to push you into this dating thing as young as possible. Does it matter if I end up 30 and then date? Who cares? I don't care anymore. And even if I end up alone, then still I will be happy somehow. I know how to please myself, I will get myself a donor to have kids, I will finish my studies to get my dream job and dream car and create my own family. I'm just going to create my own rules. It's not that I will completely stop trying but I am not going to care anymore if something I started goes to waste. I'm really done with all those games and from now on I am going to make myself happy as heck. Without seeking anything in someone else. It's going to be me, myself and I from now on. I'm going to focus on things that I CAN control. This feels SO great. Yeah.

86,myx0d2,1619441737,"Yesterday I had the best and worst date of my life, simultaneously.","Last night was one of the most bizarre nights I’ve had in my (26M) dating life. Im not sure whether or not to be upset about it all or laugh it off.

So I have been talking to this girl for a few days, we matched on Bumble. I invite her over to have some drinks on my patio. Nothing crazy, just kinda a casual ‘get to know you’ type deal. I buy some seltzer’s she says she likes before she comes over. I clean the house up, light a candle, just sorta set it up nicely. 

Well, she comes over and I really feel like we are vibing. She’s laughing at all my jokes, tons of eye contact, she’s also constantly touching my arm or my leg. I can *feel* the attraction. I’m not a ‘player’ by any means but I’m also no slouch, I can tell she is into me. Well, after 2 seltzer’s she tells me basically to cut her off after 2 more. She says she’s a lightweight and she doesn’t want to keep drinking as she has to get up early and will need to drive home at some point. She also tells me she might try and peer pressure me into letting her have more and to not talk for it. I laugh thinking she’s joking a little bit and agree 

Well anyways, those two drinks to by and she says she needs another. I tell her that those were her two and that she shouldn’t drink anymore if she wants to drive. She interprets this as me wanting her to leave, to which I try and convince her is not the case. I even offer to cook for her if she will stay. Well, she asks me to just ‘be honest with her” (which I have been the whole time). At this point she’s starting to seems a little more drunk than I thought, but not hammered by any means. 

Well, eventually she just says “where is my purse I’m leaving.” Grabs her shit, walks out the door. I follow and ask her if she’s sure she wants to leave, and she just says “positive. It was nice meeting you.” She gets in her car and heads out. 

We had made multiple tentative plans prior to this. I haven’t ever felt so confident I would get a second date. I’ve never had someone walk out like that either. On top of this, I really don’t think I did anything wrong either. Don’t know to be angry or laugh at it. By the way, this is my first date after my girlfriend of 2 years and I broke up 3 months ago. So I’m still a little tender

TLDR; girl asks me to cut her off after X many drinks. When I do what she asks, she gets upset and takes it as me wanting her to leave despite my assurance that it’s not that way",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myx0d2/yesterday_i_had_the_best_and_worst_date_of_my/
87,myx3pd,1619442030,How do I avoid being completely trainwrecked in Dating?,"Strange title I know, and also this isn't a vent, it's more so that I believe I'm lacking some critical information about the opposite sex that is causing strife and want to learn before I end up like some of my friends. Also this is going to be a long post. I'll include a TLDR at the bottom.

So here's some context about me: I'm 19M, in Uni. I've been described as handsome by my platonic female friends and I enjoy conversation and find it easy to hold them. However, every romantic interaction I've had has failed hard. Below is my list of my starring failed attempts (I've had some minor ones I haven't included) for your amusement.

1. Highschool - Asked a Girl out, simple Rejection after 5 minute conversation. This is the only time I've ever heard a simple no, and honestly is the best of my experiences in this list. No heartbreak.
2. Highschool - Became interested in a Girl, lots of flirting and texting, any plans never materialized, there was always an excuse to postpone. Asked a female friend, she revealed to me my interest liked the attention from men flirting with her, but had no interest in me, and derived her attention from multiple men flirting with her simultaneously. Annoyed but no heartbreak.
3. Highschool - Really attractive Girl asked me out! Great right? Eh, not really. She insisted on going to the most expensive restaurant in town, spent the entire date on her phone, refused to talk to me. I had been warned by the same female friend as before that she only asked guys out for free meals in expensive restaurants, and that she had no interest in me. While I would usually always pay for the meal, since I knew I was being used, I refused to pay for her half, and left. Annoyed but no heartbreak.
4. Highschool - Became close friends with a Girl, then began the courtship. She took it really well, and we flirted constantly over a long period of time, and hung out in groups constantly. But she'd refuse any attempt at escalation, until eventually a few months later I called her out on it and she admitted that she wasn't interested in me, and only flirted with me as to not hurt my feelings. That caused some heartbreak.
5. University - Began to flirt with a girl, she took it really well. So well in fact, that she began sending me videos of BDSM that she wanted to practice. I was uncomfortable, and I didn't cut things off, but she realized I wasn't the person that could give her what she wanted and so she cut things off. We remain friends. No heartbreak.
6. University - Pretty much a repeat of n.4 except it went through lockdown, and I was better prepared due to my experience. Still caused a bit of heartbreak. 

Now, after reading my star-list you might be thinking I've been really unlucky, but after I list what happened to my three closest friends, you'll be thinking I've actually been blessed.

1. My friend was in a relationship with a girl for two years, during those two years nothing more than a kiss materalized. As it turns out, the Girl had been using him because she liked recieving gifts from him, and also she was a lesbian but wanted to lie to her parents pretending to be straight (she came from a strict asian culture), using him. Devasted him when he found out.
2. My friend is still in a relationship with a girl for over two years. She ignores him for weeks or months at a time, only reaching out or responding whenever she wants him to buy her something.  
3. My friend pretty much experienced a repeat of n.4, except the Girl in question went even further, going as far as sending him videos of her twerking, revealing pictures (not nudes) etc.. 

Ouch right? But on a serious note, what's going on? Is it really this common for these things to happen? Is there some information I'm missing? Perhaps my friends and I are just really bad judges of character. I know this isn't a ""all girls"" situation, I've met and befriended plenty of excellent girls who treat their partners with utmost respect, but they're all already in a relationship.

89,myxjqi,1619443348,can you develop serious feelings if you havent developed them yet? (8months),"
these are things i have (some time ago) experienced or wondered and now i am wondering what are other people thoughts.

1. If you haven’t fallen in love with someone in eight months in relationship, does it mean you won’t fall in love with them at all? I mean who is to say that there is a specific period of time in which you fall in love? some may fall in love in two months, some may fall in love in six months, some may fall in love right away. can you fall in love after eight months of not being in love? 

1.1. do you know right away if you want to be with that person for the rest of your life or are you in a relationship with them and only after a while you start to develop serious feelings or start to see the future with them?

2. if you have had thoughts of breaking up does it 100% mean the relationship won’t last? you like the person they like you, you respect each other, everything is okay but you have had thoughts of breaking up. not because you don’t like the person or they don’t like you or they treat you badly but because MAYBE it’s just a bad phase or you are not sure YET. 
(my answer to this is - NO it doesnt mean that but what are your thoughts?)

3. is having sex rarely a dealbreaker? let’s say you love the person so much, they are everything you have ever wanted in a person, you see a future with them, you want to have kids with them, you want to marry them BUT the only problem is - their sex drive is lower than yours. they think having sex once a week is enough but for you it’s not. what would you do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/myxjqi/can_you_develop_serious_feelings_if_you_havent/
