I tried to ask him if we could text a bit more in between dates (I’m aware this probably came off as needy, but I’m someone who is big on texting and it’s important to me). He told me he isn’t really a texter but that he would try texting me more. However, he didn’t. He really only texts to set up dates, which I’ve come to accept. He usually takes me out for drinks or to a hookah lounge in the evening typically around 8 PM and we’ll be out and about until 2 AM. After, we always go back to his or my place and have sex, and usually (4 out of the 6 times) spend the night with each other. He cuddles me, kisses me, and occasionally calls me pet names. He’s told me he likes falling asleep with me and cuddling me. He’s kissed me on the forehead and hugs me goodbye.

So I am in a little bit of a predicament and I would love peoples advice! Because I’m just not sure how to move forward. I will try and make it as summerized as possible while also give the main details. Okay here goes, soooo me (24F) and the guy I’m seeing (36M) met on tinder in February of 2020! We hit off so well right from the beginning, sexually and emotionally/ compatibility. Though, he had just broken up with his ex of 6 years 2/3 weeks prior of us meeting! Very intense. But he told me he had been emotionally checked out of the relationship for the past year or more and had just been getting up the courage to finally break it off after so long. So we agreed to be in a FWB situation because he obviously didn’t wanna be in a relationship again, but shared with me he doesn’t like seeing lots of people and just wants to find someone he connects well with. So he asked me to be exclusive FWB. I was hesitant at first because I was almost about a year from breaking off my previous relationship of 4 years so I could easily put myself in his shoes and respect how he felt. But I wasn’t sure if I was ready to be exclusively seeing someone, I was enjoying my freedom. But I decided to agree to exclusive fwb because I really liked his company and figured it would actually be healthy for me to simmer it down and focus on one person again, in a casual way.

More back story: his ex and him had a lease together so he agreed to let her keep the apartment til the lease is up and he will go stay with parents. That way he could also use this time to pay off some debt as well so it worked out for him. Anyways. Within like 2 weeks of us starting to see each other we became extremely connected very quickly. We have very similar lifestyles and get along GREAT. We communicate beautifully and seamlessly as well when it comes to day to day problem solving/ and saying how we feel. So we started working out together every day etc. and basically started acting like a couple. Except all the romantic things that come with being a couple of course. But we still go out together etc. he just doesn’t necessarily do romantic things or like take me on “dates”. 

So I am also young and living with parents currently, which means we both live in a compromised living space hahaha ahhhh and it feels like high school. Ugh. But! Oh boy oh boy the sex is ridiculous. Amazing. The most chemistry I’ve ever had with someone sexually and that’s (obviously) a huge basis of our relationship too. We both say we are having the best sex of our lives. 
So we did a lot of car fucking and then would try and get a room every 2 weeks or so to spend more time together etc. 

Long story short about 8 months down the road I express that we are super duper connected and basically a couple so why have we not become one yet? Again I was waiting and giving him loads of space. Never brought it up but in the back of my head I’m thinking like this does notttttt seem like any FWB situation at all. We are basically dating. And also exclusive remember! But I like him a lot so I went with it! I figured okay it’s only a matter of time before he asks to be his gf. But upon having that conversation he felt differently and his excuses were as follows:
1. I live at home and don’t feel like I’m in a place where I can offer a solid relationship. (Valid and I respect it if that’s the truth but I mean, you’re basically in one dude.) 
2. I don’t want to be committed. I’m enjoying my freedom and he very specifically said not freedom with seeing other people but freedom to not be obligated to what a relationship entails ( valid and I understand but again, it’s been 8 months of basically being in a relationship and he also went on to say that his ex is super jealous type, always asking where he is etc. I am not like that at all and have exemplified to him that I am nothing like her so I said if he and I were in a relationship you wouldn’t be dealing with those things it would be different, he still said he needed time ) 
3. He’s scared of what the ex will do if she finds out. She still possess his belongings which furnish the apartment she is staying in and also watching his dog until he gets a sufficient place to have the dog. So he’s scared she will take the dog or ruin his belongings. ( valid but if he really cared about that he could make a change to fix that issue)
Again I want to say I totally respect all of these things if they are truly his feelings but something just seems off based on how committed to me he actually has been so far. I would expect those things to come from someone I see maybe once a week and all we do is fuck, maybe sometimes do other things but we aren’t super committed to each other’s times and involved in each other’s lives so deeply. I actually have met his parents and did early on. It happened informally but now I actually run and manage his fathers retirement business for him! I know all of his family but here’s the other thing. He REFUSES to meet mine. His excuse for that is that he loathes meeting parents even if they are just his friends parents ans it’s been like that since high school and I believe him…but come on man. Grow up. 

So now we are at a year and 5 months of being exclusive with this guy apparently just as “fwb” 
He still refuses to meet my parents and I’m just about getting over it. But I REALLY REALLY REALLY like him and we are honeslty so perfect for each other in so many ways. I’m hanging on to that and hoping he will finally man up. Because a part of me doesn’t care what our label is, I’m just happy to have his company and share what I do have with him that’s why I’ve been around for so long now. But I’m at the point where I feel super ready for a relationship and I have so much love to give and I want to give it to someone, specifically him! 

When I bring it up he still says he doesn’t feel stable enough for a relationship. He says “I just need my own apartment again and my dog back and then things will be better” I’ve waited a year and a half for those things to happen! Why does he give me every reason to believe he wants to be in a relationship with me but actually doesn’t!!!! Should I wait and see if he comes around or tell him it’s time to lock me down or move on?  I’m soooooo sad about doing that cause again it will be like an actual breakup. We do lots of day to day thinfs together and I would miss that. But I also think maybe he needs to experience that and miss me a bit to realize what he’s missing. Idk. But I’m also scared of losing him. There is that part of me that wants to keep him locked down haha ;) and that’s why I haven’t tried to set an ultimatum.

Hope you're doing well! So I (24M) have never been in a relationship, or kissed a girl. I like to think that I don't look monstrous. I am pretty overweight, but it doesn't show as much as my weight measurement would supposedly indicate.

Many people I know have expressed without prompting on my end that I am a fun, intelligent and kind person, the extent to which I believe them varies from day to day though. This lack of dating and intimacy has been affecting me negatively for years as I do not have any other source of affection in my day to day life. I have been living away from my family for the past 7 years.

I tried dating apps, and put my best foot forward, using pictures and writing my bio with the help of multiple people, but after weeks of trying I never managed to speak to anyone on those apps. 

I don't lack in confidence, at least in everything not related to women, but seeing the complete and utter lack of interest from women in anything beyond friendship is utterly demoralizing. As everybody around me is constantly slipping in and out of relationships, I can't help but compare myself to them and end up at least a little envious. I also maintain a decent social life and I have a hobby or two on the side.

Instead of placing the blame on others, I'd like to look inwards and see what part of that is manifesting outwards and keeping women uninterested.

I'm having this problem with my neighbor.

 I moved to my apartment a few months ago &amp; met my neighbor when he brought a package to me that went to his building instead of mine. a few days went by &amp; I saw him again coming home from work. I'm not exactly a social butterfly, &amp; I'm really nervous/shy. So I'm not big on small talk without getting uncomfortable fast. It's been months since this happened, but in, April I was taking some bags out my car &amp; saw him again. He asked if I needed help. I genuinely did not need help lol. He stayed by my car &amp; said ""I know I never asked but...do you have a man"" I said ""no, I don't"". Then he sadly replied ""We should chill sometime""


I ""chill"" all the time in the comfort of my own home, I'm good. That was what I said to him. 


I don't accept chill as a form of going or hanging out. It translates over to I just wanna hookup. So that was that. Few weeks go by, I see him here and there. Last few days I've been seeing him alot more than usual, either checking the mail, coming in the parking lot as he's taking his garbage out. Yesterday he came to my door. I opened it and he told me happy fourth. He asked if I'm watching the fireworks tonight and I said no. He asked what was I doing and I said I'm making bags &amp; finishing some sketches. He said ""do you need help?"" I said no, have a good night &amp; closed the door.



Idk why I feel bad but idk how to stop personalizing the behavior. I always see it as a red flag when a guy just wants to hang out instead of actually going out. And it's not just him, even with dating most of the time for me, the guy never wants to date, only Netflix and chill. I'm not dating or messing around right now. Trying to work on my self esteem and self worth. But I'm starting to think that I'm not physically attractive, &amp; men who only want to chill just want to sleep around and not actually take me seriously as anything other than someone to sleep with.


Idk if it counts for anything, but I am fat. I'm 5'4, 190, I usually have my hair braided or in an afro, I'm brown skin. I dress normally I guess you could say? Lol. I mostly wear graphic tees, jeans, leggings, when I work I wear scrubs. I'm not girly though. I don't skirts, heels, dresses etc, I was way lighter last year, I gained alot of weight during covid. Guys NEVER approach me in person, and it's been taking a toll on my self esteem. Why am I only good enough to chill with, what's wrong with me? I'm very kept to myself, I mostly go to work and go home. I started eating cleaner and started going to the gym last month, I haven't yet saw any results, but it still makes me really sad to know that he just wants to see me in a chill setting and not a dating setting. He's never even asked for my number. Is it because I'm not pretty enough to date? I'm really wondering. 


Most of the time I feel like the female that guys just wanna sleep with, not the female that guys wanna date and take seriously. But after deciding to focus on just work and my mental/emotional health, I haven't been dating. I deleted all my socials including the dating profiles. I just feel so cheap and not good enough when I'm only viewed as the woman to sleep with. I don't think it's my vibe or I give off any weird energy. I'm pretty soft spoken, really bubbly, kept to myself etc. How do I stop feeling like I'm the problem? I know it's not personal, but when it happens repeatedly it feels as if it is.

We went to his apt and after talking to each other non stop, we started talking about his profession (pharma) and we found out we were both psychedelic heads.
We both took micro doses and we had laughs, deep conversation, and non stop sex in-till 4 am.

We feel asleep and woke up, he kept trying to look into my eyes and tell me how beautiful I was. I said I had to go but he was asking me to stay a little bit. I initiated sex again, then I went to take a shower, he followed me in. On my way out he for a kiss goodbye but I was half way out of the door. 

We didn’t really text a lot before, and I was okay with it because my days were pretty packed and I wouldn’t use my phone all day.

Now it’s Monday- and I haven’t heard from him. That’s answer enough to know he doesn’t like me enough. I have a feeling he goes through a lot of girls as he had a drawer full of sex toys.

I feel like I was used only for sex, and I think I should just stop trying to find companionship. I feel so much regret as of now.

I deleted his number and contact, I know when a guy likes you he at least texts you if you came home safe, but I guess not.

I guess in better terms, how does one look for someone or at least have some success?

I'm 23, male, never had a girlfriend, and mostly just an average guy. I've always been shy and socially awkward. I've been trying to come out of my shell more and more and talk to people while in college and at my job. So working on that, I go to the gym, I'm physically fit for the most part, little chubby around the belly but good everywhere else. I'm not an ugly guy, but I'm not Tom Cruse or Chris Evans when it comes to looks. So like I said I'm an average guy.

With that being said, I'm not depressed or sad about the fact I've never had a relationship or girlfriend. I'm at the point where I'm ready to settle down and start a family and whatnot, which doesn't happen overnight. I've tried different dating apps: Tinder, Bumble, Facebook's dating thing, etc.. I'd get matches but the conversations just end up fizzling out. I do my best to keep them alive and going but the other person just won't reply. So no clue if I'm doing something wrong or not. The same thing would happen if I try to talk to someone at a restaurant or if I'm out and about. I'm talk to them, find something of interest I know a great deal about, and then the conversation never really goes much farther then that.

I don't really have much social interactions with people growing up since I lived a pretty sheltered life being homeschooled. Never had any childhood friends or went to school with people. I did some reading and try to be myself when talking with someone and follow the points buuuut nothing get's off the ground or becomes anything.

TLDR: An average 23yr old who has trouble making conversations with girls. Lived a sheltered life and has tried several dating apps to meet people. I work fulltime and have have my own home and everything. Any advice on making conversations seem more interesting or at least get replies back.

So like we're traditional but not traditional to the point of having arranged marriages ok?

We (mainly our parents) value education, status, money (sadly) – as it is a sign of power, and other superficial things like that. Of course, OBVIOUSLY, good character, respectfulness, moral values, etc are also very important but those other things are just as equally important. These are traits and characteristics women (men too but more so women) and their friends and families look out for when finding a suitable partner. All this makes it nearly impossible for women from my culture living here in The West to find a ""suitable"" guy that meets all that criteria because guys like that who live here are very much accustomed to American life and don’t choose to settle down until late 30’s-early 40’s, leaving my only options at this age, 40 year old guys who are ready to marry in 6 months to a year after meeting. Which is not what I “desire”.

I know these are some common things in American culture but just imagine what you all go through and then times it by a million, that’s how my culture is.

Now, I grew up very American too. I’ve had my fun like any normal American teenager/young adult. I’ve had bfs, relationships, gone on dates, did all that but I didn’t feel ready for a relationship that would lead to marriage until I’d say 28. And I started to see how my dating pool, based on my culture/family standards and the dating culture of America, was not what I “desired”. I had no interest in settling down with some guy in his late 30’s+ who’s just looking to wife anybody. I kind of have a wild side to me, I’m not gonna lie. I desired younger, more care free men and I could easily get these guys’ attention but I kept telling myself no no you’re getting older you have to settle down and marry as is expected of you.

I just recently moved out on my own. I used to live at my parents’ up until 2 weeks ago (very common thing for someone my age in my culture). Anyways I feel so free. I have a very good job and I’m going back to grad school so eventually I’ll be making even more and ok I’ll be honest, I also have wealthy parents too so I don’t think money will ever be an issue for me. Meaning money is the reason I would need to partner up with someone.

When I think about what I want from a guy, I think of someone who I can have fun with like just be silly and go on adventures and have lots of sex, gooood sex. Not boring marital sex. Someone I can be vulnerable with but not dependent on. I want my own life, my own freedom and he also has his. We’re monogamous but we’re not prisoners stuck in a relationship or marriage.

Idc what anyone is about to say about how “I just haven’t met the right person” because 

EVERY MARRIED COUPLE I KNOW IS MISERABLE AF.

Ok maybe not completely miserable but idk I don’t see true happiness in majority of the couples I talk to. Or even their interaction with each other gives me weird vibes. Keep in mind I mainly am thinking of examples in my own culture. Like all the girls who settled for the ""well-off doctors who are 10-15 years older"". Like I sense the suffocation in their faces lol.

So here is my issue.

I was running errands at the mall last week and I saw this guy at Nordstrom, he worked there. He was so cute, he made feel excited in a way I haven’t felt in a very very long time. You know being stuck inside for a year and then before that most of my dating was done online, I missed that feeling of seeing someone cute in person and getting butterflies for them. Anyways, I couldn’t stop looking at him. I was at customer service resolving an issue I had with an order, he was helping another customer but he eventually left that area so I decided to ask his co workers if he’s single and how I think he’s so cute and they were all so eager to set me up with him. I gave the girl my ig and told her to tell him to add me. My order issue had to be escalated with another manager, so I was there for quite some time (it was eventually resolved for anyone wondering lol). This guy eventually came back to that area and the girl who was assisting me previously pulled him aside and I’m assuming she was updating him on what I had told her because when he came back, his demeanor was different, he kept looking over at me. Anyways like I said my order issue was eventually resolved and I left. He requested to follow me as soon as I left the store and messaged me  asking me out.

I’m so conflicted. I think this guy is so adorable and I went on his Instagram page, we totally have similar vibes. He’s artistic, he's stylish, creative but all I keep thinking is how my mom is going to be like “you’re dating a guy that works at Nordstrom?????” or my friends will be with their professional bfs/husbands and view who I’m with as a loser or a low life. These are stupid thoughts that have been put into my head my whole life. I come from an extremely judgmental culture and family that has turned me into a judgmental person as well to the point where I even judge my own decisions.

I don’t know what to do? Like where is this going to? I feel like even if I go out with him and date him or whatever I’m just going to have to call it quits one day right? I will eventually have to marry someone “suitable” AKA be miserable. I feel like well what’s the point then? Why delay that process, why not just do it now that I’m young and have a better chance of ending up with someone who’s just slightly cringe and not absolutely horrid.

I have no one to talk to this stuff about. I literally cannot confide in anyone in my life about any of this. I have today off work and just relaxing and anytime I have downtime, my brain just goes all over the place. I enjoy working for this very reason, because I don’t think about my own life and problems.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,880233,public,self,I (30F) have a hard time choosing between what I truly want and what my family/culture wants for me.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oeker0/i_30f_have_a_hard_time_choosing_between_what_i/,all_ads,6,,

1. She compared me to her ex right off the bat.
2. It seemed like the fact she was liking me scared her
3. When I tried to kiss her at the end she kind of freaked out and told me she has ""intimacy issues""

I've never actually had a girlfriend/tried to date someone, only drunk hookups, but I've been wanting to recently so I've been putting myself out there. I don't really even know what intimacy issues means so it seemed kinda confusing to me how she could freak out when I made a move after it seemed like we were getting along so well.

I’m very friendly and great at making people laugh and so far I believe everyone really likes me. This one girl is really cute and nice and she has shown some signs of attraction?

I’m pretty extroverted and fit/buff so I have had some really positive interactions with some female customers and all my co workers are women strangely enough.

She is my best friend for the last 4 years. While I always liked her I gave up on her as girlfriend material about 2 years ago after I found out she was not ready at all. Now, 2 years later we are still good friends. She have grown a lot and I think I have too. Our latest meetings have been moving more and more over in a grey area where I am not sure if we are just friends or dating anymore. Some examples are that she suggested we were on a date a few weeks ago while buying bubble tea. I didnt think too much about it then. But she also offered me to try her bubble tea which surprised me and I was like..... Ok...? Thats some gf/bf stuff. The people walking by must have thought we were completely together. Then she started walking slower when we hang out and walking really close. And the kind of activities she invites me on is different than usual. And she often pays for more than her part. Then this weekend we went bowling. I was picking up a little on the flirting game and touched her hands, back, shoulders, knee, feets. I locked eyes with her several times and she looked down after maybe 2 seconds or so. So I touched her face and lips actually. She seemed turned on. She put a hand on my shoulder while telling me some sort of story. I locked eyes with her for probably 5 seconds and wanted to kiss her but didnt because it seemed crowded and so on. So I dont think I can doubt that she likes me anymore. I just feel like I have been so slow at puzzling it together. I feel like I should invite her out again as soon as possible so this doesnt fizzle out. She is generally pretty bad at initiating things so I have to ask her. She is avaiable almost always. So this weekend maybe? I am so overthinking this right now. I just have to go for a damn kiss. Even if I for some reason are stupid as fuck and misinterpreted all the over the top signals over the last weeks/months and she rejects me, we are still friends and I can move on with life like nothing even happened.

I divide it into context, what happened recently, and the question. You could skim over the context if you don't feel like reading all.

I have been talking to a girl from Brazil that I met online on discord (I'm from Canada) for two months now. She has given so many mixed signals, and it was very confusing. Below are some of the signals that she either considered or considers me as a potential partner, and that she potentially likes- and the mixed signals being she either wants to distance herself from me or she sees me as a friend. I appreciate any help in decoding what these could mean and understanding her, but not only her but also how girls generally behave or how to read girls.

**The context:**

* *After the first day we met, she was the one to ask if she can call. She also asked for my phone number in the call. Before closing the call, she said ""I like you already."" She also said despite your age (I'm 23, she's 25) you act very maturely- usually guys mature later.*
* *The next day, she called without asking and she was drunk on her bed. She asked if I had a girlfriend. I said no and I never did, and she was surprised, and also said ""that's better, I like it"" She also asked if I would still be talking to her if I had a girlfriend. I said depends on my girlfriend's comfort level and boundaries. She also said unlike other guys you have opinions and can talk about deeper subjects.*
* *She asked for my instagram.*
* *She used hearts in texts, did kisses before closing the calls.*
* *All of our calls were video calls.*
* *We watched many movies together, which I consider to be somewhat of an intimate/romantic activity and would not do with girls I have no interest in.*
* *She picked all of the movies, and she said ""you have to watch this with me, you cannot say no"" - she was assertive, which showed she really wanted to watch them with me*
* *There was one period where we did not talk for a considerable time (3 weeks), and it was when her mom got covid. - we still texted though. During this time she asked to watch movies but kept rescheduling them. She only told about covid after she rescheduled/delayed a few times. And she was apologetic for not connecting. However, refer to this point after you read 'then this happened' - it may also have to do with that, maybe.*
* *In general, she is a very busy person who works two jobs (TA and private tutor) and is doing her master's full time. Plus she's dealing with her parents going through a divorce while still living with them. Yet despite being busy, she is devoting considerable time to me.*
* *She initiated most of the calls we had.*
* *Multiple times she said she missed me, and whenever I said I missed you too, she would always say something along the lines of no don't lie, and I would always tell her she is being too suspicious of people.*
* *The day she met me she posted an instagram reel saying 'oh no I hope I don't fall' - this might be a total coincidence.*
* *One time she said ""start to practice your Portuguese"" and she named the places she wants to take me to in Brazil.*
* *She sometimes sends me songs she sings. When I told her having someone in the household that signs or play instruments would be nice, she sang me another song saying ""So they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me"" - this may or may not be a coincidence.*
* *She asked me to read her a specific poem in my native language (Turkish)*
* *After the first few weeks, she started calling me a friend.*
* *Recently on June 26 when she was drunk she sent me a voice message saying ""I like you, okay? You're a good person."" - and the next morning she said ""sorry for the drunk messages""*
* *On June 30 also recently (the fact that these are recent is important for the reason I'll give you), she said about a photo of mine ""Ooh, look at youu, you're so cuute""*

*· I am also attaching a chart of when we talked for context in case it is of use.*

**Then this happened:**

On Sunday July 4th, she told me that she is dating another guy- two months in after we started talking. But she also said she is not very happy with the relationship. In fact, she said she felt happier when he went on vacation for two weeks than when he was with her- primarily because he does not respect her boundaries and it makes her feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately, she thinks she is not normal for having stricter boundaries and thinks she has to tolerate it and live with it. So she is saying she is not sure if he is the right person for her. She started talking with him two days before she met me. May 4. In June, she saw him physically for the first time - she does not remember the date (they met online, he's Brazilian).

**The question:**

So all of this is a bit confusing. I don't know what she feels towards me. As a guy, I would not be talking to a girl 1x1 and watching movies, spending this much time, and doing things that might be considered flirtatious if I had a girlfriend. She said her date is aware that she talks to me. There were multiple times she said she is frustrated and wants to have an active sex life. I understand that, and respect that. After all, I think it's unfair to expect her to not date anyone especially if we are long distance and it is difficult to meet physically. But I just don't know, and struggle to understand where I fit and struggle to understand her actions. I also don't understand why she did not tell me about him for so long while giving me confusing signals. So I am asking for some decoding of her, especially from other girls. Because to me it is full of confusion and mixed signals. Even if this goes nowhere, I want some insight so I can understand girls better in my next endeavours.

Any help or opinion is appreciated. Thank you! :)
