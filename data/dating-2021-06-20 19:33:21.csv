0,o4j078,1624235638,Rejected twice - need advice.,"Now Reddit, don’t get me wrong here, I know what’s best to do in this situation and I’m already on it.

Here’s the story: I’ve worked with a girl with whom I’d casually chat with at work. I could feel that there were vibes between us and I’ve asked her out last year.

We had a total of three dates and I’ve made literally ZERO move on her being afraid and stuff. On our last date I told her that I liked her which is where I got rejected softly. She said it’s more of no than yes situation but still wanted to stay friends. 

Me knowing that I had liked this girl too much declined this offer and said to her to contact me if she changed her mind.

9 months have passed without any direct messages or calls between us but here is what was happening: She was seeing almost all of my Facebook stories and a few times she even reacted to my stories and my new pictures (like 4-5 times during this 9 months)

This year she posted happy birthday on my timeline and since I couldn’t do it on hers I just texted her phone.

Here’s the interesting thing: I casually do voice acting and this May I’ve posted a video and she directly replied to my story asking which microphone I was using. I was busy so I answered her like 3-4 hours later. Then she asked what software I was using. After answering she said that she was using it as well and I just put like emoji on her text and that’s it.

Surprisingly week later I was doing a web design of a workplace she works currently and she replied to me “Whaat?” and we have exchanged a few texts and this time I did ask her out and she agreed. I told her that I was bad at city map and pick a place (bad idea)

She had to contact me a week after for a place idea but she never did nor texted anything.

I waited a day and texted her if I could call and she replied in like 10 seconds saying yes.

After calling I did say it was bad that we couldn’t meet and set a definite time and said I would find a place - she agreed.

Which brings us to the finale - Today we went to cafe ordering two iced coffee and a pizza, nothing fancy.

We did catch up on this blank space, I have never mentioned our past dates since I wanted a fresh start. 
I couldn’t catch any quiet place since the people are all out so after our dinner we went to a park where she gave a book gift to her friend and we bailed from there. 
On our way out to the bus stop I knew I was running out of time so I casually offered holding hands on which she said she didn’t want to. This hit me very hard but managed to keep walking. 
Since I became quiet she said if I wanted to say anything I could say to which I said that I had a totally different expectations but her denying my hold hands offer gave me a good idea. 
She said “you know it’s not up to me” and she said that she thought I would change my mind after all this time.
I said that the things don’t work like that. I told her “you know where to contact me if anything changes” and left her at a bus stop - I walked until the next stop now with headphones in my ear.

I just feel like a fool falling for the same girl but after all I’ve never met someone with more in common.

Am I going to text her or anything? Heck no. I will keep no contact but it just stings so hard now since my feelings have been awaken.

I would love to hear if you have ever ended up with someone who rejected you in past and - thank you for reading this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4j078/rejected_twice_need_advice/

Hello Reddit, looking for some advice on where to go next 

So I matched with this girl on Hinge, we started talking on Monday we have somewhat similar interests, like we're also both trainee teachers and quite similar in general. My issue and reason for writing this is I have no idea if she's interested or not. Conversations with her are mixed and her responses are a bit dead a lot of the time she is busy as she works a lot. The thing is with this she responds really quick sometimes even seconds after I've sent a message. I asked her if she wanted to meet up tomorrow, she told me a few days ago she finished at 2, so I asked her and she said she'll let me know but it felt like one of those where you know we're not meeting up tomorrow. 

Thing is with what I've just said, she's told me that she is looking for a relationship but she did recently get cheated on so I'm not sure how to proceed with this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4j453/mixed_signals/

8,o4jhb3,1624237303,I [25F] Deepy regret dating men on personality/interest compatibility instead of physical attraction. I wish people would stop telling women that they don’t need robust sexual attraction to their partners for happiness.,"I want to share my perspective here so that I can see where others stand and perhaps provide a counterweight to the countless advice for women to “give ugly men a chance”. I’ve just come out of a year-long phase of dating men based on their personality/interest compatibility despite their less than ideal physical attractiveness, in and out of the periodic lockdowns from corona. My friends advised me on this, because I hooked up for a while with a very beautiful guy with whom I had nothing in common and was left unsatisfied. 


I decided to listen to them and go out with a string of men whom I was not as physically attracted to but shared many common interests with me and could talk to me. Now after a while, I did develop some sexual attraction towards them. The emotional connection did make me want to sleep with them more than I had initially. Sometimes the sex was good enough to make me think a relationship was possible. But now, I deeply regret it. 


I realize that after a while, I grew very cranky towards these men. I was a lot less willing to please them during sex. Every time I contemplated my desire for them, it was like a mental exercise, instead of something natural that just came to me. 


For instance, I met this guy who was overweight but nice, interesting and charming, and while I did want to have sex with him to some degree, I did not care to blow him to completion, which was a breeze back when I had sex with a good-looking dude. The task itself was a chore. Looking at him gave me very little mental pleasure. I got tired very soon and was not into it for any reason other than I wanted to please him. I think he was pissed at me afterwards. I felt like I was very bad at sex. 



Now after my year long experiment, I can feel myself bursting with desire to touch, kiss and bury myself into a beautiful man. And I can’t help feeling angry with the men I slept with during this year, even though I KNOW its not their fault. I cannot imagine settling in a relationship where the physical attraction is not robust. The whole women are not visual thing is just a myth tbh. 


I remember from the age of 10, I started watching sports just to gawk at guys, it was as natural as watching porn for men, yet women aren’t visual? Because of this myth, so many straight men just REFUSE to groom themselves at all, believing that it isn’t important to women. Just having the right haircut can really improve your sex life, not only when you’re dating around, but also already in a long-term relationship. 

Anyway, sorry for my rant.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4jhb3/i_25f_deepy_regret_dating_men_on/

12,o4jpzy,1624238176,Post date loneliness,"Was in a 2 year excellent relationship and ex broke up with me due to LDR. I started to connect with a few girls on hinge in Dec and met up with 3 of them which only 1 reciprocated back. First actual in person meetup was back in March so roughly 3 months post breakup, but these in person meet up never ended with anything serious on my end and communication ended there. This one girl, however, we stopped communication between Feb - June and she surprisingly reached out to me and we started to chat again and met up the first time 2 days ago. I really enjoyed getting to know her and later that night I asked her to meet up on sunday for a community event to check out.

We met up for the 2nd time today. I really enjoyed my sunday morning as she had to leave for another appointment. I headed back home and started to cook my week day meals. After cooking I started to feel a bit lonely and kept thinking how I should make my next move and/or wait for her to make the next move and see if she initiates a hangout/date with me next week (upcoming days). 

I am feeling a bit lonely as I want to chat her up through out the days, but I don't want to scare her away and show up as a creep or being clingy. I know enough to respect her boundary and space, but I guess I want to see her face again and to talk to her.

Does anyone else feel this way too at times? Extremely happy during the hangout/date and then many hours later feel a bit lonely? Maybe I just need to get out and get some sunshine?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4jpzy/post_date_loneliness/

She calls me everyday and talks like we are a couple checking on me to see if I am with other females even tho she said she is not looking for nothing serious because of nursing school. We usually meet around her area. Last weekend was the first time us meeting since April and we were heavily making out and feeling on each other. She claims she is always busy even though she was off from school for three weeks in May and we didn’t meet once because she was getting ready for her one week trip to Mexico with her parents and when she came back she said she was exhausted and getting mentally prepared for the next semester,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4jrn7/is_she_having_sex_with_someone_else/

He was also sweet and seemed really nice studying to be a paramedic and everything. 

These two other guys clearly just want me for me sex and aren't like objectively better looking but their disregard for me and how little they care about me weirdly turns me on? I find myself wanting them even though they're clearly not good for me. 

And it's like with the ones who are nice when they express interest or do things to show that they care I find myself feeling even more distant from them.

The reason this has happened to me is because I was isolated to my house from age 18-28 due to a health condition that I couldn't control.  Because I wasted away indoors I have no social skills, anxious in social settings, I don't know how to talk to people and I'm always miserable even when I'm doing fun things.  Now when I do get matches online the conversation dies because of the reasons I've previously mentioned and because I'm inexperienced I have no game I have a fear of showing any form of sexual attraction or lack of know how to display it over text.  I cant get dates because of the social problems and depression but the longer I stay single the more it's mentally messing me up which just makes the problem I already have even worse.

24,o4knmq,1624241448,"Boyfriend (18m) yelled at me (18f) a few days ago, and I haven't been able to move on from it","Alrighty so my boyfriend and I have been dating for around 9 months, and our relationship is generally happy and healthy. We fight sometimes, of course, as everyone in a relationship does, and we fought a couple of days ago. It's not the worst fight we've had, but maybe ""top 3"" I guess.

Basically, we'd planned a fun Saturday together where drive out to a few different fun department stores to buy our dads some stuff for father's day, and then come back to my house to eat some of our favourite food and watch a movie he's been wanting to show me for forever. However, when he came over to my house, immediately I saw that he was in, not necessarily a ""bad"" mood, but just a kinda unhappy, disgruntled one. He starting sad-complaining about how it was raining and how his rain poncho had ripped a bit on his way over and how he was tired, etc. I kinda took his face in my hands and said something along the lines of ""it's okay! we'll still have a fun day and we're gonna make the best of it, right?"" and he responded, ""yes"".

So, we drove to our first store and I started looking around for stuff to buy, and I guess I was kind of focussed on shopping for something because apparently I was giving one worded responses every time he talked to me (I didn't notice this, and it was not intentional). Suddenly he was walking in different areas of the store than me and not talking to me when I tried to ask something. Finally I asked, ""are you okay? what's wrong? did I do something"", and he refused to respond. I got pretty upset at this point because we've had many conversations about the fact that if one of us is upset at the other, and we directly ask them to want to work it out, you should be responding, not just ignoring them completely. So, I got mad, but I was really trying to still not let my temper get the best of me, and just carried on, after asking him a few times if he wanted to talk about whatever was bothering him (no response).

A few hours pass, and we're okay at this point, but still haven't talked about what happened. So, when we were maybe 10 minutes from my house, I asked him if he wanted to talk about what happened. He said that he felt ignored and that his feelings were being ignored the ""first time"". He was referring to when he came to my house and it had felt like what I said (""it's okay! we'll still have a fun day and we're gonna make the best of it, right?"") was brushing off what he was feeling upset about, but he was only referring to this incident as ""the first time"", so I thought he was talking about when he was ignoring me in the store. So I said, ""then why didn't you tell me that instead of ignoring me? did you want to make me feel ignored as well?"". I don't remember super clearly what happened after this but I repeated the question after he kinda dodged it, and then he yelled at me about how he ""knew it was stupid to do that and why did I have to keep bringing it up"" and some other things. I was only asking ""then why didn't you tell me that instead of ignoring me?"" twice because he wasn't answering me, and I was confused. This was not said aggressively, or patronisingly, it was genuinely me trying to talk him through that. Anyways, it ended with me basically sobbing all the way home while driving, and him just sitting there.

The difference between me and him, is that when I get mad and he starts crying, my heart breaks and all my anger melts away and I feel so bad and hug him and try to figure it out without anger in the mix. He did not do that. It feels like when he's angry, he shuts off or ignores me or ""runs away"" (not literally), and when I'm angry all I can think about is trying to solve the stupid problem *with* him, and trying to comfort him when I've said something idiotic in my anger.

We got home I took us to my room and just laid on my bed crying while he sat in a couch chair. I didn't tell him to go away, even though he asked if that's what I wanted right then, because I don't like being able to just ""run away"" when there's a problem, and I felt like having him leave would extend the bad feelings for longer and just make it worse and I would regret having to reach out over text or something later in the night.

He finally told me what he meant by the ""firs time"", and I apologised and explained that I didn't mean to make him feel like I was ignoring his feelings. He said he was sorry for raising his voice and he didn't want to hurt me like that. After a while, we carried on with the rest of our night.

I admitted the next day when he asked what was wrong that I was still upset about the day before, and I don't know if I should let him know still that I'm still upset about what happened or not because I don't know if there's anything he can do.

I felt yelled at and then unloved (through his anger, and this isn't the first time I've felt that when he's angry at me) when he didn't try to make it better until he was bored with sitting in his chair. Or maybe he just wanted time to think and didn't want to push me too much by trying to bother me when I was crying. I don't know. Is there something different I should be doing?

I wanna text him without any meaning. Like to just talk even if i have nothing to say and just scared it will be an empty conversation. But i don't wanna be like on him to much so he gets annoyed. But i also don't want too not text so i seem not interested. I think I never really feelt this way for anyone my whole life.
Im worried he'll match and meet some other girl. Im worried he will just not be interested anymore. And I know I can't kontroll what he desided. Whatever he desides I will be fine with. Cause it's his life. But im getting really anxious and sad about the whole situation. 

How do i stay in contact with him whiteout seeming not interested or to much interested? And how do I handle all this overthinking and anxiety?

43,o4mzez,1624249573,There is hope!,"I (30F) have been a long time lurker here and have seen a lot of frustration from many posters about the state of the dating world and all of the negatives associated with online dating specifically. I don’t deny that dating just totally sucks sometimes and it can feel so empty and hopeless after meeting or chatting with person after person with no spark or no potential to develop anything deep or meaningful with. I definitely have felt that way at times. But I just wanted to send a bit of encouragement that things aren’t always as hopeless as they seem. Sometimes it just takes a little bit of a perspective change (along with some persistence!) I had been on so many awful dates and had so many boring dead end conversations that I truly started to believe that I’d either die alone or settle for something that was just a bad fit. However, about a year ago I matched with a guy accidentally (i.e. I accidentally swiped right) who was outside the arbitrary parameters I had set for myself and what I thought would make for good partner material, whatever that meant. He started chatting with me and for some reason we exchanged numbers. I still can’t remember exactly how that happened. But he wasn’t my type and I knew it, so I was non-committal about meeting (because I’m the worst) and let the conversation fizzle out. Fast forward 6months after that and what do you know, we cross paths in real life and have some small insignificant interaction. I found myself surprised at how much more interesting he came across as in person and worked up the courage to text him an apology for essentially ghosting him (amazingly I still had his number saved.) I wasn’t even sure if he realized we had matched in the past or even recognized me at all. He did. 

We’ve now been dating for 6mo and just can’t get enough of each other. I can’t believe I almost missed out on him because I had decided that he wasn’t “my type”based on 5 bad pictures and a “boring profile.” He now deservingly teases me about it every chance he gets and I’m sure will never let me live it down. 

Essentially, my point is that the universe was kind to me and gave me another chance even though my narrow-mind didn’t deserve it...and I am so thankful for that. So chin up! There is hope!

I have only had one relationship that lasted for 2 years, the first months we were together in Brussels cause we met while I was on my exchange year during college, afterwards I came back and we kept it long distance until we just came to the conclusion it was not meant to be. After we broke up I just have never clicked with anyone and they just seem boring, only looking for sex or snobs. 
Last week I had to travel to Houston for the week, and I went on dating apps, I chatted with this one guy and we met on the day before I had to leave. He is also from Mexico, but lives in Houston, and is originally from the northern part of Mexico.
We met at a mall where I was with some friends shopping, and I left them to meet him there, we had coffee and had an amazing time together. Later that day after my friends left, we met again and went to a bar and had such an amazing evening again, we both even said that it was amazing how much we clicked and even joked about how I should call him to be my plus one for this wedding I’ll go to next year (from one of the friends I was traveling with). The last day I was in Houston we also met and went for lunch together before I had to leave for the airport and promised we would stay in touch. 
We have each other in all social media now, and we have texted a bit since I’m back. Also, there’s a small chance that I could be transferred to Birmingham, Alabama in September for work. It would still be 8 hours to drive to Houston from there, but it would be an improvement. 
I’m being honest that I don’t even remember clicking this much with my ex even in the beginning, and I loved him a lot were even thinking I would move to Belgium to live together. This new guy also felt the same, we even called it an anomaly.
I’m definitely no stranger to long distance relationships, but I just wonder if it could even be viable, having met for only 2 days. How could I even keep the momentum going through text if we don’t know each other for so long?

About 3 months ago I (24f) met this guy (28m) on tinder and we got along pretty well. He told me he wasn’t looking for hookups, that he was looking for friends. I wasn’t looking for hookups either so I thought we could be friends. 

Since very early he started acting very flirty, caring, and overall very interested,lm shy so it took me a little to warmup to him, but then I kinda started liking him. After ~ 2 months he started acting hot and cold. At first I was confused by his mixed signals so I gave him and I time until  I talked  to him about it. I told him that sometimes I felt like we were friends, some others that there was something else, and sometimes that he was talking to me when it was convenient to him.

He told me that he valued my friendship, that he was sorry for sending mixed signals and that he wasn’t ready to start dating again (which I understood). He also apologized for reaching out again, and said that he understood if I didn’t want to be his friend.  I just liked his last response.

2 weeks have passed and he reached out to me again. He first reacted to one of my ig posts and then when I posted a picture about my hair on my story he sent it to me saying it looked really good. 

What’s up with him? 


Pss: In these past 2 weeks he also posted a video with a girl and supposedly he didn’t have many girl friends because he is pretty new to the area.

53,o4nk4q,1624251771,Developing an attachment to the wrong person,"I just started my new job at the hospital last week and been training with this amazing guy who happened to be my preceptor. At first I was really nervous that I wouldn’t focus and that I would feel nervous with him because I did feel attracted towards him. However, I was actually able to separate my feelings and focus on the job. I did amazing with him and he continuously kept giving me great feedback. Ive learned a lot from him and broke walls that made me feel uncomfortable. I got out of my comfort zone with him in a lot of situations. However, I think along the way, I did develop feelings for him. When I was saying goodbye to him on the last day he was training me, I walked away feeling so heavy and sad. I hate to say this but I also actually have been crying a lot. I developed such high emotions for someone who will not be anything more than a work buddy. I don’t think I’m his cup of tea. I just have to break this attachment that I developed towards him. It’s all my fault. I don’t know how this happened. I feel like I’m in a whole mess of emotions

I feel that the attachment/type of comfort I had with him was something I lacked with all the people I’ve dated in the past. I don’t have any kind of romantic relationship with anyone in my life right now. What I had with him is something I lack in my life. Just the great/supportive person he is. The type of relationship I had with him is something that makes me thrive. I feel sad that he can’t be anything more. And I won’t even be able to see him that much anymore at work.

One more thing too, I did have an experience with a previous instructor who was very very toxic. She made me feel like I wasn’t enough and just made everything so challenging. But with him, my experience was the exact opposite. He made me feel the exact opposite my previous instructor made me feel. He made me feel like I was good enough and acknowledged my efforts.

That’s why I think he played a big role in this new stage of my life. I keep thinking of him and the memories we’ve made in the short period of time we worked together. It’s so hard wanting something you cannot have. It truly does feel like a heart break.

I have tons of experience, lots of examples, and its like, no, you're not it.

At that point I felt played and forgot about her, but since we have multiple common  friends I run into her quite often, and every time I do she say to her friend that I""m really cool, funny etc.. and she always ask when are we going out together.

Women and men aren't the same. They are different. They are very very different.

Now this is the obvious part. Here is the part that may trigger some of you.

Some people say that ""Women are humans just like us."" but this is not good in terms of dating advice. Yeah, may be they eat, shit, sleep like us but their mind works in a strange way. Their mind works in such a strange way that we can't fully understand them yet.

Now if you think, ""Oh! This guy is some sort of hippie who thinks he is having a revelation."" , just hold on.

Have you seen how guys react when caught cheating vs how girls react when caught cheating.

If a girl is caught cheating she will fake cry as if she didn't cheat and it was a sexual assault. Or worse she will blame YOU for her cheating.

And also have you seen the mind game girls play? Sometimes it seems beyond strange. Sometimes their acting performance looks Oscar-worthy. And I'm not even joking.

Anyway, I won't go into too much details. But ""Girls are humans just like us."", I don't buy into that idea.

They are just different.......way more different than we'd like to imagine. Don't make the mistake of thinking she's just another human being.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4o9ck/i_have_something_very_controversial_to_say_and_im/

Im tired of this idea that people seem to have that casual is better than building something with someone. I just want to meet a guy who isn’t lying to me when he says: “I’m a good guy and I deserve a chance”. Because I fell for that &amp; the second I wanted to give us a go so badly, he switched and wanted to be casual. &amp; I really liked him. 

Im tired. I just want to meet a guy who’s ready and wants me. Im a good person, I just want to build something special and cuddle while we watch movies and talk about each other’s lives.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4p8sz/its_always_you_deserve_someone_who_wants_to_be/

I’m a firm believer of doing things for yourself and not for the sake of dating but it really doesn’t change the sentiment much.

Dating is starting to feel like a drain on my time, energy, and money. I’ve always been the type of guy to avoid casual sex and instead focus on creating a real connection first (aka dating) but I’m starting to feel like I’d be better off if I just stopped dating and started having sex with these people who wanna fuck right away.

Honestly what the fuck even is dating anymore? Is it “oh I’m gonna swipe on my iPhone until i get 200 matches and then choose one person to schedule a date with and then flake on the date at the last minute”

Or maybe it’s “I’m gonna put myself out there and find some hobbies that I enjoy. If I meet someone I like, I’ll ask them out and see where it goes”

I mean really what is dating? I simply don’t get it. Is it “I’m not gonna try, it’ll fall into my lap when the time is right. And then once it does fall into my lap, I’ll lie about what I’m looking for until several months in and then get angry when we break up due to incompatibility”",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4pfll/do_you_feel_that_the_amount_of_effort_youve_put/

69,o4pv91,1624261389,Did I cross a line?," Hey,

I've been dating for 2,5 months with an amazing women. We spent tons of time together, do fun activities, I've met her friends and we have a great time overall. She just came back from a one week holiday with her two sisters during which we texted a lot and both missed each other tremendously. Yesterday was our first evening back together.

We agreed to meet at her place around the evening as she had a family dinner beforehand. I know she got drunk there as she texted me before her battery went out and we agreed to meet at 9 PM.

I had some delays and arrived at 9:20 PM. Nobody home.. Honestly, this was quite humiliating for me as I was super excited about seeing her all day, I made the effort to go to her place, and then to stand in front of a closed door is very disheartening. But most of all, I was worried. She was with her bike, drunk and she should have been home for quite some time already now.

My ex GF went missing for a full night a few years ago so my fight or flight response went active.

So the only thing I figured was to text her sister as I know she would be there. I haven't met her sisters yet and I know she doesn't discuss her dating life with them. But for me, seeing as I was worried, it made sense to text her and ask her if she was still at the party and if everything's OK. Her sister replied that she had just left and should be there within 15 minutes so luckily she showed up a bit later. She was also genuinely sorry and quite drunk.

However, when I told her that I had texted her sister, the mood changed. She felt really embarrassed and offended that I had done that, saying that she can take care of herself. She told me I'm putting pressure on her and basically at the end of the rant she was the victim of this whole situation. I truly feel different about this and I think my actions made sense with regards to the situation, or did I really cross a line here?

I realize I have put her in a difficult spot (I guess?) by contacting her sister but I would think that not showing up after 20 minutes and not having a charged phone is a valid reason to do so.

TL;DR: dating for 2,5 months, she was on holiday for one week, yesterday evening she didn't show up to our date, I texted her sister to see if everything was OK as I was worried, she got angry because I did that.

71,o4qdoi,1624263614,Realizing my ex is actually a bad person - A difficult thing to accept. WARNING ROUGH CONTENT,"ADVANCED WARNING there is some dark stuff here especially as you read further down. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can't even begin to go through everything I went through with my 25M, ex 25 F. We dated for nearly a year, I'd like to say I didn't see the red flags, but that'd be a lie, I saw them, I just ignored them. I have an old post talking about how I finally broke up with her  [https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/m4pobj/gf\_texted\_ps\_im\_drinking\_wine\_in\_your\_driveway/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/m4pobj/gf_texted_ps_im_drinking_wine_in_your_driveway/)   but this is really about what happened since then. It's difficult to even know what to type because so much is so personal. 

Well, the gist is she tried desperately to get me to take her back for about 3 weeks after we broke up and when that failed... she tried alternate means that resulted in us going no contact. About 2 months after that, I ran into her again, she flirted with me HARD and I wasn't mentally exhausted from her craziness anymore, she even seemed like she was doing better. She pulled me in, I got emotional, and then she stuck a knife in my heart as deep as she possibly could and twisted it. I guess when she realized I still loved her, she realized she could get some kind of revenge. 

The things she said, the things she did... I have never been in a place that dark before. For the first and only time in my life I considered self harm. I broke down crying to my friends, my parents were serious scarred for me. No one, has ever been able to hurt me like that.  I am doing better and started seeing a therapist, for those concerned. 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the past, I thought she was just crazy, after this I realized she was vindictive, petty, and venomous. I should've realized that a long time ago, there was plenty of past behavior to warn me about it. Somewhere in my face book messages if I scroll up far enough I can still find her text,'' I feel sorry for any woman that ever falls in love with you''. She sent that while she was still trying to get me to take her back, when I told her no. 

Following our grim ''reunion'', she has since sent me a threatening text, told a mutual friend her plans to mess with me, and once tracked me down and harassed me in public. Each time I ignored her and that seems to make her escalate. 

Even through all this I somehow didn't realize she was a bad person, bad to me, yes but just in general, no I didn't believe it. Idk why, I guess it's just hard to accept someone you love and dated for nearly a year is actually an awful person. But after what she did to a mutual friend, and what my therapist said it finally clicked. 

Our mutual friend recently got pregnant, unplanned one night stand and honestly probably not a good time but she's happy about it so I wish her the best. My ex told her she's unfit to be a mother, it'd be better if she miscarried, and she'd crash the car they were in to end it if she wasn't afraid they'd die too. They have been friends for over a decade and she said this too her. I told my therapist about it, and in the most casual tone he said that it did not surprise him. Based on everything he's heard about my ex through me it doesn't surprise him at all. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That was my light bulb moment, I just said some of the most awful evil crap imaginable about what my ex did, and it didn't even surprise him. I finally realized I dated a bad person.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4qdoi/realizing_my_ex_is_actually_a_bad_person_a/

A few days ago a friend of mine convinced me to use Tinder and maybe find a new love/hookup.
Im using it for a few dates and got some nice matches, the thing that i noticed is that 99% of them after awhile of chatting suggest that we talk on Instagram. When i text them the first thing they ask me is why i dont have any photos of myself. I try to explain that im not active on social media, never understood the concept of uploading photos of myself to Instagram/Facebook. I mainly follow tattoo artists there. After that its like i punched them in the face or somthing, they become cold and unfriendly. 
I mean, you saw the 5 photos of me on Tinder you liked what you saw, why is it so weird that i dont upload to Instagram? One of them even asked for a proof that im real(I sent her a photo of my tattoo on my arm) 
Im 24 years old, been in a relationship since the age of 19, i feel like so many changed.

We talked the entire time, about random things, topics on getting to know each other more, serious topics like previous relationships and opinions on kids and careers, and even started mentioning future plans with each other extending out 6+ months from now.So I guess my question now is what do we do from here? I feel a bit lost as I haven’t been this far in the dating process since my previous relationship ended. We have 2 more dates lined up this week already so we are keeping things moving in this regard. I just don’t want to get stuck on a stagnant texting 24/7 pattern of “hey how are you today” because we obviously feel more sparks when we are with each other in person.

85,o4ryr5,1624270633,Why can’t I get a girlfriend?,"So I’m a 22 year old straight man. And I’ve had 14 sexual partners in my life which is i think a bit above average for my age. I lost my virginity at a fairly young age (15). 
But I’ve never had an actually lasting relationship with a girl. I’ve “dated” 3 girls in my whole life where it was exclusive between me and the other girl. None of which have lasted longer than 4 months. I’ve learned from my mistakes in these relationships and I feel that in the first 2 I started to become too clingy once I started liking the girl. But in the 3rd and most recent one. I wasn’t clingy at all for the first 3-4 months. Then after spending X amount of time with the girl I started to warm up with her and then after that the relationship was over within 2 weeks. I just don’t get it. I’ve been called ugly many times throughout my life but I’ve also had many girls think I’m very attractive. Some of the girls I’ve had sex with are legit 9/10 or 10/10 in the looks department. But the thing I don’t understand is a lot of the time the really good looking girls almost seem like they regret having sex with me afterwards. Despite being told I’m good at sex by a couple girls. I’m about 5 ft 10 inches tall so I’m not a tall guy but not super short either. Decent height. I’ve got a good career and I’m ambitious. I work out a lot and I’m in very good shape. I don’t have many friends anymore only about 3 solid friends even though I used to have a lot more. But as I’ve gotten into my twenties a lot of my friendships have faded because they probably weren’t that real to begin with. A few months ago I went on a date with a girl off tinder. She was very attractive. Dressed nice. She had a good career also. We had dinner and some drinks. Had a really good time togethor and we had sex on the first night. This is the first actual date I’ve had in a long time with a girl I was genuinely into. I got my hopes up really quick because everything seemed so promising. And she lost interest in me after the first night pretty much. We had one more date After that and it just didn’t go well at all her attitude towards me was completely different and it was clear another guy had her attention. I recently messaged a girl on Instagram who I went to high school with but never really spoke to. I was attracted to her back then and even more attracted to her now judging by her pictures. She would like almost everything I post and I would like pictures of hers also. I took this as a sign of interest so I went for it. She replied to the first 2 messages and then stopped replying. I just don’t get it. What is it about me that girls just don’t like? Despite being told by many people that I’m very attractive and I know I’m a good person. I speak well and I’m fairly confident I feel. I dress good and I know there are much more awkward guys out there. I feel like I’ve had a hard time with women my whole life. A lot of the popular girls were mean to me in high school. Despite me never doing anything to them. I’ve reached a point in my life we’re I’m very lonely. More so than ever. With very few friends who I hardly see anyway. No girlfriend. Any girl I try to pursue is either not interested or loses interest in a heartbeat. I’m focused on work and the gym day in day out but I feel like there’s a hole inside me. Almost like I’ve been single and alone for too long and without a girl in my life I just feel empty.

88,o4saiw,1624272121,"Met introverted girl on Tinder, not sure what to do (please read full text)","I met this girl on Tinder and we chatted for a week now. We exchanged our Discord usernames and we've been chatting there. The thing is: I'm not sure if I want to invest time into making a relationship with her. For some background on me, my dating experience is minimal and I'm relatively new to any of this. 

To start it off, we have similar interests and our Tinder conversation started off well. When I asked when we could meet up, she refused because she wanted to get to know me better. I understood her point of view and didn't push the offer any further and just proceeded to do conversation. 

So here's our conversations start: I always start them. For the past week, I always start the conversation with ""Hey, how are you doing?"" or ""How was work?"" and usually the conversation is short-lived because she needs to sleep early for work. She is also a small Twitch streamer so when she streams, there's no chance to chat with her. In our conversations, it's 95% me asking questions to get to know her and the other 5% is her reversing the same question (e.g Me: Where do you work? Her: (insert job title here). What about you?) It really seems like that I'm the only one trying to put in effort into getting to know her. I even asked to exchange social media and our numbers but she refused with the reason that we should get to know each other more. I basically said ""All right, no biggie, no rush."" At this point I knew it might take some time to try to get through to her but I was willing to be patient. Little did I know, I didn't realize that it was going to be harder than I thought.

So I played a couple games of League of Legends with her. During one session, she invited 2 of her friends into the lobby which I was cool with. I asked if there was a Discord call I could join but she said there was nothing of the sort. For some context, before, I asked if we could use in-game voice call or Discord to communicate but she refused. Anyways, I was like ""Cool, let's just play."" After a few games, she had to take a break but what was weird was that her friend said ""She had to brb."" Again, I got confused as I wondered how did her friend know she was going to brb. Then I connected the dots and realized the most likely outcome was that they were in a call of their own and I wasn't invited. I don't know about you, but a simple Discord call for gaming surrounded with her friends doesn't seem ""scary"" for an introvert. Again, I don't know if this was the case but it was most likely the case. After a few games after that, I just called it a night. It wasn't until recently that I figured out her true intentions.

During a recent conversation, I asked if we could play a game together that's more chill like Minecraft or Stardew Valley. Minecraft was out of the question and Stardew Valley was on the table. I said I wouldn't mind starting a new farm with her but she stated she would rather play solo with no pressure. I said that I wouldn't rush the story as I've played through it multiple times but she said that the reason was she didn't want to socialize. I got confused and asked if she was introverted and she did admit it. Then I asked if this was the reason why we never did Discord calls. She said yes but also that she doesn't know me well. Here's what baffled my mind: how can she get to know me when I'm putting most of the effort in our conversations and I'm offering many opportunities to get to know me? She's refusing to meet up with me, she never initiates conversation, and she refuses to do a simple Discord call. The next part is where she shows her intentions. She reveals to me that she streams to try and be more confident and be less introverted. Then she also reveals that this is why she got Tinder so she can make friends (and maybe a relationship) and be more confident. It was at this point I questioned myself about if I should continue chatting with her and investing into this potential relationship. 

I know introverted people have a hard time communicating with strangers. I used to be introverted but I eventually grew out of my shell. I know it takes time to get comfortable with someone when you're introverted and I know it's going to take time with her if I want to pursue a relationship with her. The problem is, I'm already seeing problems before we even start anything and I just want to jump ship before I even board it. I have a friend who is dating an introverted person and he said it did take time for her to warm up to him but the key difference between my situation and his situation was that he met her in person already before exchanging numbers. I haven't met this girl and for all I know, I'm not 100% sure she exists. This seems like an investment I'm not willing to proceed with if she doesn't want to reciprocate the investment. I understand it's going to be hard for her but if her goal on Tinder is to make friends and be more confident, then she should probably jump at the chance to do so when she gets a match. If you're trying to make friends, I don't think the one person should do all the work to make the friendship work and same thing goes for relationships. 

So after all this information, what do I want? I want to know: 1) Do I continue trying to chat with her or do I jump ship? 2) If I stop, as a fan of not ghosting, how should I tell her that because she's not willing to put in the effort that I'm putting that in that I want to move on. 

TL;DR: I have conversations with girl I met in Tinder but I always initiate them. She doesn't want to exchange social media or do voice calls because she doesn't know me too well. She's introverted and streams on Twitch and is on Tinder in order to make friends (and maybe a relationship) and be more confident. I'm here to pursue a relationship but I want to jump ship before investing too much on a potentially no-return investment.

89,o4sf9f,1624272721,Liking but not texting?,"The case of this situation is that, I crossed paths with this guy a year ago before the pandemy, I didn't know his name neither spoke to him, but found him afterwards on social media, and I added him and we texted. He seemed interested we had a short convo, he'd react with hearty emojjs to my photos, and stories on Instagram.
OK fair enough. He lives in another region  not near, he did invite me once if I ever got to visit he said I'd be welcome.
Anyway after a year he keeps continuously to like my photos on Facebook and Instagram, but he hadn't replied to my last message saying"" when are you visiting? "".
I really don't get why he keeps on liking every single photo of me and not text text back?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4sf9f/liking_but_not_texting/
90,o4skcp,1624273300,How do I bring up exclusivity,"I’ve been seeing a guy for a little over a month now, and I want us to be exclusive I’m not sure how to bring it up.

When we first started talking, we both wanted something consistent but not necessarily a relationship. However, I feel like we’ve hit it off pretty well and I don’t want to see other people alongside seeing him. 

My worry is that because we’ve been seeing each other for only a little over a month, bringing up exclusivity may scare him off or make me seem clingy? 

Do I wait to bring this up, or just bring it up now?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4skcp/how_do_i_bring_up_exclusivity/

93,o4ss2m,1624274192,He hasn’t contacted me at all after the date,"TW: sexual abuse mentioned

So I (22F) went on a date with a guy I’ve known for 10+ years. We were in a lot of the same classes in highschool and over all we’ve had a good but distant friendship. 

He started messaging me regularly and I didn’t mind- replying to my stories and all. Then he asked me out on a movie date and it happened two days ago. We were both nervous but I think it went alright. 

He walked me to my car and I may have pushed him away a little because I didn’t want to kiss or anything. I have severe PTSD from my sexually abusive ex.

This was two nights ago. He hasn’t texted me or anything after the date. Is this a bad sign? One really embarrassing and cringe thing that happened was that I tried to pay and my card declined but he was insisting on paying anyway so he ended up doing it. 

I wonder what’s his perspective? I don’t want to message him yet because if he wants space I’ll give it to him I don’t wanna be pushy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4ss2m/he_hasnt_contacted_me_at_all_after_the_date/
94,o4stfe,1624274338,Is it unethical to talk to multiple girls when you're using an online dating app?,"I've been talking to 3 different girls on an online dating app.  They all seem very great and having different things about them that I like.  I went on a date with one this past weekend and it went great.  She has a wonderful personality and we really clicked.  Then there's another girl I started talking to around the same time and she seems super sweet and wants to go out soon.  And basically the same situation with the third girl.

Usually it doesn't go anywhere with girls from old apps so I didn't mind starting a conversation with these girls.  I feel as though they all have potential but I feel really guilty about talking to multiple girls and possibly going out with other girls.  I definitely don't want to hurt anyone or take advantage of them but I don't know where to draw the line.  

I know I'm not exclusive with any of them but I feel so shitty!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4stfe/is_it_unethical_to_talk_to_multiple_girls_when/
95,o4swgu,1624274681,Not sure if my (21M) friend (20F) is interested or just really friendly. Should I ask if we could be more than friends?,"Met my friend through a class in school. We studied together quite a few times during the exam season, and had dinner after our study sessions. I found that we had quite a lot in common, and she was quite cute, so I asked if she wanted to hangout after our finals. We had dinner together and shared some desserts after (we went dutch). That was about ~ 2 months ago.

I've since met her almost once every week to run, and we would usually eat together after. I don't think I really did any physical flirting (I'm really bad at this), but we would tease each other about the things we talked about. 

Our conversation always flows well, and she would seem to find excuses to start convos if we haven't texted for 1-2 days (asking how's life/wyd etc). I send her pics/articles of stuff that reminds me of our convo topics too if we haven't texted for a few days. She would frequently call me bro in our texts though, and would sometimes stop responding for a day or two before picking up the conversation again. I'm not sure if she's interested in me or if she's just very friendly and trying to put distance by calling me bro/being less responsive while texting occasionally.

I've recently asked her out again for night cycling and she agreed. I'm planning to cycle to a supper place then cycle around the city at night, and I'm not sure whether to ask her if we could be more than friends afterwards.

97,o4t7ic,1624275885,Best lessons I learnt 2.5 years ago now,"*Follow your gut*

If you **feel** that something is off, isn’t right, then it is not right. I am not a scientist but I believe that the gut is much more developed than the brain and it often tells us the truth. Trust it. Overanalysing the situation and finding arguments won’t do you any good. Trust your gut and stop there. 

*It’s not that complicated*

“If someone is into you, and they’re right for you, they WANT YOU to know that.” - random stranger on reddit

I’ve been applying this way of living since 2019 and my life has changed for the better. I’m way better off financially, spiritually, job-wise. It allowed me to rid myself of toxic people and focus on positive energy. It sounds simple but the impact was HUGE. 

All the best to you and thanks for reading.
