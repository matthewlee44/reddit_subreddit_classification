0,regazx,1639280913,Should I give her a second chance?,"I met a girl, two years ago when I was in 11th grade. We went out a couple of times and we really seemed to get along. I decided to confess my feelings for her at the time and tell her that I like her. There was only one problem which was her boyfriend. I told her anyways and she said that she didn't like me the same way I like her. Fast-forward a couple of months we started talking again. Keep in mind she always hits me up first I never text her first. We start dating/ hanging out (situationship) everything was going smoothly. One night we were cuddling and things went down between us. We both really enjoyed it. Anyways after a week or so she tells me that now she's ""dating somebody else"" which really suprised me. Anyways I left her until April she texted me and said ""hey, Im leaving soon to attend the military and I really want to see you. Im going to miss you"" I went and saw her and made her sign my yearbook she wrote me ""meeting you has been one of the most influntial moments in my life, even if I didn't know it at the time. I know we've had a complicated relationship, which I blame on myself. I still believe we've had great time together, I will remember for the rest of my life. You've helped shape who I've became. Even if you don't like that. I hope you look back and be happy that we've met, I know I am and I really hope you continue to be in my life."" Fast-forward until today she sends me a video of her driving a 120mph and playing music we used to play together when we hungout the message said ""thinking about you"". I really don't know what to do.

2,regqxd,1639282434,Why do I fantasize and create unrealistic expectations about women older than me?,"I am a female. I have always fantasized about women 30-40 years older than me whom I don't know I met a woman in a Zumba class at the gym. She was probably in her sixties, 40 years my senior. I basically didn't know her at all. I thought about her everyday for almost two years.

I fell in love with this woman. There was something about her that attracted me and she had a vibe that I liked. I liked how her body looked, the way she dressed, she had a nice face, and also the fact that since she is much older, I thought she has so much wisdom and maturity.

I never had a conversation with her, except the one time when I approached her and said hello and asked her name. I told her I did not see her for a few days since the last time I saw her. I wondered if she felt flattered that I noticed something that was so insignificant. We also had some physical contact at one point in class when we all got in line behind each other and she was behind me and her hands were on my waist. I liked her touch.

I created these fantasies in my head and I started to fantasize about her. I kept on replaying scenes in my head, like the times when we would turn our heads and make eye contact and smile, the time when I felt her slightest touch on my waist. I imagined us having a relationship, playing out different situations that would never happen in real life, like me going to her house. I imagined us kissing and having sex. As much as I imagined how I looked to her, and she me. And in my waking dreams, I kissed those lips one thousand times.

I convinced myself that she loved me. I jumped into conclusions and thought that just because she often looked at me in and smiled, that she loved me. I read so much into her intentions then there was. She occupied every space in my mind. I could not think of anything but her. I used up a lot of energy thinking about her and I even refused to go out sometimes or do activites because all I wanted was to daydream about her. I wanted her all to myself. I wondered if she had a husband and kids, and I couldn't bare the thought of her with someone else, in the arms of another.

I longed for her. I yearned to feel her touch again. My life revolved around her so much so that every time I went to the gym, she was the only thing I looked forward to. I did not pay attention to anything else. And if I went there and she was not there, I was sad. I would never do anything to her in person. I kept it all in my head.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/regqxd/why_do_i_fantasize_and_create_unrealistic/

I wake up from my dream to see a world where everything has slightly lost its color, and where I constantly feel loneliness. And it hurts even more to have the dream linger like a bittersweet memory.

9,reh334,1639283595,It took me (25/m) seven years to realize that breaking up with my high school lover was the right move,"I kind of just want to put this out there and get it off my chest because I struggled profoundly for a really long time with missing my first love and my longest/most serious relationship. 

She was a really great person, I just think we met too young. If instead of meeting our sophomore year in college instead of high school, I'd likely be writing posts about my wife.

We dated for almost all of high school together and with that comes being together for each other's most memorable moments/events in adolescence. 

It probably sounds strange, but I not only deeply loved her but also her family. They were like a second set of parents to me and while I would have much preferred to call them in-laws than my ex's parents, that wasn't on the cards and that is OK.

We had a really nasty breakup and a lot of things happened that prevented us from having any sort of relationship. Unfortunately, the breakup wasn't a single solitary event, it was like 3-5 months of hell afterward and there were many learning experiences from that.

The details are now irrelevant, but I never got any closure from it and I could never understand why I was pushed away so easily and never acknowledged again. I know men are not supposed to talk about their feelings, but this really, really bothered me and diminished my self-worth for a long time.

I actually made an effort a year or two after to speak with the parents and I did find closure and solace in that. It didn't really resolve anything because nothing needed to be resolved with them. But, as I said before, I really loved them as if they were my own. They are great people.

I haven't had any contact with my ex for years. I had hoped that we could one day be amicable but that just simply hasn't played out. Outside of what I've seen on social media over the years, I really know nothing about her. I cut ties with mutual friends shortly after it was all over.

I did see her at church this past week and for the first time since we were together, I had no real emotions. She was just another human being in a crowded place. I guess I just want to share this because I've finally been able to bury a ghost that has long haunted me.

I graduated college with zero debt, have an amazing and fulfilling career and live on my own. I wish I could go back to that 18-year-old me and tell him that it's going to be OK. I don't think I'd be where I am today and in the direction I am going if we had not split.

I‚Äôm 28m. Have never had a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù that lasted more than a couple to months. A few ONS and fwbs here and there. 

All of my hobbies are solo activities. 

I go to the gym 4x per week alone and put in my AirPods and listen to a podcast or audiobook. Even though I‚Äôm fit I don‚Äôt play or watch any sports. I‚Äôm self-employed. No boss. No employees. 

It may sound like I‚Äôm a loner but really I have a very active social life. I‚Äôm going to bars or dinner with my friends like 3-4 times a week and my social circle is large so perhaps hanging out with friends is my only non-solo ‚Äúhobby‚Äù.

The point is I‚Äôm wondering if this is something I need to fix? Is this something women can sense either subconsciously or consciously? Like should I go join a beach volleyball team or something? 

Or is this just who I am and I need to find a woman that‚Äôs okay with it?

The reason I find it odd is because it was the first post I made in almost two years, I was previously deactivated for months, and then went public very quickly but they had already seen it which means they both must frequently keep tabs on me.

I[30M] met this woman[27F] on a dating app. We've been talking for ~10 days now. The conversation is going good, she laughs and responds immediately. However, she never asks any questions about me. She never initiates the conversation. When I say something, she ""hahaha""'s and reply to my text. She rarely ends the conversation with an open ended question so that I can talk about myself. We spoke on phone twice and she was talking a lot, but she never asked any questions about me. I felt I had to talk about myself just after she finishes talking. 

I'm having a hard time keeping the conversation going. Just bringing out some random topic to talk about out of nowhere looks odd to me. When the conversation is flowing naturally, it's easy to steer it down to where you want. When someone just replies to your text, and never try to contribute to it, it becomes hard. It could be because I lack something, which I'm happy to work on. Any guidance would be really appreciated.

My question is: what do I do when she never really asks anything about me, just laughs and answers my question. What do I do to bring the best of her so that she also contribute and initiates the conversation.

Also, how often you do you text during early stages? We have plans to meet later this month.

I was/am still afraid to be happy..

I was with a woman for five years and then another for 2 and then another for three. They all individually feel like they ""fucked up"". It's so romantic and such self glamorizing bullshit but you have to respect that although it's not true mostly its true for some people. 

In the past two months I've had three ex girlfriends contact me and I'm not even joking or giving an opportunity for falsified stuff. One I dated since we were thirteen and stayed together until we were 18 and she self admitted that she didn't wanna continue dating because I was the only one she'd known. She went on a date with someone else and didn't like it and immediately texted me back.

The second was a chick who knew I was the real deal about relationships- she knew that I wanted one until death. But at 18 there were so many fucking options it wasn't possible for her to commit. Not to mention she was an incredibly hot piece of ass.

The thing I'm talking about is like, girls literally have something they want like or love. They already have it. But there'd this delusional fomo shit they do where like, I've literally been asked to take ""breaks"" so they could explore other people and what they're like. 

I'm not even kidding without fail these girls I've been with go out of their way to ""follow their heart"" and go for people they think they'd like and then are upset after learning their dick or personality isn't shit.

Laura Gina and gyleasa. The literal women I've lived with for years. They thought like I was immature I was wrong and there's definitely better guys - and they were all wrong. They insisted on breaks and went on dates with guys they don't like or don't fuck them how they like. 

They're literally betraying me. They always come back. They always come home. They're always fucking wrong in their suppositions but still feel.right and entitled to being right. There's a girl as we speak messaging me how she's miserable and upset like she's fucked up everything - and she did. She did that and I'm not attracted to her anymore.

Why the fuck do women constantly pretend they'd be happier somewhere else and the moment they're not happier somewhere else act like I guys should respect them the same? We don't. You lost everything because you were too cowardly, and you pretend it's guys that have to tolerate your shortcomings. 

Why the fuck do women pretend they get this chance of oh I'm gonna go on a date with somebody and you don't get to respect me different? It's not pulp culture shit. I literally dated three different girls who all came back when the grass wasn't greener. Why the fuck are you given the right to be garbage and still expect to be allowed home

Dude if you break up with a guy and go out with someone else you know you were always literally wrong right the moment you come back 

I'm getting vibes from young women that they think they're right about everything while any empirical evidence should show them they're wrong. You should literally hold yourself accountable. You should recognize you've been wrong the entire time and should shut the fuck up.

Like women. You need to recognize you aren't a victim sometimes and are actually in the wrong. There's three women asking me to be a part of their life and they were right about keeping me out months ago.

If the person you like is enough be happy.

Women your wandering eyes and falling imaginations keep you from loving who you're with.

It was probably a guy willing to spend his life on you but you didn't have the same courtesy.

If thinking There's something better is your reason you're always wrong.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reio0c/the_opportunity_to_let_someone_make_mistakes/

34,reirem,1639289789,A year end review. Dating in 2021 (rant).,"This year kind of sucked. I (30M) got ghosted at the beginning of the year just as I was falling for a seemingly great gal. We‚Äôd been seeing each other nearly 3 months and I was pretty blindsided, though I shouldn‚Äôt have been in retrospect. 

Despite probably not being ready, I hopped right back into trying to get more dates. I recovered for the most part by may, after getting some closure from Casper. Went on what I thought was a date with a former coworker around the same time, but things remained quiet until September otherwise. 

Since then I‚Äôve gone on 3 first dates (a big milestone for me to get that many in a year). None have landed though. First one was very interested but I was simply not attracted to her. I wanted to give it a chance because we had similar interests and she was really cool, but it just wasn‚Äôt going to work for me after date 2 with her. Second one was a wash and neither of us were interested. Third one was great and both of us were interested (she had some hiccups that delayed the first date for over a week, but persisted and assured me she definitely wanted to see me). I asked her for a second date for tonight, she excitedly agreed, and then canceled on me this morning citing her lack of availability on multiple fronts. 

I‚Äôm done for the rest of the year. Another break is definitely required. I‚Äôve been more exhausted by this all at other points in the year for sure, but this is more preemptive so that I can focus on family for the holidays. 

I‚Äôve learned this year that: I‚Äôm smoother than I thought in person, I‚Äôm worse than I thought through text, I have a much better idea at what I want and don‚Äôt want in a relationship, I‚Äôm not ugly, I do love myself, and I have a lot to offer.

42,rej2ky,1639291030,I'm pretty terrible at apps.,"I'm 27 Male, and in the Denver area. Not advertising, just giving background. I'm on okcupid, bumble, and was on POF and tinder. I have 12 photos up, and I've gotten feedback that I'm cute, attractive, handsome, the photos are taken well etc. I've shown them off to women on the internet and IRL. Always told its good.

I've swapped my bio out I don't know how many times. Short ones, long ones, humble ones, clever ones, funny ones. I never get matches. 

I got like 20 on bumble initially, but not a single message, so they all expired. OK cupid I get nothing. Literally just nothing. Tinder expanded my area, age range (to creepy limits) and then finally just decided I was bisexuality, because I'm not gonna manage it with women apparently. 

I'm 6'1"". Jogger build, long curly brown hair that makes women jealous, 2 photos have me and my dogs (I have 3). A couple airport photos, one of me on stage with a guitar.

I'm either being lied to with the pics (totally possible), buried in the algorithm, or my bios are garbage. Is 3 dogs intimidating? How long am I aiming for? Do I mention I own my house? Or does that seem like I'm being an asshole? I almost always mention I fix things, because I fix appliances, cars, electronics and furniture. Some of it professionally. I run a business on the side as well, but have never mentioned it in a bio. 

Sorry if I sound just mad. I'm not. I know it's something I'm doing or not doing. Also open to alternatives to apps. I don't know how to meet women IRL. They normally seem genuinely upset if I express interest, even though I normally have long meaningful conversations leading up to it. At least I find meaning in them.

She was talking all month how she couldn‚Äôt wait to see her friend and she leaves and 30 minutes later I get a text that she feels like this relationship is too much for her n she wants to break up with me. N at first I laugh n said this gotta be someone playing on her phone. But then I go on my snap n see her name saying pending indicating she block me. I go on all other social medias n I see tht im either removed or block. So I‚Äôm panicking n I try to text her n call her I‚Äôm blocked. Getting sent straight to voicemail. So ofc I do the text now app n im blowing up her phone‚Ä¶ 

It was 3am when she called me on my regular line n tells me she coming to my house. She comes n has a big bag of my stuff n pushes out the car. I‚Äôm asking her baby what wrong, what going on, please talk to me. She telling me she just can‚Äôt do this relationship anymore she doesn‚Äôt want to communicate her feelings anymore she tired of us hanging out . All in all I was very blindsided by this. I‚Äôm asking everything I could , did ur friends put something in ur head ,is there someone else, r u having a panic attack. What happen. She told me she wants us to b friends n thts it. 
Two week goes by n I let her know I have Covid. She comes gives me with a get well basket n the week after tht she comes by again saying she wants her stuff from my house . She ends up staying the night for three days n in the morning starts going off again saying she can‚Äôt stand me n she wants me out of her life. I say baby what‚Äôs wrong. We had a great weekend together Why r u always doing this. What is ur problem with me. N she started to grow angry with me saying we see each other to much, I always wanna hang out . (Knowing it was her idea to stay at my house for 3 days.) I told her I don‚Äôt have any problems, u are the one with problem. When u need ur space I give it to u, when u want to hang I make time. I don‚Äôt understand where all this childish behavior is coming from. Then she just Shuts down n doesn‚Äôt answer my question just dead quiet , starring at me as if I didn‚Äôt say anything. So finally we went out separate ways. It was 4 days later when she texted me asking a question n tht was it. Why do u guys think my girl acting wishy washy. 
She the first relationship I ever have tht doesn‚Äôt give me no problems no worries n now she acting crazy. I‚Äôm a pretty laid back guy n I don‚Äôt like the back n fourth.

53,rejwrs,1639294408,I (20F) am wondering how to meet people outside of dating apps during COVID.,"Hello Reddit! I am in need of some dating advice that might lead me in the direction of meeting new people. I have tried dating apps, but they haven‚Äôt resulted in the greatest experiences and I find they end up making me feel a bit down. I also recognize that it is tough to go out and meet people because a lot of things are not running because of the pandemic.

I am a little bit concerned that maybe I am the problem or that maybe I am just not what people are looking for. For some background information about myself, I am a full-time student in business school working towards law school, I have a job, I created a small business of my own as a side hustle to make some extra money to help pay for tuition, I am pursuing my dreams of becoming a musician, and I have a good variety of interests aside from academics and music. I am personable, but am also a bit of an introvert until you get to know me. I really value consideration and honesty, so I always try my best to act accordingly.

I was in a relationship for about three years, and finally feel, after a long period of healing, ready to step back into the world of dating. But, I guess because I was so sheltered from what dating is actually like, I had no idea how discouraging it actually is. I have been on so many dates with people I met on dating apps, and I probably have some of the greatest dating horror stories you could imagine - like a guy getting drunk at our morning coffee date, bragging about having his license permanently suspended because of his multiple DUIs and then asking me to drive him 45 minutes into town to his next Tinder date (yup, that happened! Haha.). And, for the few times where I thought I found someone who I would really like to get to know, they ended up ghosting me after expressing they would love to see me again.

I know that I do not need a boyfriend and that I am perfectly fine doing my own thing, but it is just starting to get to me that it seems everyone around me has no problem finding someone, and being uninvited to events because I don‚Äôt have someone to bring along is starting to bring me down. I understand that it is awkward to have one single at a table of couples and I don't want to make my friends uncomfortable, but it is still hurtful.

So I guess my question is this: Reddit users, have you ever felt discouraged like this and how did you get out of it? And during COVID, what might be some good ways to meet people that are not through dating apps?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rejwrs/i_20f_am_wondering_how_to_meet_people_outside_of/

We matched on Tinder literally 4 days ago and omg I‚Äôm so glad she agreed to go on a date with me.

First of all, whoever said don‚Äôt date your sign fuckin LIED. We have SO much in common it‚Äôs crazy. 

We started our date at a sushi spot in town. It was a bit nerve wrecking to meet up so soon but it was 100% worth it. Her pictures don‚Äôt do her justice in person, she is SO SO SO beautiful and girly.. I love it! She didn‚Äôt go OD with the date attire, just kept it casual so that put me at ease bc I don‚Äôt own a whole lot of clothing myself. I was a bit embarrassed that I didn‚Äôt know how to use chopsticks but she didn‚Äôt either so we both go a kick out of trying to eat with them lol

After that, I booked an escape room session for us and let me tell you‚Ä¶ if it were a life or death situation, we‚Äôd be fucked lmao we had an hour and only got 2/3 of the way through before time was up but it showed me that we could work as a team, and very clear who would take lead in the relationship. 10/10 definitely recommend an escape room date for the first date. You learn a lot about a person.

Then after that we went to my favorite bar and had a couple drinks. By then nerves were pretty much gone but I can‚Äôt hold my liquor like that and got way more drunk than I needed to be lmao I‚Äôm just glad I sobered up enough to drive home. I walked her to her car and we ended up making out lmfao she kept saying she liked me and all I could do was smile hard af.

After she left I invited her to my place and we ended up watching Harry Potter since she‚Äôs never seen it before. She ended up getting tired and falling asleep but either way I‚Äôd say the date was 100% a success.

2nd date: better convo still seemed a lil nervous but he asked questions. Asked to kiss me tongue the whole time and I never gave tongue back my face was very wet. Again told me he liked me.

He texts me and has told me a lot he is bored. Just graduated from law school only working 2 days a week meanwhile I am working full time and studying for the bar. I just feel like he does not have a life. He seems to be readily available on weekends-seems to have no plans. However, he does seem nice and he does seem to support and encourage me.

* He seems very supportive/emotionally intelligent
* Made it clear he liked me

She chose to simply ‚Äúlike‚Äù the message and not reply for two reasons: she didn‚Äôt want to reply and have hope that he‚Äôll respond, and she simply just didn‚Äôt want to because she had no response since the message was straightforward and mature. 

This sparked a debate amongst our friend groups that I‚Äôm now curious what you all think and your perspective.

So what happened was that she knew me before like when we were in middle school , and connected later on instagram after about 6-7 yrs.. It sll started of with replying to memes, stories etc and slowly she became a good friend of mine of mine. So after about 1-2 months of talking we were like too connected to each other we would text and chat everyday , told each other about our days , shared emotional stuff. And we both knew it was more than just friendship. So both of us indirectly gave hints to each other about that. So one day she asked me if she can tell me anything and  i said whatever she wants to she can tell. So she told me officially that she Loved me and i too said that i loved her back. After that day we were kind of too much expressive like a lovey-dovey couple tagged each other in cute posts , used to send each other cute couple videos. I forgot to mention we don't live close to each other so we haven't met yet. The last time we met was when we were like 13 yrs old.
So , back to the story , after we admitted that we loved each other everything went great for a couple of months.. But after sometime the texts became slow sometimes i even felt she ignored me and i asked her if it's because of something that I've done then she said it's not your fault etc etc. I'm like this and sometimes i do jt and for the time being accepted that answer and was fine with it but now its been 2 weeks she hasn't texted me once and haven't replied to my texts. I don't know what to do next I've been asking for like past 5-6 days constantly if she's okay but no reply and now I'm thinking maybe she doesn't want me to her ?

74,relzdj,1639303235,Weight preferences in relationships,"My boyfriend is not attracted to my current body weight. We don‚Äôt have sex that often and he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs not that sexual of a person but has also admitted we‚Äôd be having ‚Äúcrazy good‚Äù and frequent sex if I lost weight. I feel like he is not interested in my body at all when we have sex and the lack of attraction is pretty obvious to me. It‚Äôs also complicated because he said it is my general attitude toward diet and fitness that is also a turn off? He doesn‚Äôt like my consumption of carbs or sugar at my current weight and said that in the past my diet has bothered him a lot but it‚Äôs less so now. He also thinks that telling me all of this should motivate me to become hot because if someone told him a way to become more hot he would jump at the chance and feel very motivated.

He doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that these comments and judgements are incredibly hurtful to me and I don‚Äôt know how to frame it so he‚Äôll understand. He says other aspects of me supersede these physical issues (this is kind of hard for me to believe) but I want someone who feels romantic &amp; turned on by me.

For more context I‚Äôve struggled with weight and mental health my whole life. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and in 2012 got down to 115 lbs where my doctor was asking me to put on weight. I was severely restricting my diet and consuming only pepto bismol some days to soothe my stomach and lose weight. I‚Äôve been hospitalized for suicide attempts and been through years of counseling/therapy/meds to get better &amp; work on my self image. I felt like I‚Äôve been in a good place mentally but these comments have crushed me. I am happy with my body weight. I have no medical issues at all and have a very physical tree service job where I‚Äôm basically working out all day &amp; he said that‚Äôs not enough without going on a diet. I get compliments on my looks &amp; outfits all the time and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm a fat person at my current weight and am not according to medical standards &amp; a physical I had last week. I don‚Äôt feel particularly unhealthy and get a lot of satisfaction out of eating treats with white flour, carbs, etc. I think it also bothers him that I put honey in my coffee because he said that‚Äôs something he‚Äôd never do if he wanted to lose weight.

I‚Äôve never had someone be so brutally honest about their preferences without breaking up with me or something like that. I understand body weight preferences but he truly doesn‚Äôt understand that what he is saying makes me feel terrible. He also says in response to me being upset by these statements that I should just practice self love &amp; not worry about what others think but these thoughts are contingent on me receiving physical intimacy and love. 

I love this person a lot and we live together but I don‚Äôt want to just feel like I‚Äôm living with a roommate. I feel insecure about initiating anything physically because the whole time I‚Äôm worried about how he feels about my body, what my stomach might be looking like, etc. I don‚Äôt know how to move forward with this and at age 33 I‚Äôm not ready to accept a near sexless and romance-less relationship where my partner literally never comes on to me. I also haven‚Äôt gained weight since we started dating. Is there any way to repair? Is this just a case where someone‚Äôs sexual arousal is completely riding on my attitude toward fitness, lifestyle, and motivation to diet?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/relzdj/weight_preferences_in_relationships/

88,rena71,1639308877,How do I shut down my roommates crush on me?,"At first, I thought I was overthinking it and wrongly interpreting my roommate's friendly behavior as a crush, but since I came back from out of town, he‚Äôs been acting more strange, and now I‚Äôm here on Reddit asking for your advice‚Ä¶

I am 26F living with a 33M, and we have another 30F roommate, but she‚Äôs always out of town. So it‚Äôs mostly just us two in the house since we moved in 5 months ago. Here are the weird behaviors from this past week‚Ä¶

He came home and yelled, ‚Äúhoney, I‚Äôm home.‚Äù I heard this and cringed 

He told me he saw a psychic last year that told him he would find love, and she was in her mid-twenties. 

We talked about our living situation next year, and if we can‚Äôt renew where we‚Äôre living, he and I will search for a new place. I told him I was down. If we get a 3rd Roomie, I want another female. And he agreed‚Ä¶. Because he doesn‚Äôt want a male to ‚Äútry to get in my pants.‚Äù

He confessed he heard me have sex with a guy and kept on talking about it even though we came to a new ‚Äúspoken agreement‚Äù about our shared space. I felt bad. But now, I think he just wanted to talk about sex with me. 

He focuses on me WAY TOO much. I feel like he interrupts my ‚Äúme time‚Äù in the house very often and observes me too much. For example...I‚Äôm working extra hours during the evening, so there‚Äôs me and my laptop in the living room. I told him I was busy working, and after half an hour of him talking and me responding‚Äúmhmm‚Äù while still staring at the computer, he finally got it. He changed his tone and said, ‚Äúsorry I talk too much,‚Äù and walked upstairs all sad. I felt guilty for hurting his feelings, and I have a hard time being assertive 

I‚Äôm frustrated. I‚Äôm scared the reason he has been such a great roommate is that he has a crush. And I‚Äôm worried when he realizes it‚Äôs not reciprocated, he will change the way he treats me. He doesn‚Äôt get along with the other female Roomie. 

More about him: I view him as a clingy puppy. ‚ÄúNice guy‚Äù vibes, really wanting a relationship. He‚Äôs an only child. So At first thought he might have been used to getting so much attention he was trying to receive that from somewhere. 

More about me: I‚Äôm a caring person.. I smile a lot. I have a pretty face. An insecurity I have is getting my friendly personality confused with flirting. I love my ‚Äúme time,‚Äù and I‚Äôm an introvert by heart. 

TLDR: I think my roommate has a crush on me, and I‚Äôm uncomfortable and don‚Äôt know what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rena71/how_do_i_shut_down_my_roommates_crush_on_me/

90,renlo2,1639310252,Should I be serious with this guy?,"I met someone on Tinder six months ago. 
The first few months we've only had a very short conversation everyday as he is always busy (as he claims to be) 

By very short, it is always just Good Morning/Night, How are you. No deep conversations. And he would even leave me on delivered for hours. And sometimes would not text for 2 days. Im also the type of person who never double text. I would always wait for a reply first before I text again. So I endured those days without conversation. 

I was totally fine by it as Im not that interested on him yet. 
But as time passes by, I got annoyed at him because he told me at the very beginning that he is interested in me. But i dont feel it. He rarely text me and doesnt really ask something about me. So I confronted him about it.  He told me that he is just super busy and can barely rest.

Fast forward.. After a few months, I got interested. I want to know him better. So we had a serious talk about us. He told me that he really is interested but is afraid that I might just disappear; and thought I never share personal stuff about me. (but how would I share when he doesnt ask questions about me? üò≠)

He also explained that he is super busy and finishes his work very late. 

After our talk, I saw some progression. He always text back immediately whenever he can. And he now share random stuff about him. And he's planning to meet me soon. (Yuh, its LDR. He's in abroad)

Now my question is, should I really believe this guy? I like him and would like to know him more. But the thing is, he is still a stranger to me. We never had a videocall yet but soon we'll have one (as he say).

Im single since birth so I really have no idea how to deal with this one. Also, Im an overthinker and hates to text first even though Im dying to have a conversation with him. üíÄ

I would love to know your views and advices on this before I really invest to this guy  üòÖ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/renlo2/should_i_be_serious_with_this_guy/
91,renq5c,1639310700,My friend makes flirty jokes and then backtracks,"So basically, my male friend (I'm a woman) has been acting weird lately. I sent him something about best friends on Snapchat and he answered writing best friends with a heart emoji and then a selfie of him doing a heart with his hands. He has also asked me to call him sweetie instead when I jokingly called him mad man. In the past he has sent me a selfie with lots of heart emojis. I ignored it because I assumed it was a joke.

When I ask if he is joking he says of course and backtracks. But it just feels so weird to joke about these things, none of my other male friends are behaving like this. Why joke about it? I don't find it funny and frankly I don't get why you would joke about this stuff. Do I have the right to feel frustrated?

Tldr: male friend acting weird lately.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/renq5c/my_friend_makes_flirty_jokes_and_then_backtracks/

93,reo5lo,1639312456,How come I never had a crush on anyone.,"It's kinda frustrating because I want to love someone but I just never met a single guy who drove me crazy. What's wrong with me? Are my standards too high? I want to date but i never truly enjoyed any dates with anyone. I have to ""pretend"" most of the time and its so tiring. I want to be shy, awkward and anxious on my first date but still enjoy it and feel something different and unique. 

Well, im not very outgoing so the only way i can go on a date is if guys (from work, from a friends gathering) randomly ask me out once a year or from tinder. Tinder is a no no for me, i prefer the real thing, i'm kinda a hopeless romantic but still have my feet on the ground so dont come at me for that... And in the first case, the guy comes at me and because I was not crushing on him or liked him the date feels ""boring"" to me. Like, im not excited for that date. I still go cause I want to give it a chance.

For reference I'm 20F and straight. By pretend i mean pretending im happy and enjoying my time even though i would absolutely prefer staying home in my bed listening to The Neighborhood.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reo5lo/how_come_i_never_had_a_crush_on_anyone/
94,reokun,1639314052,Is this normal or is he rushing?,"went on date: he told me on 2nd date he was too nervous he did not ask me any questions. He also did not smile/laugh. Date lasted 1 hour

we texted in between and he called me between 1st-2nd date where he told me he liked me \[we just had a 1 hour date where he did not talk much and some texting\]

2nd date: he asked to kiss me but it was tongue from beginning to end again told me he liked me

the next day he texted me at work saying he was distracted at work ;) emoji

Did he say he liked me too soon-it seemed soon considering we met online

3rd date was going to be ice-skating. I was thinking of asking to reschedule but then before I could he told me he bough tickets. Does anyone think he is rushing or it was weird he told me he bought tickets?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reokun/is_this_normal_or_is_he_rushing/
95,reoswi,1639314861,What's the best way to proceed?,"To cut to the chase, there's a girl in a few of my college classes who I think is really cute. We're both currently in second year, having spent the entirety of first year online.

I texted with her a little bit over summer, but it was only really small talk about how she found first year etc, and never went any further.

The first semester of second year is over now, and I never spoke to her once during it. This is a combination us ending up in different friend groups, the classes being pretty big, and me just being way too shy. 

If its not too late, I would still love to try and talk to her, but I'm not sure on how best to do it.

My first approach would be to text her again, ask her how she found being back on campus etc, and maybe suggested going for a coffee or something when we get back after Christmas? 

If not that, then I could just wait until we're back after Christmas, and by some miracle work up the balls to go talk to her.

Obviously the first option is far easier, however I'm afraid it will come across as too forward, a bit creepy, and a bit sad because it's the second time I'm randomly texting her. Talking to her in person would probably be the better option, but I've no idea how to approach girls and will probably just keep putting it off until the semester ends. There's also a slim chance college's won't reopen after Christmas. 

Does anyone have any tips or advice? I'd really appreciate anything anyone has to offer.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/reoswi/whats_the_best_way_to_proceed/

97,reoura,1639315052,Long Distance Dating,"I (29/F) matched with him (28/M) on Bumble and started talking every day and eventually calling (audio and video). We haven't met yet since we're in complete opposites of the world. I was swiping in his area since I am to move there next year.

We've been talking for a few weeks but noticed a change in December. He says the only change is he's been so drained because of the Christmas rush and I've been trying to understand it but I can't seem to ignore my needs. He still messages me in the morning and evening but there's just this change I can't ignore. Today I've finally talked to him about me not being sure about us anymore because I feel neglected. He says he doesn't want to keep disappointing me and making me feel like I'm a chore (my words) so we decided to end it. The distance and the time difference are such huge factors too.

I feel like it ended prematurely. Should I have been more understanding? All I really want is for us to go back to where we were then. I want to message him and say I've made a mistake. I really just don't know anymore. Any thoughts?
