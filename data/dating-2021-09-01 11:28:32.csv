2,pfxxch,1630515108,I asked a shy guy out for the first time and he’s ignored me,"I’ve had a crush on the guy who manages my building since we met 3 years ago. I had a boyfriend, though so I did my best to ignore him. About a year ago, I ended things with my boyfriend because I knew I just didn’t feel the way I should about him and my feelings for my crush were wrong. I’ve continued to try to ignore him because I’ve still been living with my ex until I finish up school plus he lives and works here so it just seemed like a bad idea. My ex also mentioned to him that we broke up and I’m moving soon. 

Well, he just recently quit (or got fired - I’m not sure what happened) and now he’s gone. He moved out this weekend and he’s already been replaced at his job. 

I’ve never asked a guy out before, and I’m really shy, but I figured I’d just go for it and ask him out finally. Last night (kind of late) I texted him asking if he’d like to get coffee sometime. He hasn’t responded. I know he does read receipts and he’s left me on delivered, whatever that’s supposed to mean. 

I feel like a fool. I really thought he had a thing for me, too. I’ve frequently caught him staring at me and awkwardly lingering around me. A few times I’ve caught him looking at me and I smiled at him and he immediately looked down like he was overwhelmed. He never really tried to talk to me, but when we have, he usually tried to make me laugh, he didn’t break eye contact and he’d often have a big smile while talking to me. I’ve also seen his friends tease him twice around me and he walked away from them. They kept looking at me so it seemed like it was about me and whenever I’ve seen him with his friends, they’ve always stared at me and tried to get me to talk to them. 

Once, he came by to fix something for me. When I went to explain to him what the problem was, he seemed to play dumb so that I’d have to lean in close next to him to show him. After I got closer to him, he started awkwardly fiddling with his tools. I scurried away then and he said he’d have to go get a part and he’d come back the following day. Cue the next day and he said he was all done, I thanked him, he told me to have a nice day, and I waved good bye to him as he turned back and looked at me before he went out the door. Then a minute or 2 later, he knocked on my door. I thought either he forgot something or maybe he was finally going to ask me out. He leaned in close to me with his phone and asked if I could give him 5 stars for his business. He seemed nervous to ask me, which was so adorable that I couldn’t help but laugh and tell him yeah no problem. My dog was trying to escape so I kind of rushed him off and told him to send me the link. He didn’t though until I texted him asking him and he just said thanks. I left him a glowing review and the next time I saw him, he grabbed the door for me and touched my hand. 

One of the last times I saw him, my dog went up to him and he started petting him and asking me about him. When I started to walk away, he tried to keep the conversation going and when I walked back over to him, he raised his eyebrows at me and had the biggest smile. He still tried to talk to me more but I got so nervous, I sort of ran away. 

I just don’t get why he’d ignore me now that I finally worked up the nerve to ask him out.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfxxch/i_asked_a_shy_guy_out_for_the_first_time_and_hes/

I met a wonderful girl two months ago and it was, as stupid as it may sound, like love at first sight. I never believed in such a thing, but I couldn't get her out of my mind since I saw her for the first time. 
I was with a buddy at the time and this girl was visiting my buddy's sister. We got to talking later, hit it off and ended up exchanging numbers at the end of the day. Unfortunately she lives a bit further away, so we just wrote for the time being. It was somehow all perfect, we were on the same wavelength and also have the same hobbies. It seemed as if she would like me also very much. After three weeks, however, a message came from her that her crush, with whom she has apparently been in love for a long time, has contacted her and she does not want to ""drive two-track"". Since then, we haven't had any contact.
The sister of my buddy said the other day that nothing has come of the two and to this day the girl in question is still looking at my Instagram story. The other day I happened to see her in town (her parents live here) and she smiled and waved at me from across the street. At that moment, though, I was kind of too overwhelmed to go up to her.

I just can't get her out of my mind and I'm thinking about wishing her a happy birthday next month, so we might get in touch again if she's still interested. But somehow I feel stupid doing this, since I'm only her second choice (if at all) and I'm still chasing after her.

9,pfyq5x,1630517384,Single and having so many bad experiences,"I (25f) live in a touristy city that has an extremely poor dating scene. I moved here 2 years ago for grad school and then the pandemic hit 6 months later. I’m very outgoing so I usually meet people organically, but in this city it’s hard to do that so i use dating apps, primarily hinge. 

Throughout these two years, I have had the worst dating experiences in my life. I’ve had SEVERAL men ask me to make porn with them right away, I’ve been stood up on two dates (first one guy lied about his sister dying in a car crash and the second one told me he masturbated before our date and immediately fell asleep and that’s why he missed the date), and so many more crazy things that I can’t even think of. I’ve just had SO MANY bad dates in general. I just had another really fucking sucky thing happen this morning with a guy I’ve been talking to and I feel like I’m at my breaking point. 

It’s exhausting. I’ve been single for 4 years now and I’ve always been comfortable with that but since moving to a city where i don’t have family or many friends, I’m just very ready to find a partner. I’m just so exhausted from all the bad experiences though. Throughout these two years here I’ve taken breaks from the dating apps for several months at a time when I get overwhelmed or exhausted, but I just am ready to find someone I click with, I always end up getting them back. I’m beginning to give up but I’m going to be here for several more years, I really don’t want to just give up.  

I guess I’m posting to rant but also I could really use words of encouragement or people who’ve had similar experiences share their story. Also any ideas on how to meet someone (dating apps or otherwise) definitely welcome. 

Thanks for reading

15,pfz48d,1630518547,"I asked in this forum if anyone could tell if my teacher liked me by the signs she displayed, and one user DM:d me and suggested I should just be straight forward and ask her out.

My teacher sort of ignores me or minimizes her interactions with me. My parents think I might have some difficulty reading social cues and they called a psychologist. I am embarrassed and I just want to disappear and move far away.

**Advice to anyone here considering asking their teacher out or dating them:**

* If she looks at you, smiles, listens, and nods her head when you talk or discuss a topic, it doesn't mean that she likes you. I know it is crazy. I always thought that if a girl listens to you and looks at you when you talk, she likes you, but boy was I wrong.
* If your teacher gives you good grades and tells you that you did a good job and should keep it up, it apparently doesn't mean she is romantically interested in you. Yes, even if she did the above mentioned things together with giving you good grades and complimenting you.
* If she laughs when you talk about Roman history or imitate Caligula it doesn't mean anything. From what I read on the Internet, if a girl that laughs at your jokes, she must like you. But apparently they lied in that article about it because now I am in trouble.
* If she walks behind you in the hallway it doesn't mean that she wants to see your butt.
* ...
* Don't listen to people giving you advice on Reddit! 

It's crazy that such obvious signs of liking me could turn out to be wrong. She crushed my heart. It hurts to be lured in only to know she was playing with me all along. She walked on my heart with her stiletto heels. I would daydream about her and me doing it. Us having fun cuddling and talking about Pax Romana or the love affair between Caesar and Cleopatra. I don't think I will honestly be ready for love again. It hurts...

I don't care if what I say upsets some people, I talk freely and do as I please, naturally that filters out the people that I want nothing to do with.


I am doubtful that I will meet anyone that fits my criteria, but I suppose it is unwise to rule out the possibility of dating entirely - if I put in the effort and be someone else to please someone then that will not end very well because that relationship is built on a lie. So many people today build relationships on the foundation of lies and fake personas.

25,pg028c,1630521296,One of my worst mistakes tbh,"A few months back, I (18F) dated a guy (19M) for about two months, and we talked for about 1 month prior. We clicked almost immediately and it felt easy to talk to him. I told him everything about my life, and was open about the good as well as the bad. I felt accepted for once in my life. I was ecstatic! I mean, i had a history of dating douchebags so this was a big moment for me. “Finally, a nice guy I can have a normal relationship with!”

He was insecure and introverted, but I didn’t mind it at all. While we dated, he got better at talking about his feelings, keeping up hygiene habits, became way more confident, and I was all of his firsts. He even decided to take the initiative to get off his antidepressants, and felt much better off of them. I supported him as he got his drivers license and helped him with his friend and family dramas. I was so proud of seeing him grow into a happier person, and he was helping me grow too. I was way more confident, less anxious, and a lot less skittish around men (I was previously abused by an ex). 

Well, things started to get worse and got worse fast. I couldn’t see it at the time because I was so infatuated with him. First, he started criticizing my style and outfits. “You shouldn’t wear that much eyeshadow” or “I would like you better without those fake nails” or even “I hope you don’t look weird if you color your hair.” These were all things I had been doing for awhile, as well as the hair dye was temporary. He also told me to wear things I was uncomfortable with like crop tops or booty shorts. 

He was also extremely pouty if I didn’t give him nudes or sex. This man wanted nudes or sex EVERY DAY. I am high drive but I don’t want it every night. He didn’t care if I wasn’t feeling it, he wanted it. He would never directly violate a boundary if I said no, but rather sulk or blame me for being dramatic. For example, one time I cried to him saying that I felt objectified by him, and ten minutes later he told me he was hard for me. Even an idiot would know that it wasn’t the time for that. 

He made it clear to me that he needed porn to get off, and watched it for at least an hour a day. Sometimes he would turn me down because he had just recently watched porn. 

He would lie to his family and friends about me. He said I was just a friend, and sometimes he wouldn’t even tell them where I was from. Lie about my age, gender, hometown, relationship status, etc. He said he loved me but only told two of his friends I existed. 

There’s more things than I will name right now but overall pretty shady guy. I didn’t want to see it because I loved him, but these were the cold hard facts. I ignored it until I couldn’t ignore it anymore.

One night, about a week after we had had sex, he told me that he felt nothing for me during sex and that he didn’t find me sexually attractive. He went on to say that he could’ve done better than I did with his own hand and that it was like I wasn’t even there. He then said he didn’t feel like we even had an emotional connection and that he didn’t know if he loved me. He told me that he cared for me as a person but not as a partner and that he wanted to cut off contact.

I was very suspicious by this development as I had been led to believe that he enjoyed having sex with me as well as the fact that he loved me. So the next day I made a new number and texted him as if I was my ex-boyfriend. Now, for context, my ex-boyfriend that I pretended to be was an abusive person that I told him a lot about. I texted as my abusive ex-boyfriend saying that I wanted to know how to get in bed with me (the person writing this). My ex not only gave him this information, but sympathized with my past abuser and said that he understood him.

I was in shock but decided to block him on everything and move on. I know realized that he was a bad person and that I should’ve caught on earlier. I am now in a new relationship and I don’t think about him too much but whenever I do it just pisses me off. This is because I know how much has negatively impacted me to this day and how it will continue to impact me overtime. I just can’t fathom that people like this actually exist.

I started talking to some girls and I asked them out this weekend. All 3 either rejected me or ghosted me. I'm just so hurt and tired of being on the hunt. I wish girls could know what it's like. How crushing it is to be rejected.

I've had some success with women but any that do show interest have wound up cheating on me. I've been divorced for about 3 years now. In that time I've grieved and tried to pick myself back up and recover and keep trying. It's just exhausting putting in effort like this and just getting rejected over and over.

I wish a women pursuit me for once. Ask me out. Maybe even just acknowledge me as a potential partner instead of just relying on the guy to do all the work.

36,pg17c8,1630524712,I (26M) was asked to go on a trip by one of my servers (23F) and I’m not sure if it’s romantic or friendly.,"TL;DR: Server asked me to go on a long trip with her and I don’t know if she’s being oblivious, friendly or romantic. 

And a quick disclaimer:

I don’t care about your opinions of dating in the work place. It’s a ridiculous capitalistic ideal to not allow people people to date in the workplace. On to the post. 

So I’m the general manager of a small fast casual restaurant in my town. About a month ago, I hired a new server and then almost didn’t see her for the next few weeks because she was scheduled on opposite shifts from me. (My assistant manager does the schedules for the crew.) So I didn’t really get to know her. 

Well this past weekend, I worked with her. We talked a lot more and I’ll be honest, the banter definitely became flirty at some points. Well Monday rolls around and we are the first two in the restaurant so we got to talking about our families, our lives and stuff. I mentioned the fact that there are two specific states I want to live in. And it just so happens she’s from one of them. She then proceeds to invite me to go with her to that state in a couple of months for a festival in her hometown.

I was shocked because we barely know each other. And that’s a BIIIIG ask. This state is across the country and we’ve never even hung outside of work. Now, she is super cute and we definitely get along. But I’m not sure if she’s being friendly or is romantically interested. 

I did consider she might’ve mentioned offhand and didn’t mean it. So I asked her the day after, she replied “Yes! I would love to have you come”

So why do such a big part of me want to meet up with her again?? We were together for 10 years and Its been over two years since we split and my heart never healed from it.

A little over two years ago she started to fuck the guy ""i didn't have to worry about"", standard fucking thing. Completely shattered my world. Her response was when I asked what was going on between them (as i had suspicion) was ""im not sure, just having some fun seeing where it leads"". That's when i found out she had broken up with me a year ago, just never told me about it. This fucked me up beyond anything i could imagine as we were meeting up, talking and doing things as usual, just a little less than usual.

A week later she tried to kill herself, she cut open her wrists. I took her back. Only for her to refuse to cut contact with the guy. And on top of that started cheating with a new guy she worked with. I was unaware. Being a stupid trusting man.  When i found out was about a month into her ghosting me without a word. My dad saw it on her Facebook (i dont have any social media).

Broke me again and i blocked her on everything but my phone, because if she offed herself and i found out she tried to call me but couldn't; id never be able to live with myself.

Fast forward 1.5 years or so and during that whole time I've been streaming every Thursday and Sunday on twitch. Recording my online friends gameplay for our amusement. Got no viewers beside those people. All except my ex. She has watched about half of those 4 hours streams ever single week. Never said a word. But i can see her in the chat list. Messed up and weird.

Yesterday she sent me a sms asking simply ""how are you doing?"". It didn't affect me much, thought she just hoped id say i was fine (im really not) so that she could feel less bad. But today she sent me a message saying that the reason she asked was that she was so nervous and anxious and had been for a long time, to contact me. Because she really wants to see me.

The first few seconds of reading that i was like ""lol, fuck you"". And i blocked her. Then i had such a massive panic or anxiety attack I couldn't even sit up. I barely made it to bed and passed out for 5 hours. I just woke up now and typed this out.

41,pg1lxy,1630525908,There is a girl that I am stuck on pretty badly.,"I mean I understand that this is a story that probably has been told over and over again. But this is just my perspective and honestly just venting this out. It is kind of a long story, but I will try to summarize as best as possible.

There is this girl that I became friends with about a year ago. I had just moved into the area from across the country. Honestly at first we did not get along very well, I felt that she and I just had worldviews that were to opposed to even find some common ground. As time went on she gave me her number and we started chatting back and forth. 

This went on for quite a few months, but it got to the point that we would be confiding information in each other and asking for advice on things that happened. It got to the point that we were either hanging out or we were talking all day long. She normally is a very private person and doesn't share much about her life with people, even those she has known for a long time. 

Multiple times she has told me that I have become her bestfriend, and she genuinely puts forth a large amount of effort to be friends with me. 

A couple months ago I started to realize that I had feelings for her, and it has become stronger than I think I have ever felt before. So I came clean and told her how I felt and asked her to get dinner. We had quite a long conversation about this but it boils down to she doesn't want a relationship and she likes the dynamic that we have created and doesn't want to ruin that.

And this is fair in my mind, not everyone feels the same way and only I am responsible for my feelings. I have used the last month with trying to figure out how to move on, but I know that this is going to be hard with her still being such an active part of my life. I am just not willing to lose the friendship that we have created because at the end of the day I care about her as a person first more than I care about her as a potential relationship. 

TLDR: I really like this girl that has become one of my bestfriends, she is someone that is always on my mind and I care about greatly. She does not feel the same, and I am trying my best to move on with her still being actively in my life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pg1lxy/there_is_a_girl_that_i_am_stuck_on_pretty_badly/

46,pg1zt4,1630527042,Looking for some courage,"I feel like a dumbass teen who needs to explain every detail but it is what it is.

I've been out of the scene for quite a while. Last weekend we were at a teambuilding event and this colleague of mine started psyching me up to go talk to this new girl. I was reluctant at first but I eventually went to talk to her when she was at the beach (we were at a beach bar). Things went well but I was very awkward that night. Fast forward, and the next night that same girl keeps giving me looks and when I finally look back at her she smiles. I think "" damn, that guy was right."" 

We ended up sitting on the beach with another man and woman who were hitting it off. It was great. It was easy to tell she really liked me. We started cuddling and we were both enjoying it. As we were laying down, she got up and started talking to the other girl. I got up as well. Time passed. We started cuddling again. Again, she was obviously enjoying it. Yet a few moments later, she got up and said ""I'm sorry, I don't want to deceive you. I have a boyfriend."" I sort of knew.

The other couple left. We spent the next few hours talking on the beach, laughing. You know how someone looks at you right before you're about to kiss? That's how we looked at each other all night. Finally it was time to leave. I tried to kiss her but she said ""Please don't do these things"". And she got mad (at me or herself I dont know). I got upset too because she hinted that all men are like that. ""Try and if it works, great!"" We work from home these days and we're not going back to the office, so I told her we'd see each other after a year on another company event when she'd have a new boyfriend.

This is what bothers me. Her exact words were ""We don't have to only see each other at work. See, it's up to you and your imagination now."" She kept flirting with me all the way back. I stole a fake rose from the bar and gave it to her at one point and she couldn't stop looking at it with the biggest smile I've seen.

Now I've asked her once out for a lunch (you know, as a start) and she couldn't make it. I'll ask one more time tomorrow before giving up. 

I've been cheated on before and that's not what I'm going for. I'm just sick of every cool girl I meet being taken. And damn, do I like her. 

I'm expecting to get rejected, but it's been on my mind more than I care to admit. Just looking for some thoughts and encouragement here.

Everything was going great; she was even calling me on her own and sharing things about her family just two days before saying she doesn’t want to talk anymore.

51,pg2o0l,1630529050,Relationship success when approaching women,"I'm really interested, what your success rate is, when it comes to guys that are searching for a genuine connection or a relationship. 

My background: I'm 28 and been single for around 2 years. I was a nerd as a teenager and even when I started doing more sports, getting fit and simply living through puberty, most girls still knew me as a nerd and I had no real dating life in school. When I moved to study, everything changed. I met new friends organically and lots of women. I reinvented myself got more successful with women. It took some time, but eventually I met my first longtime girlfriend. Problem is: I never really did anything special. Some good dance moves in a club, keeping fit and hanging out with a lot of extroverted people, that liked to talk to strangers did the trick.

Fast forward a few years, my relationship fell apart and I'm moving to another city for an internship. Sure, it took some time to get over her, but that's not the topic now. I basically met a lot of new people, build new friendships but never someone worth going for. After a year, I moved back to finish my masters, started hanging out with friends from before and again, met new people. And still nothing worth pursuing. 
Right there's noone in my life, I have a crush on and I haven't had a date in over a year, OLD isn't working at all and i hang out with the same people every time.

I'm trying to use as many opportunities as possible, to go out, as the clubs in my area start to open again but my schedule is tight and I'm busy most weekends. 

Without any dating opportunities through friends, I'm starting to wonder, if it's time to start to cold approach women. But there is one thing holding me back: most girls are simply boring to me. Even my female friends don't really live a fulfilling life in my opinion and even though I meet and chat with them regularly and enjoy spending time with them, none of them have anything to say, that really interest me.
So when I think about cold approaching someone completely unknown with no clue about there social circle, state of mind and general vibe, I simply don't see the point.
Do you have success story's of cold approaching someone and having a real connection by sheer luck? Or do you try to cold approach in places, that usually guarantee some kind of common interest?

I met my last boyfriend on POF two years ago. He was the first person I messaged on the app and it worked out well for a year and a half. 

Anyway, back on the apps. Had one date, it was lovely but he didn't want to pursue any further. That's fine, he let me know up front. 

I've mainly used Bumble and Tinder. Of course on Bumble it's up to me to message so that's fine but barely anyone responds.. like I ask genuine questions from their profile. It's not just the 'Hi ☺️'. On Tinder I've messaged first plenty of times and applied the same logic of actually referring to a picture or something they have mentioned in the profile. You know foundation conversational skills 😂

What are guys looking for on conversation openers?

I don't know if they have even read the messages or not. But I would assume that if they did and didn't want to message they would un-match with me. 

It's just frustrating because I want to date, not specifically find the 'one', as I don't know what I want but dating should help determine what I want in a relationship and I can't even try when no one responds back.

54,pg3a2k,1630530917,"If someone with abandonment issues attempts to leave you, should you let them go or hold them tighter?","I (21f) am talking to my friend (19m) currently. We've only known each other about two months, but did feel a certain pull to each other that whole time. We both acknowledged we have feelings for each other three weeks ago, and have been attempting to take it slow. We did end up sleeping together two weeks ago, which unfortunately complicated things. He began pulling away, and I had to try really hard not to take it personally. He told me later that he was in a really hard position right now. He's been in an abusive relationship, and in his relationship after that in May, was cheated on. I personally have some abandonment issues as well that I'm in therapy for and have been for a while, so I understand the struggle.

This Saturday, we intend to have a talk. He's been pushing it off, which has honestly been making me a bit anxious. I do believe he will tell me that he is not ready for a relationship yet, and I believe him. But here's the thing: I have the patience to stick by his side, and I'm willing to use it on him. But I *need* him to communicate with me: he pulled away these last two weeks. Was that because of his abandonment issues, or because he simply is no longer into me? If that spark between us is still alive, I still think it's worth exploring.

A lot of articles say that if someone says they're not ready for a relationship, believe them. After all, if he's unsure of you right now, surely that means you deserve better than what he can give you. But it's literally only been three weeks since we've acknowledged our feelings, and that's not even taking into account the trust that we have to build up with each other. It's too early to tell either way. Not to mention, everyone deserves someone who tries to dig deeper past the defense mechanisms.

And I know it *can* be a defense mechanism for someone to try to leave if they're afraid. Perhaps this post won't even matter at all after Saturday; perhaps he will communicate that he just feels the spark is completely dead, and at that point, I'll have my answer. It's not a defense mechanism. It is a lack of interest.

But if he tries telling me that I deserve better, or that I shouldn't be waiting around for him... that just doesn't sit right with me. Should I hold him closer? Or let him go?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pg3a2k/if_someone_with_abandonment_issues_attempts_to/

As most of my friends left the city this summer and I'd happily meet new people, I thought Tinder might be a good place to go and make some connections. The thing is, I'm a virgin and I have the impression that sex and hookups are a predominant part of the interactions. Like in ""everyday life"" I do not analyse relationships as a market, but when it comes to Tinder, I do feel like it's pretty much it considered the features of the app. And I feel like a 22 yo male virgin would be pretty out of place on this app. 

Like I'd not write it on my profile and I also feel like saying it to my date after 2/3 meetups could deceive them. Am I wrong for thinking this? Or do I have to stick with other methods?

68,pg4725,1630533835,Thought I fell out of love,"I 22 (F) had been dating (22) M on/off for 5 years. The first 2 years were amazing, the last 3 I had broken it off with him once a year.

The reason ""I don't love him anymore""

We broke up properly last week, I decided this was the last time, then I had an epifany. Thing is I do love who he is, what I don't love is who he is pretending to be.

For the last 3 years he has been trying to get the 9 to 5 job, bought the family car, spending money on hobbies, never takes me out. He wants to raise his kids and die in the same place his whole life has been in.

Then it hit me, he wasn't living his life for him, he was living it for his family. He is a musician, a gamer, a techy not this washed up 'normal' wannabe. So I said it, I said that I saw him and I told him that we don't need to live his dads life (turned down being a rock star because his partner didn't like him being away, turned down having a killer overseas job because she didn't want to move the family)

Because I am that person, I WANT to move overseas for a few years, I WANT to have the dingy apartment in the city where we go to shows all the time. I am a writer/painter it's what I need to create and feel alive. Instead I got a house in the suburbs we grew up in, live an office job and was dragging my feet in the mud about marriage and kids. 

So, I am going to paint more, I will start writing the book I have been ignoring in my head for 2 years. I hope he starts making music again and finding out who he is.

I met a girl on tinder and we went to dinner, had a great night. We ended up having sex and she stayed the night. While in bed she talked about wanting me to be her boyfriend which I had no problem with, but I found to be **uncomfortable** since we just met. I made it very clear I wanted to take things slow but would not mind being exclusive with her and she agreed to be patient with me.

Later that week she invited me to dinner with her uncle and aunt that she was living with and showed me to her room before we left on our 2nd date. No sex but we had a great time together. 

Became extremely busy later in the week and she texted me good morning which I had not seen because of my work. We did text briefly later  when I stated how busy I was with everything and she seemed to understand. A day later, lo and behold she sent me a text about how she *""lost interest""* and basically gave me the *it's not you it's me* talk. 

Which is the one thing I for the love of god could not understand. How are you going to ask me to be essentially your boyfriend and days later tell me this? I've should've known it was a **huge** red flag trying to get serious on literally the first date. I won't lie I was angry and a little hurt but that's in the past. Right now this experience has left a nasty taste and I think I'm going to take a break for a while.

75,pg4o43,1630535344,"Advice to guys using dating apps, from a chica. Longer post but just wanted to share my thoughts from the past few years.","I've gotten back on dating apps more recently and there's some advice I want to give, also would be nice to hear feedback from others as well so I know if my advice is pretty shared by other women.

Someone on reddit, in some post from somewhere way back, once said: ""Men are like Lighters, Women are like Irons."" 

That analogy has stuck with me ever since I read it because of how generally insanely true it is (I'm speaking generally, I know there's exceptions). Women need *time* to get to know a guy, we're usually not BAM ready to jump into bed and be having wild uninhibited sex, we want to know if the guy we're going to be with is caring/kind/loyal/friendly/smart/our type/what the hell ever. Men seem to be able to move much more quickly with things but sometimes that can really cause timing issues. 

My friend tried meeting someone through Hinge recently and ""had the entire night ruined"" because the guy got way too ahead of himself and ended up ""grabbing her and sticking his tongue down her throat"" (her words) at the end of their very first meeting, which she was trying to keep casual (breweries/no dinner/they hung out and talked for over 4 hours). She said she was having a great time talking and liked the guy but was unsure the whole time if she really wanted to become romantic with him, and then he just made it uncomfortable. 

Also, it can make women uncomfortable when men instantly become romantic through texts/calls *before even meeting.* I know they mean well but...it makes it awkward. Example, if you start telling a woman ""You're so beautiful,"" ""why are you single?,"" assuming the girl you're texting is super into you already...it's nice, but that girl hasn't even met you yet and might *not* end up being that into you. So it's creating this awkwardness to get these messages even before meeting...a guy's been doing it to me who does seem nice and who I do want to meet, but now I'm wondering more if my irl appearance will be a disappointment to him, and I'm definitely not ready to be showing I'm head over heels for him because I don't even know him. I talked with another guy who I seemed to have a LOT in common with on paper, but when we met, we just had absolutely no chemistry. Apps open a door to let people become interested in each other but honestly you need to actually freaking *meet* first before assuming anything.

I feel like online dating/apps has made dating so strange - I do think it can work because I've met guys through apps who I ended up in longer relationships with, but the whole process of meeting someone almost blindly is very difficult and can get hella awkward. I should also say that I've dated a lot of guys, but the longer-lasting and more meaningful relationships I've had ALL began when I got to know the guy first over a lot of time (like, taking things slow/not having sex/meeting to just talk and hang out for months). 

Don't mean for this post to sound preachy, just, this is my own advice! I would love to hear men's advice to women! And to hear about others' experiences!

TL;DR - Dating Apps are *doorways* to meeting/connecting with men/women. Just because someone has ""liked"" you or is making time to meet you doesn't necessarily mean they're romantically into you quite yet, and women (and I assume a lot of men, too) need time to get to know you more before actually deciding if they're interested or not.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pg4o43/advice_to_guys_using_dating_apps_from_a_chica/

79,pg54ij,1630536826,I (28f) feel like I may have acted weird and pushed him (M28) away? Is there anything I can do to fix this?,"
I went on a date with a guy a month ago. It went very well and I definitely felt a strong connection and felt like he was very interested in me. For example he held my hand almost the whole night and he cuddled me all night and into the morning. 

I did get really tipsy at the end of the night and I spent the night at his place because I didn’t feel comfortable driving. We ended up having sex very briefly but I didn’t feel pressure to do so at all.  

This is when I feel like I could’ve gotten a little weird with him. I told him that I hadn’t done that with anyone in a very long time and that it’s going to take a long time for me to want to do that again with him. I don’t know why I said that but I did. I told him that I’m more the type of girl to want a commitment before that and I hope he doesn’t get the wrong impression of me. He said he was ok with that and did want to see me again and knew I wasn’t like that and respected me. 

The first time he hit me up post date was around 7pm on a weekend but I already had plans and was drinking with my friends so I told him that I could hang out with him but it would be later in the evening, he said to let him know and said he could pick me up if needed but then I’m assuming he fell asleep because he didn’t answer my calls. I know this is embarrassing but I called him five times that night. Then in the morning when he didn’t reach out to me I ended up texting him basically asking if he wanted to do some thing this week he replied that he did and asked what I was doing on Friday night and I told him I was free. 

So then Friday night comes around and it is 7 PM and I haven’t heard anything from him so I end up going out with my friends. I do end up reaching out to him though and he replies and asks me what I am up to. I tell him that I went ahead and went out with my friends because I didn’t know what time we were hanging out tonight. He then tells me that I can come over and hang out at his place if I want and he gives me his address but then I tell him I will not be able to come over until around 11 PM now. He then tells me that he is just going to go to bed and that we can plan for another Night next week. At this point I’m starting to think that he isn’t interested because I feel like if he really wanted to see me on Friday he would’ve tried to make plans with me ahead of time? 

So a whole week passes and I reach out to him that Thursday around 10 PM telling him that I am out with friends But if he is down to hang out we could tonight. He didn’t reply to that so than 24 hours later I reach out and say to him something like “hey I’m interested in you if you want to hang out again let me know.” He end up replying the following day telling me that he definitely wants to but he is out of town and that he will hit me up next week when he’s back. So then ANOTHER week goes by and it is Saturday night and i have liquid courage and I haven’t heard from him yet so I basically in a very forward way tell him that “if he wants to hang out tonight to let me know and again that I am interested in him but I wasn’t sure if he wanted to see me again.” He immediately replies that he wants to see me again and then he says let’s get together this week. I then reply two days later that I’d love to and that I am available Tuesday Wednesday Thursday. 


So part of me can’t help but feel like I’m doing something wrong here? I’m wondering if my comment on sex and commitment that night might have confused him or something?

I feel like he isn’t responding to me like someone if they are interested in a girl? Is there anything I can do to maybe clear the air if I was sending out weird mixed messages? 

I am very attracted to him and would love to have sex with him but I also feel at this point in my life I would like some form of a commitment before doing that. I think the way that I said that to him though was a little weird. But he seemed cool with it. 

I really felt like we hit it off on the first date and I know some guys might think that the girl is not dating material if she hooked up on the first date but he seemed to believe me when I told him that that’s not what I do normally. I just think that it’s really weird how he seemed really interested in the beginning and now he’s kind of giving mixed messages himself?

I also feel like if he did put me in some hook up category or whatever he would be even more proactive maybe about wanting to get together?

82,pg5eex,1630537747,WHAT DOES THIS MEAN PLEASE HELP!!!!,"So I have had the feeling that this girl at work likes me for awhile now. For context we're both 16 and I work in pretty small store so its almost always just 3 or 4 people in the store on a normal day. (you can also kind of see this as an update on that previous post I made, ill link it in the moments so you can catch up to what happened before this). And do I have a story to tell like...WTF. ok. so im going to try my best explaining this. Do keep in mind im dutch and translating this all into English so perhaps the tone will sometimes feel a bit of.

Okay so the first thing that got wtf in my head. I was at the cash register and she came over with her lunch to give me the check of her food and all that stuff so I say something like ""That food is good quality (sounds beter in dutch I promise💀)"" and she says back ""yeah good length is always good quality"" then she got a little embarrassed for saying that and we both laughed and she walked away. Note that she had a ""Pizza-sandwich"" sorry idk the English name. btut its round and not at all long or something like that

Alright so after she ate her lunch we're both just in the store and I saw her go out of her way 3 times to come over and talk to me she said the following: ""Hey I saw my English teacher in the store once and..."", ""Wow I got a really bad headache I really want to go home and..."" and ""Hey one time the grandma of my ex came to the cash register once and..."" She was so determined that people were lining up at the cash register where I was working and we both saw it but she still kept the conversation going as long as she could, this was with the English teacher stuff btw.

Alright the next thing that happened was that some stuff was about to fall so a had to hold it (im really tall and she's pretty short) so I had to stand behind her for a phew seconds and then she said in a playful flirty like tone ""Well don't stand to close at my back"" (again sounds beter in dutch but hey).

So after reading all this you're probably wondering why the hell I didn't ask her out yet right? well then this happened... So this guy came into the store and the best way to describe him was.. fuckboiish I guess? and they started talking like they really knew each other I couldn't hear what they're saying. Now I don't know this for sure if this was her intention but I did see her kind of looking at me to see if I saw them talking (she did btw💀) and after that well.. all the weird shit just stopped for the rest of the day, she didn't come up out of her way to tak to me anymore and when we talked it was very standart you know just words with no substance. 

Now later when I got home I did really think about it and I didn't think they hugged, I wasn't looking the whole time but I did saw them meeting and there wasn't a hug. but still I really did feel that they where close and I was scared it was her bf or something so I didn't ask her out. Why I see this as a huge mistake now is that I won't be seeing her for about 2 months or worse yet even more and that's if she or I don't have to quit because of school getting to busy and then I will never see her again. 

I would love some help to try and figure out what the hell happened today because I just get a headache thinking it al through and f there's stuff I gotta clarify just ask!

83,pg5fto,1630537874,How do you get over someone (a close friend) who showed a lot of interest and then pulled away when things got more serious?,"A long time friend of mine and I started flirting and going on these “almost dates” over the summer, with them keeping in constant contact with me and showing me a lot of attention. There were several hints that were dropped for me to ask her out. After a month or so, I did, and she said yes. 

But… she quickly started to pull away, and gave mixed signals. I asked her if I read things wrong by asking her out, and she said I didn’t, but she wasn’t ready to date after breaking up with her ex at the beginning of the summer, so she needed some time to be alone. I understand that, and we’ve been friends for a long time so I took her at her word and decided I’d give her space. She kept in contact texting me/sending me stuff on social media here and there, suggesting a movie we should watch together, but then started texting me less and less. 

Finally once I gave up and left her alone, she texts me last night about something mundane. I respond in the morning and she’s back to her super dry texting that show she’s not interested. Right when I thought my priorities were realigning, I can’t stop thinking about her again. Being emotionally unavailable and non confrontational as she is, I fee that sending a text to see where her head (or heart?) is at wouldn’t get much of a response. So I think my only option is to get over her. But I don’t know how..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pg5fto/how_do_you_get_over_someone_a_close_friend_who/
84,pg5i9w,1630538093,"I'm really sick of the ""guy's crush has an asshole boyfriend"" trope. Why is it so prevalent?","I've started watching Invincible, and while the show is good, this really irritated me. The main character meets a girl he has a crush on, then she's established to have a boyfriend, but the boyfriend is a jerk. While I haven't watched the whole show, this relationship isn't the main plot thread, so I doubt it'll switch up the formula at all.

Generally when this happens in shows, eventually the woman sees that the main character is better for her after all, and then breaks up with her jerk boyfriend. What annoys me about this trope so much is that I've never noticed this in real life.

Generally, if I find I'm attracted to a woman who has a boyfriend, he's generally a cool guy. The women I'd like to date actually have pretty good taste in men, and while I might be a bit jealous, I'm not going to try to ""win her over."" I just want to be happy for her and move on.

Generally the women I meet with jerks for spouses aren't the best either. In these cases, the woman generally has a lot of personality traits I really don't like, and I wouldn't care that they're taken because they're no catch.

It's kind of contradictory, anyway. If the woman is so amazing, she'd be smart enough to know the guy she's dating isn't worth it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pg5i9w/im_really_sick_of_the_guys_crush_has_an_asshole/

He's excellent on paper, he has an amazing job, he's mature, and very smart (maybe smarter than me). We have common interests.

The only problem is that he is ten years older.

I believe we are in the same stage of life. We both have full-time jobs and still live with our parents.

I'm asking if it's okay to date someone older than me because the majority of people that like me on the dating profile are men in their 30s.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pg5w5g/is_ten_years_too_much_of_an_age_difference/

So I thought ok he likes my body. So we have sex again today and he asks me again if I go gym. I said yes I do and he responds with 'well what about your stomache'? I was abit taken aback by this, as it's the first time someone made a comment like that about my body. (I do have a stomache it's in proportion to the rest of my body but I still am quiet insecure about it) I played it off cool at first and said well yeah I'd love a flat stomache but I also love food too much to restrict my diet. So he said well you need to have self discipline and work for it. I was like wtf, I mentioned to him if he has a problem with my stomache and he waved it off and said he likes my belly but he said this as he wants to motivate his girl and make sure she looks good.

92,pg6j9d,1630541729,My ex girlfriend texted me.,"Some context; we broke up around eight weeks ago and haven’t talked since. It was a personal choice not to message her due to my poor mental health over the sudden split, but now she’s texted me first and I don’t know how to handle it.

I am partially aromantic, I’ve realized that over the last year or so. Problem is I was coming to terms with that while my ex and I were dating. Meaning she constantly wanted more from me than my brain could physically allow, or physically handle. That was a big problem in our relationship. Before we ended up breaking up, for about two weeks she kept throwing me theoretical questions like “how would you feel if we broke up”, only for me to express express unhappiness in that situation, and stress that she was in fact going to break-up with me, only for her to convince me she had no desire to, and she was just thinking (which I took as a fair reason since we both have anxiety and have brains that tend to take on the worst case scenario.) But then she broke up with me, just like that. She said she wanted to face time or call to explain why, but I never gave her that chance and instead ghosted till now.

Monday she texted me though. Essentially her message was along the lines of “hey we haven’t talked in awhile! How are you?” And to say this message sent me into a BAD place is a bit of an understatement. I was not prepared to see her name light up my screen and yet it happened.

When I have a REAL crush they last a long ass time. Hence why I still have a crush on someone I haven’t spoken to in literal years. And we never even dated! So saying I still have major feelings for her wouldn’t be a stretch.

For awhile I was doing the whole “I’m totally over it, I’m dating now” thing and yea, that hasn’t worked.

I dunno how to handle this. I want to ghost her because mentally I know it’s a bad idea for me, but her and I genuinely clicked so well as friends even before we started dating. Having her in my life would be amazing.

I dunno what to do. This whole situation makes me nauseous with anxiety.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pg6j9d/my_ex_girlfriend_texted_me/
