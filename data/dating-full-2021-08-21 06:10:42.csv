We had a real good connection through text and couldn't wait to meet each other in person. Upon meeting, it was a little awkward at first. We ended up getting food and going out to the beach to sit, talk and watch the sunset. The conversation seemed to flow pretty well. There wasn't really any awkward silence and we had lots to discuss. Anyways, about an hour and a half into our date, in the middle of conversation she stops her story and says,
""Oh, we should get going."" And stands up and starts gathering her things. I felt really awkward because things seemed to be going pretty well. She talked all the way back to the car where we got in, talked some more and she dropped me off and that was that. It just seemed like it was cut short for some reason and I felt really awkward.

Afterwards I had realized that it was getting pretty dark out and there was nobody around, so maybe she felt vulnerable and realized that it was time for her to leave. She seemed like she was having a good time so it just threw me off. The date overall wasn't bad but it wasn't good either, and it sure was awkward. She didn't seem like she was very uncomfortable though, when she dropped me off, we hugged and said that we should do it again and that was that. This is my first date with a complete stranger, so maybe it's always awkward... I'm not sure if I should reach out and try to get a second date. Has anyone had any experience with an awkward and just decent first date that ended up getting a lot better as you got to know each other? Or should you always feel chemistry on the first date?

I texted her few hours later that I liked talking to her and would like to meet again if she's interested. She replied saying thanks for the date but she didn't said yes or no to if she's interested in meeting again.

I thought I wouldn't hear from her again but She texted me 5-6 days later saying ""good morning and have a good day"". We continue texting each other for about 2 weeks and one day we were having conversation and I asked her if she would like to hang out, she read my text but didn't replied right away, next day she replied saying she has plans for the day. I felt weird and thought I might be bothering her because we were having a continues conversion and she stop replying right when I asked her out. So I decided not text her for few days and wasn't expecting her text either. Few days later I got her text again in the morning I replied good morning and that's it I didn't try to have any conversation. Now It's been 2 weeks since we are texting, having random conversations but she never ask or say yes to meeting again.

I'm really confused about the situation and want to ask her why we are texting but not meeting.

He didn't want relationships. So that hurt.

I've been dating this really amazing woman for a bit now. We've gone on five dates in the past six months. The huge gap being due to me scaring her away with a drug reference from my past. It was cleared up after a few months when we came in contact again.

Well since we started speaking again and cleared that up, we've been on two dates. The last date was a day trip to a nearby city. I had an amazing time, but was often somewhat preoccupied with overthinking and a lack of confidence, as those are currently very dominant traits I have unfortunately.  During the date we briefly and scarcely held hands and kissed, seemed like everything went great so I was kinda thrown off from this next part. 

Since that day, she hasn't really been speaking to me much. We will go a week (give or take a day) without talking. I'll say something basic while still giving her the opportunity to build on it, but she will usually just say a closed statement without asking me anything. If that makes sense... When she does that, I don't say anything else usually since she made it a point on our trip to tell me about someone else she was dating that she felt was promoting her to respond but she doesn't feel like she should have to on anyone elses time, she doesn't owe them anything. 

Maybe I took too much stock in her saying that and just can't take a hint. I'm just trying to figure out my next move. I want to know where I stand but I also don't want to come off not confident or make her feel pressured. I also wonder if I scared her again with something I said. I'm really open about my past although I've been holding back with her. She also mentioned how her last serious relationship did a number on her, so I am willing to be patient and open since I really like her. I keep bouncing back from ""well why won't she tell me if she's not interested and just keep responding?""

I'm a 27 M and I've struggled with dating for the past 10 years. I've had 1-2 girl friends in high school but ever since college, I've never had a steady relationship. I've had some flings and 2-3 hookups but nothing that led to anything fruitful.

I just turned 27 this year and I realize that I've become a very resentful and angry person especially when it comes to dating. I've been rejected probably 95% of the time on dating apps, probably over 1000 different girls over the past 8 years. 90% of the girls I do match with rarely ever reply, even the ones that message me first.

The majority of my dating experience has been via online, so I realize that I've been missing out on more genuine relationships I could have from meeting girls in real life. The thing is, with COVID being a thing the past 2 years, I haven't had a lot of opportunity to meet people in real life settings. Anyhow I've become extremely cynical over the 8 years of online rejection to the point that I am so sick of it.

I've been told I'm not bad looking by different friends who are women, I hold a decent prestigious job that pays well. However, for the life of me, I can't secure a date! I don't think I lack in personality but I do feel like I am different than the typical dude you would meet on a dating app. I am also Asian American, which statistically puts me in an undesirable category when it comes to online dating.

I'm at a point of my life where I have everything going for me but I've never felt so lonely. I don't think I can take another rejection or being ghosted again. The years of that have definitely taken its toll on my mental health to the point where I feel like I've become slightly misogynistic, not by choice but because of how I feel I am treated by many of the women I've encountered on dating apps and in my personal life.

Before you read this and assume I'm an narcissistic asshole, just realize I've spent 20+ years of my life living with a mother who was a narcissist who never showed me any affection and constantly belittled me daily. I don't want to play the victim card and I'm not. I've just experienced a lot of hate from women and especially the one closest in my life and I've fought my entire life to stay decent and preserve good values. So just try to understand where I'm coming from. It just sucks that despite how much I try, I am never good enough. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. And for me, I spent the early years of my 20s improving myself daily to where I am today - which on paper looks great and successful, but I don't feel successful at all.

At this point I feel like giving up. Honestly all I've ever wanted in my life was to love and be loved, but after 20+ years of searching, I've found nothing. No one to give two shits about me, but I understand the world doesn't owe me anything. Perhaps I deserve where I am in life, but I would trade all my ""successes"" just for someone loving to be in my life. But life has given me a life time of suffering and lemons. I just have to deal with it.

I feel so angry with life, and I can't help how I feel despite trying to logic my way out of it. I just want something to change and I want to be happy. I want to **not** be cynical, angry or slightly misogynistic. But my life experience has put me here. I guess this is a cry for help or something. I don't expect anyone to sympathize or care, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out.

To start with: I'm a 20-year-old male student from France. Practically zero relationship experience though I've been in three short-lived LDRs. I've been spending years researching about love and relationships in order to figure myself out. I found but also left even more confused, hence I decided to write about it. 

I'm your typical socially awkward introvert. That said, I can be social and I'm self-confident, I just happen to be a loner and need loads of me-time. However, corona had a huge effect on me and my social life. I went through tough times and I've been working on myself deeply for many months. I'm getting more social but I've been wondering about my relationship situation. I'm a happy single but I've always had a very strong desire to experience love. Whilst my head says I shouldn't do anything to change my situation for now, my heart constantly says otherwise.

Here are my problems. I have a dilemma related to an important decision: I'll move out of my country within two years. I thus see no point in seeking a relationship when no future is guaranteed. I can't help but think about the future. Also, I decided to take on long and ambitious projects, this will deeply affect any potential relationship. Besides, I have social issues due to not being able to relate to 95% of people my age and basically feeling like a foreigner in my country, hence 95% of my friends have always been foreigners. I may also be on the autistic spectrum.

Other factors: I became a Hindu so this entails some things (attitudes towards sex, a special lifestyle...), I have deep intimacy issues (fear of sex and other things), I'm very picky (especially since I'm looking for a like-minded person with similar interests and values. They do exist but are quite rare), I don't understand relationships (I actually don't see why I should be in one despite wanting it, I see more cons than pros), I have some baggage and I'm very sensitive (tough past, difficult family situation), I have special views on finances and I'm in a complicated financial situation. And so on.

I know I can attract *some* girls (mostly like-minded ones), but: they're always foreigners so this entails a LDR and I don't really want to get into one again; also, there's still the future aspect which scares me out; and in my limited experience I found out I'm more sad than happy when in a (LD) relationship. I'm still facing the dilemma: **should I stick to being single until I move out or should I still try to seek a relationship through potential friendships?** I'm pessimistic about my chances anyway. I tried online dating and I swore never to do it again. And IRL I don't know how to find like-minded people. My past year experiments at uni had mixed results: I met some people but I couldn't relate to anyone.

I've tried taking breaks from dating. Being more honest. Last night I was like okay, first date. We talked about guitars and we were having a good time and he lived just up the road and it nice conversation and humour. I laid out all my things, not comfortable with intimacy just first date etc. Of course he kissed me and in the moment was nice but yeah, boob groping and tried to touch me down there three times which I physically pushed away and got upset I wanted to leave. Tried to convince me to stay. Told him I didn't want to like 6 times maybe more. Wtf am I doing wrong. Why aren't people listening to me.

I'm not good at lying but I need a strategy

Its looking increasingly likely that I'll have to have a catheter, and in the meantime I literally have to wear pads or a nappy if I'm working or out of the house as I can't feel or notice bladder movements at the moment. 

It's made dating impossible.

I already haven't dated for 5 years, but I was starting to get my confidence back and feeling sexy and now I have to wear a nappy. I feel like not only can I no longer approach women, but if women approach me I automatically run away, and then beat myself up about it later.

Are there any tips for dealing with medical conditions that affect your sex drive/dating desires? I go through cycles of desperately wanting to meet someone but also hating that anyone I wanted wouldn't want me back because I'm incomplete (I know Im not, but it's the easiest way to describe the feeling). The bladder thing isn't going away, and is now just a part of my life... but I'm worried it means that I'll never find someone because of it.

In March, however, after we had been snapping for like a week (which I initiated) and having really nice/flirty convos, he texted one of our mutual friends and said that he was picking up on a vibe that I liked him and that he only saw me as a friend. I was devastated, naturally, but I had the mutual friend deny that I had feelings for him at all. I acted totally normal around him, but I was literally so heartbroken. About six weeks after this, however, he and I and a few other friends went to a party together and he and I pretty much hung out together the whole time talking. Things sort of felt different and I felt myself falling back into him. Anyways, since then hes read 2 of my favorite books and texted me to talk about them and hear what I think, hes swiped on my Snapchat stories about music I’m listening to…I feel myself falling back into love with him and I feel so heartbroken. Should I move on? Should I hold out? We go back to college in a week. I want to be with him more than anything. Was that text a rejection, even though I never told him how I felt?

When we first met up everything was great! He was respectful and gentle. We went out for drinks and I had one or two beers, but he went hard and got way too drunk. And the more he drank, the more he started to get handsy. I told him a few times to cool it, and he would back off a little then come back and start getting too touchy again. I told him at the end of the night that if he didn’t respect my boundaries I would leave. First he got really pouty and petulant, like a kid that wasn’t getting any candy. He then held on to me and put his hand on my throat and didn’t let me go for a minute.

I went home after that, and he sent me some very drunk nonsense texts, and he said twice he thinks he loves me. This all screams red flags to me, obviously. He seems like a very lonely man who got too fucked up, but his behavior got scary fast. I don’t know how to tell him that his actions put me off, because I’m afraid of how he will react.

Im starting to think a girlfriend sounds nice. will that be C? I have no idea. Idk how much I like her or why I do. We don't have too many hobbies in common but she has a sense of wonder that I am really drawn to. She just wants to try stuff and its pretty cool. I feel I have been fearful of many things for a while. She is kind of dark, and little bit of an animal. but seems so nice. Last time we hung out we drank too much. Where is she at in life right now? She says she loves seeing all the people when we go out. What is she really looking for? does it line up with what I'm looking for? What am I looking for?

I havent felt butterflies in almost 7 years.

Chapter 3

8/18/21

Well I told her about the seedling of emotion that was taking root, and kind of crashed and burned a lil. She does not share the same feelings. She says she has attachment problems stemming from a traumatic childhood (we talked for hours after I spilled my guts). She also might be in a very independent stage of her life. Similar to how I felt a couple years ago. Walls are up. I respect that. She's too cool to be mad or sad over. Although I am bummed. I don't know how I feel exactly. Some form of sadness/loss but not heartbroken.

I think I've come up with a few ways to express it.

My last girl f'ed me up. After that, I put up some gigantic walls. And let no one inside, and would not even let people approach. Over time, people stopped trying as I slept through a loveless life. work, home, weekend, work, home, weekend. And these walls disintegrated, I had no idea. And so when I met C, I had no protection and my feelings spewed out and filled this idea of what C is and who she might be to me.

When I talked to her about my feelings. This idea was destroyed-obliterated. The initial explosion hurt and continues to hurt, but the fallout seems to be warm. I feel like I can feel things again, like the emotion I was exuding came back.... aand she is still in my life. :)

Its like lighting an old stove. You turn the pilot light on then let the burners go full blast. C turned my pilot light on and I cranked up the burners. She then came back and turned the burners off but left the pilot lit. She is still in the room somewhere, probably cracking a beer.

Maybe I can control how much heat I put out a lil better. At the end of the day, its okay to crash and burn. C is still around. And the butterflies I felt, which I hadn't in sooooooooo long. make it completely worth it. I am very thankful she is a part of my life. Still, it hurts a lil and where do I go from here?

I made a mistake based on insecurities, and I regret it. Long story short, I was sexually assaulted a few days before talking to a guy I had met on Tinder. We were talking about being friends with benefits. He seemed nice, was willing to get tested, and wear a condom no problem. I told him I was going to get tested too, but was still uncomfortable/very much in denial about what happened to me a few days prior. We talked for one day, then I unmatched him/unfriended him in fear that something similar would happen again. 

I forgot that I had given him my number, and he reached out to me. Told me he was getting tested, and asked if I was still interested. At the time, I really didn't know what to say to him except, ""Something not so great happened to me before I met you."" I told him I was interested, we set up a day we wanted to hang out, and I ended up ignoring him.

Once again, this complete stranger, texted me and asked if I was still interested. He told me he was walking through the doors of the facility and was about to get blood drawn. Was I still interested? I finally said yes. I asked him to hang out later that day. He ended up being the sweetest person I had ever met, without any ill intentions. We ended up making out, and it led to me giving him a blowjob. That's all that happened. 

He texted me later that night saying that we should hang out again soon. I told him I wanted to make it up to him for being so cold at the beginning and take him out on a date. He agreed. We started sexting. He told me he wanted to have sex with me, and I told him I wasn't comfortable having full on sex, I would give him blowjobs. I told him once again, something not so great happened to me. 

He asked me what happened, and I finally told him I was assaulted before talking to him. That's why I was so hesitant at the beginning. I don't blame him for not wanting to go on the date with me.

She started to get really upset and walked away to the bed and closed the door so I assumed she didn’t want to be around me so I stayed where I was. 

Fast forward I make it to the bed and she’s crying and making everything my fault about how she just wanted attention and I couldn’t give it to her. Thing is I was planning on taking her out in this big date day today and so I was trying to get as much sleep as I could so we could have a fun day today. Wel here we are it’s 10am and she’s still sleeping and we won’t be able to do one of the activities already. Last night she kept blaming me and freaking out and I told her she was making me angry because I was only sleeping because of how tired I was and not that I was ignoring her, and that I just wanted good sleep for our day out which I was the only one planning everything. I told her she was being selfish and got a little too angry and left for an hour at midnight to calm myself down. I got back, went to the bed where she was awake and she turned the other away ignoring me and we haven’t talked since.

Skipping forward, I took her out for a last time about two months ago, &amp; we had a great time. She even went in for the kiss this time. Almost immediately after the date, she told me she had a great time &amp; really enjoyed herself.

Well a week or so after this date, she messaged me telling me that i'm a great guy, &amp; she always had a great time with me, but she doesn't see it going any further. I told her that it was fine, and that we could still be friends. I really kind of shrugged it off &amp; played it cool. She agreed, &amp; said awesome because we get along amazingly.

Fast forward again to about two or three weeks ago. I live about 45 minutes or so away from her, and I went out on a first date with a new girl. This first date was in her hometown. After this date, I go to drive home, and I get a text from the first girl telling me that her friend saw me on a date at this brewery. Well ever since this incident, she's been trying really hard to express interest for me, and has been flirting with me.

I went on a date with her again this last week, and wow, I forgot how much I liked her. It was great, &amp; we already agreed to see each other again soon, but part of me really wonders why she originally lost interest? Did I flip her jealousy switch?

I’m currently in a long-term relationship. Unfortunately we’ve been facing a lot of issues, I think we’re both realising it’s coming to an end and we are more like friends than lovers.

Recently I met a girl under strange circumstances. I’ve seen her around, and we ended up on a 3 hour journey together. She’s a very shy, independent intellectual girl with a kind heart. She puts her career and family first before anything else. She doesn't drink or party. She knows I’m in a relationship, but we chatted as friends for a while. It turns out we have a lot in common and are at similar stages in our lives. We like pretty much the same things, we have the same hobbies and the same views on most things. Towards the end of our conversation, she offered me her number which I hesitated with. I know it was wrong to take it, but I took it in the intention we would just be friends. I definitely felt a strong connection between us but I could be completely wrong.

A couple of days past and we started texting. Again, I need to stress there has never been any flirting or asking to meet up to this present moment. The text messages turned into very long paragraphs for a few days. There would only be around 3 or 4 texts a day, but they were long. We started sharing every detail about ourselves. I would ask her how her day was sometimes when she finished work, she would tell me what she was making to eat.

I felt myself getting more drawn in. I started realising quite fast I was starting to fall for her. She asked me about my relationship eventually, to which I responded with the truth. I explained we were living like companions, and how I really need to sort my life out because I’ve not been happy for a long time in that area. I apologised for putting that information on her, and she said she was sorry to hear it but good to get things off your chest. She’s never made any indication that she’s interested, but instead will always be curious about my life. The most I’ve ever done is gave a couple of compliments, but she hasn’t reacted to these or cuts the conversation short.

Over the last few days, it appears things have taken another direction. She no longer seems as eager to talk to me. The texts have dropped dramatically, when she does reply I would say 50% of the time she will ask a question. The other day she told me at the end of her text she won’t be able to talk to me until the next day, because she had no mobile coverage in the area she was going (we only talk over text message).

I can’t work out exactly what’s going on, whether she doesn’t like me at all like that, or if she does slightly but is choosing to stay clear. The last thing I want to do is continue talking to someone who doesn’t want to hear from me. I just find it strange the way it was at the beginning, and how it is now.

I feel guilty saying there is a connection, and I would never be the person to cheat. I know my first priority is to end this relationship, but should I just completely stop talking to this girl for a while to see what happens?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,966822,public,self,"Input from girls needed, would you pursue someone in an unhappy relationship?",0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p8xaen/input_from_girls_needed_would_you_pursue_someone/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

Your heart flutters. As you turn your face to hide your shyness, you think to yourself, “What just happened?”. Your curious mind needs certainty. You look again. His gaze affixed, beating you to the punch. 

He never turned away.  

This is the moment of truth. An opportunity plucked from happenstance and hand delivered by Eros himself. 

A chance at love? Perhaps. Minimum expectation? Another whiskey sour.
