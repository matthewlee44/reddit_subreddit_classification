0,p9wsvh,1629713533,"""Red flags""","This is just me expressing an opinion.  
I feel like this expression gets thrown around a lot these days, and sometimes in a way that is really quite condescending, hate-filled and downright toxic.  
A ""red flag"" is something I thought to mean a character trait of a person that doesn't align with your values or doesn't attract you personally. Or someone who has deep issues with something - narcissistic personality disorder, alcohol, drug abuse, racist/sexist, being verbally and/or physically abusive, etc. Things like that. But people tend to use the term very loosely too - like say you get hurt or emotionally affected by something and want to talk about it and then that's suddenly a ""red flag"". Or maybe you have a bad day where your confidence is less than usual, and then that's a ""red flag""? Or maybe you handled something badly in the past, learned from your mistakes, changed completely and improved your ways, but then because of that one moment in time you have ""red flags"" in you, like you're just a bad person for life? I've seen people use this term so loosely like as if someone is unable to change or improve or become better. We're all works in progress. No one is perfect. By that logic we all have red flags all the time, but I think that's a belittling, disdainful and highly negative way to perceive human beings. We all have things to work on and most of us are just doing our best to become better each day.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p9wsvh/red_flags/

6,p9xbr2,1629715840,Sudden repulsive syndrome - is it self sabotage?,"Hey r/dating! 

I've been on 3 dates with this guy that I was really excited about, but ive been struggling with what i've come to learn is called ""sudden repulsive syndrome"" or ""the ick"": 

""A condition many people experience after dating an individual for a short amount of time. The individual is probably polite, nice, and generally pleasant to be around, **but one day, you suddenly find yourself disgusted by his or her appearance or actions""**

This seems to become a frequent thing with me. I meet someone, I get excited and then on our second or third date there is something insignificant about the persons mannerisms that changes my view of them completely. I've never come back from this, I havent found a way to reverse it so when it happens I've just come to accept that I cant really do much about it. 

I wonder if anyone else has this issue? I guess its worth to mention that I struggle with anxiety, depression and I was a polysubstance abuser (clean 9 months). My therapist thinks it may be some sort of self-sabotage mechanism that happens unwillingly, but we havent been able to reverse it and its very disheartening. I dont feel like its fair to keep dating people because it kinda feels like I string them along in a way? I dont like hurting people.

So I’ll admit I’m pretty inexperienced in this area &amp; this is kinda long so bear with me. 

I matched with this guy online, I wasn’t super into him but he was quite interested so I was like meh whatever I want to meet new people. So I asked him if he wanted to go for a walk &amp; just hang out, he accepted &amp; we met up yesterday.

When I first met him I was like ok he looks better in person but I’ll treat it as a friends vibe. We walked around this park chatted, it was good but I just felt I was hanging with a friend. 

Finishing the date/meeting he asked for my number I was like sure whatever. Then at the end I hugged him &amp; and I had my hand on his shoulders &amp; he had his hands around my waist &amp; he kind of held me there &amp; I could tell he wanted to kiss so I was like fuck it &amp; went for it, but I didn’t feel anything.

13,p9y231,1629718840,complete 180,"So I et this girl at a party, introduced by a mutual friend. She was super touchy and flirty, asking me lots of questions, getting close etc. etc. I asked her for her number at the end of the night, and texted her the next day, asking her out for a drink. She agreed and asked me when I was free. I said Tuesday night. She waited 36 hours til 1130 on monday night to get back to me, apologizing for being 'disorganized'. I said no problem, and we met up the next night.

She asked me lots of questions about my dating history, what I look for in a woman. She refused to call it a 'date' in spite of all that, but i was adamant that it was of course a date. Two people getting together and seeing if they have a romantic connection. I told her I wasn't interested in just being friends. She commented several times that I was 'bold' and 'smooth'. As we left the restaurant we held hands and I gave her a soft kiss as we walked. We went to another bar and had another couple of drinks. She was very touchy and affectionate throughout. We kissed again a few times, and walked back to the subway, which was now closed. We walked round the corner to get cabs, sat on a bench and got pretty physical, kissing, touching, close contact etc. I ordered my cab and told her she could come back to mine if she wanted. She agreed with very little hesitation, although she said ""i know what type of guy you are...you're a scorpio, sex is your love language...I've been fucked over by guys like you in the past'. I said she had no idea what kinda guy I was and she'd have to take a risk.

We got the cab home and we got in to bed. We lay there for a while and kissed a little, although she batted me away when I tried to get more physical - repeating the same thing - 'I know what you're like' etc. I rolled over and we went to sleep. Next morning we woke up and we carried on cuddling, I rubbed her back and we chatted, she lay next to me hugging me etc etc., but no sex. I flirted a little with the boundary but I kept it kosher. Anyway, time to get up. We get dressed and go downstairs, drink a coffee and chat some more. She gets her stuff together and leaves, and gives me a tender kiss goodbye on the doorstep.

That evening I texted her 'I had a great time, would love to see you again soon'. and I got nothing back. I sent no follow up text, and just let it lie. TEN DAYS later, she texts me this:

Hey, I hope all is well with you. You're an awesome person but I want to keep things platonic between us. I want to be transparent as I feel you deserve that'. I replied 'that's a sweet message, so thanks, although I'm not impressed at all with how long it took you to send it. I'd love to get to know you better but I'd be lying if I claimed platonic intentions. Get in touch if you change your mind but bye for now xx

So weird. She seemed heavily in to me throughout the night, it just seems like a total flip around. People change their minds with the benefit of hindsight but I can't shake the feeling that she was up for the chase. Maybe gave herself away too much in the beginning, and had to pump the brakes.

3. If your husband decided to move out of the state or the country, would you go with him?
4. Would you quit your job and take care of the kids when you had babies?
5. Would you be a stay home mom? 

We went to the beach to watch sunset. He almost couldn’t wait to ask me these questions after we found our seat. Apparently watching sunset wasn’t of his interest at all. I didn’t get a chance appreciating nature either because he kept asking these questions. 

On our way to the beach, he complained about his ex girlfriend not contributing financially and dependent on him. She was a struggling actress. He also complained that she liked to dine out all the time (again it’s about money).

On our way back home, he asked me whether I’d sign a prenup if the guy asked to do so. He’s not a billionaire but an average person who holds a job, like me. 

Other than that, he was very generous with giving compliments on how I looked. It was very generic, not so genuine compliment though. So I got bored of his compliments soon but still tried to show appreciation.

I’m sitting here thinking 

The societal expectation is “stay within your lane”, don’t feel entitled to a supermodel, because supermodels mostly date other supermodels

“Get realistic expectations of a partner, and you’ll be happier” 

Etc etc. 


Just get someone less attractive but with a great personality, and learn to love them for who they are, as we would hope they love us for who we are 


Now, I don’t feel entitled by any means to a supermodel nor do I particularly want one right now. 

But I wanna play devils advocate and say, don’t you think there is something deeply disconcerting and despairing about this sense of absolute finality in sex and relationships? 

At least for me, it’s like a caste system we all just unconsciously accept. Models are the upper cast, then there’s average, below average castes, etc. We know it’s probably a good idea to “date in your league” to avoid disappointment 

I think we all know that the higher the “caste” of attractiveness you are, the more life opportunities and pleasures present themselves to you. Some superficial, others quite deeply enriching. And as a supermodel “caste”, it’s just accepted, and perfectly natural, that sex, dating and relationships with other beautiful people *just happen* organically 




I guess what I’m trying to say here is that, this unofficial, universally accepted heirarchy of looks we disappoints me, and only because I’m a loser in the heirarchy. Should I ever dream of dating a higher caste, I’ll be screamed down as a pig or all manner of belligerent insult 

To me beauty is a wonderful thing, and to wake up every day knowing that I’m effectively forbidden since birth. from easily accessing the world of beautiful people’s dating, hurts my soul.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa1jq4/theres_something_deeply_agonisingly_about_knowing/

35,pa21hk,1629732213,How do you stay motivated when using dating apps?," 

I have tried dating apps on and off a few years (I am a straight female). I typically use bumble and hinge. I want a relationship, but it has seemed impossible to find someone who I feel attracted to, can have good conversation with, and is interested in me and willing to be in a relationship.

Here's a recent example. I matched with a guy on bumble, we texted for about two weeks. We had pretty good text conversations and then met up for drinks and ended up spending about 3 hours. The conversation was very easy, we had a decent amount of stuff in common. I could tell he wasn't someone just seeking a hook-up. When we parted he told me to text him to let him know that I got home okay. I text him later to let him know and he tells me he had a good time. I say me too and ask do you want to meet up again sometime. He messages me the following afternoon saying nice things about my looks and my intelligence, that the conversation was good, but that he feels no spark. It's not me it's him, apologizing etc. I then notice that he deleted his bumble account too.

Living up to someones expectation that you should have a spark after meeting off an app for the first time is a really high bar to meet and somewhat unrealistic IMO, but I don't want to focus on that too much as that is one person. I don't want to seem like I am letting one experience affect how I feel. For me it is a combination of poor experiences. I've used these apps for a while now off and on and it rarely leads to anything positive. I always seem to encounter two common situations: guys looking for a hookup/very casual situation (I often don't meet up in person with these matches, as I can more easily discern that it is not a good fit) or guys who seem normal, nice, select that they would be open to a relationship on an app and act interested but then kind of flip on you later. Basically, even the guys on the apps who indicate they would be open to a relationship often don't seem to be in the end.

I know people say to not take any of this app dating too seriously or be too hard on yourself but as a human it takes a toll sometimes and things can bother you whether you want them to or not. However, meeting someone naturally in real life is really unlikely in my current situation, so the apps seem to be the tool I have to keep using. The problem is that I increasingly get the feeling that maybe the people out there for me, if they exist, are not on the apps and I'll just never meet them.

Have any of you encountered similar challenges? How do you stay motivated to keep using the apps/meet up with more people and maintain a positive mindset?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa21hk/how_do_you_stay_motivated_when_using_dating_apps/

We‘re texting a lot, have a good time when we see each other and we like each other. He makes me laugh a lot. I feel very comfortable around him. He‘s really sweet. We went on 3 dates in total (he went on vacation for a while after our second date).

Even though he is pretty talkative with me and seems to trust me with telling me certain things I think he’s pretty shy and I don’t know what to do. I enjoy his company a lot (and I told him that) and he enjoys mine.

We haven‘t even really talked about what the other was looking for but I’m planning on doing that the next time we see each other. Normally I try to just go for the things that I want but I don’t wanna mess things up with this guy.

For the first date we had ice cream at a park and talked for a couple hours, the second date he asked me out for dinner and last night on our third date I went over to his place to watch a movie. And that was all we did. We watched a movie. I wasn’t expecting to hook up since I wanna take things slowly but we didn’t even cuddle or anything. Of course I also don’t wanna make him uncomfortable but how do I get him to loosen up with me? Not for hooking up but I want him to be more comfortable in general. What do I need to do? I tried putting my head and arms close to him without being too aggressive. I initially wanted to put my head on his shoulder but though that might be too much for him.

He mentioned that he‘s a very awkward person (and I can see that) so I’m assuming it‘s hard for him to be more assertive. Do I need to take on that part for him? Can a shy person try and tell me what to do? I‘m not the most outgoing person myself. Or does anyone have experience with a shy partner?

54,pa3vdd,1629737685,“Girlfriend” essentially ghosted me,"
Earlier this year, I(25M) moved across the country for a new job. This was a complete new area to me that I barely knew. My job is mostly working alone so I don't get too much social interaction on a day to day basis aside from small talk. About 3 weeks after moving here I meet K(22F) through a dating app. She lives about an hour away from me, we FaceTime several times and instantly hit it off very well. Go on a few dates, and seem to be developing quite nicely. Before I know it essentially 2-3 months later we are dating pretty fully, sleeping at each others houses multiple times per week, and I even met her family once although it was by accident.

From the beginning we agreed to take things very slowly and let the relationship develop naturally. About three months in, I am on my way to visit K and spend the night there when she tells me she bought a bottle of liquor and is insistent on us drinking for some reason. I am not a huge drinker, but agreed nonetheless (I Know my limits pretty well.) We end up having about 4-5 shots. I know this is enough that will give me a good buzz but she got way more drunk than me. She starts telling me she loves me and wants to fully date me for real and stupid me believes it all and thinks Im really falling for this girl. The next few weeks or so go very well as our attachment seems to be growing.

Then due to our busy schedules, we aren't able to see each other for about a week. We had plans to hang out on a Monday night. I text her but she never answers me until later the next day.(pretty uncommon, we would always answer rather quickly) Meanwhile she posted on her snapchat story at 4-5AM several snaps of her out partying all night with 2 new guys she had met. She knows I am not the party type like that and that could be why she didnt ask me but I still feel like I deserved an explanation or something. She texted me back the next afternoon just saying hey and how her night was wild. I tell her (without trying to play the blame game) that I was really looking forward to hanging out and that I was somewhat uncomfortable with her behavior the previous night. We were pretty open and honest about everything and I had always been respectful towards any feelings and boundaries she had. 

This was the first scenario where something like this happened in our relationship and she immediately got defensive. We end up getting into a long argument through text and agree to FaceTime later that night because nothing was getting accomplished. We talk on FaceTime and things seem somewhat patched up (I never felt crazy hostility at any point) We never fully had a full resolution to everything yet when her phone dies mid FaceTime (this happened quite often when we would FaceTime, I could tell because it cut out mid sentence.) She never calls me back, so I decide to go to sleep and well talk the next day. I send her a good morning text and she answers in the afternoon how ""she isn't ghosting me but just wants some time to process everything."" I simply say ok well talk when you're ready. She then proceeded to not reach out at all for several weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I only sent 1 short follow up text a little over a week later saying I would really like to talk but other than that nothing. It has now been over a month and she still never hit me up. I pretty much accepted its over at this point but it all feels so fucked up like how can you do that after everything that we had been through. If you would have told me the last time I saw her would be it I would never believe it. It wasn't even like a breakup it was just nothing. 

I ended up just blocking her on social media recently and deleting her number in my phone and trying really hard to forget about everything but like I really dont see where I went wrong with anything. Maybe I am just older and more mature and she wasn't ready for the relationship and changed her mind?Is there something here I am missing???

 But to never talk about any of it or resolve anything or get any closure was really getting to me so I just had to shut her out and now am trying to completely move on which I am having a very hard time doing. I never made too many friends in this new area since I pretty much met her right after moving here and now several months later, it has been very difficult dealing with this whole situation. This has definitely taught me to make sure I really get to know who someone is first in any future relationship and definitely not get emotionally attached too quick because this was fucking horrible.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa3vdd/girlfriend_essentially_ghosted_me/

TLDR: Girlfriend emotionally cheated with friend and now having I’m having problems trusting future friendships 

My Girlfriend (F22) and I (F20) have been dating for almost a year. We went long distance for about 3 months during the summer due to school break and I’ve just recently (about a week ago) returned. During the summer my girlfriend admitted to having a crush on one of her coworkers who was her friend. She didn’t outright physically cheat but it still hurt nonetheless as she had denied liking her for months and would lie about communicating/ hanging out with her. She’s since cut off all contact with her coworker and changed jobs. While I’m grateful for the steps she’s taken to help rebuild our relationship..I’m still a bit hurt and weary of future friends. Every time she’s met someone new recently and have showed interest in becoming friends, I get this gut wrenching feeling that this can happen all over again. I know trust is absolutely needed in a relationship and I really love her and can’t imagine breaking up but it’s really hard. 

She’s complained that I’ve been smothering her lately and has suggested spending less time together to do different clubs. I know that is a absolute reasonable request and would have no issue with this in the past but now just the thought gives me terrible anxiety.

I’ll add that I don’t get these feelings when she hangs out with the friends she had before knowing me…just new people.

I end up getting hurt and told her I could no longer be her friend or spend time together because it wasn’t fair to me if I kept sticking around when she was talking to other guys while I sat and watched. So we end up not talking for a few months and she reached out to ask if I wanted to meet her in person for the first time since she was coming to the city for something. I obviously agreed and realized I still had feelings for her and confessed it to her through text the next day and to my surprise, she said she felt the same way!

We then went on 2 more days and between those dates, she tells me how much she likes me and has liked me from the very beginning but she didn’t want to say anything because she was still hung up on this guy who she is now over, and proceeds tell me how much she misses me but on the day before she was leaving for schooling, I asked if she wanted to be official and she said she thought about it and realized she can’t do long-distance… we were supposed to go on a date that night when I confessed but she cancelled on the last minute because she had to pack and run errands and that’s why I asked if she wanted to be officially over text. 

&amp;#x200B;

After she rejected me, I then informed her that I probably won’t be meeting her the next day(we were supposed to go out Friday and Saturday) because since we were friends I didn’t wanna see her on my day off (petty I know) but she just responded with “ok” and I just blocked her since. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did she lead me on or was her reasoning of rejection valid?

Question
A little background and sorry for my bad grammar because it’s my second language but try to bare with it while I go through this rant and confusion on why this happened.



I met this girl online a year back and it started off as us just being casual friends that just did things with each other because we were bored and we had fun doing things.



I, unfortunately, started growing interested in her but she never felt the same way (at least that’s what I thought but we will get into this part later down in the story). Throughout the time we spent together, I was always there for her when she was sad or depressed or just had problems that she needed to talk to someone with and vent.



Fast forward 8 months and I confess to her in which she rejects. I end up getting hurt and told her I could no longer be her friend or spend time together because it wasn’t fair to me if I kept sticking around when she was talking to other guys while I sat and watched. So we end up not talking for a few months and she reached out to ask if I wanted to meet her in person for the first time since she was coming to the city for something. I obviously agreed and realized I still had feelings for her and confessed it to her through text the next day and to my surprise, she said she felt the same way!

We then went on 2 more days and between those dates, she tells me how much she likes me and has liked me from the very beginning but she didn’t want to say anything because she was still hung up on this guy who she is now over, and proceeds tell me how much she misses me but on the day before she was leaving for schooling, I asked if she wanted to be official and she said she thought about it and realized she can’t do long-distance… we were supposed to go on a date that night when I confessed but she cancelled on the last minute because she had to pack and run errands and that’s why I asked if she wanted to be officially over text.

It's just feels weird and bizarre that we know each other for so long, we hangout in the same group from time to time and the other week in person she said yes to going out, and now she doesn't even read the one text that I sent her that was bassicly asking if she had time after she got back from a trip. 

I just don't know how to deal with this in the future because I inevitable have to be around this person. Like if this is where she drew a line and was uncomfortable with, should I stop talking to her in real life to? Because I don't know if I would come off as bitter or angry if I stopped talking to her, but at the same time I don't want to talk to her or interact if I made her this uncomfortable to stop even reading my messages. The worst part is that if I would stop hanging out because of her, then she would probably be the one not being invited because she just tags along my friend.

71,pa651l,1629744403,Ghosted/moving on,"So at the end of July/beginning of August I (22F) met up a couple of times w this person (25M) from Tinder. Both times we hung out were really amazing, in my eyes at least. For context, I recently got out of an on/off serious relationship probably around the beginning of July. It had been a long time coming and I honestly was already over him. So the couple of dates I went on w this new guy were really refreshing and honestly, I don't mind if its not a full blown relationship or if it stays a FWB kinda thing. 

So onto why I think I'm being ghosted. Last time we hung out, beginning of Aug., was really nice and ended on pleasant terms. We watched movies, we did some other.. stuff.. and overall I really got over my initial nerves and felt comfortable around him. I tried keeping convos going with him after that day, and it was limited response from him. I point blank asked him if I came on too strong and he said yes, and stated he was dealing with stuff. Last message I sent, I left the door open and said I'd give him space and if he needed anyone to talk to, Im there for him. It's been a lil over two weeks now since we last talked and he read the message but never replied and hasnt talked to me since. and I hate to say it but I'm hung up on him. 

I feel like I messed it all up big time and I hate it cause I'd like to even just be friends cause hes a nice guy. Plus, I can see when he's active (we message on Insta) and that kills me even more to know he's just choosing to not talk to me.

Am I overreacting to the lack of response? Should I keep holding hope or just cut my losses and try to move on? (In which case any advice for that?)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa651l/ghostedmoving_on/
72,pa65eo,1629744436,I (M24) need advice on situation with a women (F21)," 

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

As time progressed we remained friends, still talking on the phone everyday, telling eachother everything going on in our lives and she frequently said things like she is really happy that she has me in her life and that she needs me. But as time progressed it also was harder for me at times. Especially if she was hanging out alone with her guy "" friends"".

I was feeling jealous and really questioning my own self worth/ respect at times. I know i just should have go NC the moment she friendzoned me, but yeah stupid me.

But i was becoming more distant from her to just protect myself and 3 weeks ago she send me a messages that she really misses me and did not thought our bond would ""break"" this quickly. I told her i miss her aswell but from the moment she told me she just wants to be friends a lot had changed because i really thought we were building something more then just friends. she did not respons on my reaction.

For the last 3 weeks our conversations are really dry and it feels forced. I got a snapchat from her last week from her that she was taking a drive with her ex, which she always complained about to me and talked alot about when we were ""dating"" in hindsight it maybe meant she was not over him still. But since she send that snap i did not contacted her and it has been 3 days now.

I need some advice on what to do next, should i stay no contact or should i contact her? i have to be honest and tell you all i am having a hard time, also because she is undergoing surgery coming thursday and i want to be for her, but on the other hand it is hard to be in her life as just a friend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa65eo/i_m24_need_advice_on_situation_with_a_women_f21/

He left town for a week. He said he wants to hang out the night before he left. Both of us were working until 10pm. I told him I had to work early the next morning so I only had a couple of hours and couldn't sleep over (we usually sleep over unless one of us has to be up early \[usually me\]) but that I'd still like to see him before he leaves.

 I'm off work at 10pm, I ask if he wants to come over, he says he's wrapping up but it might be a little late. I don't hear from him until 12:30am saying he just got home. I was falling asleep at this point, and just told him goodnight. He said he wants to plan for this weekend when he gets back but truthfully I'm hurt/disappointed at basically being blown off so I didn't respond.

IMO, we've been seeing each other long enough to where he knows I'm not going to drive 15 minutes to his house in the middle of the night when I have to be up at 8am. This is not the first time this happened. Last time, I said I'd rather not make plans when he's working late and I have to be up early. He apologized, said it shouldn't be a problem in the future etc.

I'm having a hard time not taking this a sign that he really just doesn't care about me the way that I do him. I understand that a miscommunication is not indicative of the whole relationship, but the fact that this isn't the first time is making me think that this is more like a pattern and I'd been letting it go.

Do I tell him I feel like he blew me off? Was it my fault for making plans with him knowing that he's working late and probably won't be available until hours after he said he would?

82,pa72xx,1629747254,Dating isn’t what it seems,"I think dating is seen by most as this thing that is necessary to have the best life. To be the happiest version of yourself. When it’s totally not the case.

If you’re out there feeling sorry for yourself because you can’t find the right partner, you’re completely in the wrong. The problem is you’re unhappy with your life. And you’re taking it out on something external.

The real cause is probably mental illness and you don’t even know it. And what is the cause of this? Inflammation. The crappy things we put into our bodies that our bodies don’t know what to do with (anything besides water, meat, fruit &amp; veg). It’s amazing how much happier you can become when you eliminate inflammation from your life. All of a sudden you think more clearly and you’re not constantly tired and miserable all the time. You can suddenly see that for the majority of your life you were blaming your misery on external situations (bad dating life, bad job, poor luck) when really it was your brain that was inflamed and you would be unhappy even if all of those things were fixed",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa72xx/dating_isnt_what_it_seems/

Im out of college. If I dont get out I dont meet people. If I dont ask people out everyone thinks im their friend. If I dont work on myself and try to be better at talking with people I probably should throw in the towel.   


Right now I'm trying to find people through my social circle. Im kind of striking out and may need to broaden my circle. I got this one girls number, but it's someone I have been talking to at social event and it was because she was interested in checking out my climbing gym sometime. So I felt there might be something there, but will need to explore it more the next time I see her.   


And I just got rejected from someone else in my social circle last week. So I dont want to come accross to people that Im jumping from one person to the next, but if I think I might be interested then who can blame me?? I just dont want to be that dude that gets known with asking everyone out.   


Side tracking a little. My point is that I really want to be looking for dates, but I think there is a balance that I need to find. For instance I'm not going out tonight and I kind of wish I was because of fomo. When I know I'll probably be out several times this week.

I noticed on his ig several women liking on his pictures but barely any friends that are in his ig follow him. We been talking to each for a month and a week. I understand after he came from vacation he was swamp with work. I saw him on the fort’s page with some activities he was involved with.  Yet, ever since I added him he has been less proactive in texting me. I had been the one initiating conversation and leading to the point that just recently I ask him hey let’s do a phone call if five minutes. He told me he had plans that night to which I reply when are you available? I’ m flexible. He left me on read. I have decided not to do a follow up for about a week maybe a little bit longer. He is not been active online but I noticed when he is online and sees my stories. What would you make up this? 


Another observation, I recall seeing all of his albums pics were easily for me to view but as of last week I can only dee the pics that he is tagged in, public post and his private post posted in the past. What would you make up this? Is he setting up to ghost me or just leaving me hanging? I want to give him the chance to know each other but sometimes I feel like I getting mixed signals. Thought of sending him a message at the end of weeks sling him how can we improve our communication and where does he sees things going forward with our interaction (so I can adjust expectations accordingly). Will this be too much on my end?


It does not help that I also suffered from anxiety.  Normally, I am very independent and could careless but for some reason this guy has come to challenge certain things when it comes to getting to know someone. I am used to getting ghosted very quickly but with this guy I feel like I do not what is going to happen.  Also, is he taking me seriously in getting to know me? I know I posted several things about relationships and anxiety on my stories and wonder if that could have scared him away?

He is in his 40s and I am in my late 30s. It feels like I am new to dating but I am not😅. Maybe is because we have different dating styles? Different communication and ways of knowing each other?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa7mls/guy_added_me_on_fb_and_ig_but_we_have_not_met_yet/
91,pa7mp2,1629748976,How to not rush in a new relationship after being only in a relationships for 10 years,"Tl;dr: 1. just got divorced recently
2. met a girl who was really into me
3. developing already feelings, but I want to enjoy being free.

Hey guys, Im 27m. I divorced with my wife few days ago. It was a long process over few months, so we are doing better than before.

I began to meet new people and I wrote to a girl I met recently on work-related place without any intention.

She was really interested in me, chatted with me the whole time and she made so many compliments and didnt even try to hide her feelings towards to me. 

We discovered some mutual hobbies, interests, sexual preferences and planned a date next week.

She knows about my situation and understands I dont want to be in a relationship. She said, she is in a similar situation.

All of sudden she is writing only few times a day. In comparison to whole day texting with so much interest and affection, its like nothing.

Maybe its a strategy, but Im worrying to „lose“ her. Because she is the only person Im chatting with now and I really like her. 

I discovered myself want to be in a relationship mode again, but since I never had a time to be a free single, I wanted to use this time to meet seceral people. But I can‘t get this new girl off my mind.

I am so unexperienced in flirting and being single. I dont want to rush in a new relationship, but I want her so badly.

Can you give me some advices?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa7mp2/how_to_not_rush_in_a_new_relationship_after_being/
92,pa7ri0,1629749384,Could it be me,"Quick background: I’m 9 months pregnant, haven’t wanted any type of affection due to hormones running wild. We already have 1 child together and got engaged earlier this year after almost 5 years. 

Recently my intuition was telling me something is off about my fiancé. He doesn’t usually spend much time on his phone. However, I caught him smiling at his phone, differently than he would have been over any post or guy chat messages. The next morning I woke up for work and decided why not just take a peak (even though I trust him and rarely ever do this.) Well the last person he texted happened to be his new coworker (who he has to have communication with at and outside of work due to type of job.) Initially I thought “nahhh it’s too soon” then again you never know. Well turns out they were talking pretty inappropriately about “tips and tricks” for certain areas of the body. They didn’t get into details, but still why is this going on for messages throughout the last conversation?  

I spoke to him that night and his “reason” for this was because he is lacking attention at home. Because I wasn’t giving him the affection and physical attention he needed. My point to him was why didn’t he communicate these before he got to this point and he said I should have known after the way he was acting. Also why would he allow himself to get to that point if he could just speak to me about his concerns? 

Days after we spoke still feel like crap about him talking to her and now any time i see her name pop up on his phone I’m a bit bothered and deep down want to see what they’re talking about. He brought up therapy and I’m up for it, but really don’t think we need it if after all these years we’ve dealt with a lot already on our own and have no problem with communication til now. Not sure if I’m just getting too over my head because of these hormones and insecurities I feel being 9 months pregnant, what should I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa7ri0/could_it_be_me/
93,pa81de,1629750213,I'm an anxious person and it has always shown.,"For as long as I can remember I have been an anxious person from child to adulthood. I have seen multiple therapists and been on medication. I've learned a lot of ways to deal with it and can tackle everything in my life now with a sort of nervous-confidence if that makes sense.

I have a lot more self respect now too, but I've always had this uneasy vibe I think that turns people away from me and meeting people is harder than ever. It makes me sad because I've never had a love life mostly due to this weakness, 24 M btw.

96,pa85zu,1629750619,She didn’t actually say she rejected me but I still felt rejected,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pa85zu/she_didnt_actually_say_she_rejected_me_but_i/

98,pa8c2k,1629751149,Ending a short term fling,"I’ve been seeing a girl for about 5 weeks, not long I know. However, things have gone quite fast. Slept together on the first date, spent lots of time together, cooked her meals, taken her out etc. 

However, her replies are starting to get slow and dead, she’s airing me more often and it feels like the flames dying out… which is annoying as I can’t tell whether I have caught feelings or whether I just don’t like the thought of not being in control of whether I get to stay with her.

In my heart I do want to keep seeing her, but in my head I feel I should end it as it’s drawing too much of my attention away from my own goals. 

Has anyone been through anything similar or have any general advice? I know this sounds deep for a 5 week fling but I do catch feelings easy and tend to get in deep quite quickly.

99,pa8cqv,1629751210,How to navigate dating as an unattractive man?,"Hi all! Just want to say I love the subreddit so I'd thought I'd pick your brains with a question(s) that have been on my mind lately.

How do you ask a women out when asking out can be problematic in of itself? It seems like the general discourse is that doesn't matter, women despise being hit on by guys they are not interested 100% of the time.

Rejection doesn't really bother me, there are a million and a half reasons not to date someone so there's no reason to take it personally. How ever my main concern is accidentally bothering / harassing a women or making her feel uncomfortable, unsafe or creeped out =( . So much so that I (26 M) haven't really ever bothered to make many moves so as to not be a part of the problem
