1,pf0pjl,1630393332,Who should pay,"I have a question.  Who should pay for the date? I think it should be the person who asked the other person out for the date irrespective of gender. Its usually the guy who asks out. But if the rarity that the woman asked the guy out, should the guy still pay or should it be split or should the woman pay. This is ofcourse is a het situation. I don't think same sex couples have this problem...

Also what happens in a long term thing? Does the payment of not just dates but the other stuff that's common is also shared. Obviously all this given the fact that both of the people earn and earn in almost equal amount and that they do share the household responsibilities and its not one sided 

Want to ask this also in another but i wont be allowed to. So if anyone who is an old member of that sub can give me their opinion on what is expected I would be very much obliged.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pf0pjl/who_should_pay/

4,pf0u42,1630393975,If you want sex then act like it,"I can’t stand how phoney casual relationships are these days. 


After 2 years of decent success as a pick up artist, I grew tired of the manipulative nature of the ‘game’, so one day I decided to change my approach. 


If I wanted to have sex with somebody I would just ask. That’s it. If I saw an attractive women at the bar, I would go right up and start some dirty talk. Or if I saw a hot women at the grocery store I would tell her she’s hot, if I managed to grab her number I would get straight to sending those dirty messages. 


As expected, I was met with hostility majority of the time, but that was ok. I guess we just wanted different things in life, there was no need for me to get angry about it. Respectfully part ways and try with the next.  


This was 1000x less effective than your traditional manipulative seduction bullshit hey I still managed to get a small amount of lays. I don’t even see the point of getting to know the person if all you’re going to do is screw each other. Wtf for? We’re here to screw man! And guess what these women had to say afterward? They respected it. There was no bullshit. This is how the world should be....


But everybody loves living in a fantasy. Everybody loves hearing sweet little things in their ear. Everybody loves fake. That’s the kind of world we live in. 



Even though I was getting a lot less sex (no sex at times) , a little voice inside of me felt proud. I was being authentic. I was being legit in a phoney world. Which fulfilled me more than what I was doing before. I used to be a fake Casanova who would woo his way into the pants of women. And guess what? It didn’t even make me happy. I just felt like a massive phoney. If you want sex then act like it, if you want a relationship then act like it. I rage inside when I see men picking up women at the bars, spitting all that phoney bullshit just to take them home and have sex for one night. What kind of world do we live in. We shouldn’t even be pretending to care about each other’s lives. 



If you want a relationship, then act like it. Don’t pretend to be interested in her romantically if you just want to have sex. If you really want something deeper don’t you think sex can wait??? 


I’m not saying to get on your knees and propose to her on the first date, what I’m saying is keep the aura about you. If you become what it is you are trying to attract the universe will have your back.

7,pf14ec,1630395409,What is the point of getting to know somebody if all you’re going to do is have sex?,"I honestly think the world would be a better place if us men would stop all our manipulative bullshit when it came to trying to get laid. 


My preferred approach is as simple as this: 

I see an attractive women shopping. I go up, look her in the eye and tell her she’s hot and I want her number. After getting the woman’s number, I’m sending her dirty messages straight away. This is as authentic as it gets. I’m signalling ‘I don’t want to get to know you, I just want to fuck you’. 

Or if I see a hot woman at the bar, I’ll go up and tell her ‘ I wanna fuck you. You wanna come home with me?’ . That’s it. You don’t need to exchange life stories to have sex with each other. It’s just pointless. I think flirting is pointless to be honest.


The problem with pick up culture is that there is too much emotional investment. It relies on Jedi mind tricks to bed women. Pick up is an industry I was heavily influenced by, and after becoming disillusioned with it and awoken to the bullshit nature of this world I had a massive problem with romance in our culture. 


Us men initiate everything right. So the problem starts with us. If you want sex, ACT LIKE IT. If you want a girlfriend, ACT LIKE IT. In this phoney world we live in, I promise you that being authentic will fix all your issues. 


Imagine if men were actually honest with women. A lot of bullshit would be avoided and no women would get get her heart broken. 


In my opinion, if a man is taking the effort to get to know you he should be screening for more than just sex. If he is pretending to care about your life just to lay you, he is nothing but a gutless coward. If you really want something deeper, don’t you think sex can wait? I’m not saying whip out a wedding ring on the first date but just make sure your actions and words match your intentions.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pf14ec/what_is_the_point_of_getting_to_know_somebody_if/

Within hours we had moved over to Whatsapp and we have agreed to go for a drink soon. I said I would find a nice bar for us to go to and she has given me her schedule. 

– Tomorrow night,   
– Friday night (but can only have 1 drink)  
– Or next week, when she'll be more free  


How best to play this? Do I agree tomorrow while momentum is on my side (may involve a bit of frantic preparation), go for a quick drink on Friday and hope for a second date, or opt for next week and hope she doesn't change her mind or get bored chatting?

I was shocked, but in that state; he asked me if I intend to see a change in what he does; to which I refused to answer (He demonstrates change when he sees logical).  A lot of them are regular people and not even influencers which made me feel odd. Its kinda odd, I dont think so lot of them are people that he even knows personally but there are 20,000+ of them.

40,pf6ppp,1630419306,When anxiety overshadows potential feelings,"Hey r/dating community!  
I believe I am somewhat dysfunctional when it comes to dating.   
Maybe some of you can help me figure out how to overcome that.  


So, about me, I am a 25-year-old male about to begin my last year as a master's student. I would say I'm decently attractive although slightly smaller than average (5' 8 / 173cm), kind, smart, and occasionally funny. It's been about 3 years since my last relationship, a rather long period, but I'm trying to get back on the dating market. I'm definitely looking for something serious as I would not find casual encounters meaningful. When it comes to potential partners, I'm especially attracted to women who are educated, are not afraid to share their opinion, and are either really passionate or good at something that they do. As I am introverted and Covid is still very present here despite vaccinations, I have taken up dating mostly through dating apps. This hasn't been easy, but I manage to get a date once in a while.   


Just yesterday I met a girl for a first date. We had texted for about a month prior to that. We made lunch together at my place and I showed her a bit around town (there's nothing to interpret about the date's location; I think I simply give off a harmless vibe). I enjoyed myself and I think I quite liked her, but I'm not sure I was able to show that properly (eg maybe not enough compliments). As I mentioned before, I'm quite introverted and it takes me a while to feel comfortable enough around a person to be my true self (especially if that person is a woman). This takes forms such as that I'm afraid to put on music I like during a date and instead try to look for something more generic, or that I sometimes have quite a lot of inhibition preventing me from saying things that just come to mind. Adding to that are general insecurities that I have accumulated over the 3-year period of being single, mostly that I will fuck up by not being enthusiastic enough, focusing too much on the informational content of my speech rather than the social aspect, not asking enough questions, initiating physical contact too soon or too late, and not being able to sense my real feelings through this veil of anxiety. Anyways, the date lasted about 6 hours and we said our goodbyes. I texted her later that night because she had forgotten something at my place and also because I was keen on seeing her again. In the hours before I texted her, I felt anxious, much like if I feared failing an exam. I played the date back in my head, cringing at some of my behaviors. Apparently, though, she also had a good time, keen on meeting again, although we didn't set a second date yet.   


I'm aware that y'all do not know me and do not have any way to evaluate whether I am completely socially inept or reasonably normal. I'm just looking for advice on how to approach dating such that I can allow myself to feel emotions that are actually related to the person I'm meeting and not to my anxiety. On top of that, I know that it takes me a while to develop feelings for someone. So, even without the anxiety, I would often be clueless. I find it hard to escalate things physically just based off of some societal schedule for Western dating. Should I communicate that? I don't know... Anyways, my thoughts for the (potential) next date are that I should steer things more toward relationship talk (I know, I should have done that before) and try to be a bit more relaxed, although I don't know whether I'll be able to succeed at the latter.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pf6ppp/when_anxiety_overshadows_potential_feelings/
41,pf6s7t,1630419520,I broke it off with someone yesterday and feel like shit.,"Yesterday I broke it off with someone I’ve been talking to and hanging out with for the last 6 weeks. During that time we both had several trips/ time out of town, but we probably got together 5 or 6 times. The last time we hooked up and that’s what I feel the worst about. Then he had to go away with his family for a little over a week and we texted a couple times, then I didn’t hear from him for a week. When he got back he basically made a comment about that and that he was trying to gauge how I was feeling by not texting me. He was a very intentional dater, told me he wanted to be in something serious but, seemed to respect that I didn’t want to rush into something serious either. After feeling like he “tested” me I kinda freaked and said I think we are looking for different things and I’m just not ready right now. He called me out on giving mixed signals and that it had seemed like I wanted more than FWB. Now I’m confused myself, I know I don’t want to move forward with him, but I feel fucking shitty. I feel like I have no idea how to date, I want to eventually be in a relationship but I don’t want to rush into it and I’m so many ways it seems like it’s an all or nothing. I feel bad I can tell he was frustrated and hurt, I know he didn’t want to hook up just to have it end - and I did tell him the night we did that I wasn’t ready for an exclusive relationship yet- like this feeling of hurting someone is enough to just not want to date, or only do casual hookups. :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pf6s7t/i_broke_it_off_with_someone_yesterday_and_feel/

I don't need a huge manager salary NOR do I want the responsibility of a manager.

Earlier this year she landed a great job in a field she has been wanting to be in for a long time. I'm happy for her. 

Now that she is making actual money, would it be fair if she took over some more bills? Or should our system that worked when she had less money still apply?

She obviously wants to keep the old system, and I don't blame her. Her hard work is paying off. But she noticeably has more spending money at the end of the day than I do. Which is fine, but also it would be nice if we both had the same amount of spending money.

I'm not quite sure if this post will help anybody but I hope it does.

So I'm quite interested in dating myself and have been browsing through Reddit community's all about dating and stuff.

But sometimes I wonder why they are so many people trying to get into a relationship as fast as possible. With out any regards for themselves and their emotions or for there partners feelings.
There are also the people that want to date with out being truly happy, by themselves and for themselves first and I don't quite understand, why.
I have read about people complaining, about things they have no control over, like there hight, face and etc., and I'm not saying that they shouldn't let out there concerns, it's good for oneself to let it all out, but it shouldn't be an obsession or an excuse to you to make yourself more miserable.

I know it's already a long post but i wanted to give you all a bit of advice even if it is obvious.

1. Take your time, don't rush yourself or others, most people forget that it takes time to life, to learn new things, and to find love.

2. Be happy first and have your life sorted out because a relationship is not just fun and games, many believe it is not there responsibility to take care of there partner, but that's just wrong and irresponsible.

3. A Crush and someone you love a two different things, it might be obvious but many often forget that.

4. Respect your Partner always be Respectful, you are both trying to achieve the same thing.

5. Know your boundaries and communicate these to your partner.

6. It's okay to have argument's it's actually normal, just know how to calm the anger of you both.

7. Don't blame yourself if a relationship doesn't work out, just reflect on your past, cry and try better next time, your life is long and there are many opportunities to find new love.

8. Invest time and effort In to your partner and I don't mean just at the beginning of your relationship but the rest of your life.

9. Be prepared to be mentally and emotionally exhausted form time to time, in these moments you need a partner that is prepared to protect you and be supportive of you.

10. Follow your heart not your desire, because short term things hurt if you are not prepared for them.

It maybe quite obvious to most of you but it is just a friendly reminder to take yourself seriously and be honest with yourself and the people around you. I hope you all take care and date responsibly for everyone's safety and  well-being.

63,pf9mtv,1630428150,"A girl sent me a message and removed it before I had a chance to read it. Now I'm wondering if it was a mistake, or if she did it on purpose.","There's this girl who works at the same place as me. She's pretty cute, and I like her. Previously on Facebook, it said she was in a relationship. Now I noticed that relationship status is gone completely. Despite us working at the same place, we don't have much contact. We just say hi, and have short chats sometimes. A year or so ago, before I knew she had a thing with her soon to be bf, I was into her and may have given her small hints of interest. She may have noticed me looking at her a few times, and I went to talk with her a few times. I can't know for sure if she saw it as interest, but I did stop doing that after she announced her relationship on FB (which she did shortly after all of this). I'm thinking maybe she realized I liked her. Anyway, I started to keep my distance from her from that point.

Fast forward a year. I check my phone a Monday, and to my surprise, there are two messages from her. Then I see that the two messages have been removed by her three minutes after she sent them. So I couldn't read what she had written. They were sent in the late evening the day before I checked my phone. I had been asleep when she sent them. This was on FB Messenger btw, and we are on each other's friend lists. At first, I thought it would be best to ignore it. Then I noticed she no longer had the relationship status, and it made me curious. I sent a message asking what the messages were about, and this is what she replied: oh I just sent it to the wrong person, in the second message I wrote that I sent it to the wrong &lt;insert my name&gt; 🙈.

That was probably what happened, but I just find it so weird and coincidental. I'm the only person on her friend list with my name, out of 130 or so ppl. How did she send it to me, if she was going to send it to someone else with the same first name? Wouldn't you have to search for that persons page and then hit the message button? And how often do you message someone who isn't even on your friend list? How do you NOT notice my close-up face profile photo when sending a message?

Could she have done it on purpose for some reason? To make me click her profile and see her relationship status gone maybe? Did she write something to me, and then panic and regret it? Was she just messing with me?

She wasn't at work the next few days after that. She had called in sick. Related? Today, I met her at work again and said hi with a normal polite smile. She seemed normal and greeted me back the same. Both of us are shy, and I find it hard to approach her to talk.  I wonder if she feels the same lol.

66,pf9pf6,1630428365,My honest impression of dating apps and takeaways,"As a disclaimer, I live just outside of NYC, so it's not like I'm in a bad area or short of options. I'm not here to start any arguments or try to encourage sexist views of any sort. These are simply my observations. Please don't bring any negative energy

I'm an athletic, good looking PhD student who just moved to start his new program. Decided to get on Bumble recently to try and meet people I could explore the city with. Uploaded my best pictures, made sure to have a solid bio, and got swiping. After several days, I've been pretty underwhelmed

My takeaways:

- Though I've gotten a lot of good matches, hardly anyone actually messaged me (for those of you unfamiliar with Bumble, the women have to message first). I rarely extend, because the way I see it, if someone couldn't be bothered to message in a 24 hour window, they're probably not that interested (and I have no interest in playing games if the person is waiting to see whether I extend or not). On the rare occasion I did extend, it made no difference

- The messages I did get were incredibly low-effort: just ""hi"" or ""how are you""

- A lot of the profiles I've seen are really lazy. At least half of them just seem like the girls advertising their Insta page (you know the type: nothing in their profile other than their handle)

- One girl unmatched me after finding out I'm ""not American"" (I'm ethnically Middle Eastern but born and raised in the USA). Not sure why she matched me to begin with?

- While it's easy to quickly feel defeated on these apps, I think it's important to remember they're not a reflection of your quality as a person (this is true for guys and girls alike). I'm not sure how much this serves true for guys on these apps, but a lot of the girls I came across gave the impression of only being there for attention, validation, etc., and have no interest in actually meeting

- **This is especially important for guys to keep in mind on dating apps**: For those of you ""normal"" men like me, remember that most women on apps deal with a lot of awkward/creepy guys. I've heard a lot of horror stories from friends/acquaintances/dates. If a girl seems hesitant or wants to take it slow, don't take it personally

- That said, if someone seems flaky/dodgy, it's better to assume they're not interested and move on. If someone is genuinely interested, you'll know it. If you find yourself wondering if the person actually wants to go out or if they're interested, the answer is most likely ""No"". Trust your gut and don't get too hung up on one person

- While there is a lot of nonsense on these apps, there are also people who are willing to meet up with you. I've got two dates planned within the next week 

- Above all else, I think using these apps should complement your real life efforts, not replace them. I'd still rather meet someone organically, because then there's no ""hiding"" or tailoring a profile to only showcase somebody's ""greatest hits"", but having these apps, especially as someone new to the area, doesn't hurt. Just don't take them too seriously

- Last, and most importantly: love yourself and keep improving",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pf9pf6/my_honest_impression_of_dating_apps_and_takeaways/
67,pf9uga,1630428791,OLD Friend zone?,"Just looking for some advice here. I (22M) matched with a girl (22F) on an app and went on our first date, which was terrific. About a week after the date when I followed up I was told that she's not ready for dating right now and that she just wants to be friends. We hung out four additional times and finally I decided to ask for some clarification. I really respect what felt like honesty from her but I have noticed inadvertently that she's still getting notifications on her phone from a dating app. At this point I would rather her just tell me that she's not interested in *me*. But she's said multiple times that she's not in the right headspace to date *anyone* right now. So, my question is: am I getting duped because she's trying to be nice, or should I just take this at face value and keep going?

My secondary question is how to handle this situation going forward. We would exchange 100 messages a day but I think to sustain that I would become even more attached romantically to her than I already am, and she's still texting me quite a bit. It's a perfect match, honestly, so it's very difficult for me to deliberately not reply right away or send too many messages.

It’s my first day of school, so I’m on the train for the first time. I see a girl I think is cute get on also, and we glance at each other and make eye contact for a brief moment, before we sit down in separate seats a few rows away from one another.

Then transfer to another train to get into NYC. I get onto the train platform to switch trains, and the girl does as well. We make eye contact again for a brief moment, but I’m too shy to make a move. 
We finally both get off the train and arrive  in NYC. We make eye contact for a third time. This time, she asks me for directions. 

I confess that I don’t know the way around since it’s my first day, but I offer to walk with her and try to figure it out. She happily agrees.

So we’re walking to college (it’s a 25 minute walk) and we start chatting. The convo is going great. We have a lot in common, we’re both really involved and I’m really into her. She has a great sense of style, beautiful straight brown hair, sparkling green eyes. I can go on and on. 

We finally arrive at college and she’s late for class. We say goodbye to each other and agree emphatically to meet up in the future/take the train together. She gives me her number and we say goodbye. 

Later that day, I text her and ask if she wants to meet up during the week. She responds an hour later saying she has a super busy schedule so it probably wouldn’t work out. 

Understandable. 

Then I ask her if she’d like to meet up on Friday/Saturday. She says she’s away for the weekend.

I’m a relationship rookie and don’t know what this means. This is the first time I think a girl was even into me (I was really school/extracurricular focused in HS and didn’t  make time for girls/relationships.)

Is she into me? Are her reasons for not being able to meet up a polite rejection? How can I know if she’s into me or if she just wants me as a friend to take the train with?

I was starting to really like him, and most signals he gave me seemed to indicate he was interested (I.e. talked about next time we were together, when I asked him if he wanted to hang again he said yes, when I said I liked where this was going he said he did too, when he asked if I wanted a relationship and I said eventually he said the same thing, told me He was happy I met his friends). 

Except one caveat…he told me that one of his friends that I met was someone he used to hook up with and had a crush on that was not returned, and when I asked if he still liked her he said yes kind of. In my drunken state I waved it away since he said he wanted a relationship and I understood since I was in a toxic relationship not too long ago, and it takes awhile for all feelings to go away. 

But when we were planning to hang out last week, he bailed saying he was sick, and then the next day when I asked when he wanted to reschedule for he said “I don’t see this going anywhere, you’re a great girl and so much fun but I’m just not in a place where I can be in a relationship right now, and it seems like that’s what you want.” While a relationship right NOW isn’t what I want, yeah if things went well, I would’ve liked one down the road. I’m just really confused because things seemed to be going well until the shoe dropped and he decided it wasn’t going anywhere.

Is it too much to ask if he ever saw it going anywhere, or if it was always supposed to be casual and I just missed the signs?

83,pfbkhd,1630433925,When long distance is the only option,"Being in Alaska creates some unique problems that are never really explored on this sub for lack of demand. First of all, of course, within the 18-30 age bracket there are statistically 1.3 men here for every woman, on average, in the general population, the highest ratio of all US states. This means that not only are single women few and far between, but the dating app competition is unbelievable compared to anywhere else. Men like myself who aren't well connected are SOL here in the dating field. 

If I lived in the lower 48, this would be less of an issue, I could take a day trip to a neighboring state or major city to look further. I've heard so many people complain that 100 miles is such a long way. Consider this - the nearest major city to me is Seattle, and I am 200 miles further from there than San Diego is. I cannot take a day trip to another state to go bar hopping or otherwise, it is prohibitively costly and time consuming just to get there, especially running the high risk that I will come home with nothing but rejections to show for it. 

Long distance is the only thing I can realistically do. If I am ever to find someone, it must be online or through some form where I know what city I need to fly to in order to meet her. I have accomplished this twice, but those relationships were before corona gave internet dating a stranglehold on the whole game. 

This is an issue that I don't think I've ever seen addressed anywhere, because most people can drive to another city in a couple of hours. No amount of ""being yourself"" and ""confidence"" and ""personality"" can overcome numbers like this, and so many people write off long distance entirely because they don't really need it.

The conversation flowed very well and she seemed interested in getting to know me. She confided in me that she had never been so long talking to someone by text (positively) and that the conversation never got boring. The idea was to have a date soon (in the last 2 weeks she has been away on vacation). However, at the end of last week, everything changed due to a single event.

We were texting and I told her I was taking a break from work to cook a snack. If she wanted she could call me and we would talk a little. My idea here was to transition from text messages to a call and later to a date (which would be this week, after she got back from vacation).

She said it was weird for us to talk by call and she wouldn't call. I was a little perplexed as I wasn't counting on the reaction. Strange to me would be going on a date with a person without hearing their voice or without getting a taste of the person's conversation. At least for me, it would be a more real way to see the dynamics of the conversation and whether there was chemistry. We talked a little more by text and then I went back to work. She no longer responded to messages I sent her. Okay, I was ghosted.

After 3 days yesterday, I sent her a message alerting her to an important situation (a stupid streamer on twitch that exposed her and other girls' profiles in a dating app) and she responded quickly in a long text and thanked me a lot. She spoke to me as if nothing had happened. The subject stopped there and I didn't respond to her bearing in mind that the purpose of that message was just to give you this information.

I have more options and so does she. However, I am perfectly aware that she was enjoying the conversation and that she was finding our interaction different from what she had previously (she commented to me). Probably, the only thing that made her ghost was the fact that I suggested a call with her. She may have thought I was a weirdo (sounds a bit extreme to me but she has the right to think that about me). However, we spoke by message for 1 month and she never had anything negative to me, on the contrary. She always said that I was super mature and that our conversations were different from others. It's all super confusing to me.

For now, I don't plan on sending her any message. In the future, who knows, but I won't think about it now. I want to know your perspective. What do you think of this whole situation and what would you do if you were with you?

Hi !

I made a thread the other day because I didn't wanted to engage in small talks. But I find it very hard in the current state of the dating scene to get to know women without getting through this phase. Since I'm not confortable approaching women in the streets, I think I'd focus on the dating apps. The 3 first pictures are on the dating apps (the first one is a different one without the paper)

I'm 6ft1, kinda slim but athletic.

I think I'm able to connect with people, and I want to. I just need to increase my opportunities, and I really have a hard time figuring out how. I really can't manage to have any matches, or only with girls that I don't find attractive or with girls who won't answer or be cold/boring. It is a really boring experience and I don't know how to get it more stimulating.

Maybe it's because I look like a child or a girl, or because i'm too skinny, or my hair. I really don't know what's wrong. I really like myself tho, but it looks like that's not enough for online dating",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfc6sp/am_i_enough_for_dating_apps/

94,pfcbsm,1630436209,Can reserved/passive people come across as lukewarm even if they do like you?,"I’d love to know the perspective of people with such personalities as well as people who’ve dated/been in such relationships.

I ask because the last guy (m 25) I (f 23) dated seemed to have a reserved/passive nature.  I’ll overall be wondering why he seemed like he was attracted to me but came across as lukewarm, both of which conveyed by his actions.  He almost always initiated texts (esp good morning messages), would compliment most of my snap stories, and admitted to feeling nervous after our first date (because he found me pretty).  But while he initiated texts, I always initiated meeting up.  His texts would come across as dry as they’d be short, but he would seem like he wanted to keep convo going even if it was falling off.  He’d ask me questions about what I’m doing (and was probably a bit better at asking questions about me in person), but wasn’t exactly as inquisitive as more outgoing guys I’ve seen before.  He was slow with physical contact but admitted after our second to wanting to kiss me but not sure how I felt.  And he did initiate the kiss on our third but it was a peck on the lips.  Cuddling was something on one of our meets also initiated by me, and he and I were mutually excited over text, but on the day of hanging he agreed lukewarmly before doing it (but apologized that particular day  for being low energy as he had a headache from bad sleep the previous night).  Sexting was something that’d be mostly initiated by me as well but once by him.  And the overall vibe he gave was that he’s open to anything but not hungry/passionate-like he’d be down for/agree to whatever I suggested our arrangement to be (like casual dating/fwb) but have no particular desires or expectations of his own to voice.  When he started going through personal things, he’d still want to keep in touch, but while he wasn’t necessarily curt/cold, he wouldn’t seem to excited about doing stuff either.  

So I’m tryna understand this mindset/nature partially as a means of closure and to see what  to make of any future such folk down the line.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfcbsm/can_reservedpassive_people_come_across_as/
95,pfcc6j,1630436242,Should I stay no contact? Or is there hope for a relationship?,"




I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

As time progressed we remained friends, still talking on the phone everyday, telling eachother everything going on in our lives and she frequently said things like she is really happy that she has me in her life and that she needs me. But as time progressed it also was harder for me at times. Especially if she was hanging out alone with her guy "" friends"".

I was feeling jealous and really questioning my own self worth/ respect at times. I know i just should have go NC the moment she friendzoned me, but yeah stupid me.

But i was becoming more distant from her to just protect myself and 3 weeks ago she send me a messages that she really misses me and did not thought our bond would ""break"" this quickly. I told her i miss her aswell but from the moment she told me she just wants to be friends a lot had changed because i really thought we were building something more then just friends. she did not respons on my reaction.

For the last 3 weeks our conversations are really dry and it feels forced. I got a snapchat from her last week from her that she was taking a drive with her ex, which she always complained about to me and talked alot about when we were ""dating"" in hindsight it maybe meant she was not over him still. But since she send that snap i did not contacted her and it has been 3 days now.

I need some advice on what to do next, should i stay no contact or should i contact her? i have to be honest and tell you all i am having a hard time, also because she is undergoing surgery coming thursday and i want to be for her, but on the other hand it is hard to be in her life as just a friend",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfcc6j/should_i_stay_no_contact_or_is_there_hope_for_a/

97,pfcitm,1630436778,Guy I’m seeing saw my scars,"Just a heads up I’m talking about self harm scars… I’ve been seeing this guy for a couple weeks and been doing a pretty good job covering the cuts that are on my arm but sometimes I forget they’re there. He showed up to my place this morning with coffee and a muffin, I didn’t expect him to be at the door, so assuming it’s my roommate I answered the door in a big tee and messy hair. My arm was exposed and when I reached for the coffee he saw my arm. It’s pretty obvious where it came from because the cuts are only on my left arm and I’m right handed. I can tell he felt uncomfortable and I turned my arm inwards to hide the marks. It’s bad because I have some fresh ones from a couple days ago and I’m pretty upset at myself because my previous scars are almost unnoticeable but I did it again and now I have to go thru this process of hiding while it heals. 

I invited him inside even tho I felt pretty shitty, he grabbed my arm to inspect it and just took a deep breath. I told him I was sorry idk why but I did feel the need to apologize given the circumstances and how it’s hard to see that. He said “you’re too pretty to be doing this to yourself. I didn’t expect this.” And he picked me up and kinda bear hugged me then left. It makes me feel like our relationship is tarnished now because he probably thinks I’m mentally ill and need help. We haven’t slept together yet but I’m sure he isn’t attracted to me after seeing that. He texted me articles on cutting and basically carried on with like it was no big deal. He still wants to see me and said it wasn’t a turn off for him. I still feel a bit down about it and kinda want to cut him off. Should I continue on pursuing this connection? I really like him but I’m so used to ppl saying they aren’t bothered then throwing it in my face or trying to push boundaries because they think I have none for myself. Or they think it’s hot and wild. Maybe it’s just a me thing but it does make me anxious.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfcitm/guy_im_seeing_saw_my_scars/
98,pfcmyy,1630437132,Second Chance,"Would you give a person a second chance that left you behind in another City/State?

Was dating someone that we clicked but at the same time finding how to communicate better with one another, at times we would debate or disagree and with time I think we were finding out common ground, debates were nothing to walk away from but I think we both have strong characters that we take stands instead of just finding a peaceful ending to our conversation.

I am not perfect at all but after a few days trying to enjoy our vacation together she kept on saying that she was not weak and if I wanted to leave her that I should go, after several times of her saying it I actually took off and left her behind, I truly regret my action to this day because it is not me at all but my handling could have been different, could have stayed in town and just do my thing but instead my feelings of being unappreciated took over and I wanted to go home, I did a very childish thing but at the same time she has told me that she understands why I did what I did.

In the end, she said we took this vacation too early in our relationship and if we could be friends, I don’t hate her, I think I tolerated her because I do like her, but I know she needs work just like I do.l, so she probably tolerated me as well.

So my question is, would you give someone a second chance or just not deal with it and move on?

Thanks for your time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfcmyy/second_chance/
99,pfcoce,1630437239,Does being friends with benefits actually work?,"An ex and I started hanging out again. We were friends before we dated. For some reason we were either having a blast while dating or fighting like crazy. After a lot of fighting we broke up for a few months. However, recently we starting hanging out and having a blast together as always. We are still good friends and we even tell each other about other people we talk to and give advice to each other. At the same time, we also do relationship things like cuddle, visit each other all the time etc. I was wondering is it possible to be friends with someone while having a romantic attraction to the but still be okay about them seeing other people. I am a bit confused as you can see. Thank you for your answers.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfcoce/does_being_friends_with_benefits_actually_work/
