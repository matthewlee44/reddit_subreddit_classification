“Yeah we can meet on that day. Let us do 8 pm. We can figure out the place the day of.”

1,qsn28f,1636757548,Is he seriously ghosting me after this?!,"I would love any insight/advice about this situation:

&amp;#x200B;

I (25F) might this guy (29M) off of hinge 6 weeks ago. We immediately hit it off and have so far gone on 5 dates (yes, I have slept with him after the 3rd date). After our 3 or 4th date, I can't remember... he had to go visit home for a week - he didn't reach out to me once, 7 days zero contact. I reached out to check-in and we had a great conversation, turns out he had to extend the trip slightly and would be back that weekend. I waited... and nothing for 8 days until he reached on the following Tuesday and asked to make a plan to see me that week. We made a plan and again had a great date. I made a passing joke I thought he was ghosting me since I didn't hear from him for so long and he apologized and told me he would never. When we are together he is extremely engaging, has vocalized his interest in me, we share a lot in common and frankly I have nothing negative to say about him. I really saw this going somewhere and having a lot of potential.  

&amp;#x200B;

When he left the next morning, Friday, he told me that he'd love to see me again after Halloween weekend and we would make a plan. We spoke briefly on Sunday when I texted him about a show he recommended I watched but other than that nothing. Then Wednesday he proceeds to send me this ([See Convo HERE](https://imgur.com/a/QDpNWKr)) and I felt it was a good time to vocalize the fact I don't like his long spans of non-communication and the weird disconnect in his behavior when we are together vs. when we aren't. He seemed receptive to it and told me we would talk when he's back...

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it is now 9 days later and I have heard absolutely NOTHING from him after this exchange and I'm almost positive he's back home from his trip. Did he really ghost me? Should I have not spoken up about communication? Should I try reaching out? I would really love an outside perspective and advice on this as I am so confused and disappointed. :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsn28f/is_he_seriously_ghosting_me_after_this/

8,qsno2v,1636759311,[21M] Met this shy girl [19F] while abroad who now completely ignores me," 

Hello everyone, this is my first time posting on Reddit hence the new account. I would really like some advice on my current situation because I find it very confusing.

I am a 21-year-old guy from Norway, and I recently went to Australia for a month for a university exchange program. There I met this group of friends and I became part of them almost immediately. I noticed this one super cute girl 19 who seemed very shy and reserved and she seemed okay to talk to me only in group settings. Once we were one-on-one, she always had trouble maintaining eye contact and went from a rather loud voice tone to almost whispering. I didn't think much about it at first and assumed she didn't really like me and I was annoying her,

Over the next two weeks, I started liking her a lot though, and I started having trouble holding eye contact with her because of this. I noticed that she was laughing at all my jokes and was overhearing conversations even if I wasn't talking to her, but she was still more outgoing to other guys she didn't know than she was with me so I still assumed she didn't want to get to know me.

I also noticed her staring at me a couple of times when she thought I couldn't see her. Her friends told me that she never had a boyfriend but never seems interested in dating anyone.

During the last two weeks, I realized that I was crushing on her hard and that we had a lot of things in common, so I gathered up the courage and asked her out. She said yes and that was the first time talking one on one that she held eye contact with me, her voice was super loud and she couldn't stop talking haha. We exchanged contacts and went to dinner a week later because of busy schedules. She was super talkative and we had a lot of fun. She is basically the girl version of me, I am not lying when I say we have A LOT in common. I could definitely tell we had good chemistry.

However, at the end of the date, the fact that I had to go back home in a couple of days was brought up, and after that, she changed. We said goodbye with a hug, I didn't kiss her because I thought we would have seen each other at least one more time but it didn't happen.

When I asked her to hang out once more she said she was terribly sorry but she couldn't because of a university project she had to submit. Which I know is true but I still think this was a bit of an excuse. I told her not to worry about it and we exchanged a couple of text messages.

The next day was my last day and I met everybody from the friend group except her. I saw her in the hallway and raised my hand with a smile. I know she noticed me too but quickly turned to her friend and walked away.

I met her later while walking past her that she was talking to somebody else and said ""Hi (girl's name) "" with a smile. She very shyly smiled looked at me for a second before looking down while whispering ""Hi"". This was the last time we talked.

I tried texting her ever since I left but she doesn't answer and if she replies she does that in a way that ends the conversation. I still talk to everybody in the friends group but her completely avoiding me like this really hurts and I don't know why she is doing this. I don't necessarily want a relationship because I understand that we don't really know each other and the distance is very big, she said we could be friends but this isn't how friends interact with each other.

Seeing the attention she gives to other guys on social media while she completely ghosts me really hurts a lot too... I would just like to know why she is treating me like this, it's like she hates me or something, any help is very appreciated.

I felt intimidated and stepped back.","I don't know where this dream might come from... 

But I will rapidly explain you my story:
I thought that a guy who was really nice and caring secretly liked me and was too shy to step up, but after I've confessed the feelings that I have developed for him being that nice, He replied that He only sees me as friend. He also let me know He is (closeted) gay. It turned out I was just deluding myself based on some clues and facts, as the date He planned in a restaurant for only the 2 of us. Besides feeling ridiculous now, I am convinced that his bestfriend (who is openly gay) was very jealous and I've been thinking that they might be more than just friends and in an actual relationship (they share a flat!), so maybe that's the reason why He had to return to his track and set a boundary and in the end I wasn't just seeing things... 

Was the dream trying to tell me that He is taken? Would you agree that the girl is the representation of his boyfriend (I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT ROLES IN GAY COUPLES)?
Was it an invitation to drop everything, start considering how uncomfortable my attentions made his partner feel and therefore pull away as a sign of respect?

Anyway, apart from him being closeted gay and not wanting his coworkers know about his private life, I don't know why He should be lying to me about his relationships status and how all this can make sense.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsnqch/i_dreamed_about_a_girl_who_was_competing_for_my/
11,qsnrg9,1636759591,Do people keep assuming I like them or am I reading too much into conversations?,"When people meet me they assume I’m shy or timid because I’m very quiet and reserved (…yes at 21). I’m actually really confident but I don’t force conversations.

Lately I’m noticing, mainly men but a few women too would subtly bring up their partner or sexuality in the conversation. 

Hahah now this sounds ridiculous I know but let me explain. We’ll be talking, of course we’ll be talking and smiling talking about pretty much any/everything (the most generic topics to the deepest, mainly deep ones I have no idea why) then they’ll compliment either my looks or personality. In the next few minutes they have to make it known that they’re unavailable somehow.

I never noticed this when I was younger but I have always attracted people towards me. I’m on the more optimistic side so maybe they feel comfortable telling me about things freely without being judged. To me it’s just a great conversation from an acquaintance, one of many which I do enjoy nonetheless but to them it’s meaningful and memorable.

Do they think I like them or something? How do I shut them down (because my ego can’t take it)? Like they couldn’t have me even if they wanted me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsnrg9/do_people_keep_assuming_i_like_them_or_am_i/

Like movies, I have VR games that we can try, and a quiet space for us to talk. But I can see how having her come over to my house is a bad idea.

I'm just recently becoming more social, and I'm just nervous that I can't carry a conversation. So coffee just seems a bit intimidating and I know that going to the movies is hard to pull off.

After I started explaining why I do this she withdrew from the conversation but I have a lot of unanswered questions about how she sees it.

Of course I explained well my situation to her but here is why I have these habits: I work and go to school and I hardly have time between rushing from work to school to eat, and I especially dont have time typically to cook for myself, I do cook when I can because I know it is the healthiest option but it is probably only once or twice a week. And I order salads from fast food restaurants not out of laziness but necessity. Otherwise I dont eat. 

I would think that someone who is trying his best to better himself that it would be understandable that I have this situation right now, it isnt going to be like this forever, as I graduate I should have better health and routine.

 It just seems unfair to me; however I really want to investigate into this particular trait and why it could be seen as unattractive, I wont get offended as I value opinions but in order to understand I think I should hear it from someoen else",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qspgvo/27_m_me_eating_once_a_day_is_a_turn_off/
36,qspi0e,1636764994,"My Boyfriend(32M)Keeps Following Naked Instagram Models, am I (24F) not enough?"," 

Hello!

My boyfriend(32M) and I (24F)are in a long-distance relationship for one year. We haven't been able to see each other because he lives in Mexico and I was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor. I had brain surgery and because of this, I haven't been able to travel. The last time we saw each other was in August. I have been feeling extremely insecure because I lost my hair and have lost a lot of weight in treatment. I feel and look sick. I opened up to my boyfriend about how I was feeling and he reassured me and told me he loves me as I am. He didn't have social media when we began our relationship, but the other day in my suggested accounts his new account popped up. He hasn't tried to follow me and basically only follows beautiful Instagram models or very sexual accounts. Seeing this made me feel very insecure because those women are so perfect and I especially don't feel perfect right now. Even when I was not sick my body was never as perfect as those women. Seeing that made me a little sad and made me feel like I am not enough for him. I don't really know how to go about his. It did hurt my feelings that after the emotional conversation I had with him about my insecurities he made an account and followed all these accounts. I had even expressed to him that I get insecure comparing myself to the women I see on Instagram. Should I tell him how I feel or is it normal for guys to follow these kinds of accounts? I am feeling really vulnerable right now and don't know if I am justified in feeling this way?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qspi0e/my_boyfriend32mkeeps_following_naked_instagram/

After we hooked up the first time I told him I didn’t really want to do another fwb since I just got out of one and he said he liked me, wanted to get to know me, and that we should just go with the flow and see where this goes. Then we immediately started hooking up and it made me feel weird since it seemed that’s all he wanted. He has been making an effort to get to know me kind of. Usually after we fuck and a few times outside of the bedroom. However, we never text unless it’s to hook up. I have had a problem with chasing guys in the past so I don’t want to do that again and just get used for sex, but I also really want to start talking to this guy more. If it’s just casual idk if I want to keep doing it since I’m already a little stretched and don’t want to get hurt. I just don’t understand what he really means with go with the flow combined with the fact that he doesn’t text me. 

Another thing is that I’m supposed to see him on Sunday but I’m on my period so I’m scared if I tell him ahead of time that I’m on my period that he might not want to hang out.

Basically the first week of October she invited me to go with her and bother guy to a hay ride and haunted house. I went with them then after that the other guy already got a hotel for him and her she asked me to stay. So I asked at first he was taken back but he agreed after I gave him 40$.

That night I stayed on a pull out couch when the other guy took the bed which was the king size I was so out of shape 11-12 o’clock at night usually I’m asleep by 9. I was trying to get to sleep when he passed out she came and stayed with me she snuggled up and we cuddled it was very very nice. We kissed cuddled. Then I woke up around 9 or 10 and got ready to go when he got up I left. That day he took her to a concert where she called me and told me to come get her I did cause he tried to rape her. As I took her home she wanted to ask me to date her and I didn’t know what to say.

About a week later she asked if we were like officially a couple. I haven’t been in a relationship for years so I did not thinking about it twice. As we were dating the first two weeks were really good but red flags kept coming up. Which hurt me alot but I didn’t say a whole lot. The last two weeks were terrible she took me off her location on snap sent me videos of her drinking and drunk her asking to fuck guys. That made me so upset. I told her to be careful and I soon found out she was really only with one guy drinking and he was sleeping with her… so I dropped a whole 5 paragraph of reasons why shit isn’t working. I told her we can work on it or we can be done. 

A few days past she messages me hey. I responded with hey are you wanting to talk? She said you didn’t talk to me the past few days! I was like well what are we she said you said we were done so if that’s the answer from you. I said well what do you want she said idk. At that point I said bye. Now her sister sent me a video of that same guy she was sleeping with at her moms house and the guy is 20 times uglier then me and I sometimes call myslef ugly.

52,qsqrnk,1636769101,Quiet desperation,"The mass of men lead lives in quiet desperation. It’s something I honestly don’t do enough of. I’m too vocal in my feelings sometimes and it seems to backfire quite a bit. Constantly trying to force life to be something that it’s not. Maybe deep down it really is me that’s the problem. I seem to push people away by being too much for them or always attempting to say the right thing instead of just letting things happen. I need to look within myself sometimes and take my time to answer things and not try and have some fantastical vision of life. Never did I think at 29 that my life would be in shambles. Maybe it’s just beginning? Just when I feel like I hit rock bottom I burst through and find a new low I never saw coming. I want to do the right thing and be that right person for someone but it seems to elude me at each passing turn. I tell myself that I’m a good person but maybe I’m not. This isn’t me throwing myself a pity party trying to play the “nice guy” card in hopes that some desperate woman will fall in love with me. 

I’ve made a thousand wrong decisions in my life and I expect to make a thousand more. Because here I am, 29, jobless, broke, and unloved. Not by my family, they love me and do what they can but it’s a different type of love that I am seeking, someone to share a life with, someone who is trustworthy and honest. At 26 I thought I found that person, finally someone who was infatuated with me and hung on my every word. I guess at that point in time that was all that I needed to fill that vacant space in my soul. I truly had never cared about someone the way I did her and I had no other thought in my mind than spending the rest of my life with her. But that came to a screeching halt this past summer. She left me for another man, I was shocked, hurt, every emotion you could imagine. I did things I’m not proud of to get back at her and I lost myself for a while. 

Last week I met with an old friend who I had known for a long time and always been close with. I thought that me and her were really hitting it off and that everything that happened was leading me to this. Someone I trusted, confided in, cared for. Me and her talked about the possibility of dating and both expressed an interest. Unfortunately I let my voice get the best of me and said a little too much about all the things I went through in the wake of my ex destroying my soul. She ultimately rejected me and I can’t really blame her for that. But the pain of that rejection is so unbearably painful, I thought for a moment that life after my ex could be better than ever. So now here I am, alone again and lost without a purpose. Every day is a new chapter in this living nightmare I find myself in. Most recently I was laid off from my job, the only thing I had going for me and now I am destitute. I’m adrift with pain and suffering, an endless stream of misery that surrounds the entirety of my existence. Is there any hope of a normal existence after this traumatic time in life? I understand that life goes on, but am I too broken to ever be happy again?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsqrnk/quiet_desperation/

So i (21M) got rejected from this girl i was talking to just today and im pretty sure i know where i went wromg but would appreciate some pointers anyway.

I actually met her i was her server and she was in my section and i just really had a massibe crush on her lol so i asked her out and she said yes. She said she wanted to get coffee but everytime i suggested a day she just kept saying she couldnt make it even thlugh i told her you can come to the restaurant at night where i work for a drink after my shift and we could talk or we could meet in the mornings. Basically i was willing to move mountains to see her since she said she was going back home on sunday for 10 days to see her family and i just thought she would forget about me if i didnt get to spend even an hour with her before.

I asked her if she wanted to meet tomorrow at 10 but she said no and was like i dont we are a good match at all im sorry. Im ngl i had to fight back the tears at work it hit me kind of hard since i liked her so much and was so happy whenever she messaged me.

I just think in future maybe just ask the girl out on a date once and dont bother trying to keep asking her after she says no i think. If someone is interested in you theyll make time for you no matter how busy they are and i think my naiive ass just thought that she liked me but genuinely couldnt find the time which im very sure she could have if she wanted to.

Background: we had a few short lives flings in high school that ended badly. Has been trying to reach out all summer I wasn’t super interested at first and then finally I was convinced. First month went great, second month got a little volatile. He was still reaching out everyday but we weren’t seeing each other. I saw a noticeable change in him. I don’t think it had anything to do with us, but he wasn’t being very communicative about it. 

Current situation:
We got into a fight 2 weeks ago about not seeing each other and lack of communication. I didn’t answer him for a few days and he did the same to me when he finally texted. A week after I initially reach out, he told me he was injured and thats why he hasn’t answered. We had a normal conversation that whole night and a little into the next day (this was Tuesday-Wednesday) and nothing since. Last thing we talked about was me having a break from work so nothing heavy that would make him not answer. 

Should I reach out or wait it out? I’m honestly really conflicted. I really like him so I don’t want to make things worse and be the reason it doesn’t work out, but to be completely honest I won’t be devastated if it doesn’t work out.

Recently I met a girl (F25), someone who was sweet, and kind and I got a good sense for her. I worked up the courage to ask her on a date. It was in front of her co-workers and to my shock she showed so much enthusiasm and proclaimed “yes!”. 

That felt like a step in the right direction. And she told me how she was looking forward to it! Fast forward a bit, it’s Saturday morning and our date. It was nice. What was immediately us being a little bit nervous turned into us easing into a conversation where I learned so much about her and she learned about me and we had shared experiences and also so engaging differences. 

Something I considered special happened, and she opened up to me from a place of vulnerability. I happen to be an artist, and I’m wildly passionate about it. Having only started two years ago it’s become an outlet and something that I’ve turned into a business that is becoming sustainable as I learn and push myself. Vulnerability is something that I grapple with often. With her having a background in art she shared with me some of the energy from THAT place. 

Afterwards, she asked me about my personality (we both have a similar background in mental health and neuroscience) said she characterized me by openness, creativity, and depth. Told me we could paint together. And at the end of the date gave me an affectionate smile and said “I’ll see you soon.” 

Later that evening I told her that I enjoyed the time and it had been well worth looking forward to. And I haven’t heard from her since. It’s been close to a week and I was completely ghosted. I sent her a follow up text saying that “not hearing from her was a bummer and I hoped her week wasn’t overwhelming. I had gotten two tickets for a painting with a twist in case she was looking for a fun outlet. 

Nothing. Completely ghosted. It’s just so incongruent and inconsistent. There’s no closure to what felt like something that was such a joy to look forward to. Thanks for reading",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qssata/hoping_for_some_perspectives_that_might_help_me/

I’ve taken her on one date which went excellently, did end up having sex, and then she told me she would be busy with her sister who was in town for the next few days 

I decided to give her space because I didn’t wanna be clingy or eager even though I was really into her, but then she would text me first just to see how I’m doing and what she was up to 

Then a few days later I texted her with some plans, and it’s been maybe 5 days since no response, just completely outta nowhere she took me from totally into me to not acknowledging me, so I neede advice, was I just ghosted cuz she’s done with me and I should just move on, or is there something I should do to get back to seeing her.

Probably a very classic post on this sub but when your head is spinning over someone for days you do anything, thanks for any help",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsshxb/am_i_being_ghosted_or_tested/
74,qssina,1636774982,Guys been cheating on his gf,This guy (23m)has been continuously cheating on his gf for the entire time they been together. He was my best friend. He liked me (22f)for well over a year but was a complete asshole when I gave him a chance. Slept with 5 different girls and would tell me he loved me. Then he claimed he dropped them and we got more serious. All he wanted to do was have sex all the time and I wanted a relationship before sleeping with him bc he told me he cheated in the past. We did other things and we were basically a couple. Then he slept with his co worker (18f). And started dating her suddenly. He kept sending me nudes and asking for nudes since dating her. I distanced myself and blocked him. Then he messaged me on an app saying his dog has cancer. He even made out with me last week after telling me he has feelings for me. Me thinking oh he’s not with her anymore. And today I see on a burner insta account that he posted with her today after literally asking me for nudes today. I’m so confused. How is this guy like this. How is he so ok with cheating and then posting like he isn’t a horrible person and he’s happy. He literally chose to date this girl over me and then comes back begging for me and then posts with her. I haven’t slept with him and I don’t plan on it. The whole thing is so bizarre. A lot of people have told me to not tell the girl anything bc they say she will figure it out in her own that he’s a cheater especially bc I’m not sleeping with him so I’m sure he’s gonna go for other girls. She also used to third wheel on his dates with another co worker and at one point told her he loved me  after she told him she liked him. so she knows how he is,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qssina/guys_been_cheating_on_his_gf/
75,qssmum,1636775377,Do you ever wish your ex met you where are now instead of wher you once where? (23m 24f),"About a year ago I started dating this girl right after I had just graduated college. At that point in time I was completely lost. I went to school for exercise science and all of the gyms where closed making it super difficult to pursue my career. I went back and forth with the idea of going for my master's. I was also studying for the exercise physiologist exam as the time.  It was during the height of covid and we were both super afraid of catching it since our parents where both older. We were super cautions with masks and social distancing. However, we both seemed to have a very strong connection. We both admitted that we had strong feelings for each other. 

After a ton of soul searching, I got a job as personal training manager. In the being it was fucking awful. At that time the vp of the company was training me and he was extremely difficult to work with. He had a reputation with all of the personal trainers that he had zero social skills. I strongly disliked his abusive way of coaching. I was depressed and it showed. I did my best to try to hide it but it was clearly not enough. Thankfully the vp left my territory for another new hire and then I met my boss. As soon as we met me became best friends. He was a super interesting gentlemen and he had the purest of hearts. He told me how much potential I had and really had an effect on me. I looked up to him, he was an older brother to me. 

Unfortunately around this time I broke up with the girl I was seeing. She was being very distant and I texted her to see what was going on. She said that dating me started to remind her of a guy she used to date and she needed to be single for a while. We left on really good terms and she was really kind about it. I was feeling really down for while though. I can honestly say she was the first girl that  that I actually loved in a romantic setting. Things were weird for a while. I had recently moved to a much slower territory and my sales were awful. I had way too much free time at my desk to just think about pointless sad things. She kept looking at my snap stories and this made me crazy. I saw her on tinder a few months later and I texted her. She opened and didn't respond. I remember feeling like such worthless piece of shit. About a week later, I got into a car accident too. Thank god I was okay. I had a bit of mental break and I cried and screamed in the fetal position on the floor that night.

Then things got better. I started to get the hang of everything. I gave work everything I fucking had. I started to improve like crazy. My sales where climbing and I was only getting better. I was an absolute killer when it came to sales. I eventfully reached 1st place in sales 3 times in a row within the entire company. Mind you, we were nation wide. 

Around this time my boss quit, it was sad but he wanted me to take his position. It took him 4 years to get this position but he felt I was the best candidate.  He made a recommendation to cooperate and they had their eye on me. VP flew over to my territory and he watched me like a hawk. He was taking my leads and he wanted me to train 3 other new hires. I was a fucking mess but I still ended up being 1st in sales. Everyone was so surprised they said they would give me position, they just wanted to see how I could handle the added responsibility.  I was basically the regional manager without the pay or title. It grew really old overtime and they eventually gave the position to someone else outside of the company. I was livid. I ended up getting alcohol poisonings that night. I was throwing up the entire weekend. Which was even worse was that when I looked at my phone on Monday morning, I had drunk texted my ex that weekend.....multiple times and I had zero recollection of it. I blocked her from everything. This could not happen again. 

I went for a job search craze for about 3 months, doing a shit load of interviews. I finally found one that fit my needs. I had to do about 4 interviews for this one job and I got it. I only gave my company a weeks notice out of spite and left. This job has nothing to do with my degree but it pays much, much more with amazing benefits. Infarct I just got a 10k rise within the first month.

I have thought about how much I have changed since the last year and wonder what if she met me now? It's stupid question I know but, I'm happier, I have a nicer car, a new wardrobe a new hair and beard style. I have grown  so much that it's so difficult to fight back tear when I think about it.

There was plenty of flirting and touching and I knew she wanted to kiss but I couldn't for the life of me make it happen even though there were plenty of chances. I'm very outgoing and chatty and i have plenty of confidence that helps create a connection but when it comes to making the move I become so shy and can't bring myself to actually making the move. I actually feel bad for the person I'm on the date with because I've had girls tell me they felt very confused why it took so long for us to kiss and they weren't sure how I felt about them.

82,qssvyf,1636776260,"I Have a Crush on My Roommate, but He Has a Girlfriend. Should I Make a Move Anyway?","It's his girlfriend, not his wife.

To summarize:

\-This hot guy of my dreams moved in 6 months ago.

\-He's had a GF for the past 2 years, I suspected he did when he first moved in, but he told me no and I stupidly believed him.

\-He took me out for drinks/cuddled with me a few times when they were fighting (he tried to have sex once but I wasn't ready yet). I got emotionally attached. Unfortunately they reconciled and I was left behind like an abandoned doll.

\-One night his GF was in the hospital and I was watching a movie with him. He asked me to cuddle, I shouted NO and we awkwardly sat next to each other.

\-Now he doesn't talk to me at all anymore and he spends 1-2 hours on the phone each day talking to his girlfriend...despite him literally living in the ROOM next door to mine, in the same house. He also took her to his sister's wedding.

He never hangs in the living room or the kitchen and I feel creepy knocking on his door. 

I feel like the clock is ticking. Pretty soon he will move out and I will never see him again. Should I tell him how I feel? I miss him so much. I also wonder if I had sex with him or just ""gave in"" and cuddled with him while he was in the hospital...would he have liked me better?

What can I do? I think about him all day everyday, have dreams about him, and have already dated dozens of other guys from dating apps but none of them compare to how I feel about this guy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qssvyf/i_have_a_crush_on_my_roommate_but_he_has_a/

The first 6 weeks were great - we got along so well, he was super emotionally available and he didn’t play mind games. Then our country went into lockdown.

The first month of lockdown was good, we FaceTimed everyday and then I started seeing his mental health deteriorate in the second month and he started becoming standoffish. The city I was doing lockdown in eased their restrictions after the first month so I can’t imagine what it was like for him. 

I moved back to the city where we live 2 weeks ago, since then I’ve seen him once. He’s happily gone to play tennis with his friends, gone out for drinks with his friends…made loads of time for his friends, but when I’ve tried to initiate a hang out, I get shot down. And he’s also been an asshole to me about his ex. The straw that broke the camels back for me was me deciding to give him a couple of days space because he was having a tough time at work and with his depression and when I did reach out last night, he wasn’t struggling, he was at a friends house having drinks. 

I don’t know him long enough to know if this change in character is because of lockdown or if this is the “honey moon period is over” and it’s the real him but I really don’t like it. He constantly says I’m lame which has made me self conscious and he’s referred to me as “damaged goods” on more than one occasion. And I don’t think he’s really over his previous relationship either which became more apparent in the last month. The fact that he doesn’t want to see me in person is embarrassing too.

So I (26f) met my husband (25M) in June 2018, we soon moved in together March 2019. We struggled with jobs and keeping up with rent etc.  so I decided to join the army in Nov 2019 to make it easier for us, and to also move us from our small state. The recruiter suggested for us to get married so the army moves us around. Since we were already together we just decided to go for it. Long story short, I found out he was talking to a girl back in our home state after we had left and I was stuck on base during COVID. I was upset I told him to go back to our home state and just leave me alone cz I planned to file for divorce. He went back and started dating this girl. I ended up leaving the army 3 months later due to other reasons, and I managed to get an apt in a whole new state and start my own life. However, the divorce had not been processed, and he was still trying to make things work. I decided to take him back and he came to join me in my apt about 2 months or 3 later. He started giving me bad vibes and always talked of how he didn’t like his environment and how he wanted to be with his friends back home. I got tired of it and told him to leave if he wants to- he flew back the next day. Few months later he came back, and we tried once again to fix things smh. But now, he is back to trying to move. I have finally found a stable job with a reputable company that actually lets me utilize my BA and MS. Even though it is remote, I am required to live within 75 miles of the office. I am not looking to move and I am happy with where I’m at. He keeps bugging about how he doesn’t like where we live and that moving to a major city will help him feel better. In my experience, it doesn’t matter where we move. He just likes to be around his friends so they can party and hang. So moving would not help, it would be the same vibes. Other issues such as him not enjoying our nights out after I nag for us to even go somewhere. Always complaining about his job, wanting to wait to have kids even though I was ready at some point- not any more- not with him. So our lease ends in 2 and 1/2 months. I just applied for my own apt and I have not told him yet. Our apt needs a 60 day notice and I’m going to put mine in tomorrow. I am so over his negativity and bringing me down mentally. I want to be happy, travel, enjoy the good money I am making now. I guess I’m not really looking for help, just how other people see my situation.

Oh and I had filed for divorce in June. Our 3 month waiting period ended and I’m following up to see how it can get finalized because I’m so drained by him.
