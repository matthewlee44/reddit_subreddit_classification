However, it ended or became less relevant over time is due to the basic rules of dating. According to evolutionary biology, men on average want abundant sex life with huge variety while women want to date and commit with a single high value man. Within the hippie culture, the men were able to get what they wanted because of the idea of freedom, free love, etc. They would get basic food and shelter from social safety net and would spend most of the day with girls or with drugs. 
However, women within the hippie culture were not getting what they wanted other then some freedom. If most men do not bath, dont have jobs, do drugs, etc then they would not be classed as high value. Eventually, most girls realized this and moved out of the hippie world. This also forced the hippie men to move out of that culture and get a job, clean up, become responsible, etc.

First things first, I don’t find nightclubs cool because I can’t turn by brain off even with continuous music, the thing is, I got invited to a VIP lounge in Paris for the last night before nightclubs get closed the day after for two weeks because of covid. On hour after staying like a statue at the VIP table, I finished by drinking some vodka to simply meet people.

And it worked, after a few people, I went talking to a beautiful girl after she smiled at me in a cute way. I found out later she is Swedish so she speaks English as well (I’m a French native speaker). Still, my English was decent and the feeling between us were incredible. Later, we exchanged numbers and Instagrams (she have thousands subs, I have hundreds. Don’t know if it’s an important point). She said she didn’t mind if my account was poor. So I suppose it’s ok.

And it worked, after a few people, I went talking to a beautiful girl after she smiled at me in a cute way. I found out later she is Swedish so she speaks English as well (I’m a French native speaker). Still, my English was decent and the feeling between us were incredible.

After a lot of talking. We told our ages, mine is 20, her is 22. But it seems it wasn’t a problem for her.
She even said to me multiple times that I was cute and awkward so I guess it’s a good point.

Later, we exchanged numbers and Instagrams (she have thousands subs, I have hundreds. Don’t know if it’s an important point). She said she didn’t mind if my account was poor. So I suppose it’s ok.

A few moments later. I got back to her and for no reason I asked her a hug although I believed a kiss would be fine at this point of flirting.
So we hugged and she liked it then we continued talking afterwards.

Another minutes passed and I said to her I must go (it was 5:45 am) and we said we will call each other later.

When I got home, I was about to sleep but I looked to my phone and saw a missed call of her. I decided to call her back so we talked but I don’t remember at all what conversation we had exactly, about a minute or two later, I said to her that we will call tomorrow. I said I will. And we said good night (gently of course). That was my last interaction with her.

After waking up at 10 am. (4 hours of sleep) I sent her this message at 12:06 am.

""Hey [name] tell me when you’re free and we’ll call each other ;)""

because she were probably at her University but on the other side she must’ve been on lunchtime so I could eventually call her but I didn’t got the balls. She saw my message 20 minutes later but she didn’t reply.

I thought of her all the afternoon and thought how to find a way to call her back relaxed because the effects of alcohol were gone. So at the end of the day, I went to the gym to increase my testosterone levels but I pushed to hard so it made me feel angry (it was 4:30 pm) and it got worse later. I concluded I needed to call her back at 7-9 pm to be sure she’s available but I realized I was so tired and stressed to engage a conversation on the phone with her that I sent this message at 8:44 pm

""Hi it’s [me]! I was busy today so I woke early and you must’ve been busy too with [subject] classes, now I'm obviously tired to speak with a decent english AND with a cellphone quality lol.

So how's your classes going?""

The moment I send this post is the next day and still no reply of her.
I believe those messages were a big mistake! Now I should call her. From the beginning I simply wanted to invite her for a coffee or something but I thought I would be to straight for her. Maybe I was wrong and it was the solution.

Please tell me what I can do.

If the average annual income from this lifestyle is $50,000 then it would mean that the market size is $500 billion or 2 percent of the US GDP. I spoke with 3 sugar babies who did this as a side hustle. One of them bought a starter home before turning 24, another was looking to become financially independent or retire early by 27 years. The third one was able to travel to 100+ countries and has now got a six figure job through contact with a sugar daddy.

I really don’t like my facial features at all and I have to accept that I can’t change them without plastic surgery.

My biggest flaws are that I’m extremely quiet. I don’t like to talk a lot. I have tons of trouble making friends. My biggest fear is people. I come off as rude sometimes because I get so scared that I run away.

Even if I was good looking, I probably wouldn’t land a date due to my fear of people and personality type. However, I have a ton of facial flaws too. I’m bald, have a completely round head, have crooked/chipped teeth and my bone structure is awful (despite working out and doing facial exercises). Plus, my cheekbones are huge (chipmunk cheeks)

I was at a Halloween party and during a game of Cards Against Humanity, someone played a card “ugly with a bad personality.” Then someone I barely knew pointed at me and mentioned me. It destroyed my already fragile ego

I also go on Omegle and every girl skips me. They either give me a disgusted look, be very rude to me or make a negative comment about my face

I feel like even with a better personality and my best version of my appearance, I will hugely struggle to get any relationship

I'm High-Functioning Autistic myself, though I'm sure you already figured that out.

Due to this I have generally struggled to form any kind of relationships or just even interact with people really. I also have some other flaws that make this difficult such as social anxiety and a stutter among other things. All of which feed into each other as you can imagine, but they're issues for another time.

Now regarding our main question I ask for a number of reasons. Firstly it would be nice to hear some opinions from actual women. Secondly I wonder if I could tell someone that I'm autistic in order to explain any potential awkwardness that might arise. Thirdly because I worry about if I should actually tell someone or just try to hide it. In my experience telling a girl something like this never goes well.

Someone can treat you perfectly normal but completely change if they know you're autistic. They can ignore &amp; avoid you, be quite rude or even mock you, treat you like a child and speak to you like an imbecile etc... The last part gets to me the most though, I'm actually quite intelligent which I've noticed is either expected or surprising depending on the person. I'm socially challenged, not intellectually.

Due to such experience I'm very cautious about revealing my autism to anyone. I can mask it usually and just come off as very strange and awkward to most. This is quite tiring though, nor do I want a relationship built on falsehood.

But yeah... I best stop rambling on now haha. How do you feel about Autism personally Ladies? Let me know.

I was a casual dater then and now.  We started talking again couple weeks ago after a good 3.5 months.

In our past, he initiated and continued convos over text daily.  Would apologize if he was preoccupied for even a few hours.  He even once apologized in advance if he doesn’t reply while dealing with something, but actually still maintained consistent communication.  And when I had to decide for us take a break due to a situation of his and me starting a new job, he was direct and accountable about totally understanding how I feel.  

Currently, ever since we started talking, he doesn’t show the same consistency as in the past and the conversations feel very surface level (as in barely asking questions and even shorter acknowledgement,
Compared to our past).  Now it was his idea in our last conversation in the summer to plan something (to rekindle dating/hanging) in the future if I’d like.  And I did ask him when I reached out after a while if he’s still interested.  He said he’s definitely down, his extended family is moving into his home which will be hectic, but he’s up for it.  And I, as well as friends in my personal life, found it direct and open minded at the time.  

Now yesterday because of this difference in energy I messaged him “I remember you said you’re down to rekindle the casual dating/fwb stuff from the summer. But I’m sensing our vibe is not as strong as in the past, and that it is on and off depending on the day.  So I would like to know what’s up or what has changed, &amp; how you are actually feeling about us?”  And he responded “Oh I've just been sick and my family just moved here.”  Now both are true, and he has always been one to be concise in his texts and chattier in person.  And he’s rather passive/mellow in nature.  But I felt this wasn’t straightforward enough to answer the question.  So I texted him “I hope things get better! Honestly though how do you feel about us and hanging out? Just be honest as I don’t wanna waste both of our times” 

Now I need to open his recent reply.  Because of the non-straightforward nature of the previous message, I’m anticipating him potentially turning down hanging using his situation.  If he says in a direct, sincere way with more words than I would not press it.  But if he says it in a way that seems like an excuse, I’m thinking of saying “hey I wish you best of luck with that (his situation) regardless.  Now if you just aren’t feeling interested regardless, direct &amp; honest communication is best with me or anybody as we are all adults here.”  Basically I’m hoping to suss if that is specifically the reason or if that is a polite let down/excuse, but I certainly don’t want to come off as presumptive/accusatory or passive aggressive.  So I’m hoping for your thoughts .",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1135388,public,self,"Is it appropriate to call out if you suspect that someone you’ve dated/been dating is turning you down with an excuse, and if so, how?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/re3dnz/is_it_appropriate_to_call_out_if_you_suspect_that/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I went on a first date last night. We had spoken online a while. I fancied him. We shared some kinks. Drinks sounded good.

We went for cocktails, my favourite kind of date. I got to wear my Versace dress, so I felt good. It was all so promising.

We seemed to hit it off. Conversation flowed. This is nice, I thought.

Except, twenty minutes in to the date, he told me “I’ve booked a hotel for later.”

“For later?”

“Or in a minute. Whenever you’re ready.”

“Ready for what?”

“Wait.,.. I thought you liked me.”

“I do like you. You asked me out for a drink, not to go to a hotel with you.”

“Well I booked it now.”

“Well you wasted your money. I told my babysitter I’d be home by eleven anyway.”

He was perplexed. Didn’t understand it. Didn’t understand that I could both like him, yet not want to follow him back to a hotel first date.

“But you make porn for a living.”

“I do. But I choose who I make content with.”

“I don’t mind making content with you.”

“Gee thanks. But again, I choose.”

Seriously, the amount of guys I’ve had “offer” to “help” make content, like they’re doing me a massive favour, is beyond a joke.

Don’t assume that because someone makes porn, they want to make porn with you.

Don’t assume that because cocktails and conversation are going well, a girl is going to want to ride your dick on the way home.

Don’t. Book. A. Hotel. Room. Before. Discussing. With. Your. Date!


But you know what the most fucked up part is? I found myself APOLOGISING to him. He walked me back to my car, asked to get in for a while to “feel me”, and I said no… SORRY. Why? Why was I sorry? I still don’t know why I did that. But yeah, I did. And I said sorry for wasting his money on the hotel, but I had to get back. I wasn’t sorry. It wasn’t my fault his entitled ass paid money out when I hadn’t consented to anything. But still I left apologising for disappointing him…. Despite the fact I myself was very disappointed in how it panned out!

My love life started 8 years ago when I was just 19 years old. We were madly in love. It was totally new to me and ofcourse for her also. We explored a lot and we loved eachother so much. 

In our early years of love, I was not a great lover but she was mad about me and she loved me no matter what. But I took it for granted but I stayed true to her as well as I was in love to her and I did what I know about love at tat age. 
Then came a person who was my school friend and fate made him to be her college mate and also best friend. 
He did things tat made her feel special. He had the opportunity to stay with her. Be with her every day because they are in the same classroom. They had their moments as close friends. He slowly started to make his move and I know it's not his fault to get attached to someone like my girl. 

I got possessive and started to lose my shit our their conversations and over everything that they happen to enjoy as friends. At that age, I didn't have the maturity or the patience to listen to my girl.

I never felt what she wanted from me. But no matter what I wanted her to be my wife. We had our worst days and months during those time. 

We managed survive in the end. But some part of her love died in tat part of life. After 4 years of love, I realised her importance in my life and I did started to do things for her and I wanted her to feel so special. But I did them when she started to lose interest in love.
 I tried my best for 3.5 years and I had so much hope that we will discover love and tat we will rediscover ourselves and she will definitely be back in my arms.
So many days I stayed awake, thinking tat she will call me with love and as old days she will come back to me no matter what.

I convinced my parents, relatives and made everyone believe in our love. Eventually everyone agreed and wanted to get us married. 

Initially she was excited about the marriage and she felt special.

But this decision of marriage, made her to thing about our bad moments and the things tat I did which made her feel disgust.

Again she started to have her bad thoughts about me. But we had so many good and wonderful moments which all gets vanished insight of those bad ones.

With heart broken, I had come far away from my family, friends due to work commitments. And I find it really hard to get connected with people especially to get connected with any girl which I should done in my early days.

Over the past 6 months I have grown alot and gotten out of the habit of randomly hooking up and have been looking for something more serious. But I am having a hard time when getting rejected when I tell potential partners about my positive herpes status.
       I have been waiting till the third date hoping that they will enjoy my personality enough to consider it. I start off by asking what they know about it and dispelling myths and telling them statistics. (I've done hours and hours of research). For myself I've only had one outbreak when I originally got it almost 2 years ago. And I've never given it to another partner so I consider myself very low risk but there still is a chance of course. I've had friends advise me to stop telling people because of the last two reasons but I cannot bring myself to do that for obvious reasons.
      I guess what I'm wondering is... how do I give this news so it's not as shocking? What kind of information would you want to know potentially dating a woman with herpes? Should I keep waiting till the third date, should I wait longer, or do it sooner so that I ""don't waste our time? Have you dated someone with herpes and how did yall handle the risks? If you have herpes how do you handle the conversations?

I’ve been dating this guy that wants me to move in with him, it’s not like he’s a stranger, we dated 6 plus years ago and recently rekindled some things. We have raw sex, we spend quality time, share goals etc, we really enjoy each other’s company.

It’s not like I went snooping either, I follow some of these women myself, but I’m starting to see that he’s added them ALL. I feel like THATS what he want. Also, I don’t think he buys flicks from them but he saves the ones they post publicly, screenshots, etc. Makes me feel less than enough and he once made me feel more than enough. Seeing his name as a follower on ALL the pages really disgusts me. None of this makes me feel loved, adored, respected, or cherished by this man. This bugs me and sometime I have to ignore him completely so my emotions don’t get me overly angry.

However, sex should be viewed as culmination of acts taken together that build sexual tension and bonding, so that the final act of intercourse is hotter and more emotionally charged. This involves talking, pulling back monetarily while kissing, touching and kissing of the upper body, oral sex, or finger play.

The first part of this is kissing, pulling back to talk or tease, lightly brushing your fingers across her arm, kissing her neck, nibbling her ear. Take your time with this. Everyone always equates foreplay with oral sex, but this is just as important, even more so. This is where tension is built. The push/pull of kissing, then stopping helps in this. This should be done sparingly, otherwise the sexual tension can lost momentum.

Transition to rubbing her slowly while kissing in a gentle circular motion around the clitoris, keep building tension and anticipation. As things progress, go faster. Still take your time. If she has indicated she is ready, use your index and middle fingers to enter her. Press up against the upper wall of her vagina with a rapid heartbeat-like rhythm.

It’s a myth that all women like oral sex, it isn’t enjoyable for some. While still inside whisper “I’m going down.” She will communicate to you if this is something she wants. This way you can communicate boundaries without killing the mood.

If she indicates it’s time for intercourse, hold off a little bit longer. Tell her you’re not done yet. Get her as close to the mountaintop as possible before intercourse.

I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend (26M) for over two years now. We live together and have traveled together too. Virtually everything is perfect, he’s so sweet and supportive and takes great care of me. He is everything I could have asked for and more. Our sex life is generally pretty great, he’s very open to the things I like and can usually meet and exceed my expectations. Recently things have been really difficult, he’ll cum within seconds of starting sex. I have come to find out that this is something he’s been worried about since we started dating. I have tried to give advice like stopping and maybe focusing on some foreplay or changing positions and even trying to incorporate cock rings to dull the sense but I can just feel him getting down on himself. We have tried alcohol and weed but sometimes it’s not feasible. Recently it’s gotten to the point where I don’t even react back and I feel like I’m not even participating in sex, I’m just laying there, so that way I don’t set him off too quickly. I have always had an extremely high sex drive so this is very hard for me. I don’t want him to feel like he’s letting me down and I know he’s not intentionally but I definitely have not felt satisfied and I hate not being a participant in sex the majority of the time. The worst part is there is a clear mood shift after it happens and it takes awhile for us both to snap out of it. Does anyone have any advice maybe how to stop this issue or how to address it with him without making him feel like he’s incapable or not fully satisfying me.

I joined her class (bout 30 people) that year so we had never talked before. The snaps were just a simple hello and then that was it. She also asked me if I had a dog and for his name once after I sent a pic with him. Now we’ve been snapping eachother selfies with no text everyday for a year. At first I thought, hey, she just wants to increase her snap score, because we’re in high school (senior now) and that’s what teens do. She also had a boyfriend at the time, but I’m pretty sure they’re not together anymore. Usually she’ll send a blank expression or a slight smirk, but it seems like she usually tries to get good angles and lighting in, so there’s some effort at least. I have no idea if she does this with any other guy. She’s never left me on read or taken particularly long to respond. 

What gets me confused though is the way she acts towards me in real life. When we’re in class she’ll basically turn 90 degrees to look behind her like some contortionist, and almost always her eyes end up looking somewhere in my vicinity. Usually I sit with my guy friends, and I’m almost 100% she’s not interested in any of them so I have no idea why she’s looking my way. Other times, when I happen to be walking behind her, she’ll do the same thing and it seems like (turn her head 90 degrees) and it seems like she’s trying to get a view of me from the edge of her vision. But then when we meet in the corridors face to face she won’t meet my eyes for more than a fraction of a second. Just a few days ago she was walking with friends from the opposite direction and when we got close to eachother she started looking down at her shoes. We were right at a doorway so I stood aside to let them pass through and she almost collided with me/the door frame. She then laughed, though I’m not sure it was at that, didn’t say anything and continued on, not even looking at my face.

I’ve only talked to her a few times because there’s not really been any opportunities to.  First real time was at a party half a year ago. We got into a conversation, exchanged a few words and then she just looked around and walked away. Second time was at a party a few weeks ago at her place. She seemed pretty friendly this time. First I asked her a few things, she seemed happy to answer them and was slightly giggly. We then ended up in a group convo, didn’t feel any special attention from her at that point. Then we hugged, I left, and that was it. Still snapping eachothers selfies several times a day.

What the fuck am I supposed to make of this? Sometimes she’ll stare at me uncomfortably long, sometimes she won’t look at me, she’s snapped me with no interruption for a year but never talks to me in person. Sometimes I wonder if she thinks I’m scary/creepy for some reason, but then why would she snap me for so long? And I’ve never done or said anything remotely weird to her. Dating someone in my class was even off the tables until this year because of the resulting awkward situation if we would break up.

For context, if it matters, I’m not some creepy basement dwelling ogre. I’m a fairly attractive guy, kinda tall by most standards (6’5), am decent socially, with good hygiene and dress reasonably fashionably. She’s an attractive girl who seems pretty awkward in conversations from what I’ve overheard and experienced, but has plenty of friends which she hangs out with regularly.

I am going to call her Sue. So Sue was out of state for the last 3 days, and she will return home in a couple of hours. A few hours after, we are meeting up for dinner. It will just be our 4th date, but I feel like that we have seen each other for a long time, you know?

Our interests align. We want the same things out of life. We even like the same sports teams. Turns out we were in the same school district too. And now she is looking for a change of employer. Thanks to COVID, she held a job where she was underpaid for way too long.  And now she thinks she should sample the job market. We quickly agreed that my employer is not the right place for her, and I am secretly sorta relieved. I have seen good relationships blow up thanks to too much proximity, and I don't want anything to screw this up.

I've been seeing a guy occasionally for over a month now.  I'm not sure what to call it.  I met him on a lesser known dating site (because I was sick and tired of getting recognized and called out by guys who knew me or had previously rejected me, it was so embarrassing and also a dead-end).  He seemed nice, and he was insistent on meeting me the same day we matched on the dating site.  I admit he wasn't completely my type, and at first I was hesitant, but I decided to give him a chance because he's a decent looking guy, nice, and interested.  So far our meetups have consisted of us hanging out at my apartment, usually chat, sometimes watching TV, and sometimes he'll bring along a bottle of wine for us to drink.  We haven't done anything sexual, only kissed/made out, never anything further, always fully clothed.


So far I feel so-so about this, honestly.  When I went on the dating site, I was looking for a guy who could eventually turn into a husband and have a kid with me.  In recent times I've realized the grim reality that this probably won't happen with most guys or right away, so I am okay pursuing some short-term fun in the meantime, which means a sexual/FWB relationship.  On the day that I was actively on dating apps, I was seeking a sexual FWB.  So far I've had no sex from this arrangement.  I do admit I haven't rushed things with sex or made any first moves.  But neither has he, at all (despite ""good sex"" being in his ""likes"" section of his dating profile).  Part of this is because I'm shy and afraid of rejection, because of many rejections I've gotten in the past, some of these rejections occurring even without me making any moves or doing anything at all.


In the last week or so, I started mulling over what was going on with him and I, what was unfulfilling about this arrangement for me, what I wanted from it, and where it could lead.  I haven't gotten sex or a BF/GF relationship from it. I'm not certain he's looking to have kids in the future.  Even two female friends said I should broach him about what's going on because I've seen him several times in over a month and it isn't really going anywhere.  Normally I'm too intimidated to broach anything with a guy about relationship goals or what I want, again because of bad past experiences, and trying not to look too pushy or clingy.


Last week I summoned the guts to broach him about the sex needs thing, sort of.  I texted then chatted on the phone with him, tried to tell him I'm looking for sex and have sex needs, but I admit I stuttered over my words and got really nervous and flustered.  In turn he totally misinterpreted it, thought I was saying I was too afraid to have sex, that I worried he would want sex!  What?  That's the opposite of what I meant!  I reexplained it.  But the whole misunderstanding left me feeling more nervous than before about expressing my need for sex.


A few days later when I was having a bad day, and I'd just about had it with lots of people pulling one over on me, I finally summoned the guts to be more direct, including with this guy about my needs.  I texted him that I do have relationship goals for my future, and also sex needs in the meantime, but until I have those things fulfilled, I will keep myself open on the market in terms of talking to other guys.  I wanted to give the impression that other guys were trying to reach out to me, that I had other options.  He then texted back in a way that seemed cranky (cranky was my BFF's word for it when I showed her the texts).  He said that it was a big concern that I would even want to consider talking to any other guys.  Keep in mind he is not my boyfriend, we never talked about this, we have never even slept together, and my attempt to initiate sex backfired.  He then texted that I shouldn't be talking to any other guys at all.  Shortly later I asked him in text what he wanted from us dating-wise or relationship-wise, where he saw us going.  He texted, ""for you and me to be happy :)"".  Uh, what does this mean?  Can somebody please clue me in?  My BFF and another female friend were also confused by this.  I admit I'm confused, but also a little annoyed, because I feel this is such a vague answer and doesn't even really answer or address what I'm getting at.  Am I correct or am I being too hard on him?


Also, hypothetically is it wrong if I talk to other guys, either in friendly flirty conversation or on dating apps?  I admit I hadn't talked to anyone else at that point, moreso out of lack of convenience (my job kept me too busy, and there weren't any guys contacting me or responding to my earlier dating app messages) than conscious choice, but still.  So far we haven't had sex, or even foreplay, and we've never talked about becoming BF/GF.  In over a month he's taken me out once, and that was a brief dinner at a local restaurant down the street from where I live.  In the beginning he told me how he likes to go dancing (which I'm NOT into at all) and museums and stuff, but he's never suggested plans for that.  I'm not sure I'm really into him.  Is it bad if I consider myself open and single in the meantime?  Or would that be a form of cheating?  I admit the reason I am apprehensive about staying loyal to a guy who's not my BF is because I had a REALLY bad experience with this last year.  I committed fully to a guy, assuming he was my BF because we met up on a regular basis and because he told me not to date other guys while seeing him, but without the BF/GF talk, and in the end it turned out he was stringing me along while seeing other women.  Therefore, I do not want to end up a fool again.  What should I do?  What would YOU do in this situation?



TL/DR: I've been hanging out casually (with only kissing) with a guy I met from a dating site for over a month.  We've never had sex, never went on a date except 1 time when we had a short meal at a local restaurant, and are not BF/GF.  Trying to tell him I want sex was unsuccessful for me and just led him to tell me he thought I wanted the opposite, to not have sex.  When I asked him where he saw us going relationship-wise, he vaguely said he wanted us to be happy.  But he also told me he didn't want me talking to any other guys (so far I'm not, but I don't want to close myself off to other opportunities if they arise).  Is this normal for adult (30-somethings) dating, or a potential flag?  What should I interpret of his ""I want you and me to be happy"" response about our dating status?

So I’ve been more or less crushing on this 17 year old guy I work with. I haven’t acted on it or anything because if he likes me back, I want that decision to be 100% his without any outside influence, if that makes sense. I’ve been told that he finds me attractive but don’t know the extent of how he feels. 

I was struggling for a few days about the age gap and him being a minor. I’ve read a few posts and feel somewhat better, but ultimately don’t know what to do. I feel like if maybe we were to hang out more and get to know each other better, over time there may be a chance that we start dating. I’m already worried about how I’ll be perceived as a 21 year old liking a 17 year old (AoC is 16 in my state but I still feel like I’m a weirdo). 

Does anyone have experience with this type of situation? Or an age gap and dealing with people’s opinions?

We had really good chemistry over text. He told me that I was really hot, and the cutest guy in town, and he was very attractive too, being a former model.

We went on a first date after a week or so of texting and it went well. He lived an hour away from me and said that he usually doesn't drive that far to meet someone, and that he didn't think that he'd consider dating someone so soon after he got out of a two year relationship a few months before, but that there was something about me.

We made out and he held my hand for a bit as he drove me home. We made a plan for a second date and kept texting each other. He started going through some stuff, him and his family having to move unexpectedly and him trying to take out a loan to get a new house for his family, and I'd be there for him, sending encouraging texts.

He told me that he was obsessed with me, falling for me, and could see himself spending his life with me, and that no one else is as smart as me except for him, and that he might be my perfect match. I have difficulty socializing, so I've never been in a relationship before and only been on a few dates. No one's ever said stuff like that to me, and I was so happy to hear that this guy really likes me.

He said that he wanted to have sex on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. He said it had to be in his car, since his family was having to leave their house and I lived at home too and wasn't allowed to have potential romantic partners stay the night . And it also had to be unprotected. 

I told him that I was nervous to be penetrated since I'm a virgin, and  I wasn't sure how I felt about my first time being in a car, and he said that I just had to get over it. He eventually said that we didn't have to have sex on the second date, but that is being in a relationship would be delayed until we had sex, because he wanted to know how good it would be. I was going to go through with it, but a few days later I thought that we wouldn't be sexually compatible, and we went our separate ways.

I've been having trouble moving on from him since it happened, going back and forth between thinking he just wanted to have sex with me and being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who saw a future with me. Last month I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked if he really did like me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me and he said that he did really like me at first but that I ruined it.

I've been thinking about it recently and did I ruin it or did he?  It seems to me like he liked someone (me) enough to see himself spending his life with them, but it ended up not working out because he had to have unprotected sex on the second date to see if they'd be dating and wouldn't budge on that issue, even though the person he was obsessed with and falling for didn't want to do that. He said that I was pushing him away when we were initially talking, but it seems like he was pushing me away by not being able to go at a pace that I would be comfortable with.

And I think it's a combination of my personality, and just the fact that I don't really feel romantically attracted towards anyone. Not to say I don't find women attractive, but every conversation I've been in I've almost never have been able to figure out the difference between me having a simple conversation or me flirting. It's something I've always had trouble with, and at this point... I just don't know if I should even continue trying or just accept the fact I might wind up being alone for the rest of my life.

I hate to say it, but I've kind of gotten used to being alone after all these years. Comfortable with it even. For awhile, I've had friends who's company I've treasured more than any personal intimate relationship I've had with a woman, and I've had this theory that maybe I don't necessarily need to have a romantic partner so much as I need a companion who knows me well enough to perhaps not see me as partner material but not a complete hopeless loner neither.

I can't say that I completely like or am comfortable with that theory, but I can't say it's not inaccurate to what I've been dealing with so far in my life. And that maybe it may be the closest and only thing I have to having a partner in the near future. 

The thing is... I still kind of want to try having a romantic partner. I'm 28 soon to be 29 in a few weeks, and so far haven't had a girlfriend since I was 15. Either because most women in school were skanks, or because no one ever clicked with me. I'm not going to say I'm handsome. I'm decent enough, but I can't say I radiate masculine attraction or any standard of attraction really. I'm decent enough. 6 at least. 7 at best. But I think my confidence has decreased over the years since I started becoming social. I've had a passion for material things mostly, and don't have much interesting hobbies that people would gravitate towards and find reason to stick around with me. I don't think anyone I've tried talking to has ever really seen me as much of a potential partner so much as a friend and sometimes... That's just not enough for me. And I don't know if I should be mad, or just accept it and just never talk to them again. I've had friends whom I've been romantically interested in the past, and still hang out with them despite those ships sailing. But the thought always linger that maybe they might change their mind and give it a shot. It's a delusion, I know. What's done is done, and I can't change anything. And if I try, it will destroy the relationship I've tried to keep afloat. I don't know. I feel I'm ranting now.

I guess my point is... I'm lonely. And I guess it's fine but at the same time, I wish I wasn't sometimes. Maybe time will tell whether things change but not likely given my luck and location.

Quick question though. Have people had any change at all with finding dates in other states? I live in the east coast US, and another reason I think may have had no luck is just location.

Like everyone else, I've succumbed to online dating, due to everything going virtual. It seems like more people have gone into dating apps, due to restrictions and easier to finding a date, girlfriend, or any other relationship. For the past year and half, I've been on several dating apps.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good job in Finance, making money, work out daily, and have other hobbies, so I'm not some boring person who's trying to find myself. In these dating apps, I describe myself thoroughly in my bio. I add several photos, and even pay for subscirptions. I can honestly say that over the past year and a half, I'v paid up to several hundred dollars, even up to a couple thousand. I always change my photos, change my bio, and upgrade my subscriptions. During the past year, I have not been able to get a date with any woman. I do get matches (up to 3-4 a month), but none have been aligned with my values or attracted to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't gone on a date in a very long time and I'm always trying to convince myself that it's some sort of algorithm playing with my profile and I should stay patient. But now that I'm constantly paying for these apps, swiping right until there are no people left, and can't get into any form of converstation, I'm coming very close to losing hope. It's not about how you apply yourself in thesse apps and how much you invest your time. The only thing that matters is how you look.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to say that I can give myself a solid 4/10. I'm not the most attractive guy out there. It's extremely difficult to  find any form of relationship, or even a simple date, when you're not looking like other men on these apps. It's very depressing.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1135456,public,self,Dating apps,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/re7jx7/dating_apps/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,
