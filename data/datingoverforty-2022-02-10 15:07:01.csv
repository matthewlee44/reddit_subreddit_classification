She ate two slices and asked for a box, then whipped out her phone and started messaging and ignoring me. 

It was an awkward moment and knowing I have nothing to lose, I just excused myself, went to the cashier and paid my half plus a little more and a tip and left without saying goodnight.

24,sq9bh4,1644612831,Update: Long Term relationship but tough schedules and just enough distance to make seeing each other on the regular kind of tough,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/si0vtn/long_term_relationship_but_tough_schedules_and/) 

Some good conversation on the last post so I thought I would follow up.

Originally I had said I really didn't think I could make more of an effort than I had been but I decided to test that this week since I didn't have the kids. I went to her place 3 nights this week. Each time it was an hour in the evening and then about 40 minutes on the way home. Both are relatively high traffic times, the evening is worse. 

By last night at her place I was exhausted and kind of feeling it - I had an edge. I have never really had an edge with her before and she said something in regards to an activity we were doing and 'making me work for something' and I just kind of stared at her and said 'the drive here was work.' It immediately changed the moment from joking (she was joking with me playfully) to negative and it also highlighted something for me internally. Even though I've always known it - I hate commuting. I've worked most of my career in such a way that I can work from home so I don't waste my time commuting. I hate it. My ex and I started in a relationship that was distanced similarly but just a bit further (about 40-50 miles vs 25 here) but the traffic situation was similar - same freeway basically I just lived further south than I do now. 

I hate the commute. I dig her but I fucking hate it. I can't do it more than once a week and it's worse for her if she tries to come my way so she doesn't really do that. Plus it's got me getting up so early that I am pretty tired for the rest of the day.

It sucks. I hate it.

Back to the moment, she recognized it and said she was surprised I made the comment as she felt it was a 'pet peeve' of mine and one we weren't allowed to bring up. I think she has some feelings too. I was too tired last night to make it into a more serious conversation and I wanted to reflect a bit more (I mean stall) to put my own thoughts together. 

My son really likes her, I hate that if I break up with her that he will be part of it too. She and I have been seeing each other for almost 2 years (in may) and we've been exclusive for just over a year now. We were on and off a bit in the beginning. 

I feel terrible too because I'm the one who pursued her when we were off the last time. I renewed it and now I feel like I'm just going to hurt her more. 

I also feel like I'm so numb these days because of the pandemic, fighting with my ex over custody stuff with our older son and working through all the paperwork and financial stuff after divorce (which I'm still doing) AND my job's changed quite a bit during the pandemic and I just don't have the same work/life balance I used to. I almost feel like I'm just fucking the pain away with her. I really do enjoy her company and I believe I have the feelings for her I tell her I have (love) but over the last few months other parts of my life have been incredibly intense and it's just really affected my ability to feel anything.

I'm exhausted emotionally at this point and I am just a deer in headlights about the idea of bringing up my heart right now &amp; telling this woman that I just need to be on my own because as wonderful and supportive as she is and has been, I literally can't feel it.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sq9bh4/update_long_term_relationship_but_tough_schedules/

Please don‚Äôt lecture me on this part because I‚Äôve heard it all. I get it. But shit happens and here we are. I wound up with very deep feelings for him, and he couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt reciprocate. He told me he doesn‚Äôt have plans to leave his marriage, and he can‚Äôt promise me more than we had at that time. So I heard that finally, loud and clear. I‚Äôve been mentally preparing for the end. I know it‚Äôs a matter of time. He said he won‚Äôt hold me back from where I should be. 

Fast-forward to recently. I started trying to have conversations and date casually other men. It‚Äôs a jungle out there. Damn. But I know I need to move on. I met someone recently that I got along with. We went out a few times, talked for quite a bit. I knew I needed to eventually come clean about the other relationship. New guy and I had said ‚Äúno judgements. No shame. Past issues and relationships don‚Äôt matter‚Äù. I felt comfortable and vulnerable enough to tell him about my affair. He was supportive at first. I told him I know it has to end and it will. Mind you, we‚Äôre not exclusive, I didn‚Äôt really have to tell him anything about anyone else I‚Äôm seeing, I told him because I was honest and knew it was done. A few days later it was done. I was crying and sad for me. It was hitting me hard, a divorce, an affair I regret, doing things alone, it all came to a head. He had asked me if I was ok, and I told him briefly what had happened.  He was silent the rest of the night, comes back late with a big long ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù text on how he can put up with a lot, but not someone hung up on a married guy not leaving his wife. How it was the last straw me crying over him ( I was crying for myself mind you. I was taking back my power and taking control of things finally. I‚Äôm not heartless, it‚Äôs going to be emotional). I told him all of this, he didn‚Äôt listen, said there is no room for discussion, stopped answering my texts and ignored my phone call. What an ass!  So I asked him to at least talk to me on the phone. Can you think about it and call tomorrow?  He comes back and says he‚Äôs not thinking about it, he‚Äôs bowing out, and to quit calling him.

We chatted for a while using Discord and she told me she lived in Glasgow, Scotland (I live in the US), worked for a tech firm, and so forth. All nice ""get to know you"" talk before she asked to move over to Google Chat/Hangouts. I use that myself so I was fine with that. There was more chatter, sharing of pictures, all those kinds of things. We did one video chat which didn't last long due to a crummy connections but what I saw of her looked like the pictures she sent so, in my head, she was legit.

Because I had it in my head that this person was real, I ignored the warning voice in my head even when talk moved to finances which then moved over to ""will you give me a loan for"" reason X, ""will you help me with a project at work"", and similar talk. Of course, my intuition was telling this wasn't right but the other part of me was in a ""damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead"" mode. Yes, there were the promises that I would be paid back and I believed them because I was so emotionally caught up with this person, that we would meet, and so on. No amount of logic was overcoming my desire to fully believe this woman and her words. She claimed to work for Tesco as a crypto analyst, if such a position even exists. Even when I was reading contradictions in what she wrote (like where she worked), I just excused them and kept on going. I shared WAY too much personal information with this person.

Well, I'm out around $17,000 cash US and have $30,000 US worth of credit card debt. My credit cards were cancelled due to all of this nonsense I let happen and my credit score, which used to be great, has really taken a hit. I finally got my head out of the sand during the beginning of January to realize that I had been catfished...this even after some people had warned me that I was being scammed. After freaking out for a bit, I managed to pull myself together to start to think about what I need to do. I first got in touch with Tesco and Glasgow police to see if they could help me gather information. Glasgow police told me the street address this person gave me didn't exist. Tesco gave me a bit more of a canned response that they would never ask an employee to do what she asked me (gift cards, of course!) and to contact my local police which I did. Talked to them and sent lots of emails, pictures, and screenshots to the officer who was working with me. He then moved it over to a detective who sent Google a request for information about the email address this person was using to chat with me. As you might guess, it was created in early July, 2021 in Nigeria.

The past few weeks have been very busy: I changed tons of passwords, closed out a couple accounts, put in fraud alerts with the 3 major credit bureaus, and filled out online forms with the FBI, among other things. Got a personal loan to pay off the credit cards. Did everything I could think of to secure my financial world. Emotionally, it was tough but the thing that really stuck with me was how I continued to ignore my intuition. I still beat myself up a bit over it at times, even after reading about these scams, how these people are professional criminals, and are so good at being very convincing. I realized how I was an easy target for this kind of thing, too, so I'm working on coming to terms with that and how I can (hopefully) protect myself both emotionally and financially. I need to learn how to trust my inner voice.

So, for those of you who have had similar experiences, I feel for you especially having been there (and am still there, really). It sucks to believe in someone who turned out to be not that person at all and is really out to scam you. **Please, please, pay attention to your intuition** even if you don't want to listen to it as I've done. Be safe out there and watch out for these kinds of people and be aware what they can do to you.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sr5ain/catfished_a_tale_of_caution/

You can look at every scenario and chances are I‚Äôve dated someone that fell into the scenario (to be fair I‚Äôve gone on dates with only maybe 12 people in a few years).  But no matter what they seem to pull away.   I just don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm missing here, unless dating has just changed too much and I‚Äôm totally missing the mark.  I‚Äôve tried to be cool about things, I‚Äôve tried to not be clingy while also expressing that I am interested, etc.  Current man I‚Äôm seeing is sweet and kind, checked a lot of boxes, seemed really into me,went on multiple dates before he kissed me, but as soon as we crossed into some intimacy he pulled back.

57,srie9z,1644758133,Seemingly conflicting statements,"My (49F) ex bf (50M) broke up with me late Dec. Talked to him this week (I initiated via email asking why he just threw everything away for one mistake and he called in response) for the first time about 6 weeks after our break up (2 yrs together, very good relationship IMO). We have been LD for about half the time. He broke it off because I lashed out at him because of my own stress. First time this has happened. He‚Äôs apparently got some mistreatment trauma in his past. 

Right now, he‚Äôs got a ton going on with his startup (moving, another investment raise, teetering on break even but not quite). He explained to me during our call that he shut it down because he was not going to be a punching bag. He was touched and appreciative when I told him one of the things I loved about him was that he was not a doormat. This was the first time in the relationship, he knows me better and I made a mistake. He seems to get that I‚Äôm very regretful and understands I‚Äôm working on learning stress management techniques. It was a calm conversation, even some laughs were had. I think if he weren‚Äôt in the midst of these big things right now, he‚Äôd probably be more open to reconciliation at this point. 

So, he made two conflicting (in my eyes) statements that I‚Äôm hoping to get some insight on. First he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve moved on‚Ä¶Though there isn‚Äôt someone else or anything like that.‚Äù I completely believe him, he‚Äôs too busy and moving to a different city.

70,srt19c,1644786474,Does it has sense to talk to her after a break up?,"Hi!

My ex GF and me broke up a month ago ago (she's 48, i'm 42). I miss her a lot, but we both didn't contact each other. We were dating for around 5-6 months. It was amazing. I loved her more than she love me, but i didn't care and we were dating normally and building a relationship (as far as i know).

We had a tough discussion, where we disrespect each other like we've never done before. Never, she punished me and i attacked her cause it hurted, i told her and she continue, that was annoying. I started very angry about issues in our relationship, and suddenly she wanted some time, we continue the discussion, and then she said she broke up finally.

I was very angry so i said it was ok for me (I thought that in that moment, and even that day, it was in the morning), but then i realize how i miss her.

She chose to follow her indepdent life... and it was the first strong discussion we have. For real. I suddenly realized that maybe she was thinking about the broke up last weeks, probably (i'm guessing, she didnt say nothing ever).

So my anger caused the breakup, but it was hide inside her, so I think i only accelerate the process. I felt really stupid. Why she didn't fight or at least why she doesn't want us to be friends, we never had an argument like this, it got all out of hand. She was affectionate and attentive as she used to do that day, I don't understand anything, she then was cold and distant and commenting on problems from the beginning of our relationship that I thought were more than solved and talked about. Really idiots things like i talked a lot about my ex gf and that annoyed her (but that was during our first dates, that was not to me another reason). She was like justifying the decision, when he could have not been hurtful and just said he didn't want to go on, period, it would have been just as harsh, but you don't get that bitter and unpleasant aftertaste, there was no need.

I don't know if talking to her would change anything after a month with no contact. My friends say that once a woman makes a decision like that, and she tells you that she has lost feelings, there is no going back. And that she probably won't talk to me because she is very proud (she is), and she will remember the things that hurt her or she does not like about me. She moved on, but inside me i feel like those things were avoidable and talking with care and intelligence could be solved.

And that is my doubt. If you contact her and ask her if she wants to talk. 

The thing is that I feel like I need to close the chapter and so it's not clear to me. Or maybe I miss her so much. I don't want to annoy her anymore and I'm not going to cry or ask to come back in a slimy and demanding way, just to know if, like me, she thinks that it was a bad time and that, despite the failures that we both have, there is something that unites us in the background and we can look for solutions.

If she wants, and if not, then chapter closed. I would like to know if someone who has been in this situation and the experience and if this is a wrong idea and i should move on and let this finish.

75,ss05gp,1644807749,The absolute worst thing a man can say to me‚Ä¶ is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúneedy‚Äù.,"We all have pasts and we have all been hurt. I mean, we‚Äôre in the dating realm at forty years old for crying out loud. I‚Äôm sitting in my bathtub, steam rising all around me and my head is hurting because I just ended it with someone. Let me be clear- my head is hurting because I‚Äôm angry, not because I‚Äôve been crying. Let me explain‚Ä¶

Trauma and triggers often go back to childhood. After the ‚Äúend‚Äù conversation with this person I‚Äôve had an epiphany involving my childhood and that may be a big part of why my head is hurting as well. I‚Äôve been through counseling where these things have been talked about and analyzed separately, but I‚Äôve never connected them before and neither has a therapist. So, be gentle because here goes‚Ä¶

I(45f) was an only child until my brother was born when I was five. So I have vivid memories of him being brought home, etc. Things were good until he started to walk. To put it lightly, he was rambunctious and constantly needed attention. My mom was a SAHM and my dad worked swing shifts at the time, so often if he was home he was sleeping. He would swing shifts for three weeks before he would get a week off and then go back to it. My mom was essentially a single parent. 

My brother did not nap during the day(I‚Äôm really not sure why) and ran full tilt from dawn until dusk with my mother, who was just beginning to find out she had a seizure disorder, running after him. I was in school most of the day,  but when I got home there wasn‚Äôt a lot of thought or time given to me. I was quiet, well behaved, and independent, so both parents assumed I didn‚Äôt need them. I was often left in my room for hours reading or playing with my dolls and horses by myself. 

However, when I did need them- they were both exhausted. My brother, as a toddler, locked my mom totally out of our house to crawl on top of a stove top to get to Halloween candy. She could hear the burners rattling, but could not get to him. He let her in when he had his fill of candy, so yah, he was  a handful. This was the eighties. No cell phone. The neighbors were all at work. She just had to hold her breath and hope he didn‚Äôt catch himself on fire. 

When I did go to her for comfort or needing help with homework, exhausted and going through a traumatic diagnosis, she would tell me I was being ‚Äúneedy‚Äù, that she needed a break and that I needed to be able to do things on my own. I was SIX!

Fast forward to my adult hood. I worked my ass off through college. Graduated, I often worked two and three jobs so I could afford my house(I bought it at 23) and maintain my independence at all cost. I never wanted to have to rely on anyone other than myself. The ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be needy‚Äù reverberating in my head over and over. 

Then came my ex. Now diagnosed as a narc(officially last year! Yes! I wasn‚Äôt crazy!) whom had very, very poor communication skills along with the whole gaslighting and lying and being cagey. We argued often because of his poor communication with me and he would often resort to telling me I was needy, a stage one clinger and that I would probably fall apart without him. He knew this was my trigger. I would get quiet, the fight would go out of me and for days afterwards I would feel the weight of these words, even though I had maintained and bought a home on my own years before meeting him. 

This brings us to today. The man I‚Äôve been seeing sucked at communication and after telling him once that I needed this(good communication)in order for me to feel safe and valued in our relationship, I told him I was done when there wasn‚Äôt any change. He was upset and told me that anyone who needs this type of clarification was too needy for him anyway. 

So, now I‚Äôm sitting in my bathtub angry. I have finally realized that what I‚Äôm asking is not unreasonable and that he chose the thing he thought would hurt me most to justify his own shortcomings! 

From this point forward I vow that these words will no longer hurt me. Thank you for reading!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ss05gp/the_absolute_worst_thing_a_man_can_say_to_me_is/

77,ss2a6h,1644814512,Vent - I broke it off today over a 5 min call,"I (41F) started talking to someone (46M) on Bumble in December right before Christmas. Great communication (daily texts initated by him) and humor. We didn't meet until January 2 due to holiday stuff. Great first lunch date. The next weekend we had another date. He disclosed he had a daughter (not on his profile). I wasn't looking for someone with kids but I was invested. He also disclosed he lived with his parents, not a dealbreaker since they were older and Covid situation. The next weekend, we saw each other on Saturday and Sunday. He calls me on Monday to disclose he's been to jail and that's why he's living with his parents. Again, not a deal breaker for me as he sounded remorseful. He also has not kissed me yet so I asked him about it. He said he's not dated in a long time and didn't know when. The next weekend, we hung out Saturday with a make out session in the car then he wants to invite me to his place Sunday to hang out and meet his parents. Great, I bring a bottle of wine and met his parents. I also realized he lives an hour away from me but we been meeting in what I thought was the middle but he actually is further out. We go down to the basement, we're making out. He lies there like a dead fish. He doesn't touch me at all. He doesn't really kiss me back either. Ok figure he was awkward and afraid that his parents would come down. I called him Monday and asked him what he was looking for in a relationship since I felt pretty rejected since he didn't even touch me. The next weekend I invite him to meet my friends at a Lunar New Year lunch. We came back to my place. I start kissing him and again he lies there like a dead fish. When I stop kissing him and move over, he would then reach out to touch me as if he didn't want me off of him. So after stewing on this I call him on Monday and discuss with him how I want to be touched when kissing. I asked if he was physically attracted to me since again he didn't touch me at all. We have not discussed sex yet so I also brought that up as I was looking for passion in my next relationship. So all week we had flirty texts and I was very open about my willingness. He also seemed he was interested in the next level. I invited him over today and cooked him a great meal for Valentines. He brought me a potted plant and complimented me on how I looked and the meal. We watched Ted Lasso, again I start kissing him. He touches my arm and back. We stopped kissing as it didn't lead to anything. He pulls out his phone and plays Wordle. What the HELL. We go back to kissing. Ended the date pleasantly enough. I called him and explained that I was frustrated and unhappy and didn't think things would work out. He said he understands, wishes me luck and hung up. WOW all that time and effort ended in a 5 minute call. I am now all up in my head thinking all the signals were there but he just wasn't attracted to me. 

TLDR : Guy really seems into me and put in quite a lot of effort but didn't want to touch me or have sex. Ended in a 5 minute call.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ss2a6h/vent_i_broke_it_off_today_over_a_5_min_call/

81,ss9p6g,1644842481,How To Know If He‚Äôs Lying (Even To Himself),"A recent breakup has me feeling like I got hit by a bus. We are both divorced (me longer than him) and met online just after we‚Äôd both gotten out of short relationships. I was initially skeptical (as I would be with anyone), but he worked overtime to win me over: courting me, saying stuff like, ‚ÄúHow are you everything I need in one package?‚Äùand wanting to spend lots of time with me. He was fun and handsome and affectionate  and available and charming the sex was great. 

By two months, he was starting to talk long-term plans. By three months he told me he loved me and was ready to meet my kid. 

One thorn: He was ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with the girl he‚Äôd dated before me. It seemed to me like she either still wanted him to be pining after her, or she was having regrets about dumping him‚Äîthey‚Äôd only gone out for a month or so and she‚Äôd thought he was too intense‚Äîbut he insisted it didn‚Äôt matter because he was much happier to be with me. I‚Äôm still friends with the guy I was with before him, so I let it be. He never wanted to tell her to just go away, he said, because they shared political views (we don‚Äôt) and had so many mutual friends.

Well, four months in I went away for the weekend. When I left, everything seemed fine/great. When I got back, we were done. He insisted he did l love me, although admitted he maybe wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhead over heels‚Äù because he never worried about me dumping him. But he said he was now sure he didn‚Äôt want to be with me forever, and so it was better to break it off. I didn‚Äôt understand how one could go from ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to that so fast. It had never happened to me before. 

Now, a month later, I find out he‚Äôs with that girl, and I feel hurt all over again. I don‚Äôt know if she made a play for him while I was away, or if she waited until a few weeks after he dumped me and that truly wasn‚Äôt in his mind when we were broken up. I wish I did know, but I am not even sure if it matters. Is there any way to protect myself better in the future? It was the first time I‚Äôd been in love since my ex-husband and while I didn‚Äôt necessarily think it would be forever, I also didn‚Äôt think it would be over so fast.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ss9p6g/how_to_know_if_hes_lying_even_to_himself/

I just wanted to say, I had to break up with him again and I am particularly miserable. After a week of not talking via text, or at all, he messaged that he missed me, and I wrote back saying, I know, it's hard! 
Which led to a barrage of texts, walls of text, trying to convince me to come back and of what he could offer. This is a man who does not speak my native language very well, and I don't speak his in a social way. I couldn't connect to him, whereas he seemed to not really be aware of a lack of connection (?) Or, he seemed blinded by the want to just be in a relationship. I tried to get him to see my side of things, but he was not able to. 
It was too late already! Part of what turned me off was the pursuing too much!!
It triggered me because my ex husband did that pursuing thing with me, and I often felt cornered.
So I had to tell this ex bf today, again, that it was over, and to have some respect for himself, - you shouldn't be trying to convince someone to stay with you, they have to want to be with you!! And to not rely on me for all his self esteem and happiness, and to essentially ...grow a pair?! (But not with those words) lol
I just feel upset about having to go through this again. Maybe I'm upset at myself for not making a stronger boundary, and for even letting the relationship get this far. Sigh!!!

He went out of his way to ask me what my favorite candy was over a week ago as well as find out my favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor.  He asked if I was bored watching him play,  but I find it very relaxing. I cannot remember having a better valentines day,  and it wasn't because of what he purchased or what we did,  but because he thought about me and even wished me a happy early valentines,  since we couldn't get together tonight.  I told him again this morning how much I appreciated  yesterday.  It truly is the thought that counts.

It feels strange not to be thinking about moving the relationship forward toward goals like moving in together, marriage, kids, etc. 

I've been married and don't feel the need to do it again. I have a kid and don't feel the need for another one. I value having some alone time on a regular basis.

96,ssteuo,1644896348,How to move on‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm 46F and have been in an on again off again relation-shit with 49M for the last 8 years.  We met about a year after I was divorced (2014- was a set ufor by a mutual friend) and I was enamored within a few weeks.  Having left a loveless marriage that had no friendship or romance, I found all of it in this man and became smitten.  I felt ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù to him, the way he doted on me, spoiled me, we traveled, he made me feel on top of the world, and the physical connection was amazing.  I ignored all red flags even from the very beginning (he seemed a bit narcissistic, a know it all) and also had an odd protective nature over his ex wife (who he claimed cheated and stole money from him). We loved hard and we fought hard and must have broken up 15 or more times over the years.  He was always doing the breaking up.  Would literally say I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship seemingly out of the blue and ‚Äúbreak my heart‚ÄùMost breakups lasted a few days to a month once or twice but then one of us would reach out and cycle repeated.  I allowed him back in.
He has an aggressive demeaning gas lighting nature that triggers my short temper and I  would react.  He then used my reaction against me to tell me all I do wrong and I‚Äôm left thinking what a terrible person I am questioning myself!!!  I have been on this roller coaster on and off for too long.  I am 99.9% certain he‚Äôs cheated although he‚Äôs smart enough to never get caught - and just when I gather the strength to end it, he breadcrumbs me and pays attention to me and I give in.  I‚Äôve been in therapy and I know it‚Äôs a self esteem issue on my end that I‚Äôve allowed and put up with his narcissistic behavior and bread crumbing.  Here‚Äôs the plot twist- when I am now physically next to him, the rose colored glasses come off.  I‚Äôm no longer smitten or attracted to him mentally due to the years of mind f*cking and hot/cold behavior.  However I‚Äôve been unable to put on my big girl pants and fully disengage because I don‚Äôt want him to give someone else what I once had from him!!! So much attention, affection, love, adoration.  I was dying of thirst and he gave me an endless supply of water in those early years but I see now the water was tainted.  I just can‚Äôt help but remember how those early years felt and how I was the happiest and felt so loved for the first time in my adult life.   I know this relationship is long over, and I‚Äôve tried dating on and off but haven‚Äôt met one decent guy who sparked an ounce of interest.  I am smart, educated, people say I‚Äôm beautiful, I have a great job and am an excellent mother but I cannot dig deep and move on with dignity from a man who has truly messed up my mental well being.  I‚Äôm afraid of letting go.  Addicted to this man who now treats me terribly.  Throws me a bone by calling me.  I Wish somehow those early days/feelings could return because I thought I was so happy; now I wonder how much of it was a charade on his part, to win me over then the narcissist came out.
I want to move on and give dating a fair chance.  I just cannot seem to fight the demons of jealousy and let go of this man.  Any advice is much appreciated.
