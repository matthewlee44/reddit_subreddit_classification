Also, I'm a hall senior and she's a fresher which adds another complication and might be considered weird. If I was to be honest, my mind is telling me it's a bad idea, but I've gone through a pretty dry spell (COVID and other reasons) and I feel like I'm just thinking with my penis.

I did not knew what flair was right to use, I hope it doesn't matter all too much.

My boyfriend and me are long distance but we will meet in march. He is 29, was not in a relationship before and thus never had sex with anyone.

We have talked about sex here and there and we talked about preferences, what we would like to try out, etc. But I also noticed that as soon as we talk about it in a very serious tone, he voices being nervous, being afraid of doing something wrong, me not being satisfied. I reassured him that he should not worry about this all too much and that he has no reason to be afraid and that I am not gonna leave him for something like this.

But as he has those worries, I have them too. I am not gonna push being sexual with him the first few days and I don't want to pressure him at all or give him the feeling that we have to.

So I went on a date with this guy that I am acquaintances with and we matched online. 
Date was ok, we went to dinner and then a nice bar for drinks.
Get back to his house and hangout for around half an hour and I say I’m going to get going. He goes in for the kiss.
We start making out and I stop him and say I need to get going. He goes in for another make out session and gets handsy.
Stop him again. 
He asks me to stay and hangout longer snd watch a movie. Things were good for a little while and then we start kissing again.. I got turned on at this point and instigated a little and then stopped it because I had no intention of having sex on the first date. 
A little bit later he blatantly asks if I was not having sex because it was the first date, to which I replied yes. 
We continue hanging out and then I leave a little later.
He’s texted me every day for the past 3ish weeks but nothing of getting to know me stuff, just mutual interest things and it’s a brief couple of messages back and forth. He’s expressed interest in wanting to grab breakfast or hangout and after I agree there is no definitive plans made.
I will say I am used to guys chasing me a lot more and putting in a lot of effort to get to know me for a few weeks and trying to plans things out ahead of time. Is he just not that interested? Is he just keeping tabs hoping I’ll put out next time?

(TLDR at the end lol)

A phd student (25m) here, regarding timing and schedule, I spend most of my weekdays working on my project and sometime even during weekend if unlucky enough...

During weekend I usually have one evening for family commitments etc. (so not for socalizing anyway).

For my spare time, I do have hobbies like sketching or painting (and ofc going to the galleries) or playing classical music but might be a bit ""out of date"" considering my age, as most of my peers would rather go drinking, clubbing etc.; I play soccer as well but still mostly male-dominant field, and plus I am not a drinker and plus my aforementioned family issue would hardly hang out with others.

For my communications, not sure it's my personality or my training for phd, I could hardly hold the conversations as usually my words or responses are sort of too ""insightful"" and shut down any possibility to expand the small talk or whatever - and tbh I try but still don't know how to improve it lol.

So anyway, in conclusions, I have quite limited ""access"" to others, especially new people, except a few lab mates or other people at work space, and potentially due to aforementioned reasons and plus I always try to be super ""professional"" at work space, I don't think it feasible to reach out to any of them even though I might want to, and plus on the other hand, I could save their days in the lab but I could never save their dates for dates - like one of the girls said she could never ask for a better co-worker like me, but she won't invite me to her party lol.

Thus, my question is, how should I change it or improve it ??

TLDR: busy PhD student with limited social links and skills wonder how to start dating ?

We used to go for dinners at each other's place etc. Then her family got busy due to business and job stuff and we didn't meet for a long time.

Fast forward to last year i met her agian i was with my parents and she was with her mother and younger brother. We talked for a bit turns out we had similar interests, I liked her vibe we exchanged digits talked for a bit more played some games had dinner together and i asked her if she'd like to sleep over at our place obviously with hers mother's permission she came over we chatted a bit and it was late at night so we slept next morning we had tea etc and that was pretty much it she left and we haven't met since.

We continued chatting for a while we discussed about our lives. We did knew each other since childhood but memories were faint. We chatted alot i took a like ing to her( a little bit about me i m an overthinker introvert kind of person. I can't really bring myself to trust people and all of this happend during 2021 during covid lockdown so plenty of time to overthink )We talked alot but slowly i felt that maybe she was loosing interest and i didn't see us meeting any time soon (i asked her but we couldn't make it) so i kind of gave up on the idea of it and one day just didn't text and not did i got one back so i though it was just we got bored and our lives.

Naturally there are 2 points of view, So lets look at it from both sides.

&amp;#x200B;

Guys POV:

Now speaking as a guy, Men are wired to think like this... 'MUST HAVE ATTRACTIVE LADY.... MAKE OTHER MEN JEALOUS...' In simplified terms, MOST (Not all) Men will prioritise Appearance first over everything else and for most its a Deal breaker. These Guys will only be interested in a Woman if she looks 'Fit'. This means that a Large Quantity of guys will chase after a smaller number of Women having 2 outcomes, 1) Most Men will still stay single as there will only be so many 'Attractive' Women. 2) Women Deemed by Men to be 'Average Looking and Below' will be left single as Most Men will not be interested in them because THEY do not deem them to be Attractive Enough. Yikes.

&amp;#x200B;

To Sum up Guys POV: If you are not 'Attractive' Most Guys wont be interested.

&amp;#x200B;

Girl's POV:

Now there are the 2 Imaginary Groups of Women, those deemed 'Attractive' and 'Not Attractive', Those deemed attractive have a tough job because although they may have lots of interest and attention, however, this in not good attention as Most of these Guys are 'Thirsty' and only thinking with their D\*ck. So filtering through this can be an extremely difficult and sometimes traumatic time, Leading to a lot of attractive women being 'Turned Off' by men due to many bad experiences.

Those so called 'Less Attractive' Women have it just as tough as most Men look down on them almost as if they are not worthy which is disgusting, Some may begin to question who they are and if they need to change in order to fit in and be wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is My Take:

Physical Attraction is definitely important and plays a role in whether on not you are interested in someone, after all, physical attraction is the firs thing you notice about someone for the first time. However this should not be the definitive factor in deciding I you may like someone or not.

Men need to not be so shallow and just go after girls because of looks, but Girls also need to give guys a chance as there are many good guys out there that just need to be given a chance to prove they can be a good partner.

Now 1 thing that does irk me from Men is how nowadays they seem to think that a relationship is all about Sex. Sure there are some women who may look for hook-ups but, it saddens me a little as a guy that there seem to be less guys like myself who actually would enjoy the little things about a relationship just as much if not more than Sex.

When it comes to Women I HATE That there still is this Old Stigma despite being in Modern Times that it is still the Guys Responsibility to approach or begin a conversation with someone if they find them attractive because women 'fear rejection' or are 'Shy', Like guys dont piss there pants at being rejected either... I know from experience that it can be extremely nerve racking approaching someone I had a crush on, only to be told ' Im really Sorry, I Have a Boyfriend'. I took it as a compliment that she said I was attractive and really kind and carried on with Life. Guys generally struggle to approach a Women they Like because the feel like the will be shot down like I was if they are attractive, the thought behind this is 'Well she is really attractive, she probably has loads of options, so I just wont bother' I have definitely thought like this before and recently but it is definitely not the correct way to think.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally have not had any success dating and that is completely fine, I will keep being me and keep trying my best to find someone who I match well with and have that Good Chemistry with where something Serious may blossom, I hope that both Men and Women and Learn to respect each other and appreciate each other because I personally feel there has been a bigger divide growing in the last few years.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159859,public,self,Here is Why Most People are Single (Guys and Girls),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/swa518/here_is_why_most_people_are_single_guys_and_girls/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,

I wasn’t sure if it was a date beforehand and I’m still not 100% but right now I feel pretty confident it was.

When we first saw each other we hugged. We went to a bar where we just talked and drank for about 2.5 hours til the bar closed. We talked about a lot of stuff. There was definitely some flirty stuff going on and she was dressed to kind of show off a little bit. She would talk about how’s she’s single now (in a joking way), how she’s on tinder, and she seemed really interested in my life. I was definitely interested in her. The bar started to close and I thought that might be it for the night but she asked if I wanted to go anywhere else. So we went to a different bar and talked more til like 12 AM.

During these convos we would laugh and have nonstop eye contact. We also got really personal with each other. She talked about how she thought I was awesome in high school and I reciprocated that sentiment. Then at 12 she said she needed to go to bed but she kind of second guessed herself for a moment. She said the night could go two ways and one she said she would need up getting pretty drunk. This caught me off guard a bit because I didn’t know what she meant lol. Then we were leaving and we hugged again. We agreed we’d like to do it again. I sent her a sweet little text when I got home and she said she was so glad we did this and she’d definitely like to do it again. She also sends me smiley faces if that matters lol.

The only thing is, is that I don’t want to come off too strong because I really respect and like this person. There wasn’t really much physical contact other than the hugs but it seemed like she was interested I think. But because of her personality I can’t tell if it’s just her being a friendly bubbly person or someone who’s sexually interested. I definitely want to try to progress things a bit on the next date.

I’m in college and even though I’m absolutely sure that this one girl likes me, I’ve been asking other women that I know what they think and so and so. So far, there’s been good feedback but I would also like to know the alternatives. With that said, I think it’s fair to let you guys in on the story.

2 weeks ago, I was with a friend observing the equation of time dependence and Ricci. During that time, sometimes students would come in from my class but I would say it was cancelled. Finally, after a while, the next class was supposed to start (but I was absolutely sure my professor talk that class as well). A girl walked in, she had blue eyes and dark hair, and fairly shorty than I and older (I can tell descriptively what she looks like but, with the benefit of a doubt). As you walks in, she happens to notice what I and my friend are studying on the board. She comments that it looks like mathematics when it is sort of mathematics in the general sense. As she says this, my friend comments that it’s quantum mechanics and she react with a “cool”. I decide to make some small talk as my interest peaked a bit as there was only 3 of us in a room and I like talking in small groups. I make conversation with her following through quantum mechanics, chess, and marvels. However, during the whole time she is facing me and looking at me despite my friends presence.

Something you should know, is that I don’t normally look at people’s eyes. However, I couldn’t resist and she was still looking deeply into my eyes. From the get-go, I could tell she had a straightforward personality. Suddenly, a fellow classmate of hers came in and said class was canceled. Before she started making way to the exit, i asked for her name. It was (R) and I said my name was (T). She then asked for my Snapchat and I said I didn’t have the app on me right now but I asked for her number. So I gave her my phone to put her number in. She told me that she had frequent trouble with her messaging system which is why she preferred Snapchat. So I said that’s okay. 

Speed forward another week, I decide to pass on a note to my professor to her but not just any note. This note is a clue and this clue leads to another clue. The next day my professor told me she took the entire class period to solve the clue (decipher). Keep in my that I told my professor to deny my name in it. He told me that she kept asking and describing me but she got the idea. She solved it but didn’t find the other clue…(comments below)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159852,public,self,What is a sure sign that a woman likes me?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/swbr8v/what_is_a_sure_sign_that_a_woman_likes_me/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,

We have known each other and been friends since I moved in this neighborhood (which was about 10 years ago). He has been my crush on and off since i met him. We lost contact between the age 15-17 (so like 2-3 years roughly) because of lockdown stuff and high school (we go in different schools). 

And i have always wondered if he too had a crush on me or not. I remember when we were kids we used to play together with other kids around same as us in the neighbourhood, and he has always been so sweet with me all the time. For example he used to ask me what i like, used to call me by cute nicknames, used to encourage me and compliment me, i also remember that he notices and remembers small stuff about me too and i sometimes also caught him staring a few times back then. 

Coming to right now, we met in a gathering after a 2-3 years and we talked and i realised that nothing had changed, and i remember I told him ""oh my good look at you! You're still the same and your looks haven't changed yet either, except u just look a little mature"" and he became so happy listening to that (and i *think* he blushed a little but that might be just me). So yea that day we also took each other's numbers and socials because we met after so long (he initiated it btw). And the staring part happened again too. Like he will ask me a question about something and i will proceed to answer and then he will lock his eyes with mine (and he rarely blinks lmao) and there were other people with us too so i would occasionally look towards them but i knew from the corner of my eye that hes STILL LOOKING AT ME. And in the end when I ask him if he got it, he just breaks eye contact and changes the topic or someone else around us does. Soo yeah idk.

We also met a couple of times after that and he also complimented that I looked nice, also offered me food from HIS dish, and also offered to help me with something (it's personal so i won't say what it is but yea). And a couple of my friends were teasing me about something (as a joke ofc) but he still took my side and defended me and i was just in awe. And he has also commented on how good i look.

And now he texts me regularly (or sends memes) but again, not everyday. And sometimes his messages are kind of lame like it almost feels like he's asking/sending stuff just so he can talk to me (but again that can be just me) i am a med student (and he isn't) so one day he randomly texts me asking a biology related question which he could have easily googled because it was just a definition. I don't know if i am reading too much into it but I just need to know if he really likes me or just being nice.

And i have also teased in sometimes about his ""future gf"" (he's single) and i have also asked him jokingly of he has a crush to which he replied a no, but be keeps sending crush/relationship related memes in a group chat of 3 people in which i, him and another one of our friend is. And he keeps saying that he doesn't need a gf whenever this thing comes up as a teasing thing.

I want to go back to appreciating men - I used to live in London and had lots of good dating experiences with some idiots of course but I just accepted that there are always idiots.

Now I’ve been in Stockholm for 3 years and dating here is so awful, men are so entitled and selfish and total takers here who expect the world without giving anything back. People are wildly promiscuous- before I came here I thought it was an exaggeration but women here really will sleep with a man within 20 mins of meeting him- in London that’s rare. Lots of girls will sleep with a different guy every night while they are single which I just can’t do but guys expect you to sleep with them very quickly because of this culture.

At first I thought it was me and I needed to adapt but I’ve lived in 5 countries and never had these issues before. The thing with me is I’m so quick to take responsibility if I feel I’m making mistakes but the absolute worst feeling came recently when I realized it’s not me it’s them. Sweden has really bizarre dating culture and honestly I think it’s really dehumanizing and unhealthy and I’m feeling very depressed about it as my life is going really well otherwise here

""dont you think you should company me while im sad and gives me reassurance?"" and  like ""you can joke around while im serious"" and more....

She has some past traumas and ptsd and I am completely accepting of those things. We get along amazingly and both care for each other very much. Even going so far as to say we love each other and discussing potentially moving in together within a few months.

Now when we first started talking I was honest and let her know that I did still in fact talk to 2 of my exes, as friends, but we did talk, and one of them was quite rare. 

She said that she wasn't a fan of this and if things got more serious she'd expect me to cease contacting them. To which I agreed out of respect for her. 

Now here's the tricky part. She's been hot and cold throughout the period of us seeing and getting to know each other better, so I haven't completely cut contact with those 2 exes, as they are friends. She asked me if I was still talking to them, to which I answered honestly and even let her read the convo so she could see it wasn't anything romantic. 

She was upset and hurt by that so I said fine I would stop talking to them even though we haven't made any kind of commitments yet. 

Fast forward to now, we've been dating for roughly 2 weeks (I know, I know) and she's asking to break things off now because she doesn't trust that I am not talking to my exes, or won't talk to them in future etc. I figured this was already done as we'd discussed it multiple times before agreeing to see each other seriously. 

So now I don't really know what to do.

I do genuinely care about this girl and see serious potential with her, but she is basically saying that she's doing this to protect herself and there's obviously nothing I can say that will make her change her mind. She's breaking it off now, as much as it hurts, because she just thinks it'll hurt more later or something like that.

I (21M) recently had a weird experience, where I got humiliated pretty bad. So I would like some advice on how
To deal with these types of situations and avoid being made fun of in front of people.

I matched with a girl on Tinder and she hit me up that evening saying just “waiting for you to come over”. During a brief text exchange she told me to bring a bottle of vodka, as she had just hosted a small party, but she was alone and there were no drinks left. 

When I arrived at her door, she was a bit tipsy, dressed in revealing clothes and somewhat flirty with me. I set my bottle in the freezer and saw that she had some half empty bottles there - I found it weird that she told me she had run out, but thought she just wanted me to come with a small gift for her. We sat down on the couch and talked for a half an hour, until she said she had a couple of “acquaintances” coming over and had to “deal with logistics” on the phone. I thought why not meet new people and have a chill evening just drinking and hanging out. 

Turns out the two guys are her friends from school. One of them was pretty relaxed, but the other one was a bit of a jerk by not saying his name during the initial handshake. Anyways, we sat down in the living room and started listening to music and talking about hobbies and school etc. At one point she decided to make the guys drinks, telling me that my vodka was going into use. I had no problem with it, as I had my drink in front of me at the time. When she came back, the guys commented a few times on the taste, praising her that she had poured the vodka generously. We also made some cocktails later and I used her rum, which she made a small comment on. 

We headed back to the living room and the guys started talking about heading to a party later on. The girl said she was getting tired and wanted to go to sleep. The jerky guy then said “oh you wanna go to sleep? Really? We could go.” They whispered something and the guy said “Hey buddy. My girl wants you to leave. Like really, she wants you to go. Are you calling a cab?” I sat there dumbfounded, as the drinks had done their job so he pushed on sarcastically “I mean you could sleep on the couch. What’s your decision?” I got up and told the girl I’m heading home for the night and the guy said “I like you, what are you doing tomorrow?” I said “Uhh, Well see” to which he laughed. He then saw me out and said thanks for understanding with a grin and dapped me up. As I stepped out the building, I saw that the girl had blocked me on Tinder. 

I just stood on the street and felt quite humiliated from the experience. I’ve heard of guys being used for free dates, drinks etc. But this was a whole new level. I basically got punked by this guy and laughed at for unintentionally setting his hookup up. I would like to know how to stand up for myself more and leave these types of situations respectfully.

He asked me what I was looking for (and I stupidly) told him I was looking for a regular f buddy. He told me “he has no expectations” but that “he could work with that”. Flash forward to now so much has changed, at least in my eyes. 

The first time we met I went over to his house talked and got to know each other a bit then slept together and then watched some netflix. Just after the first time I knew I was developing feelings for him. The sex was very passionate and he kept giving me kisses on the cheek even afterwards when we were just watching netflix.

He kisses me bye every time I leave his place (twice in public when we left his place at the same time because he had to catch the train). We text each other every day, he tells me how his days going, asks me about mine, sends me pictures of his cat/new furniture he got, etc..

We’ve hung out 4 times now. The first time like I said was me going over, second time the same thing except I slept over, then the third time he asked me in advance if I wanted to order dinner with him or go out so we picked up some sushi and had it to go at his place and then watched some tv and then had sex and again I slept over. Then the fourth and most recent time, I asked him if he wanted to go out and do something first so we wound up going to this art exhibit and then went out to eat at a restaurant (i paid for the exhibit he paid for dinner) and then back to his place, and then again had sex and I slept over. 

I really have feelings for him at this point and I’m upset at myself for telling him I was looking for a f buddy cuz that’s not what I want with him at all at this point, and I’m having a hard time interpreting if that’s what he wants as well. I’m worried that he’s just going along with all of this just to continue with what we have going on (because the sex is great).

I’m scared to bring it up because I don’t know if it’s too early to do so, and even then I don’t even know how i’d bring it up to him. I’m worried i’ll scare him off.

However, I really wanted to makeout with someone because I hadn't done that ""random makeout session at a club"" that most college students do and it seemed fun! 

I achieved my goal pretty easily because this guy started dancing with me and we made out for a while. Let me tell you, it seriously was one of the best makeouts I've ever had. He made me feel really safe and knew where to touch me, in all the right places and he was passionate and I absolutely loved it. However, I was tipsy and walking quite wobbly so my friends saw that and took me away from him and I just sat down for a while to sober up a bit. I was able to ask him his name and what program he studies and turns out we study in the same faculty (not the same program but same campus because my uni has 2 campuses in the same city but a separate one just for the medical faculty). 

This means there is a good chance we will see each other again because our campus is small and it's very easy to meet everyone. I cannot stop thinking about that kiss and dancing with him and how he was hugging me, it was just super sweet. However, I saw him with another girl that night afterwards and I think they were exchanging numbers. Does this mean he wants to contact her later for a date or just hook up? Personally, I don't think I could kiss 2 people in one night if I wanted a serious relationship but it's hard to tell. 

In conclusion, I caught feelings for this guy way too soon and I don't regret kissing him but should I act on my feelings? So, if I were to see him around campus, do I talk to him or just ignore him? And what would I even say? All I know is, I really liked our dynamic and want to get to know him more.

TL;DR: Met a guy at a nightclub, made out with him, absolutely loved it, will probably see him again and I wanna get to know him more in terms of starting a serious relationship.

Been to a dozen doctors with no help.  Viagra is hit and miss.  There's been obvious damage to the tissues of my penis.

I've had a Bumble for a past year now.  I've met with about 20 different women from there.  None have lead to sex or a relationship.  I've had my heart broken badly twice with this year from women who I really liked, but who broke it off after a month.

I rack my brain wondering what I'm doing wrong, but last night this girl ""broke it off"" via text message who I had two dates with.  She said something extremely profound.  She said:

""you have this very weird nervous energy about you that you try to hide.  I can sense it, and it makes me not trust you since you're hiding something.  It then makes me start feeling nervous.  Our connection was just very awkward, and I wish you the best.""

I think that people, especially women with dating, are very intuitive.  It's like they can just sense something is wrong with me which makes them stray away.  I have no idea what to do about this.

I feel like my problem goes well beyond words I say, or the way I behave.  It's this weird ""something is wrong here"" vibe that I seem to have no control over.  I don't know how many times I've had women break it off after a few weeks, and now I'm starting to think it's because of that vibe I have.

To use an analogy: it's like you're in the market for a convertable mustang.  You go and check one out.  You kick the tire, the guy selling it seems nice, it starts... but you just have this weird feeling you can't shake... so you don't buy it.

That's what my dating life has been like.  It's like women just know something is wrong with me and they trust their gut and break it off.

I'm obviously going to hire a therapist, but even then Idk.  I'm at the point now I literally just feel like telling me dates right away that way they know what's up.  If I would have told that last woman, she probably would have been like ""ohhhhhh that makes so much sense.  I'm not scared of you anymore like I was.""

I'm going through a bit of an episode at the moment which has been triggered by the things that are happening at my work.

This has spilled into my personal life and affected my outlook, self esteem, sex drive, etc.

I went on a first date with a girl off bumble. She seemed really nice. A little bit reserved and maybe a bit nervous but overall lovely. 

After the first date I got home and my depression sunk in really bad I had a bit of an episode, ended up texting her, thanked her for the date but explained that I'm not in a good headspace for dating and need to work on myself. She messaged back ""thanks, OK, you too"".

I've woken up this morning contemplating whether I should try salvage it. Do I explain that I have clinical depression and was just having an episode? I don't want to be stuck in this pattern and alone forever.
