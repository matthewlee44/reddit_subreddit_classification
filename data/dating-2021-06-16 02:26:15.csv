8,o0zs5t,1623830903,Second date imminent. Unsure how to play it.,"Hi guys, me and this girl met last year and we instantly connected on a non-verbal level. I‚Äôd never really experienced anything like it before and it‚Äôs hard to explain,but in brief, it just felt right. I felt connected to her right away and we were mirroring each other‚Äôs actions across the room constantly staring at each other. Usually, I‚Äôm really reserved and socially awkward, but when I met her I can honestly say that it is one of the few times in recent years that I truely felt like I was living in the moment. At that time, nothing else mattered but her and it felt euphoric; all my problems disappear because I was 100% focused on her. Overall, it was an amazing experience where we connected with each other on a very deep level.

After we met we started texting. We didn‚Äôt talk often, but whenever we did talk it would always be a super deep convo that lasts hours -Neither of us enjoy small talk.

We spoke about the night we met and we both expressed that it was a magical experience thst we cannot put to words - she felt a similar connection to me as of the connection I felt to her. Ever since I can‚Äôt get it out of my head that she might be the one.

Fast forward a few weeks and COVID hits meaning that we never get to meet up during our peak interest. As a result, we started texting each other less due to repetition, but the interest never faded. She never left my thoughts during the whole of lockdown.

Fast forward to the present day: lockdown has ended and we both finish uni so we manage to finally have our long awaited first date. I was obviously nervous; I already know this woman better than anyone I‚Äôve ever met and we‚Äôve only met once. Fortunately, when we met all my nerves vanished and there was no awkwardness about. The date was good; it felt very casual with both of us more just getting comfortable being together. However, it also felt deeper than that on a non-verbal level once again; although we were both talking, it felt like a formality. It felt like we were communicating more with our eyes, both of us locked in a gaze. It felt like we were reading each other and everything made sense. Overall, the date was good.

My main question was about our next date. Do you think it is too early to express all this to her? For example, do I tell her that I‚Äôve dreamt about her every day since and she‚Äôs dominated my thoughmy feelings are pretty intense and I don‚Äôt know wheter
 it‚Äôs best to express that or to hide it. I don‚Äôt want to scare her off, but i also want to be true to my feelings.

What do you reckon? 

Also, sorry if this doesn‚Äôt read well, my phones been having like a 10 second input delay whilst typing so it‚Äôs hard to make things flow.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0zs5t/second_date_imminent_unsure_how_to_play_it/
9,o0zt01,1623831012,Some of the advice given here is not practical,"I often see advice that is not practical. I've seen the following here:

\-Disabled guy can't get a first date, gets told to ""look at the positives and keep living your life"". Our life purpose is to mate and if that doesn't happen, then it's hard to look at the positives and keep living because we're in pain

\-Late 30s guy, never been in a relationship, gets told ""Don't give up, you'll find someone one day"". If he still hasn't found someone at that age, then his chances of finding someone in the future is very slim, so why shouldn't he give up?

18,o11i69,1623838423,I messed up is there hope?,"A few months ago I met this woman and I have been head over heels. There have been a few red flags along the way but mostly manageable. Today, I misread a situation and came off all wrong in how I spoke to her. I tend to be extremely direct at times but can generally be pretty lax about word choice but today it was text. I feel definitely it was a ""lost in translation"" situation but as I process the whole thing I understand that I offended her greatly. 

Essentially she has been avoiding meeting my friends and as I have gotten closer to a dinner for everyone I have teased along the way. Today I asked her to bring me a burrito at work (we worked out together but I rode my bike the 10min to the gym) and when she found out people were going to be there she accused me of gaslighting the situation. It was definitely a 2 birds/1 stone incident but I wasn't pushing that. Once I got back to the shop I tried to diffuse/defend the situation through text but I only made it worse. 

She's pissed, and she isn't wrong. Obviously if I had called or spoken the same words the sentiment would be different but she has broken things off. I definitely feel like there is more to it that I don't fully understand (in her anxiety about meeting the group) but in re-reading the days messages and understanding her already pumped state I definitely get it.

Is there anything I can do as I really like this one, and is there a proper cooling down period? I'm definitely the ""tell me to leave and I'm gone"" type but this was really abrupt and I see where I am in the wrong.

37,o13b54,1623845176,Back to Online Dating and after 1 day already feeling exhausted,"I have been on Online Dating apps previously and managed to click with someone but sadly after around 6 months of dating, things appeared to not be what they should be so the relationship have ended. After that I had some time to myself and recently I have decided to get back on as many dating apps as I could to maximize my chances to find someone. 

I have spent a whole day on setting quite a few apps and trying to interact with multiple women from where I only got 1 reply back which then fastly fizzled out. I don't think I'm bad looking, I'm tall and very geeky/nerdy, introverted. I have manners and respect women etc.

And howly shit, most of them dating apps are robbery in a bright daylight as they seem to be a blantant crash grab for the features that should be free.  Also, what doesn't help is that there are multiple the same profiles on all of them apps so frequently you become accross familiar faces which I can't criticize them for as I do exactly the same to maximize my dating chances. 

It feels to me that Online Dating is rigged and manipulated by companies for their own advantage to bring as much profits as they can and to fill their CEO's pockets to the full capacity. I'm not the only guy who has issues with online dating as when I was checking for some dating tips on YouTube, I noticed that many guys have similar experiences. 

After reading all of them comments, I started to feel discouraged\\low and I'm currently wonder if I should at all continue with Online Dating as I'm at my end wits. I guess I could spend that time on something more productive but Online Dating is my only option, not because of Covid of course.

The above confirms somehow in real life as I know people who are very harismatic, fashionable and got everything that a woman would want but somehow it takes them years to find someone online. Also, no, I'm not salty that I haven't went on any dates after doing Online Dating for 1 day but rather expressing my frustration on how much Online Dating became worse and worse over the past years as technology have advanced more and more. 

I think I got all of it off my chest now so somehow I feel better. 

Oh well, I will need to stick around for a while until I find someone again.

I know everyone says that looks aren‚Äôt everything, but they‚Äôre so much. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm ugly by so many people my entire life including my own parents and siblings. I‚Äôve been pointed at and laughed at, heard people talking behind my back, in high school, on multiple occasions girls came up to me and said, ‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôre so weird looking‚Äù

I don‚Äôt pursue attractive women. I go after women that I think are as desperate as I am, and they still don‚Äôt want me. Last week I was texting this one girl whom I had been speaking with for days before and who I thought I had a chance with and when I finally shot my shot, she posted it on her Instagram story captioned, ‚Äúugly dudes are getting bold‚Äù and blocked me. All I said was that I‚Äôd like to hang out with her some time.

I feel like this is the sign that no woman would ever desire me and that I probably will die alone. I‚Äôve tried dating apps, clubs, meeting friends of friends, nothing has done me any good. I feel so hopeless and I don‚Äôt want to be alone for the rest of my life and never have a family or wife or someone who loves me and is attracted to me.

We decided to get started on it and I scheduled to meet up with her in person in the library 2 days later. The assignment took 2 hours to complete. Afterwards, I asked if she was free to hang out at Mcdonalds for dinner instead of going home and she said yes. While I didn‚Äôt intend to date her, I wanted to make friends.

Then at Mcdonalds, we talked about ourselves and our background. During one of our conversations, it lead up to her talking about her past relationships. We first started by talking about what we were doing on our free time. Then she talked about how she used to hang out with her boyfriend and was dumped her and now she doesn‚Äôt do much with her free time. They broke up a month ago and she‚Äôs mentions she‚Äôs had a lot of terrible BFs. She broke into tears and then we hugged in the end. I felt sorry for her on this. While I didn‚Äôt initially have feelings for her, I decided to ask her to an actual date to the movies and she accepted. I wanted to give my chance into dating and I want to make a good relationship with her.

My question now is, what are the red flags I have to watch out for? I can‚Äôt believe on our first meeting she mentioned this. I only wanted to be friends with her originally but I wanted to give her a chance because she‚Äôs so sweet and smart. I‚Äôve never had a closer chance to date a girl before than this.

Usually we just kiss for awhile and next thing I know clothes are off and she's grabbing my dick trying to shove it in her, no hands, no oral, nothing. It's offputting. Eagerness is hot sure, but this is overeager, like 'hurry up and get it done'. I want to enjoy it and take my time.

Hey. Happy birthday. I hope you have a blessed day. I‚Äôm writing this email to tell you I‚Äôm sorry I fucked Juliana. I‚Äôve been working through a lot of childhood trauma and just bullshit that‚Äôs happened to me as an adult that I haven‚Äôt really processed.

(He then proceeds to talk about his friend‚Äôs death and how that affected him because he learned ‚Äúnot to grow too close‚Äù to people. I‚Äôm not including this part out of respect for privacy). 

I‚Äôm sorry about how she treated you when that all went down. She was geekin because she doesn‚Äôt get that much attention ever and she had to tear you down because shes jealous of you. I should have stopped her but didn‚Äôt. I was angry with you. I was angry with you even though I knew it was my fault and that I fucked up. I felt hurt and betrayed that you left, even though you had every right to. I knew I fucked up and I was cruel to you because I loved you.

69,o19jsk,1623862646,Very curious,"So I'm 18, I met this cool 26 year old chick at a little party my brother was hosting. Now let me give some context, this brother I refer to is my half brother who I dont see too often and his birthday passed a few weeks ago. We made arrangements for me to come spend the weekend with him (he lives like a hour and a half away) so I came by. When I got there (it was Friday night) he informed me that on Saturday he would have some friends come over and we would chill for a bit. So on Saturday we clean up, grab some snacks and some drinks and one of his friends come, a cool guy who's company i enjoyed. About 2 hours later 2 more people come and I weren't expecting females, because he never said anything about it... Now nothing is wrong with that, I just wish he gave a heads up... Now both were attractive but one in particular just gave off a certain sort of energy with her playfulness that attracted me to her as im sort of a chill, laid back individual while she had high energy (she tried to get me to run with her to her car because she left something in it and asked me to get it with her). So we were just chilling, we drank a little bit (dont be judgemental im American) and we played some cards and a little bit of video games. Now let me get to the point, I noticed she kept looking at me at different points and also kept trying to come next to me all the while maintaining contact with me, when we were at the counter although there was plenty of space she leaned into me, constantly touched me, asked me many questions, offered to rebraid my hair, touched my hair. Then we moved to the couch, she sat directly next to me and made my brother sit on the other side and her friend and his other friend sit elsewhere (3 person couch) while she kept talking to me and touching and what not. Now I'm not a shy person, but like I said im laid back and chill. I made sure to maintain eye contact even though at certain points it was kind of weird, tried to answer directly and keep the conversation light hearted as I opened up and became more comfortable with everyone around. Anyways, I wasnt able to get her # or social media due to not wanting to come on too strong as this was my first meeting in a chill setting and out of respect for my brother and wanting to get his blessing afterwards speaking to him about it first. I will say this, she did hug me before she left and left a great impression with me as I find myself smiling at the encounter, but I just wanted other people's opinion on what happened here (I know its long, sorry) and any words of encouragement. 
ADDING THIS IN: I am a pretty attractive dude (other people told me this not being cocky) with long hair that was twisted up and a fresh fade. I am pretty introverted but it is not as bad as it once was, it just takes me a bit to warm up which I eventually did throughout the encounter. The start was a little weird because she hit me with the ""awww you're only 18 you're such a baby"" and that was kind of annoying at first as well as her saying I have ""baby hands"" although it was just teasing I didn't show that it bothered me though I just kept going with the flow and kept it upbeat.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o19jsk/very_curious/

84,o1badx,1623866920,Why do the guys I meet lose interest after the first or second date?,"Hi reddit!

I'm a (27y.o F) I've been going on a few dates now and then, maybe 1-2 a month, and it feels like all my dates go well, and the guys seem interested, then after the first date they take longer and longer to text and it basically fizzles out between us, even though they would have said multiple times they want to meet up again, and even plan something, only to flake.

I met one guy (32y.o M)a month ago and we had a really nice first date. We had gone for drinks, and it felt like there was a really nice connection and conversational flow, he would even copy things I would do or drinks I would order for example and we even made a joke about that. When it came to the time to pay I offered to split the bill, but the waitresses card machine wasn't working so the guy offered to pay the full bill (around 90 euros) and he hinted at meeting up again and was planning dates we would do in the future.

After our date we left the bar and it was only 8:30pm in the evening and the bars were closing due to covid. He asked what the plan was after (here in Sweden during covid it's usual to go to someones house after for a drink since the closing time is so early, or to take a walk) - maybe he assumed since I lived very close we would take another drink at mine since we were enjoying ourselves, but it was a Sunday evening and I wanted an early night. So we didn't go back to my place, but instead we went for a long walk (bearing in mind it was raining) and I walked him back to the metro station, where we kissed and he said he would like to meet again.

A few days after this date, the guy messaged and were having a lot of nice, flirty texts back and forth before we decided to meet up and play boule for our second date (I had originally suggested this for the first date actually). It was the most beautiful summers day, and the guy had literally organised everything for this date (booking the game, paying, paying for drinks again even though I offered). We had more flirty and fun banter, but yet again the place closed at 08:30pm due to covid. We had already been hanging out around 2/3 hours and were having a great time, so he suggested for us to take a walk through the park and he had brought some drinks we could have and sit on the cliffs and watch the sunset.

Honestly, the date felt super amazing, we were a little tipsy, but it was so fun. He is a Landscape Architect and was walking me around the whole island we were on, giving me a tour of the history behind different places etc, and while we were watching the sunset on the cliffs he kissed me.

Again, the island we were hanging on is quite close to my house, and as it was getting cold we decided to go back to my place to have some drinks. We had more fun conversations, and were speaking about music etc. By this point we were quite tipsy though as we hadn't eaten dinner, so we went to sleep. There was obviously a lot of sexual tension and attraction between us and so it was quite hard to go to sleep, but he was being super gentlemanly and saying that we didn't need to have sex and could have it another time as to not pressure me, but we did as there was too much tension.

The next day it was a bank holiday here and he had to leave early to catch a train to his friends summer house for a week to relax but he said we would definitely do this again (meeting I assume). Then the week after that he decided to go to his own summer house to see his family. While he was at his friends summer house I text him that I had a super nice time with him and that I would like to meet him again - to which he agreed and responded immediately.

Some more days went by and we made plans to meet on a Sunday - I asked him what he felt like doing and he had planned a really nice date where he would show me his local area, show me the basketball court he played at, and local attractions etc, so felt like he put some effort in. A few days went by and I didn't hear from him, then on the morning of the date he cancelled as he said he had to work on a deadline for work (fair enough) and hope he hadn't ruined my day. I was super dissappointed obviously as at this point we hadn't seen each other for two weeks and I didn't want things to fizzle out - but I didn't let him know this and just wished him luck for his deadline.

The next day I message him to see how his deadline is going and just generally tried to strike up a conversation, hinting at meeting again and sent him a cute picture of me. I felt rejected as now he said he was back home again and left it at that. So it felt like I had hinted at meeting twice and it wasn't really working out, and also his texts were short (although he would reply immediately). Not sure if this was because of the deadline.

It's now been two weeks and I haven't heard from him. Either he lost interest (most likely) and things fizzled out, or he's been busy with work. Tbh, my gut feeling says he lost interest, or someone else came in the picture. I am really gutted though as I don't understand why. We had a really nice vibe and connection and he even planned this super nice date (although it never happened). I also fucked him like a pornstar so not sure why he wouldn't even want to meet again for sex!!

The last time I saw him (a month ago since he always seems to be at his summer house) he left his ring at my place, so when that happened I messaged him that he left it and he said he would like to pick it up at some point. I guess since it's been a month he forgot about it.

Should I text him one last time? Maybe saying something about the ring? Or would you guys just chalk it up to he lost interest and that he was trying to make it obvious by cancelling / not following up.

It seems to be happening time and time again, I go on a great first date or two dates, then the guy loses interest. It happened with another guy also, he said he wanted to meet again and we kissed, but he takes 5/6 days to reply to a text!!!! So I forgot about him.

Why are guys interested and say they want to meet then never follow up? I am an attractive woman, in shape, good style, confident, funny, great personality, ambitious etc.

Do they just meet someone better? I am convinced as a mixed-race girl living in Sweden, the white guys that I meet must prefer to date white skinny blonde women, as that's who I see him mainly following if I have them on social media, as I don't see why else they are not interested... When I lived in the UK I had no problem attracting men and at least dating guys for like 5 dates.

Is there something I could be doing wrong? Or these guys just change their mind? It's really disheartening.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o1badx/why_do_the_guys_i_meet_lose_interest_after_the/
85,o1bccl,1623867049,"To the women on here, how has your experience been using online dating? Did you have any success or did you quit the apps?","So after browsing on this sub a lot, most of the posts here venting about dating and the lack of it are from men. As an average guy/ even slightly below, I can empathize, I'm close to giving up. Maybe love and relationships aren't meant for everyone. But when I see some of my friends who are girls dating I just can't help but be envious. As my best friend put it, ""Life just happens to them"". Many of them don't even use the apps but still have no problems with dating, hookups, friends with benefits, or finding a boyfriend. My close friend got out of a relationship, went through the hookup phase, and got into another relationship again, all in the span of a few months. Another one is voluntarily single, she can restart anytime and she was always in relationships. Neither of them did online dating, men just approach them, several times a week. Similar stories for 2 other friends too. Meanwhile, I haven't gotten laid in a year, and never had a relationship in my life. With how dating is nowadays, I don't think i will any time soon either. It just feels hopeless. I did have some interest from girls in high school and early college years, but it seems unless you have an extensive social circle or incredible luck/ appearance with approaching women, it's not happening. Online dating took a hard situation and made it nearly impossible to participate in. After 2 years of OLD, still no luck.

But I barely hear from the other side of things though. I firmly believe men or at least average short guys like me have the hardest in dating. I can't even imagine what it's like to have 500 matches or getting to pick whoever you want out of the lot, basically unlimited options. So to the ladies on here, what's online dating actually like for you? How many dates do you go on a week on average and do you see a lot of people simultaneously? Do the unlimited options get exhausting? Can you also empathize with the other side who has the opposite situation to yours? let me hear your thoughts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o1bccl/to_the_women_on_here_how_has_your_experience_been/
86,o1bm2i,1623867733,Newly Single and Newly Medicated (26M),"Hey everyone, thanks for coming to view my post. A little about me. About two years ago I started going on a mental health journey which included medication, therapy and other things I neglected growing up since mental health was about the most taboo subject in my home. Currently on medication for depression, anxiety and ADHD but I feel like a complete 180 of my former self and love every second of it. 

I‚Äôm also somewhat fresh (~4mo) out of a two year relationship that my therapist has labeled as ‚Äútoxic‚Äù and ‚Äúabusive‚Äù. I never really thought that my partner was a bad person, until my therapist made me realize the things that were being done to me during the course of our relationship wasn‚Äôt healthy. Thankfully I‚Äôve gotten away from that person entirely and I‚Äôm happily moving on. 

But dating apps just seem completely different now that I‚Äôm more in touch with my thoughts and feelings when I‚Äôm approaching others online. It‚Äôs almost like I sike myself out before the game‚Äôs even begun. As a guy, I figure it‚Äôs mostly on me to reach out first (from what I‚Äôve read, this is how a majority of apps work aside from Bumble if I‚Äôm looking to have a conversation). I just seem to kind of struggle to find something interesting to say beyond the usual ‚Äúhey‚Äù. 

I aim to find things in their profile I can relate to, or at least something I can work with in order to break the ice. If it‚Äôs an empty bio or a slim one, I don‚Äôt typically try to reach out. I just don‚Äôt really know what to say if I‚Äôm given limited information about the person I‚Äôm looking to connect with, and feel a generic greeting would be lost in a sea of messages. 

I‚Äôm also trying to improve on my photos that I put out there, currently I have about three great selfies (according to my friends of the opposite sex), a couple of pictures of me with my hound, a candid shot of me kneeling down to pet our family dog at a gathering, and a picture of the mountains on my road trip to Colorado. 

I‚Äôm just looking for ways to improve my profile, and maybe some tips on how to connect with others. Like most jokingly say on their bio, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know what to put here‚Äù.

tl;dr - Not all those who wander on dating apps are lost, but I sure am lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o1bm2i/newly_single_and_newly_medicated_26m/

And it kind of awakens the teenage girl in me, wtf? I buried the crush down because I was lost in my former partner. I feel guilty as if I shouldn't have the crush, like I don't even deserve it because of the past relationship. I buried authentic feelings for a new person. ANYWAY.

Well I was brave enough (and this is a big deal for me) to message him and have him come hang out with my brother person and I. My brother person gets off at 10pm right, so I... Asked him if he wanted to hang out with me before I go pick up my brother person. 
He said yes. And I fell off my bed when I saw it üòÇ

I moved back into my own apartment (I had been staying with family over the course of the pandemic) and I have made my way back to the gym (I had been working out at a home gym I built for myself at my family's place.) While I'm still working from home, a lot of my time is now being attended to by my daily life. It takes more time to go to the gym now, for example, since I have to drive there, plus it's been incredibly busy once I'm there, so my workouts take slightly longer. I also have to do more errands around my place rather than just sit at home.

What I've noticed in the past few weeks is that where dating apps got more of my attention and time prior to these changes, I'm not really spending a whole lot of time swiping through them and staying on top of conversations. It's not that I don't have the time to date, but maybe after spending the past year staring at them and leaning heavily onto them with not much progress, I'm naturally at the burnout point with them and throwing fate to the wind while I go about living my life as usual. I'm not working hard to get those matches. If they happen, they happen.

Something I have also noticed in running errands and being out and about is that there are a ton of attractive people around the area who probably aren't anywhere on a dating app (they may also be in relationships for all I know,) and while it is a matter of figuring out how to meet new people IRL, it's at least promising to know that options aren't restricted to the select profiles within a 25 mile radius which an algorithm has determined you are worthy of (but will change if you subscribe to a premium service for the price of $29.99/month.)

99,o1cxw4,1623871051,"My (21m) girlfriend (21F) Lied about orgasming during sex for our entire relationship, Ego isn't hurt but the lying is messing with my head."," This will be short, but first, I've looked up other posts like this on reddit, and a lot of the responses were focused on the guy being insecure about not being able to make their girlfriend orgasm, \*\*This Is Not What I'm Upset About\*\*

I've been around the block with different women and I am aware that some women need extra help from a toy in order to finish with a partner, now that we've established that, let's get into it.

So in the very beginning of me and my girlfriend's relationship I told her that honesty is a very important virtue to me in a realtionship, I take pride in being able to be honest even when it's hard, and I think that is how you build a strong healthy relationship.

Anyways once we started being intimate, I told her that if she doesn't finish, to tell me and we can work out how we can get her there, as that's what's important to me, that we both enjoy the act. She agreed and said word for word ""well duh I'm going to tell you, because I want to be able to get off too""

So that made me happy to hear that, as I believed we were on the same page. And apparently I had made her orgasm a lot (I tried to make it happen at least once every time we had sex).

A few weeks ago we went of a binge of, doing the act, and at the very end, she squirted. And I was surprised because she had never done that with me before, I asked her ""has that ever happened to you before?"" and she replied with ""no that was a first, I didn't even know I could do that"" we went to bed afterwards.

And then today we were chatting on the phone talking about how sex is different for girls and guys and she said something about how girls always need a toy in order to orgasm, and I then responded ""what do you mean? you orgasm all the time when we have sex, and we've only used a toy like that a few times"" She then got nervous and I put two and two together and asked her if she had being faking orgasming the entire time, and lying to me. She then responded that she had been, and that when she squirted that was not the first time for her, that was a normal thing for her, that happens when she has an orgasm every time (that's what she does during an actual orgasm). And that to usually orgasm she needs a vibe toy during sex

I told her that I was hurt that she lied and I hung up on her. Lying is something I take pretty seriously and this isn't the first thing she's lied to me about. while I don't think this lie is that bad, I don't understand why she would agree in the beginning of the relationship to tell me the truth so that we could satisfy her, and then not agree to that and lie for the entire relationship.

She said she faked them because she didn't want to hurt my confidence, but I told her in the beginning that it wouldn't hurt my confidence, I just wanted to make sure she was having a good time as well.

Our relationship is only 2 months long (we were unofficial for 3 before) so technically 5 months I guess. And this isn't the first lie she told me, I'm starting to seriously doubt my trust in her if she can't even tell me the small things. The last lie we told I was debating ending the relationship altogether.

And it's not that I'm bad at communicating, I'm very good at communication, and am not afraid to express my thoughts good or bad, and am able to keep my cool when I say them.

She's a really great girl otherwise but idk, the lying messes with my head, quite a bit.

Anyone had experience like this? or has dated someone who lied a lot? how did it turn out/ Did talks about trust and communication ever change anything?

I know I said this would be short but it wasn't lol, whoops.
