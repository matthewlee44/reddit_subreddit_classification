One time recently we caught up with each other in a hallway unexpectedly and started talking/catching up. Almost the entire conversation we did not break eye contact, like, at all. Very odd vibe, not sure how to describe it. I noticed that her eyes were fixated on mine and that she was a little off? Like distracted or zoning out yet still we could carry on the conversation. She also rapidly blinked (fluttered?) more than a few times which I found to be odd, just enough that I noticed.

We stopped when another female colleague passed us saying hi. She then said that's ""so and so"" then asked if I know her. In a sort of odd tone. 

I don't know what to understand or interpret from this. Is this normal or is there something else?

if this helps shes emotionally unavailable ( she said it) and was the one that came onto and professed feelings to me. 

few days before breaking up she said how she trusts me, how happy she is with me etc. 

then when she broke up with me, a whole bunch of stuff happened with her house etc and she said she wanted some time, but then said shes unsure of feelings, that i she hasnt felt the connection lately, that i dont seem present with her, she doesnt feel seen or understood etc. i just accepted it and said okay.  

after that she deactivated her social media and hasnt been on discord or anything

we were supposed to see each other once more for batman with another friend
i had heard nothing from her and the day of she started popping up on discord again. she has stuff going on and dumped me so i figured id respect her decision and not ask. 

last night she texted me asking me how i am on discord.  i didnt see it so i responded this morning, we have been talking and now shes asking how batman was etc.  i gave some info and just ended last sentence off with i wanted to text u about seeing it 

what should i do now?

For context, I'm a guy who has never been married and has no children in my late 30s, and live a metro-suburban area of New England about an hour outside of Boston.

* Most profiles skew on the older side, which is not surprising since that is what Facebook's userbase is. You will see more women in their late 40s and 50s than 30s and under.
* Pretty much every profile mentions how many children they have right off the bat and the fact that they're divorced.
* There's also a very defensive tone to a lot of the profiles -- ""No hookups!"" ""Don't send me d\*\*\* pics!"" ""Don't be married or have a girlfriend!"" ""No liars or cheaters!"" Needless to say, it sounds like this crowd has seem some shit and has had it lol.
* A vast majority of profiles are seeking a ""long-term relationship"", but there are other options to select including ""casual"", ""friends"" and ""chatting."" You will see ""casual"" in profiles as well, but I don't think the definition many of these women are going by is casual sex/fwb/hookups, but rather a casual yet committed dating experience where you're not rushing into anything serious. If this app had a younger skewer audience, it would probably mean the exact opposite.
* The interface is a positive. I don't get the sense that you're being fucked over by the algorithm with having more attractive profiles kept out of reach or having your profile buried. You can send an opening message with your likes just like you would with Hinge. There is also a large amount of likes you can send within a day.
* There's plenty of fake profiles scattered throughout, but you can usually tell which they are.
* And yet, the same dating app issues persist. Some people are more engaging in conversation, but most women send one or two messages, and then stop responding. Some don't reply at all and make no effort to carry on a conversation, so I guess this goes to show you that regardless of age demographic, you're still dealing with a lot of flaky behavior.

I can see this being a better app for people who live in 'burbs, are beyond their 30s, and are similarly dating as a divorced person and/or parent, but I don't think this is the place for a younger, less traditional audience of dating app users.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162982,public,self,"Review of Facebook Dating: It really put the ""old"" in the term OLD lol",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t8woka/review_of_facebook_dating_it_really_put_the_old/,no_ads,0,,,,,

*I'd like to be upfront &amp; honest about this in the beginning before you message me: I'm child free by choice &amp; wish to stay this way. It's important to me that you also don't want &amp; don't have any children bo matter the age or where they live.*

In my field of work, I make a positive impact in the lives of children in their early years. I mostly enjoy working with autistic children, I happen to be an autistic person myself.

I'm someone that what you see is what you get. I love to march to the beat of my own drum, &amp; I live my life on my own terms. 

If you're ANY of the following, then you WILL have my full attention:

*Patient, down to earth, fiercely loyal, goal oriented, hard working, stable in all aspects of life
*Don't have &amp; don't want children is HUGE for me
*Into sports (basketball, hockey, football, baseball ect) 
*Has strong ethics, morals, ambitious, strong professionalism &amp; upholds healthy boundaries  
*Animal lover, especially cats. 
*Wishes to take me on in Mario Kart, ANY Mario game out there, Mortal Kombat, Monopoly, Chess, Scrabble or ANY card or board game 
*Doesn't mind watching Wheel of Fortune &amp; Jeopardy every night 
*Enjoy physical activity or fitness as much as I do

There aren't a lot of places I can go to that are year-round to meet people in person so I find myself relying on dating apps to make friends and date for the most part. I don't usually have much of an issue finding matches either it's just usually when I go to check their profile to learn more about them so I can shoot them a message it's usually a laundry list of things they aren't looking for or don't like which doesn't give me much to go on when I am trying to start a conversation to get to know them better. If I'm going to be the one to message people first it would be nice to know what they do like, do for work etc. beyond what I already see in their pictures. 

Roughly 1/30 matches actually end up in a conversation where the other person seems genuinely interested in getting to know each other and the rest never reply or keep it limited to 1 to 2-word replies. The weird thing is I've deleted the app quite a few times (as I'm sure we all have) and there aren't that many people in my area, to begin with, I usually match with the same people repeatedly after I see them as my profile again. I'm always curious if this time they'll say something but it's usually just silence. I also use grindr and the same people will constantly look at my profile, probably once every 2-3 days or so, but never say anything it's so weird.

Often times I just try to be the one to put myself out there and break the ice instead since I know that can be a scary thing to do but that is often rather hit or miss on whether or not it will get a response.

Recently I haven't had the best online dating experiences but just a few days ago, I realized how cruel the world is sometimes and how it breaks good people from finding the right person. 

   I had met this guy on Bumble and we instantly clicked. I'm a HUGE introvert and am really shy but something about him just completely gave me an opportunity to be myself. We met later that exact same day even though I had a busy schedule. We went to the carnival along with one of my friends. He joined us and we got a bit of alone time when my friend went off with her siblings. We were having such a great time together, we held hands, cuddled, and he seemed like a perfect match. It was too good to be true. 

   Another thing for this date is that my car almost got stolen. My date and I were talking in his car that wasn't far from mine since I moved my car closer to his after we dropped off my friend's siblings. My friend was alone in my car just vibing to music while on her phone (she told me to try to make a move on my date and she would give us the privacy). While I got the kiss and it was amazing. Sparks flew everywhere. I melted into his arms (I didn't even think that was possible for me). I just felt so safe. While cuddling, we saw a middle schooler go to my car and open the driver door so roughly. He was talking to my friend so I jumped off my date's car and rushed over. I yelled at the kid, waved over a cop, and got the situation sorted out. I was shaking and terrified. Nothing happened but I was about to cry. My date was comforting me and held me close, it helped me calm down. I asked him to follow me and my friend to my house and he said yes while handing me a pocket knife since I was traveling the next day. Him and I talked outside my house for an hour till I calmed down. I felt so much better around him. 

   Cue our next date which was 2 days later, we went back to the carnival alone and talkled more about what we wanted. We went into our trauma. His dad's death had messed him up and he has a lot of pressure around him. Hearing what came out of his mouth got me so angry at the world because this guy is so amazing. He's genuine, sweet, caring, talkative, social, talented (he can sing, play different instruments, and some other things) and he has his life together but the trauma messed him up. He started to seem hesitant about getting into anything serious because at first we were just going to be a situationship but once we realized how quickly our connection lit, it gave us ideas for something serious. We pulled away from each other. He needed to work on himself and I am not sure what I am going to do with my life. We ended up being a right person, wrong time sorta deal and it is sad we couldn't end up together. Luckily I am not hurt as much as I thought I was going to be because I did not get too attached (after all we only went on 2 dates).

I have two real, legitimate friends: both 25M, one lives across the country in DC and the other roughly 40 miles from me. I wish they were closer, but we keep in regular contact, and I participate in church events with other guys that I'm cordial with. I have a good relationship with family as well.

I make \*almost\* the median US salary in a regular business services job, and have the potential to earn 6 figures within the next 5-10 years. I have my own car, though it's 10 years old and admittedly in rough shape. 

I'm NOT ugly, also probably not handsome, but hey - 5'11, not fat, full head of hair, decent face, that's something. I must admit my teeth are fucked up (overbite, discoloration, and WSLs), but I'm currently saving for dental work that I should be able to complete in 2022.

I do have long-term anxiety and depression, which I take medication for. Through healthier living I've weened myself down to the lowest dosage, and I plan to stop meds altogether in 2023 once the proper habits are solidified. 

SO, with all this being said, I feel like I need help in understanding: why are my dating prospects so horrible? I don't use dating apps because they're demoralizing, but I've still shot my shot a number of times. The only women in the past year who've shown any interest in me or reciprocated my feelings were (1) very overweight, or (2) literally homeless. I've been curved by every single ""average"" woman I've tried to set up time with, to the point where I'm convinced there is something wrong here that needs to change if I'm ever going to date again.

So, what is it? I suspect that it's a combination of the money, the teeth, and the mental health, as outlined above. Seems to me like a normal girl simply doesn't have to settle for anything less than outstanding in those categories, and while I'm decent, that's just not good enough. In my mind, I won't stand a chance until I boost my monthly income, fix my teeth, and find a health routine that allows me to discontinue meds.

The relationship was getting toxic and we needed some time apart. Not gonna lie, I was the cause of most of it. I suffer from adhd, anxiety, and emotional problems. I let a lot of those issues out on her and became a bit abusive. However I am in therapy now getting help. After the split, we started hanging out every single day. We went to the movies, got food, and went on dates together. Only thing different from before was we weren’t kissing or having physical contact. We were there for each other emotionally, helped each other out, and did everything else we did while dating.

We stopped talking for a few days because it was getting too hard to be just friends and I wanted more. But then we started talking again and unfortunately 2 days later we got in an argument. Basically she did something mean to me when I was expressing my feelings about my deceased dog. I said things in a joking way which made her regret feeling bad for me. That wasn’t cool. I didn’t say anything bad just didn’t take it seriously I cope by joking. I kind of got wordy and said a lot over text and then called her out for texting someone that I know (he isn’t a close friend but I’ve know him for a bit). The reason I knew she was texting him is because she posted a photo of his text conversation on her private snap chat story (with about 30 ppl) and pretty much made fun of him. I wasn’t jealous because she obviously doesn’t care for him but I told her that wasn’t a nice post of her. She ended up blocking me and thinks it’s weird that I cared and called me a stalker. The reason she thought it was stalker like is because she never posted the guys full name but posted his number and captioned ""I think his name is Chris"". I recognized the area code and thats why I assumed it was the person I knew. Turns out I was right. she thinks I went out of my way to look up the number. but either way, she posted it publicly.

Well she didn’t block my snap chat so I tried explaining that I wasn’t stalking or being jealous but I just thought that what she did to this guy wasn’t cool. She said to leave her alone or she’s calling security. I let her be and she didn’t block my snap.

I feel like she did this in the heat of the moment because she was tired of arguing and isn’t actually going to call security. Its been 3 days and I kind of want to clear things up with a quick snap text but I don’t want her to get overwhelmed. I was gonna say a short apology for our argument and for being creepy about the snap chat story she posted. I don’t know if I should but I just want to make things right and maybe talk to her again.

For context, I'm a guy who has never been married and has no children in my late 30s, and live a metro-suburban area of New England about an hour outside of Boston.

* Most profiles skew on the older side, which is not surprising since that is what Facebook's userbase is. You will see more women in their late 40s and 50s than 30s and under.
* Pretty much every profile mentions how many children they have right off the bat and the fact that they're divorced.
* There's also a very defensive tone to a lot of the profiles -- ""No hookups!"" ""Don't send me d\*\*\* pics!"" ""Don't be married or have a girlfriend!"" ""No liars or cheaters!"" Needless to say, it sounds like this crowd has seem some shit and has had it lol.
* A vast majority of profiles are seeking a ""long-term relationship"", but there are other options to select including ""casual"", ""friends"" and ""chatting."" You will see ""casual"" in profiles as well, but I don't think the definition many of these women are going by is casual sex/fwb/hookups, but rather a casual yet committed dating experience where you're not rushing into anything serious. If this app had a younger skewer audience, it would probably mean the exact opposite.
* The interface is a positive. I don't get the sense that you're being fucked over by the algorithm with having more attractive profiles kept out of reach or having your profile buried. You can send an opening message with your likes just like you would with Hinge. There is also a large amount of likes you can send within a day.
* There's plenty of fake profiles scattered throughout, but you can usually tell which they are (they're the profiles that all list 5' tall as their heights.)
* And yet, the same dating app issues persist. A few people are more engaging in conversation, but most send one or two messages, and then stop responding. Some don't reply at all and make no effort to carry on a conversation/respond like it's an interview but never ask anything in return, so I guess this goes to show you that regardless of age demographic, you're still dealing with a lot of flaky low effort behavior.

I can see this being a better app for people who live in 'burbs, are beyond their 30s, and are similarly dating as a divorced person and/or parent, but I don't think this is the place for a younger, less traditional audience of dating app users.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162987,public,self,"Review of Facebook Dating: It really put the ""old"" in the term OLD lol",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t8y4sj/review_of_facebook_dating_it_really_put_the_old/,no_ads,0,,,,,

So I have limited dating experience. I have 'dated' I guess 2 girls. 
I was with my ex for about 7 months. And I went on a few dates with a girl last year. For around 3 weeks. 

Basically, been talking to someone since last week and we have got on well. 
We had a date yesterday which was had sex on twice. I mean, date overall was good!  Neither of thought it would go that far, before the date I didn't want things to go that as I wanted to just meet a few time and see how it went.   But we'll one thing lead to another we went there twice..    anyhow, last night and today we have spoken and we have both said obvious no need to rush, just take things easy and see how it goes. We have both said we'd like to go on a second date and both enjoyed yesterday.   She has said she doesn't fully know what she wants and also doesn't want to be talking all day everyday and for me to be thinking we're a couple. Which of course we're not, 1 date and 1 week talking isn't a couple. 

Basically, what do you consider to be taking things slow, not rushing etc.  

I've never really been there, for me in my head that would be talking on and off daily, and bit but getting on with our own lives in the mean time. Until the next date. 

Obvious she has said to me not to be talking allday everyday, which with our jobs anyway we wouldn't. 

For me, I'd still like to be talking to her in my free time at home because I would. 

So yeah, in your experience, when dating what did it mean to take it slow, no rush, no pressure and see how things went?,. Did you talk daily,. Talk a few times and arrange dates?   What happened? 

So far the signs are all good, I just thought we'd be talking a bit more, but talking a little less could just be what she meant about not all day everyday. Obviously we all still have our own life and plans. So with me not having a lot of experience dating wise and tbf, my past ones have pretty quickly gone form zero to 100 (which is why I stopped dating a girl last year after 3 weeks because she left a toothbrush expecting to be at mine a lot after the 2nd date and I just didn't like that).

She had posted a pic of us on her story to wish me. Back in 2016, this girl had a huge crush on me, but I didn't act on it cause I was a teenager with issues and I didn't want her to suffer with me (I have told her that too, quite recently). So I never really said yes to her or ignore her completely. Right now as we talk everyday, she's still very nice to me, flirts well, compliments me on my pictures, sends me good morning and good night texts, sends me her pics, tells me her whereabouts for the day, is supportive whenever I feel low, but unfortunately she lives miles away from me. But still I asked her on a virtual valentines day date and we talked for 4 hours. I am genuinely interested in finding out where this can go (I was curious back then too but sadly I had to pass), but there are some things which bother me. Such as:

1. She's very nice to me. Always there to listen to me if I'm having a bad day. But lately it feels like she's putting me on a pedestal, denying the fact that I have flaws just like everyone else. Always complimenting me whenever I say something bad about myself. 

2. She's still in college and is living the best college life. She parties a lot,, goes out with her friends, has fun to the best extent possible. Makes me have trust issues that what if she's with other guys? (she's very attractive, she's had a major glowup, so did I, in the lockdown) 

3. She told me about being friends with benefits with a guy from her friends group. She still hangs out with him, posts pics, and I've noticed that in almost every group picture, both of them are always near each other. Today also she went shopping with the same guy. She didn't reply to my previous text until the 12th hour. She said she's tired, said good night and went off to sleep. Ngl I don't feel good whenever she's with this guy.

I'm having major trust issues. I don't know if it's my insecurity taking control or my instinct. Matter of fact I've never had a gf, maybe I'm overreacting as I've never been this far with a girl when it comes to talking. I've heard and seen a lot of people going for the wrong person, so I'm trying to be as alert as possible.

To summarize, My dating life has been a failure since after college. 

  
For the most part i've met women through the dating apps and my experience has been basically a failure. It's almost always the same when I meet someone, or start with someone, it's one of the following:

I'm really attracted to her, but she's not to me. Even in situations where I have ended up sleeping with her, her interest in me drops sometime somewhat shortly after and she goes cold. I've gone on dates where we end up making out but they lead to nothing, to my odd surprise.

I'll talk to a woman, and maybe eventually sleep w her,  &amp; then realize that i'm not that into her.

&amp;#x200B;

 or i'll meet up with someone and either I, or both of us, just understand that we're not each others types.

&amp;#x200B;

It's like damn man. I really don't understand why this has become so difficult for me. I did well with girls in college. Maybe my standards are too high but I just cant lower them. I was having  jaw-droppingly hot sex with a girl I consider a 9-10 right before I graduated, and i've been chasing that since and havent found it. I just cant settle for a woman i'm not supremely attracted to. I just feel like i'm better than this, it shouldn't be this hard for me to find a good connection. Its like I think i'm worthy of attracting a very attractive girl because I know  I've done it multiple times in the past,  but now it feels like a lot of these women don't seem to see what I see in myself. It's like at this point i've forgotten what genuine mutual attraction and desire is like because it's been so long.

Maybe it's that dating apps attract generally a certain type of woman who will drop you quickly because they have so many options from it, or just not my type of lady.

How do I break this cycle? any advice? What should be my attitude and perspective on dating?

I'm trying to self reflect. I think sometimes I how I carry myself can be better on dates,  be more flirty etc. But I know ideally I should just be able to be naturally myself and she'll be down for me. I feel like my trial and error has gotten me  way better at understanding the game, but I still haven't had my breakthrough success yet. 

The reason i've used the apps a lot is because my social life is definitely lacking, I feel like I havent found \*my people\* or my group of guys, and even girls too, that I really enjoy hanging out with since I moved back to my home city. My fraternity was that for me, but those guys are across the country. I feel like once I find this, a group of people I really enjoy hanging out with regularly, where I can be in new and fresh social situations, and get a job that lets me have more of a social life, my dating will blossom too, when I can find real options that aren't from online. It's just tough out here to figure it all out.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162986,public,self,Is Anyone Else in this vicious cycle of dating failure? How do I break it?

He even casually mentioned me meeting his family and while we were laying with each other watching TV he said he could be with me like that forever.

He said while he would be a little busy that week, he would probably have some time on Saturday and would let me know if his availability changed.  I said okay and throughout the week we were texting normally and then Saturday came. The morning was normal with him texting me good morning and telling me about some stuff he accomplished at the gym. I told him how proud I was and he said thanks and joked about how tired his arms were. It was then that he completely stopped responding. In the middle of the conversation. He didn't read my message saying to rest and take care of himself or any messages I sent after which was just a meme, me asking if our plans were still on, and a text on Sunday asking how his day was. I tried not to think too much of it since he said he might be busy but I just had a weird gut feeling about everything. I checked my tinder once in a while and he was still on there until late Sunday night he no longer was. This is unusual since he said he's not a guy that would ever block or unfollow without an explanation or conversation. Granted he has not blocked or unfollowed me on social media but still odd. Friends of mine have offered possible suggestions like maybe it was accidental, maybe he unmatched since he already has my contact info, or maybe he deleted the app since he sees serious potential with me.

Recently I’ve had a crush on a girl that I work with. She’s still hung up on another coworker of ours and has a lot of personal shit she’s dealing with so I don’t see it really going anywhere in the near future. However, we get along very well and she’s very physically affectionate. A few times on shift when either of us have been having a shitty day it’s became a kind of thing with us where we’ll just give each other a hug when we get a moment alone.

The other day she was leaving for the day and I had a horrendous hangover and was exhausted and still had a couple of hours of my shift left. She just kind of opened her arms and was like ‘come here’ and gave me a big hug. Sometimes when she’s dragging me off to do something she’ll hold my hand, etc.

It’s made me realise that half the reason I’m probably hung up on her is that as a guy, I don’t really get any physical touch or affection literally anywhere else in my life. We wonder why so many dudes feel lonely and alienated and isolated and I think this is probably it. I can’t remember the last time, outside of being a kid, that someone’s saw I’ve been having a shitty day and gave me a hug. Girls are always hugging their friends, but us guys because of toxic masculinity or whatever just try to act like it’s not something we ‘do’.

When you go kind of touch starved for so long it kind of feels like you don’t need it, or you forget that kind of simple affection is even something you’re supposed to probably have in your life. Then, when someone does give that to you, it’s like mind blowing how good that feels. I realised a big part of that crush getting bigger is probably just me enjoying having someone show some affection towards me and not wanting that to end. It’s sad to realise that’s how kind of alone you are when little things like that mean that much to you.

Anyway, be sure to hug the guys in your life who mean something to you; they probably need it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162986,public,self,"I’ve been touch starved for so long and after a few hugs from a girl I’m into, I realised just how much I’ve been missing out on any form of physical affection in my life",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t904py/ive_been_touch_starved_for_so_long_and_after_a/,no_ads,0,,,,,

A quick synopsis of the myself (27F) and the 30M I'm talking to: 

* Started talking in June 2021 after I followed him on insta. A month later when we went into a city-wide lockdown for 4 months. We continued talking and built a relatively strong connection. We've know been talking for 8 months now. 
* Continuously messaging and talk on the phone every other day for a good hour/two hours
* Try to see each other once a week but we're both professionals (he's a lawyer, I'm a marketing exec) so our work schedules are crazy. We respect each other's careers so it's not a big deal to either of us. 
* We haven't had sex - I'm waiting for marriage. He knows this and while we have sexual banter &amp; chemistry, I'm certain he knows I'm not wavering on this boundary. I also think he respects my decision. 
* He has messaged me 'I love you' twice while he has been out drinking and when I asked if it was a joke, he said no. I think there are feelings on his end but not that deep.
* He has been in 3 long term relationships (all 3+ years - one cheated, the other two was a difference in values) - I've only been in one that lasted for 9 months (got cheated on) 
* From my perspective, we connect on every level.
* He's told me he's not talking to anyone else or that he's on any dating apps (I've never been on dating apps) and gets triggered whenever I'm out with male friends or co-workers.

I want a relationship and I've always said this. He did tell me 3 months in that he struggles with expectations of a label and that he doesn't want the infatuation phase/the hormones you normally get in the beginning control his decisions. I agreed as I think a strong friendship foundation is required for any relationship but I'm at a point where I need a label. 

This guy struggles with vulnerability and I believe he is emotionally unavailable deep down.

How do I handle this conversation in a non-combative way? I want to be able to say that we are technically dating now and he should respect me enough to not string me along if he doesn't see anything going forward.

I have recently made it official with my best friend (mutual attraction into an official relationship). The issue I seem to be having, though, is that I feel too unattractive for love -- or perhaps that he could do better than me.

To preface this, I have body dysmorphic disorder. I recovered from EDNOS a few years ago and have a complex relationship with my body -- I feel unattractive. I understand it's irrational; I know my best friend wouldn't date me if he perceived me as unattractive. I am 100% trying my best to better my self-image. 

My question is, how does insecurity like this affect a relationship long-term, especially if I cannot fully resolve the insecurity? Will my anxiety about if my boyfriend is attracted to me or not only grow?

Short history:  She just went from an 8 year relationship BU, and she told me that she isn't ready yet and what can she offer is friendship only. Being mr. 200% never give up guy that I am, I said that I am willing to wait. (So yea I learned this the hard way). 

First 3 months was great, we are seeing each other once every weekend, plus constant chat/call.

Around January last year, the news that she is entertaining somebody got to me thru a mutual friend, I confronted her and tell my honest feelings about it and she said there is no need to worry on my part. (The lesson i learned in this folks is to always trust your gut/instinct, it is a basic thing to know that guys would not do anything move on you if he is not interested with a girl)

So during february last year, we had a fight, and instead of fixing the problem with me, she posted on her socials this date of him and the friend that I should not worry about. When I saw that, I just knew that this is probably over, she ghosted me for 3 weeks which validated my conclusion.

When I am ready to move on march 2021, she suddenly contacted me again thats why my feelings all came back. She began being close with this special friend of hers and Being mr never give up (or should I say a sore loser), I've decided to fight for my feelings and giving it my all so that she can someday change her mind and only choose me. (folks the lesson here is that YOU CANNOT CHANGE OTHER PEOPLE, you can give them all but it wont change anything, trust me and trust the other postings when they tell you this).

She decided to pursue her dream and business and decided to resign from her current work last april 2021 and I found this opportunity to make one of the most important case in my life. Because she is just starting her business, I've decided to help her with her life, every month from april to September 2021, I am in charged of her monthly grocery, and water bills. I just wanted to show her that I am here even when the world is not. I bought her a tablet, camera, to support her and make life easier. 

But during my incredible run, she still posted this picture of her and this special friend on social media. I became very jealous because I am doing my very best but I felt like my effort is not being appreciated after all. Thats why I decided to end it with a long message about my feelings (for a while)

Being this never give up guy, I tried to reach out last november 2021 in which she replied also. She told me that she is still isnt ready for a relationship yet, in which I do really had appreciate. What bothered me is that when she told me it is her right to post on social what she wanted. (Never once did she post our date before that is why I told her i felt bad)

During this second run, I noticed that she is not that attentive anymore, there are times when she is not replying and when I checked her socials, she is with this guy. I think I just got tired of all the bs and I did the same, whenever she is messaging me, I am not replying quickly and sometimes, I just leave her on seen/react.

Now I've decided to cut out my ties with her without telling anything because we are never exclusive on the first place.

The guy (23M) I met on a dating app also goes to my university. He also happens to be American and we hit it off pretty quickly as we both moved to the UK around the same time. 

We’ve gone on maybe 7 or 8 dates and only the past two ended up with him staying over. The first time he stayed the night was fine. But last night…. 

So we had a day out where we took the train about 1 hour away to explore a new city. Saw some museums, had lunch out—pretty much went like our other dates except we travelled somewhere together instead of staying in our university town. He said he had a great day when we got back to town that evening and took a pizza back to my place for dinner. He had class this morning so said he wouldn’t stay over, which I was fine with. He lives less than a 15 minute walk from my place. 

We were talking / hanging out and it was getting late, but he hadn’t left yet or made a move to leave. When I mentioned the time and he said he didn’t want to leave (if I didn’t mind), but was very obviously on the fence about it. I said he could stay if he wanted. 

After about an hour of his indecisiveness, I told him I was tired and wanted to go to sleep. In the end said he decided he’d stay. 

Here’s the kicker. He said he was going to sleep on the couch. ??? I was equally tired and surprised, and said I would not be sleeping on the couch with him—I was going to sleep in my bed.  So what does he do? He’s serious. He slept on my couch. In his jeans and winter coat. I was shocked at how random that was, considering I was having a good time and he said he’d had one as well. The next morning, he let his alarm go off (intentionally missed his class) and crawled into my bed to cuddle for awhile before he left. I told him I thought it was very weird that he adamantly slept on the couch, and was now in bed with me, and I had expected him to leave before I woke up. I asked for an explanation for his sudden odd behavior but he didn’t have one. But what he did have was the audacity to tell me he was cold last night!

Ive slept with many women whom i consider very attractive, but i've rarely even been in a relationship. I've been in 1.5 real relationships and even then I wasn't sure if I was fully into the woman.

It's like, when I've been sure i'm into a woman, I get burned by her, and she loses interest at some point, sooner or later.

And theres other women i've given a chance, but then realize i'm just not that into them.

My whole dating life has been this push/pull effect and it's never fully worked out.

I guess I just have high standards when it comes to physical attraction. I don't want to date a woman who i'm not supremely attracted to. I want there to be that spark, that intensity of attraction and desire. But damn, I don't know what it is about me but it's so hard for me to find that. Mainly because my social life has been supbar since after college, where I found most of my dating/sleeping success. I was having jaw dropping amazing sex with a woman I considered a 9 or a 10 right before I graduated, and i've been chasing that ever since, to no avail.

And Online dating has just expedited this process. More women who reject or burn me, or women that i'm just not that into.

Do I give more chances to women im less attracted to? Or do I just keep going hard in the search in hopes that that one woman comes along and changes everything? I'm pretty firmly leaning towards option B.

Two of his best friends thinks he does but for some reason is scared to admit it (maybe because he’s traumatized from a past relationship, he’s also going through a lot of shit rn that has made him lose a lot of confidence and he’s been sad even though I try to support him)

Another one of his best friends makes jokes about marriage. (Context: I joked yesterday saying I was going to sing to my husband at our wedding and the friend chimes in and goes “ohhhhh Bobby??” (Bobby is his name lol)) 

So I can’t help but think that his friends see the connection and see something. Is it possible that he doesn’t realize he has feelings but from the outside looking in, they can see it?? He’s one of those people who are afraid to show their emotions I think for maybe fear of rejection or being viewed as weak (which I’m not a fan of but he’s my best friend and I won’t judge- obv something in life made him that way.)

Today on a Group FaceTime, he said to our friend “the crazy thing is I think she (me) likes me” and the other friend joked and said she loves you. But he said “I love her like I love Danny” (his other best friend) BUT the idea of me liking him didn’t freak him out entirely. And I’m thinking if he wanted to reject me he would shut it down immediately and not joke about it. 

YES I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE HIGH SCHOOL BS LOL but this crush legit makes me feel like a teenager lol

I do plan on eventually telling him how I feel, because the more time we spend together, the deeper my feelings get. I know eventually there will come a time that he will find someone to date, and I know that I will become extremely jealous and potentially toxic when he is happy with her. I have nothing to lose.

We’ve been on 4 dates between December and today, and we are in the same friend group so we see each other outside of dates semi often. All 4 dates have been great, conversation was flowing fine, learning about each other’s interests and younger lives, family, etc. She is a super kind and sweet girl, smart, athletic, cute, and a bit socially anxious. I really feel lucky to have a chance with her, and I know if I was to be in an exclusive relationship with her, she would absolutely be an amazing girlfriend. I can tell just from how generous and kind she is to her friends. She is pretty busy with work, and we are both full time college students, so planning dates can sometimes be a bit of a struggle and a little disappointing, but they’re always a good time so its worth the wait. We do also text pretty frequently, although its usually surface level stuff about our days or me asking how her shift at work was. Even though they are surface level, we are still both engaged in the conversation so they’re nice to have. 

Even with all of this, I haven’t really felt like shes as enthusiastic about the relationship as I am. We have yet to talk about our feelings and where we see the relationship going yet, which I am planning on bringing up on our next date, so that could potentially change things around. But most of our conversations and all of our date planning has been initiated by me. I am definitely aware that this could be an effect of her social anxiety, but I cant help but feel like she just isnt that interested in me even though all of our in person interactions have proven otherwise. 

Part of this for me internally I think has to deal with my love language. I bond the best with people through physical touch and quality time, both of which have been a bit lacking so far in our relationship. Physically, we have not gone beyond hugs, and our time spent together is fleeting and has been solely organized by. I have been a bit hesitant to try to go beyond hugs, as early on in us dating, I had put my arm around her at a party, and a few minutes later after she had moved away and did not come back. I was really worried and mortified that I had made her uncomfortable, but one of my girl friends assured me that it was not a big deal. I am not sure what her love language is, so once again maybe this is just a source of a lack of communication, and once I have this talk with her on our next date everything will be great.

I am relatively new to dating. I didnt date at all in high school, and have only started dating around the past years of college. I was in one unhealthy, very short relationship, and since then have come close once to another relationship. So I dont really know what the full transition from friends to dating to a healthy relationship looks like, but I do know that I want to do everything in my power to do the right thing for us and her.

Does anyone have any advice on how to go about a situation like this? Things I should do moving forward to try to bring us closer together? Maybe I just need to take a leap and tell her how I truly feel?

I (m24) have met this girl (f 19) through friends of friend. 
I have always had anxiety approaching women with the intention of dating the only times i was able to do it was either if the girl approached or through dating apps.
She has often reached out to know where I was (at first I thought that it was because she was bored and needed company)

She’s quite a touchy person and last Tuesday we basically almost got to hold hands and she has grinded on me at a club. 

The next day a person who introduced each other jokingly asked if I flirted with anybody at the club to which I jokingly answered that I flirted with her but she didn’t reciprocate, to which she blushed; later asked me how her hair looked to which I answered that she always look hot (I have a joking attitude so most time people can’t tell whether I’m serious or not ). 

After that we went to eat with other friends and found her staring at me with a smile (I wasn’t saying anything as I was a bit drunk and kind of dissociating) after I made eye contact and saying what she blushed and shrugged it off. 


This is only some of what I’ve noticed but being new to this stuff it’s kind of overwhelming. 
I was thinking about asking her out but I’m afraid that those signals are all in my head

anyways, back to today: today i saw a childhood acquaintance (m25) that i had forgotten existed. he was extremely sweet, and as cute as i can remember (i definitely have a tiny crush on him). from a mutual friend, i found out that he currently isn’t seeing anyone romantically (only casual hookups). i am going to be seeing him a couple more times as he will be fixing some things around my house. my question: i would like to subtly ask him out on a date and see where things go. ultimately, i’m looking a romantic relationship with someone that i can trust and rely on, but i can do casual until then… is this a terrible idea that will blow up in my face? what are potential outcomes if i 1) make and 2) do not make a move? i realize that this could be a rebound, but i doubt it - my ex and i ended on good terms and i recognize that our relationship had problems since the beginning. also, i believe that i have grown and learned a lot from the relationship (it was my first relationship). i have a lot of self-respect (which is why i would communicate how i need some attention every once in a while, but i would never beg and nag him for it), and do not need to turn to someone else for validation. although i am a highly anxious person, i like to think that i am otherwise pretty emotionally stable, and overall am content with myself. so, redditors, i welcome and appreciate your opinions! again, here are my questions: what might be my potential outcomes if i 1) make and 2) do not make a move on the childhood acquaintance?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162990,public,self,"is it bad for me (f21) to be making a move on my childhood acquaintance (m25)? granted i’ve recently broken up with my bf of a couple months, but i’m not on the rebound",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t94vhh/is_it_bad_for_me_f21_to_be_making_a_move_on_my/,no_ads,0,,,,,

This weekend, I went to a bar with some friend of mine. We drank quite a lot and the night was going well. I noticed a gorgeous girl in the bar we where at. 
The evening went on and this girl walked by a couple times. Everytime she was walking by, we were making eye contact. 
At this point I was quite drunk and it started to be pretty wild in the bar, which became more like a club. After, a x time she walked by, I decided I had to talk to her. I was looking for her on her way back.
I waited for like 3-4 minutes and then I saw her. She was looking at me and walking straight to me.
She asked me ""can I kiss you"". I got caught off guard, and I think I answered ""you are really pretty"" and we started to make out.
After a few minutes, she told me she had to go home.

So I asked for her number. I really wanted to see her again and see where it could go.

Here is where the huge L start.
I left the bar 4-5 minutes after she left, as I felt my evening was done, and I was way to drunk.
Will leaving, I saved her number from a note to my contacts and I accidentally called her during the process without noticing (I noticed it 2 days after).

The next morning, I sent her a text, saying I wanted to see her again and I asked her if she wanted to have drinks in a near future.

I got no answer from her after 3 days. I get that she could have ghosted me for something (maybe a 1am call from someone you just met lol) or whatever other reason.

Should I go for a 2nd texts in a few days, or am I just losing my time here? I don't want to be a douche.

Should I have done this differently?
