For me, it’s dating. It’s always been such a challenge for me to find someone, and I know people that seem to find dating generally easy and enjoyable, have lots of options, and find guys who want relationships all the time, whereas I find it disappointing and exhausting and can barely get past 3 dates. 

I have an Instagram friend who literally has had like 7 dates in 10 or 11 days with the same guy. No one has ever even tried to see me two days in a row. I’m anxiously attached and I think I tend to attract avoidant types, so maybe it’s not surprising, no matter how much we click, that no one is making it very obvious how into me they am by trying to see me on consecutive days. 

I try not to be bitter or jealous because I don’t know what goes on behind closed doors, or even if the relationships I see are healthy and happy, just what they seem to be outwardly, and I’m very open about emotions and struggles with dating, whereas others may be more reserved. 

I just don’t know how to stop being resentful of those who seem to always have options for dates, or who jump from relationship to relationship, when I can’t even find someone I connect with who wants what I do, and wants it with me.  I guess I feel kind of sorry for myself. 

I’m in therapy and working on my health and body image and just generally trying to get out more, but comparing myself to others is a bad habit that I struggle with.

Well I matched with this girl who messaged me first and my first thought was ""Wow, she is pretty"". So we started messaging each other and she was really interested in me so I asked for her phone number and we started texting and talking to each other. 

Now, I mentioned that I am not much of a conversationalist which is true, so dating can be kind of awkward at times. We went to the shore recently and walked around which was pretty fun, and we have had two one hour phone conversations. She texts me Good night and good morning randomly which is kinda nice. 

I'm just wondering how to ""whoo"" her, I will keep perusing, but I'm not sure how much I can talk lol.

I’ve been seening this guy for 3 months  and we started off agreeing it would be casual, as neither of us wanted a serious relationship. As time has gone by, I’ve caught feelings because of the way he treats me. We talk everyday, go on dates sometimes;he’s so sweet and attentive . The sex is amazing, and even when we don’t have sex , he’s super affectionate.  So ofc , I caught feelings and am starting to see this as a potential relationship. 

He still seems hesitant to commit, saying he’s not in a place to be in a relationship. I feel like he is scared, he got pretty hurt in his last relationship and that ended like a year ago.

I see where these people are coming from. I have gotten rejected a gazillion times and have myself spiral down in the depression and anger pitt which leads on hating on women to release some steam off. 

However, I have met really cool girls that are nothing like what many people here complain about “the nature of women”. Which is super stupid since no 2 humans are the same. 

What I am thinking is that the cool girls are not as loud as the not-so-cool ones and therefore are not as noticeable if one does not take the time to get to know them. Therefore, these not-so-cool girls tend to be all these people see. 

Also, based on my experience the nice girls that I have met are super busy with their careers to be partying in clubs and they hate online dating. 

I feel that many people here had the bad luck of getting a really shitty sample, and that is why they hold their negative  views.

I repeat, no 2 humans are the same. Every member of my family is so different from one another. All of my friends are different as well. We all have different views including the kind of girls that we find attractive and what we want in a girl. 

I have met guys that disgust me with their cheating and machismo, and I have met feminazis that I hate because they make me feel terrible for the sole crime of have been born a guy.

If I just generalized entire genders based on my bad experiences then I wouldn't talk to anyone at all because people from both genders have hurt me and disappointed me more times than I can remember.

The human brain loves shortcuts to save energy. Generalizations are an easy, but highly flawed way of humans to make sense of the world and others. Just please be aware of this, have an open mind and know that everyone is different.

And the statements “Women are x and like x” and “Men are y and like y” are always flawed due to our differences.

So anyway I'm a 28 year old female and my friend is a 30 year old male we both have mental health issues. We have known each other for like 10 years now. I'm kinda stuck in limbo now on what to do about the future and where to go from here. In the beginning of our friendship we were just friends for like 5 years of and on that were both attached to each other but never said anything. But then were starting a friend and benefits thing for years when ever I was off with my kids dad. For the last year we have been talking about possibly becoming more then friends and feelings and what not. Last month for a like 3 weeks we decided to try and date for the first it went amazing we would hang out all the time like we normally did but with cuddling and what not, witch was so great. But then the rest kind just went down hill because he started to pull away and not coming around at all. The last day that we dated if u can all it that he messaged me something along the lines that he's not superman and that he can't be what I want him to be and that if we keep going down the road were on that we would ruin the years of friendship that we have. That he feels like he is constantly stuff up and that he's just so emotionally detached. That he would always be their for me but just not in that way. And a bunch of stuff about feeling like he has a bunch of stuff about him self that he need to work on. And how he was reading stuff online on how it's not good to date someone that you have been in a friendship for years because if just goes down hill and the friendship get ruined. And how that he's not good at love stuff.
But now hanging out as friends is just kind odd for me. I've been really trying just to go backwards into being friends but it's really odd to do so. I honestly thought that one point that we would have a really good future together because we are so close and share almost everything with each other and always their for one another. And it felt great to be more then friends. 
I don't know if I can deal with this just being friends thing anymore it almost feels like torture one one hand when he's not here I'm lonely when I want to share something with someone I want to share it with him and at times I feel like I never don't want him in my corner. But on the other hand it's starting to feel a little uncomfortable and unhealthy to keep having someone around when I feel like I want more from someone then they want from me.

This is a bit self explanatory but if I could get some advice to stop dwelling on this person I’d appreciate it! I posted this elsewhere but didn’t have much luck 

I actually stopped online dating and from this year, I probably won’t date through apps anymore. Not because i don’t like apps but I just feel like it’s impersonal and at this point, I’d rather be alone than try to drum up potential with a complete stranger.

Furthermore, I didn’t pursue it since I had feelings for a friend. Unexpected and not really trying to push them to commit to me but moreso want to spend some time with them. However, lol, after our first kiss and this being someone i liked, it’s a bit hard to contain my feelings. I’m not like over the top, I work I don’t think about it much but, at times, it’s hard to forget.

Here’s the issue though, while I would like to bring up this conversation, there’s a bit of bad timing involved. First off, this person is leaving for a bit not permanently, next, theyre a bit far from me but our area is not too far just takes an hour to get to everywhere so it’s not an issue before but this may allow for times where I don’t see this person which I’m fine with but I don’t know their POV. Lastly, this person, rarely initiates conversations with me. They’re always there for me and do care I’m not questioning it but it makes me hesitant.

Overall, all my friends are telling me I deserve someone who at least puts in effort. I don’t care about an everyday convo or anything but I wonder if I should even think this person considers me romantically anymore. 

So maybe this situation isn’t applicable to everyone but if anyone was in a similar situation, how did you move past someone who just isn’t interested? Normally I would ask for a verbal rejection but this is a friend so I’d rather use my time to move on. Also im not aiming to date to move on lol I only told this person cause I liked them..",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,842926,public,self,Letting go of a crush on a friend?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o1ra0d/letting_go_of_a_crush_on_a_friend/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,

But now it’s my turn to directly ask the question. I’ve tried my hardest not to turn into someone that only sees the bad and to try and see opportunity. Right now I’m not sure what to do anymore or what ways I can prevent myself from feeling just so shitty and down all the time. I really feel lost.

A little bit of background to help you understand what I and many others have experienced before. I’ve never really been someone that’s confident in their own skin. This past year I’ve decided to work on myself wherever possible because I’m sick of being invisible to everyone. Currently Ive lost about a third of my body weight, and I’m working to overcome my mental struggles. But even after all the work I have put in so far I don’t feel any better about myself.

With all that, I’ve never formed a close relationship with someone and for that I feel like I’ve missed out on so many opportunities and connections. Yeah sure I have a couple close friends but right now I’m not getting the same satisfaction out of that like I used to. A couple months ago I finally thought I was ready to put myself out there because everyone who I’m close with kept telling me to. I thought okay what hell, maybe I’ll be happy and meet someone. 

Unfortunately It’s taken a toll on my mental health quite badly and I’ve never thought worse of myself. The people close to me talk and brag everyday about everyone they’re talking to and go into details about their sexual relations with said people. It’s fucking draining to feel that you’re unwanted everyday while your close friends seem to be people who are drooled over. I have told them I can’t stand hearing it because it makes me feel worse about it and yet they seem to not care. It’s all they talk about and it makes me jealous of what they have. Hell I’d love a fraction of what goes on with them. I know online dating doesn’t work for everyone but it’s been months and no results. At this point I can’t remain optimistic and I’ve fallen into the “I’ll be alone forever” trope and there’s no opportunities left. Even at a young age of 22. My friends just says it’s that my pictures don’t really offer anything and I can see it. But at the same time that overpoweringly shitty pessimistic voice in my head tells me that I’m ugly and undesirable.

It’s difficult just to hear someone talk about their life or what’s going on when it comes to finding love. I get jealous and my first response is the cynical “good for you” response. As someone who lives in their head and thinks a lot, I think about “how can I be happy for you when I’m suffering?” 

Also when I’m around people I can’t help but feeling totally alone. Whether that be with my close friends or family I can’t relate to what they’re talking about because the topic always seems to be the same thing “relations and sex”. How can you be around people that make you feel alone? It gets old and it’s hard because I can’t help but to feel jealous and alienated. 

Everyone says you can’t be happy with a partner until you are happy with yourself. I don’t really know how though. Where do I start? I mean a massive part of my self esteem was destroyed growing up because of my weight. I’ve lost around 100 pounds but I feel no different. I’m still the shy, introverted, self conscious, keeps to himself dude I’ve been that has grown up feeling ashamed because of how I look. 

I sit there at night laying in bed just wishing that I had someone to be with, someone that will fall asleep in my arms, and someone who will be the first thing I see when I open my eyes in the morning. But even if I had that, what I want so badly, I don’t think it would solve any of my problems and wouldn’t be fair to the other person. I’d probably still feel alone and jealous of what other people have. Not to mention me not being ready for any of that no matter how much I want it. 

I personally would like to thank any of you who read this. God that felt so fucking good to get out of my head and onto something. (I’m definitely somebody who lives in their head/closed off). I didn’t know where to turn and any advice or anything would mean the world to me. I just don’t know what to do anymore or how to deal with these feelings so I can improve myself.

So I (29F) have been FWB with this guy (33M) for a couple of months now. We were on the same page that it was super casual, just having a good time kind of thing - we talked about it and were very transparent with each other about what it was for us. 

After a while, in my personal opinion, FWB can only go two ways for both parties to be happy and avoid one-sided toxic situations - people either could consider exploring if it could be something more, or stay friends only. FWB can't last forever.

He has been clear from the beginning that he didn't want anything more than casual dating, so option 1 was not an option. Also, I had my own doubts that led me to suggesting to staying just friends a couple of weeks ago:

First, I was honest that I tend to lose interest in sex (or most of the time, not have it at all) without an emotional connection - for this reason I never had one night stands, or long FWB situations - not sure if it's me being weird though, but that's how I've always been. I wanted to be clear about it because I didn't want him to expect sexy times when we meet when I didn't feel that way - wouldn't be fair on both of us. 

And secondly, I didn't know if I could even like him in a romantic way - we used to meet up but I never even let myself think about those times as \*dates\* because it was just a casual thing. I kind of mentally built a wall there and set limits to how I viewed it all - probably, to protect myself from getting hurt as last year I had a terribly toxic situationship that I have only just recovered from.

I told him all of the above, being super honest. I also said that being friends will be the same as we were before, just without sex - and that I enjoy spending time with him and don't want that to stop, if he is on the same page as me of course.

To all that, he said that he felt we started connecting more in the last few weeks (which is true), and he liked it (I also noticed it from him), and he was open to explore if it could be something more than FWB. We agreed that we would meet and hang out without any expectations of kissing/sex/romantic stuff, and see how we feel.

So that same day, we met up, went for drinks, dinner, went back to mine to play some video games - I really enjoyed that evening! I kind of started seeing him in a different light, and allowed myself to think about him without any limitations in my mind (not sure if it makes sense).

We kissed, cuddled, it was super soft and romantic - different to what it used to be like. At one moment, things were getting heated but I stopped him and said that I'm not saying no to sex (as I definitely felt, you know, the excitement as well) but I'd like to take things slower and not rush anything, now we're 'on our first official date'. I said that I kind of like him and don't want to fall into the FWB thing again, if we are actually treating it all differently.

He got angry. He said I made everything too complicated, that I was playing games, that he just wanted to go with the flow and I ruined it. He also mentioned that when I was away last month, 'I had fun' (I went on a few dates with a guy - it didn't work out; for the record, he has been dating other people too, and I was cool with it), but now I am not up for fun. We argued for a bit, and then just never talked about it again.

It definitely put me off, to me in that moment it looked like something a 15yo horny teenager would say/do. I think I was in my right to decide whether to have sex with him or not, especially after we were clear there would be no expectations.

But at the same time I can be very biased and protective of myself, so I want to hear other opinions. Maybe the way I behaved was too confusing, and it could seem like a game?

I had been chatting with this girl for about a week on tinder/snapchat. We meet during the weekend, and have a great first date walking around the city and sightseeing for 3 ½ hours. We talked constantly and I could feel a connection between us. Late evening of the same day I ask her for a second date and she’s happy to meet again.

Well, now since she wants to see me again and I believe she likes me as well, my brain is hooked and I can’t stop thinking about her, and I’m thinking maybe she could be the one (stupid, I know). After a few days we meet again, shop around and go on a picnic. I thought we had a great time, she seemed relaxed around me and we joke around.

After picnicking, exploring the city, talking, having fun, I leave and give her a goodbye kiss. She didn’t seem that into the kiss which was a small red flag for me, but I didn’t think much of it. The next morning I tell her I had a great time and ask if she wants to see again for a third date, but she says that despite her having a great time, she doesn’t see a future with us two.

I don’t think I’ve ever had dates go that well and long (3 ½ hours and 5 ½ hours) with things to talk about the whole time and us seemingly having a great time. How can despite this the other person feel I’m not boyfriend material? Do women just have that many options that if the guy doesn’t feel perfect then he’s not worth trying further? I guess I didn’t flirt/touch her enough?

I’m just sad since I thought she was extremely beautiful and perfect in that wife material way and that our attraction was mutual. I don’t know why after my previous relationship I’m getting my hopes up way too fast and end up paying for it.

We instantly clicked due to a weird connection we had ( I knew an old song from a relatively unknown artist and she actually knew that guy in person). We were both amazed and found it funny how we broke the simulation. Later her friend asked her if she wanted to go home with them but she told her she’s gonna stay and instead asked me if I wanted to walk to the main train station in the city with her (40 mins). I said sure. We walked to the city laughing and having a good time. I even gave her a bright pink peony I found along the way and she was happy about all along the way. When we finally arrived I noticed I have to wait for an hour for my train. She immediately said she wants to wait with me (3am at that point). So we waited together and it was really fun. Not going into much detail here but let me tell you she felt really happy and showed it which made me happy too. Later we kissed multiple times but she would stop and say something like „You’re gonna remember this“ I didn’t really know what to think of it 🤷🏻‍♂️ when we went back to the trains I saw mine and told her I gotta catch that one. She gave me HER phone and wanted MY number. At home she texted me one of those „iPhone character“ kiss stickers and I sent her one back. The next day I texted her in the evening and told her that last night with her was pretty cool and how her day was. She replied she had a bad hangover but now feels well and I said the same about myself and sent her a photo of the lake where I was chilling that day. Nothing came back. I feel sad because I don’t even know what’s going on.

Some additional info:

She’s apparently an Astro girl and I managed to guess her zodiac sign on the first try (which was pretty sick to say the least lol) but that might be a bad sign about a girl? (She’s a scorpio and even showed me her tattoo of one on her arm if that helps)

She’s a year older than me (23,24)

As someone who some people think they “know” before they actually do, it’s difficult to differentiate between people who are interested in me for me and people who just want association with me.

Despite being mildly well-known locally, I have always been extremely private about my personal life and I don’t want to stop now, but entering the dating pool especially via apps feels like I’m busting that wide open for anyone to see.

During the loneliest of COVID times I downloaded Bumble BFF just to chat with people and I was hoping I could fly under the radar a little bit, but instead about half the conversations started with something like, “wait, are you so-and-so?!” Other times delightful conversations would inevitably turn to what I do and as much as I played it off I could sense a change in how the person was acting.

So I'm looking to settle down for a serious relationship as I navigate my way through med school. I've been on endless dates and can't help but feel like the ones that ""spark"" butterflies end up being incompatible with me or can't reciprocate the same emotions (least to say they also are more aligned with the ""im a jerk"" personality). The ones who I SHOULD be attracted to, that treat me to beautiful dinners, buy me flowers, and support my dreams of becoming a practitioner,  are either extremely quick with validating either feelings.. very obsessive, or foreigners (who may be looking for paperwork).

I've been speaking to this guy who is very seetl when it comes to spoiling me, and even said ""get used to this""... but it feels rather unnatural at moments. He is very geeky, and things have been long distance because his position has him travel alot, so thats something to bare in mind.  I tried to push these things past me (the awkward moments)  but I can't get over ONE thing. He continuously, both over the phone and in person, states my name in the conversation... Instead of letting a conversation flow naturally by saying ""how are you feeling"", ""You're going to do great on these upcoming exams"" , or ""I want to make you happy and spoil you"". The sentence always ends with my name in it. 

"" How are you feeling mary?""

""You're going to do great on these upcoming exams, mary"" 

""I want to make you happy and spoil you, mary"" 

&amp;#x200B;

and I can't help but feel likes its been triggering to me and turning me off. Is this feeling valid? Should I feel this way or is this just my mind's way of shutting good people down?

I 23\[M\] went on date today with a girl 18\[F\] that my friend helped connect me with. This is the first date that I've been on since January of 2020. I'm happy this happened not just because the girl is attractive and good to talk to, but bc I feel like I've broken some kind of 'dry spell' lol

Anyway, this girl has had a very different life than I have. Her parents provide her with tremendous financial support. Therefore, despite being 5 years my junior, this girl has already moved out of her parents place, has her own place in a very expensive area of town and drives a brand new luxury car.

For reference, we are both uni students. I am in my last year and she is in her first. I still live with my parents, and would ideally do so for another 3-4 years if I remain financially intelligent and don't let social pressure get to me. I live in a part of town that is very very middle class. I don't have my own car and drive my parents car when I need. I didn't go to one of the most prestigious private schools in my city.

I'm not saying that the impostor syndrome is going to affect my decisions on whether or not to keep interacting with her.

NOT the pandemic lol but a relationship that I allowed to get under my skin during the course of the pandemic. It started with a bit of kinky D/s play in which I was trying to be more dominant as a woman. This person seemed lovely at first and just- big lovebombing vibes. Fast forward a year later and I am feeling just vulnerable. The relationship uncovered my insecurities, and lead to these intense abandonment reminders. I have a past history of pretty complex generational trauma, and I have done a lot of work. However- that's the thing about ""the work"" it does NOT END.

This person at first put me on a pedestal, getting down on their knees and literally worshipping me- like wanted me to absolve them of own insecurities and guilt. I realize now that it was all unhealthy.

I am a bleeding heart, and I really wanted to make them better. I have learned my lesson for sure, but I'm also feeling like A) wasted my motherfucking time B) Let this person take advantage in unexpected ways.

I certainly am not free and clear of fault - I soaked up their attention. I knew that the relationship wasn't healthy from the beginning but I chose to proceed. About a couple months into the relationship they lost their job and a couple of incidents happened : 1) They got angry at me when I was trying to talk about the job interview before the job interview. I was trying to meet them for lunch but the place I asked them to meet was closed, and we still had time but they got really angry. We found another place. They ordered a beer before the interview, and as we were waiting I was trying to talk about the interview and they just blew up at me in public. The day after I was like ""Please never do that again"" and they bought me flowers as an apology. Another time we went out and I treated them to dinner because they didn't have a job, they got wasted. I had bought a hotel room for us and we couldn't even really have sex or use it because after dinner they were just so drunk, they kept saying ""I'm so hot, why is it so hot in here, etc"". The next day on the drive home they drank a lot during the day and.....it was just so gross. Still I carried on because I really genuinely thought I could help them I guess? I didn't care and moved forward anyway because I wanted to feel superior in the D/s situation. I tried to break it off with them/get space multiple times and couldn't stick to my guns - at various points they said that if I broke it off they wouldn't speak w me again. They refused to accept my offer of friendship instead of dating, which at that point was only about 5-6 months into the relationship. They said that they ""had enough friends"".

Nonetheless- I persisted and continued on. In spring of last year when their birthday rolled around, it was still tricky meeting up so we met outside. We were on the beach and both got this feeling a bit like we wanted to makeout and possibly have sex, but I pulled back, I didn't have the time and didn't want to go back to their apartment. They got angry at me and left me on the beach. I stayed there and then they came back like ""are you coming/I'm sorry"". They were like ""I've never had sex on my birthday, I'm so sorry"". I actually forgave them once again.

Fast forward to yet another incident, in which them and I were meeting so that they could pick me up when I needed to get my car fixed. It turned out that I didn't need them to come get me but they were already on their way. They were pretty pissed. They ended coming out to meet me anyway, and we talked through how they really do not like to waste time/ wants to know in advance where things will be etc. They faulted me for not giving them correct directions. It wasn't the first time that they got angry about not having correct/very specific directions- this happened on 2-3 other occasions. The thing is - They are likely on the ASD Spectrum, so I'm like - ok, it makes sense that both being in a car with a lot of sensory input as well as timing of things makes it especially hard to regulate emotions. They also have a hard time w/ dating in general due in part to what they called ""past relationship trauma"" - however, that trauma had to do much it seems with their own angry outbursts toward people who didn't give them what they wanted, or tried to draw their own boundaries. They do come from a privileged background (different from me, I'm working class) - and I think they were also just kinda spoiled.

So anyways...after all that happened last year, toward the end of the relationship we were both burnt out on each other. I was trying to find ways to escape without facing this person’s anger. I couldn't do it. This past winter, they had some chronic pain problems, which was so so difficult. I just wanted to help. They needed someone to drive them. I offered to drive them out about 4-5 hours to a Dr's appointment to get it looked at, but they ended up cancelling that appt. So I took them instead to see another person closer. The appointment ended up unfortunately running about 40 min over on a weeknight. I was driving their car, just thinking to myself while waiting, so angrily, ""Wow, if they were in my shoes right now they would be SO pissed"". So when they got out of the appointment I was basically like ""What happened, like WTF?! If this was you you'd be so upset"" They profusely apologized. I was in my feels and had some difficutly accepting- I said to them for some reason that I wanted to make them mad – what I meant was I wanted them to feel how I felt when they got mad at me so many times in the past. I started driving and they kept making excuses that I did NOT want to hear. I was like ""Hey just please give me some space right now, I'm feeling angry about this and I need you to be quiet"". They kinda kept going and I said stop, and then they were like ""Nope"" and demanded I pull over so they could drive. Once in the drivers seat they flipped, stepped on the pedal and sped through the small town we were in while blaring music and then smoking a bowl all at the same time. They were talking and kinda yelling at me, and I just shrank. I felt so scared and almost like an out of body experience. I couldn't believe what I was dealing with. On the 40 min drive home we kinda tried to talk and they, IMO, still didn't take responsibility or care to really give a genuine apology. Once we got to my house we were both like crying, it was- ""So are we done?"" and I we both got out and I gave them a hug. I just \*hate\* seeing people upset. The next day we kinda talked and were kind sorta ok but still both very fragile. I told my other friend about it and they were basically like ""Do not talk to this person again"", so I did a stupid thing and I wrote on a website where I knew they would see a post, about a person I dated having anger issues. Basically from there it was really done. I still was trying to smooth it over for some reason- I think because I was still looking for a genuine acknowledgement from them.

All of that was back in Feb. All of March we didn't talk (their decision) and then in late April I reached out and wanted to be good. We went for a walk and it was fine. I still wanted more from them even then, and it kills me that I went so far as to offer and still try to get something from them. They were talking about wanting to go for a hike together, and I was like ""hmmm....maaaybe"" and then I thought well, shit, I'm still attracted to this person and still want to properly Domme them (UGH WTF). Part of me wanted to bring them to this point of just...I dunno, I wanted to see the best in them, and I wanted to see them do well in life, I wanted to smooth things over and see how a FWB relationship could go over time. I literally thought that we would be in each others' lives in some form or another forever, because I truly thought that I loved this person very much. ☹ And they always said they still cared about me even after all the shit blew up, which I allowed myself to feel grateful for? It was comforting to have them there for me everyday. And I genuinely still think that this person is special, and still even now have feelings of care toward them.

So I dunno I was wanting to still fuck them kinda, they said no that they couldn't and wanted to be friends, and I was like....""Wait but why now are you wanting to be friends just because it is under YOUR terms when I was wanting to be friends with benefits at the very start!"" - the NEVER actually acknowledged that that ask from me had ever happened.

So just this past week there was a comment they made here on reddit which just very ever so slightly pointed to them having some awareness on what a red flag looks like in an abusive relationship, knowing that I did read their comments. I was super immature and just feeling like I wanted them to see how very much they had hurt me. I hadn't really fully processed everything that happened. I didn't have a chance to get closure I guess. I wrote a comment in which one of their behaviors was abusive and tagged them (like an idiot- why did I do that?!). Big mistake,.....like what? Why. I'm not a teenager. Anyways they flipped and I tried to contact them via text after that and they FINALLY were like ""I'm blocking this number. Good Bye"".

The feelings I've been having since reading that last text from are kinda excruciating. For the past 3 days I'm just on the verge of tears. I am feeling on some level very relieved that it is finally over. On another level I feel so fucking embarassed for myself. On another is just a lot of anger still. If you can’t tell……. I seriously don’t like holding onto any negative feelings.

I absolutely know that time will pass and I'll be fine- but I dunno .... it fucking hurts. I still feel somewhat small. I just want this person to be out of my head. At that same time, I also in the way back of my mind am like ""Oh, maybe in the future we can talk again..."" and it's like- ""WHAT IS WRONG W/ YOU BRAIN?! STOP.""

Thanks for reading.

So there is a girl that loves next door to me. She and l were like best friends as we were neighbors when we were small (I am 17 now). She was a very bright and cheerful person and I think I had a crush on her. soon when I was 12 our family moved to the city area (before we were living in village side those of Asia). I think I had forgotten about her but after three years her family also moved to the building next to us and she started to read in the school near our home. We two hardly talked with each other as my school starts at 6:15 am and ends at 7:30 pm. And her ended at 3:30 pm and started at 10:10 am. So the exams were coming and and we hardly had 2 months left for finals so I decided to go to the tution where she reads (she reads like crazy till 12 in the night. I am a very shy person and it takes me a lot of trouble to mix up with new people it took me like 2 weeks to starts talking to them all of them were from her school and my syllabus was different. I didn't talk much with her because she was always busy writing and practicing.so in the tution there were 2 boys who were good looking and I think her classmates. So when she used to talk to her I felt a deep pain in my heart like a spear had hit it while sleeping too my mind always used to show pictures of it so finally the exams came we were ready to give our exams. During this time we used to text a lot as I felt very uneasy going to her home. Those text were mostly exam related and finally when pre exam finished Corona came back and no exams. So now when I text her it's always like this 
Me: hy how are you doing 
After waiting 2 days 
Her:I am doing good what about you
Me after one hour because the internet keeps going:
I am fine too so what are you doing right now
Her again after 1-2 days:
Oh nothing really 
Me :oh ok 
Chat ends. 
When l look at other girls I even tried going on a date with another girl but that feeling never came out. I think I fell in love for the first time as I thought all of this was crap before (because 4 of my classmates ran off with their girls and are now suffering).this is my first time and I want it to be my last time. I want her to be my children's mom. I also get a vibe from her that she likes me (at here a girl never approaches a guy even how how madly she loves him). So when I try to approach her in the text my heart beats like an engine and a thought come into my mind that if it doesn't work I will loose my friendship forever with her and that stops me from approaching her.

So I recently met this guy at a neighbors party we danced and talked for awhile mind you we did this in front of my parents which are cool and understanding he was respectful and everything he even took me home and gave me a hug and said goodnight. I’m 21 (F) and he is 25 (M) he seems like such a fun and nice guy he is respectful opens car doors for me and everything. We been on two dates and everything was going well until after the second date ended he texted me and told me he wanted to ask me something, but was afraid my dad would hear. I was a bit confused and i told him what was it he was going to tell me, and he told me if I have ever planned on having a boyfriend and it followed by saying because he really likes me a lot. I was a bit disappointed if this was his way of him asking me to be his girlfriend so I said not at the moment because i want to finish and focus on school ( I panicked) he completely understood and didn’t say nothing else I also mentioned I was just getting to know him I mean it’s been two dates! We stopped texting for a day and he texted me and asked how I was doing and we been talking for 2 weeks since then  non stop and he still compliments me and I really do like him and I am willing to give him a chance but there is something else. He is from Guatemala , and he has a son in Guatemala who he has not mentioned anything about. He talks about all aspects of his life but this, again all our neighbors know this information including my dad ( I found out through Facebook plus my dad told me), but the guy hasn’t told me anything I feel the need to confront him. I guess I’m just confused and wondering if it’s a red flag because he won’t tell me anything about it. We are soon going on our third date I just need some sort of advice.

Decided he wanted to have a picnic for the first date and watch the sunset. I am all for unusual dates and I love nature so we got up at 5 and went to a spot he selected in a nearby field. It happened to be a little over a quarter mile walk to the spot through said field and was a pain in the butt to traverse with all the blankets and food.

Once we got there things seemed okay, we were talking and made some food, laid down next to each other for a bit, then he gets a call from his dad asking where his car is. Well the car was on private property and we were trespassing, had to move the vehicle and the farmer was very unhappy and made it known to us. I was shaken up to say the least, and I asked to be driven home afterwards. 

He was extremely apologetic about the situation and I know it’s not something he intended to happen. I am now on the fence about another date, the whole confrontation was not his fault but I got a bit scared. I don’t know if that’s clouding my judgement about this person but I am apprehensive about a second date, even more so because I was scared about going on the first date in general since I am leaving for college in a couple months. I want something long term and know distance will be difficult but I am fine if it is with the right person. I don’t know if I should have agreed on a first date and instead should be waiting until college. 

I feel like a terrible person for being so unsure of my feelings and for possibly not suggesting a different place for this picnic which could have avoided the whole situation.
