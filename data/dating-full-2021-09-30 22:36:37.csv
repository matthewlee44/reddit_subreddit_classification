She told me that her last relationship ended because the other guy told her ""You act like you never care for anyone at all"" and that hurt her a lot, and sometimes I just think that she acts like she doesn't care for anything and that confuses me because sometimes she cares for me as nobody else has ever done it.

I came from 2 toxics relationships, where I just shut up about what I feel or think because that was bad, it always leads to fights and troubles, and the outcome was just me shutting up and apologize for everything, even when I was only telling how much I loved that person or when my ex was cheating on me, I always was the one who apologizes. I always thought that it was just my fault, that I am the one who makes every mistake in the relationship, but I change that at the begging of this year, I try to speak my feels, to say something when I was annoyed and not just shut up and say everything is fine because I hate fights, I don't like making someone guilty for the mistakes they made, because I understand that everyone could make a mistake, and that's ok as long as you don't make it again.

So I told her (the girl that I'm dating) that I love her two months ago, I don't think this was a mistake, I really love her, and I am tired of shutting up my feelings... She said that she doesn't believe it but that she ""me quiere"" to me (In my country we have two words for express love, one is ""querer"" and the other one is ""amar"" so you use the first one with family, close friends, someone you appreciate a lot, and you use the second one to your close family and your romantic interest (bf, gf, wife, husband, so), I will continue)  but when we are having sex, she told me that she loves me in secret, that she always wants to stay with me, and I feel really confused about that. 

When we are on a date, or simply just together, she always says that she really like hanging out with me, and enjoys every second with me, but the next day or just a couple of hours after that she is different with me, sometimes she is busy with her mother and brothers and sisters (which I understand and admire about her) but it's like she ignored me for time to time, and when I am busy with my job, she gets a little mad with me for ""ignored"" her, but I just can answer her when that happens, sometimes I am even driving and she gets annoyed because I don't answer and she believes that I'm seeing another woman, and I am always trying that she feels like my only woman in my life, I am truthful to her, and even when I am busy, sometimes even in a business meeting, I try to answer her message because I don't want that she gets mad with me, and I am afraid to say something about that because I did it once and we have a fight, so I don't know what to do.

I really love her, I think she is an amazing woman, I admire her, I try to support her in anything she wants, I enjoy every moment with her, she has been showing to me that she really loves me, even she doesn't tell me the words, she is trying to adapt to this relationship, but she is afraid of we become a couple, and it just looks like it doesn't matter how hard I try, I will never become her boyfriend, and sincerely, sometimes I just feel lonely around her, like if I always have to beg, and that reminds me my pasts relationships. I want someone who I could love without excuses, and that person loves me the same way, and I understand that her ex-boyfriends cheated on her, that trusting in someone could be difficult, and it could take time, but honestly, I don't know what to do, I love her with all my soul, but I don't want to waste my time with someone who maybe never wants a relationship with me, and I don't know if she really wants a relationship with me but she is afraid (which I could understand) or if she will never see me like a partner and I'm only a friend with benefits, and it is even worse when we cant talk about it because she feels under pressure and that only makes me feel lonely.

I don't have many friends, just one, and I cannot chat about this with him, so this is the only way I find, also I don't want to lose her, but neither I want to feel lonely.

If you read it thank you so much, I apologize for my English, I'm not a native speaker, and I apologize for if it looks like a long story, it's difficult for me to write my feelings (and harder in another language) so I am sorry if it's too long, I will try to get better doing it.

I've been wanting to state things explicitly, e.g. ""Hey, I know you're probably not interested anymore, but it was nice meeting you and getting to know you for a bit. Good luck with everything!"" I am completely sincere. It helps me feel closure and that I'm making communication a norm in this weird/modern dating space.

So I've been talking to this girl for the past two or so months and we've really hit it off. We spend a lot of time over text and we always talk to each other during the day, especially since the class period we share together is essentially a free period. I've asked her to homecoming and she agreed but this is where it gets kinda confusing.

So basically when I asked her to this dance, I apparently wasn't clear enough because she thought we were going as friends, but that was not the case and I made it clear that's not what I was thinking. In response she basically told me she's not looking to date ***at the moment***(the part that has me thinking), which I can get, not everyone is as eager to date as I am (also kinda important, it's my first time asking ANYONE to ANYTHING, so I was definitely very nervous). But she told me that there's nothing wrong with me, but rather just everything wrong with her, which I don't believe for a second. She has problems, yes, but everyone does and I'm willing to look past them because there's a genuinely amazing person behind them. And now I'm wondering; Does she like me? and if she does, is there a chance? I mean I don't want to force her into doing anything she doesn't want to do especially since she isn't interested at the moment, let me just make that perfectly clear, and while it seems obvious at times whether or not she likes me, at others it feels like there's more to it. For the time being I'm just trying to figure out whether or not she likes me. I'm planning on talking to her about it at some point but I figured I'd just ask Y'all since who better to ask then people who probably have experience with nutjobs like me lol. 

And since you guys are probably gonna ask, here's some signs of a mutual crush;

She's said that she enjoys spending time with me (this isn't necessarily romantic but I figured I'd put it here)

She's called me sweet a bunch of times.

She's expressed a lot of interest in various hobbies (ex: she completely unprompted found my YT channel on which I talk about movies, tbf it's directly linked from my main insta but still.)

Laughs at a lot of the silly stuff I do/say intentional or otherwise

She's really personal with me

She's always complimented me for my ""smart kid schtick"" (this might just be a compliment I can't tell sometimes)

She thinks I kick ass because I practice a martial art (also might be a compliment)

So there it is all laid out. I don't know what to think anymore, I know one of the more popular answers is going to be to ask her myself, which as a mentioned previously, I am planning to do, but I'd like to get some kind of opinion on this matter, because it's kinda of the first time I'm doing this, and I'd like any indication at all that I'm doing it right or what. Regardless of the answers, I'm really thankful for you guys answering if you do.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1036695,public,self,Does she like me?

I live in a big city and one thing that I'm really struggling with is that the majority of guys that I tend to meet/come across through on dating apps are primarily looking for hook ups/sex and very often they're not upfront about it.

Sex with a stranger on the first date is not something that I'm really into and some of the experiences that I've had weren't really positive. For instance, some guys will ask to hang out at night in the area that they live and every time I've accepted to go on these dates I ended up realizing that for the majority of them, their main goal is to bring me back to their place. I don't know if this is something that some of you may agree with or may have experienced as well?

Anyhow, I started talking to this guy and he asked me out on a date. We talked about having coffee and I asked if he was available this upcoming weekend during the day. He said no and proposed 8pm on either days of the weekend. Told him I sorry I'm not available at night this weekend then he suggested to postpone and do coffee instead at 8pm during the week day next week. I don't know if I'm overthinking this or being too on the fence because of my past experiences but I feel odd that he keeps suggesting to meet up later during the evening for coffee??

When I have been under employed, when I've been crashing on a couch, when I've been struggling financially and professionally or at a low point in my personal life, I get lots of dates, I get girlfriends, I do very well on apps and in general and I have relationships, FWB's, etc.

When I find myself making plenty of money, when I find my quality of living goes up significantly, when my overall situation is very stable and respectable, when I have more financial resources and I am doing more productive, interesting things professionally, I can't seem to find any match or click with anybody.

I recently did pretty well financially through work and investments (this could mean anything depending on one's definition, so I'm not trying to brag) and after saving and living very cheaply for a few years, I am moving into a really nice apartment, some other investments paid off so I have more petty cash than I have in a few years - - and I am not matching with people. I am not clicking with the people I do match with. I am not particularly attracted to the people I am matching with.

In the past I have gone through periods of being unemployed, completely broke and living in tiny shit hole studio apartments or living in the downstairs rec room of a relative or whatever and I have gotten all the girls I wanted; I've dated my huge crushes, I've dated interesting, fun, beautiful women, I've had confidence out the wazoo and my dating/sex life has been almost more successful than I could handle. Girls wanting to come over. Hitting me up left and right, can't seem to get enough of me- and I can barely pay for a lyft to get to their place or if they come over to my place it's a mattress on the floor and basically nothing else.

Now that I have all the other stuff in order: Living situation is great, finances are solid, work is going well, etc. I am having zero success romantically/sexually.

So.... any theories? When I'm a deadbeat loser I have no issues sexually or romantically. When I am a reliable, stable person I can't get a date or get laid to save my life.

I still think about it frequently because of the emotions of the night that changed everything... Dec 28 2020. I will never forget that date. This was a 2 year 3 month relationship and things were honestly never good and I always wanted away from her as she was VERY manipulative and verbally abusive to a point where I wasn't myself anymore. She would call me names and aggressively cuss at me for playing games while we were on ft.(just a small example) After trying to leave her multiple different times she would tell me that she would kill herself if she did not have me. Soo me being a normal human I called her up and went and talked to her about our feelings as a couple and every time we would end up back together by the end of the night. Deep down I knew I did not want to be with her but I also wanted love. So I stayed for 5+ times of her saying she would kill herself. She did it so much that I became obsessed with her. I feel that this was just me trying to protect her from her own self. I felt like I was doing my 'job' as a boyfriend and at the time saw nothing wrong with it. I became increasingly aggravated with things that had already annoyed me in the past and she could tell. But I was confused because she just told me 30 days ago that she would die for me. She slowly stopped texting me and I knew the end was near but I was so in love with her that I was in denial at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

One night I call up my best friend and ask him questions about what I should do in my situation and if he could help me understand her better. 2 A.M. and I am driving by his house (he lives very close to me) and I see her car one alley away. I bring up that her car was close to his house and jokingly asked if she was there because also her friend lived near me (I'm not a creep I promise LOL just don't feel like typing every little detail). He say 'well yeah she's been here for 3 hours or so'. I start panicking and loosing my shit. I tell that I will be at his front doorstep in ETA 3 min. I pull into the drive way and I have to beg him to talk to her. I storm thru the front door and caught her with my best friends bother. I cry still thinking about it. I lost all my friends that night. Everyone sided with my ex bff and ex gf that night. I was blocked by everyone I grew so close to in the past 3 years of high school and I still have to wonder why me. There was much more that happened but to personal to explain.

&amp;#x200B;

Later after talking to my old friend from high school she told me that there was a rumor that she was seen with him months before. In the school parking lot. Also she had lied to me about (her now boyfriend) because apparently they had been seeing each other before me and her were together.

&amp;#x200B;

Moral of MY story

1. don't let people change who you are
2. love yourself first in a relationship
3. if someone is telling you that they are going to kill themselves without you they either are lying or you can call them a therapist. (99% of the time they are lying)

At first it was just flirtatious innocence where we had a crush. Then the sex started and it was GOOD! Really, really good… on both of our ends. So we decided to make it a mutual agreement to sleep with only each other and enjoy just talking to other people since him and I were wanting to focus on single hood for a while. Well, things got comfortable. We’d talk for hours, watch movies, have dinner, drink, sleep over at each other’s houses on work nights, cuddle, etc. And when you introduce relationship behavior into a very, dare I say, FWB relationship..things get confusing. We’d attempt to go out on dates. We’d start calling each other and just sitting on the phone and talking. We’d feel comfortable bringing our kids around (only briefly) each other. He even randomly gave me a key to his apartment! So I guess we really started liking each other.. idk. I started to see him as actual serious relationship potential. Then I noticed he was texting other girls on his phone, which was fine as we had the agreement, but he became distant with me. We continued to have sex as that part always stayed amazing. However, I noticed that he’s spending a lot of time entertaining these other girls in my presence. Even when I’d have the respect to ignore my phone and have my ringer off. Now after our sex sessions and the obligatory pillow talks end.. he seems to be very in his thoughts. I notice he doesn’t fall asleep next to me anymore. He’ll lay there all night until morning sometimes. I’ve brought it up but he says he’s fine and just having a hard time falling asleep. Now, I’m a total insomniac and pretty much never sleep so I’m able to easily observe this. There was a time in the beginning that we’d both comfortably fall asleep in each other’s arm. 

 Am I coming on too strong now that I’m starting to see him more seriously? I’m trying hard to not catch feelings. 

I really hope I’m not losing him as I’m starting to really like him. He still cuddles and acts relationship-y with me and comes in randomly for kisses. But his lack of sleep while he’s next to me is really concerning. I know his behavior and can tell when something is wrong with him.

I just need help. I don't want to mess up a good thing. Been dating a woman for about a year. We broke up last January out of nowhere because in her words ""I was too good to her and it scared her"" We reconciled and started dating again last December.

Before we started dating the 1st time. We confessed feelings for each other and planned to eventually start dating. Then she randomly ghosted me for about 2 months. She's terrible at getting back to people, like honestly the worst. Ive seen her completely ignore her phone for days when I've come over to visit or when she sees me, so I'm not really sure if that counts for anything. Shes just never been too good at keeping her phone on her. Around that time though, she had a fwb/coworker named Clyde that she used to hook up with. She's told me she's had to cut him off a few times because of other guys she's dated in the past not liking her spending time with him and she doesn't want me to breakup with her for it. Her last relationship ended because she still talked to him when her old bf told her not to.They were never officially together but they would always go out to dinner and he would always pay. She told me that he was like this with all the women at their job. He just liked company and would take her and others out to eat. Sometimes alone sometimes in groups. She had feelings for him but he didn't want anything serious. I happen to reach out to her sometime after he rejects her and we eventually start dating the first time.  We both had some things we needed to work on within ourselves. Almost every actual relationship she's been in was abusive and I was cheated on in a couple of my other relationships. Ive gotten over the exs but ever since cheating has always been a sensitive topic for me. A part of me feels like its bound to happen at some point or something.

We spend last new years together and have a great night after that she doesn't contact me for a week then breaks with me over the phone.in the moment she said it was because she feels like she be a good girlfriend because she has too much going on in her life but now she says its because apparently ""i was too good to her and she felt like she didn't deserve it"" or a mix of the 2. She said that she never truly understood how much I cared for her. I'm not sure how true this really is but, whenever i was with her Id feel an overwhelming amount of happiness. It was euphoric. I remember crying after one of our dates  because i was so happy and all we did was see a movie. Which is why i don't want to mess this up. She's been so good to me after we eventually reconciled near the end of last year. We've had some many beautiful moments and have always been able to get passed our differences. 

I also saw her at a friend's birthday party about a month after splitting up. spending most of the night what looked like flirting with one of my own friends and even asks me for his Instagram. I just ignored her. That being said, she told me after we broke up. She experimented with some other people including Clyde. He was her shoulder to cry on for a period of time during all that. They would hangout and have sex and sleep in the same bed and go out to dinners and everything that a couple would do but they weren't a couple. Which is all fine since we weren't together. She then told me she continued to date other people causualy and felt something was missing and went on this whole journey moving back in with her family and asking them if she should reach out to me again and they all said yes. That they all liked us together and that she ruined a really good thing. It took me a while to open up to her agaim but we eventually reconciled after having a few talks about it and about 2 months of seeing each other casually. 

Clyde reaches out to her again through text about 3 weeks ago. I saw the message but didn't say anything. Later that night she's crying and mentions to me that he messaged her and doesnt know if she should even reply because she doesn't want to start any issues. She said that there's nothing to worry about and that they're just friends and she loves me. That it always frustrates her having to cut him off because he's always been a really good friend to her regardless of the fact they used to sleep together. Apparently he refuses to sleep with her if she's dating anybody. Then she yells that she just loves him platonically and desperately wants her friend back. She yelled that out loud, about how much she wants to spend time with him. Then goes on to tell me that he has so many options and he's a good looking guy so i have nothing to worry about. She said that he looks great in turtlenecks and if he ever goes out on a date with someone she'd tell him to wear it. She tells me this multiple times for some reason and even emphasizes that hes an attractive guy. I told her that that doesn't exactly make me feel any better and she said that she's just wording everything wrong but she swears i have nothing to worry about. 

Ive been thinking about this comment she made for weeks. I didnt know how to react when she first said it because emotions were high and she promised me everything will be fine. But saying someone has a lot of options as a reason not to cheat and stresses that everything will be fine because the the guy can have just about anyone he wants just rubs me the wrong way. I feel like I  always have to fight people off because she's always getting approached in public and even random strangers tell me all the time they wish they were with her instead of me. It pisses me off. I also saw another message he texted her the other day about moving, again I didn't say anything about it. But while we were looking at houses this morning she mentions moving to the same exact area he mentioned in the text. Coincidence?? Or am I over thinking?? Idk. I do do that a lot. Nothing has happened between them yet but I just have a feeling things can only get worse from here. I love this girl. I want to eventually marry this girl. She's even been telling some of her friends recently that she's all in with me. Do i just give her the benefit until something happens? Do i make her cut him off?? I don't want to mess this up. What do i do?? Im so lost.

Ladies, I know that this isn't what you want to hear but its absolutely essential that you hear it and keep it in the back of your mind so that you can avoid making mistakes and getting your heart broken.

Most situations where two people that have a platonic relationship and then try to advance into dating mode fails. Why? Because one part was never that invested to begin with. Thats where the friend part comes in.

Heterosexual men will keep around female friends, in the hope that there is a possibility for sex. Even if he is nice, caring, and gives you glimpses about being a really nice guy, he is doing this mostly to up his chances to get you in to bed. If you're fine with casual hook ups when this isn't a problem and you can stop reading further. However if you're hoping to develop a serious relationship with a male friend, keep reading.

So who are the women men befriend? Its usually the girl that maybe already has a partner so she isn't directly available to him, or the girl that he wouldn't really hit up when there's better alternatives, or the girl he doesn't really feel chemistry to but deems her to be acceptable as a sexual partner. He will orbit around these women, build a ""friendship"" that isn't really a friendship, just to get into her pants. This can go on for years. Many women say ""oh no he isn't like that, I've known him for years!"", but in truth the amount of years you've known each other makes no impact what so ever.

And then it happens. The female friend catches feelings, feels attracted, wants to pursue something, thinks he is serious about his interest, they have sex, he ghosts or stops showing interestand then everything falls apart. The girl starts blaming herself, asking what she could have done differently, if something is wrong with her, was he really just a jerk all this time? 

No. Nothing is wrong with you. Stop blaming yourself. You could be a 10 and he could still not view you as gf material.

Men don't befriend girlfriend material types of women. They don't really waste time on building a friendship with women they can see themselves with long term. If they find a woman they want to keep around for longer, they won't bother making her a friend. They will in 9/10 cases pursue her romantically depending on the situation.

We made the rule that if he does stuff with other people that we would tell each other beforehand if we can. And we have to tell each other if we are with another person. He calls me at 3 and tells me he did that with a friend, I knew this friend and he never told me he was with them. Actually he wasn’t with them, he just got high and he was venting to his friend and one thing lead to another.  And then he tries to make up excuses, saying that the rule where we can’t do stuff others without talking about it first. But we both agreed on this rule, and he tried to turn it on me. I love him but I’m really hurt, and I have no one to talk about it. Im a very sympathetic person and I couldn’t Bring myself to tell others and ruin his reputation, and I know he’s attached to me too since he’s very needy and he spends the most time with me then other people including his other people he dates.

We met up four times; first time we had a casual drink, other times I would go to his place or he would come to mine. From our first date he made it clear that his intentions were good, that he was looking for something serious and even added ""I'm 24 now, it's time for me to settle down"". We have common interest in a few things and I feel that we are on the same page overall. He really does seem to like me too and is upfront about the fact he likes talking about me to his friends, even coworkers? Like, introducing me and saying he's met someone.

Yesterday was the fourth time we met (at my place) and the evening was going so well. We talked, had dinner, watched a movie, cuddled, and we eventually kissed... for a very long time. It was the first time we were going really passionately at it and without getting into the details, I'd say we got very close physically and shared intimacy BUT didn't do it either. We did not have sex, which I'm relieved about, and I kinda sense that we both felt like it wasn't the right time and place anyway. Important to mention too; I never felt like he absolutely wanted to either and didn't make a sudden move (like undressing me or idk). I felt respected on that note and I think he realized it was way too early to go any further. The evening went on, we watched another episode and he would just put his arm around my shoulders, then go home as he has work early in the morning. I didn't feel any particular change in his behavior, I mean we hugged, he kissed my forehead and lips, we even finally exchanged numbers then he left. Sent me a goodnight text and said he had a great evening.

Yet why I am getting so worried? I woke up this morning to no message. He always sends something in the morning when going to work, and he did not this time. Just asked him if he had enough sleep, if we were still seeing each other this Sunday, and got veeery brief responses, nothing extra. My friends tell me I'm making up the worst scenarios in my mind and there's literally no reason for me to get worked up, but I can't help but imagine maybe he thought we shouldn't have been intimate, even though it felt reciprocal yesterday and well, it's not even like we did it?

I have serious anxiety and abandonment issues due to my ex having a change of heart right after we had sex, which now leads me to doubting myself every time on this matter.

So big day tomorrow for me! 
After a decade married, I'm recently back to the single life. 

I met this amazing girl on bumble, we had 3 great dates already.  Now she invited me to her place for dinner and movies tomorrow.

Now I have a couple of questions:

1) should I bring anything? Flowers? Wine? Chocolate? 

2) am I supposed to sleep over or to leave after sex? (I live few blocks away from her, but I would like to stay with her as much as possible, I just dont know what is ok or not these days..)

3) if I sleep over, should I leave before or after she wakes up? Before or after breakfast?
