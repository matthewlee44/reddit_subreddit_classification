I’ve been texting a girl for a couple of months. We immediately hit it off and have been talking about everything and anything. From our conversations I’m getting the impression she’s never had a partner before. She’s very quiet and assuming she doesn’t get much attention in that way, but I’m really falling for her. I’m also just fresh out of a relationship that gave me nothing but problems, and my girlfriend was the completely opposite of her. She knows about her and knows who she is.  


I started to drop some hints that I’m interested. I honestly don’t think she’s had attention before and doesn’t know what to do. Worst of all she doesn’t seem to be on her phone a lot, especially if she’s around people. My message will be sitting there unopened for 3-4 hours at times. When she does reply, it’s always lengthy with questions in it so I understand it takes time to write it.  


She’s just started Uni today on a short term course so she’ll be back home soon. Before she left, I messaged her to say I think she’s awesome and not to change a thing to suit anyone else. She replied saying “aww that’s such a nice thing to say, thank you” and she continued to update me while arriving at her accommodation. Last week we talked about something we want to do together when we’re both free.  


I’m just really unsure how to go forward. She mentioned a few weeks ago she finds it hard to commit as she likes her independence, but also said it would be nice to be settled. I don’t want to do something else to show how I feel, in case I start pushing her away. This is her first week of Uni so I’m wondering if it’s better that I back off and give her some space? Overthinking everything at this point.

Our convos were pretty consistent, but she was often busy saying she was working (which i know she does) or doing school work (which  once again, I know for a fact she does). She also NEVER gave any dead replies or left me on delivered for an extended period of time when she she wasn't doing anything (to my knowledge). We even met up around a week ago and everything seemed to be fine. She was enthusiastic to go in the first place, and she seemed to enjoyed herself and even said that she did. When I asked her if she wanted to do it again sometime and she seemed pretty enthusiastic about that too. 

Up until last Wednesday, I think (we met on the Saturday), we were doing well, nothing had changed and we were still talking as per usual. But then on that Wednesday, I realise that she left me on delivered for the whole day (which would've been fine IF it was normal for her, but it wasnt). Since I was worried, I naturally asked her if she was OK or if anything was wrong. One other thing is that she actually seemed to have deleted me from the app we originally met on, so I brought that up in the message too. The next day (since I sent it quite late), she responded with something along the lines with ""I'm so sorry, im not in a good place mentally right now and I'm taking a break off social media and thats why I deleted almost all my apps"" (which doesn't really explain her not being on my friends list, but sure). I said that if that's the case, she should take all the time she needs to feel better and that me and her friends are there if she needs to talk. 

Now, fast forward to yesterday, I'm curious if she had deleted her account because when I searched up her name to see if she if she'd actually deleted her account, and she wasn't there anymore (funnily enough, it only got rid of her from searches AFTER I deleted the app because there was a problem with it and that was the only way I could figure out in order to fix it, but thats besides the point). So I was just like ""yeah ok, this makes sense, fair enough"". However, then I remembered that when you BLOCK someone on the app, you cant search their name anymore. So, I got my mate to search her up to see if she'd blocked me and when he put her name in, there she was... so she must've blocked me. But I still have her on snap, even if she's left me on delivered for almost a week.

I can't lie, this whole situation seriously messed me up and I couldnt sleep for like 2 days straight. I guess its just the fact that I dont have an ending to it. I wouldnt be mad if she didn't want to speak anymore, ill be contempt in knowing that I have an answer, if that makes sense? Am I overthinking it? Should I ask in a few days time to see if anythings up? I just dont know anymore tbh.

I've had past bad experiences and told him from the start i wasn't exactly set on the idea of having sex or being ready to. He had respected my decision but then after doing other things he had told to me that he can only go so long without having sex and that I had two options: ""either you let me sleep with other ppl, which i know would hurt you"" or ""we continue dating and see when you become ready to have sex"". I don't think this is a good sign and honestly it doesn't make me feel like he cares about me.
After contemplating this past week or so I realize I am not wanting to be physically intimate with him anymore as it doesn’t feel right since we barely know each other and I feel a lack of an emotional connection (we aren’t bf/gf but have been exclusively seeing each other, but the relationship tends to feel very surface level for me and have realized I don’t want to be intimate with someone unless I know them very well, due to my past bad experiences and also Catholic upbringing). 

What is the best way to end things with him? I don’t want to be mean, rude, or hurt his feelings as he genuinely isn’t a bad person but I’ve been having this gut feeling for a bit and realize this is probably the best thing for both of us, as I don’t think we are giving each other what the other needs/wants and I honestly think we both realize that as it feels we’ve become a bit distant, or at least I have as to not be fake with him. 

We have hung out in person quite a bit and have spent the night at each other’s places so this hasn’t just been an online relationship, and I actually left some things by accident at his place. Would the best way to break up be in person?

But at the same time, I've realised that I do want something more than a hookup/ONS with someone, and I preferably would like to have a meaningful connection with someone. This past few years I've really tried to figure myself out and what I want in a short term/long term interaction. I've realised that in addition to looks and appearance being a non-negotiable, I also do have other non negotiables that include:  
\*Being warm, kind and caring.  
\*Being genuinely interested in me.  
\*Intelligence and being driven.  
\*Having great interpersonal skills.  
\*Sporadic social media use.

However, I really struggle to find this in places such as tinder or in nightclubs. Dating apps are already tough for guys, but  I feel like that the quality of people on tinder these past few years has gone downhill significantly. The last time I went on it roughly 60% of people I went through were tik tok/instagram/only fans influencers just looking for extra followers. Most other people explicitly were after a one night stand from their bios. I wouldn't say im opposed to the idea of going on a fun casual date with someone and seeing where it goes, or meeting someone on a night out and hooking up at the end of the night if we are both vibing, which i've done before. But I don't think I can just meet up with someone for sex, without even talking or going on a date first. Additionally, I've found out that a lot of women who might be after something more serious tend to get off dating apps like tinder, because of the high number of guys that act inappropriate and send vulgar messages. This has made it harder for me to find what i'm looking for on dating apps.   


A few months ago(before my city went into another lockdown), I decided to quit all dating apps and focus on going out to different clubs and bars a few times a week. After a while i ended up getting a lot more confident in  communicating with women, and I ended up getting some results. I even went on a few dates with a few girls I had met in nightclubs, and all of them were a bit suprised that I had asked them out on a proper date. But I noticed that the same pattern emerged, in that most people I had met in nightclubs had come out of long term relationships and were not really looking to start anything serious(which is completely fair enough). The other issue I had with going out to big nightclubs was that the music was so loud (particularly in larger nightclubs) that it made it literally impossible to have a conversation with someone. I remember there was this one girl I attempted to have a proper conversation with in a club once. We were both very sober, a and we had tried to talk for about 10 minutes, but the music got so loud it made it impossible to hear what we were saying to one another, we ended up giving up trying to have a conversation and just exchanging social media details and going our separate ways.

On dating apps, I try and avoid selfies, mirror selfies, and those type of photos. But even then i struggle to find what I'm looking for and I notice I almost go left 90 percent of the time.

The thing is I have no idea how to talk to women. Everywhere I look, it’s clear that women don’t want strangers talking to them because it feels threatening. I’ve even seen girls saying they feel uncomfortable if a man they don’t know is near by them. I don’t want to get a reputation as being creepy, and I know that even talking to a girl that doesn’t think I’m attractive could lead to her labeling me as a creepy guy.

Advice I’ve gotten from my girl friends is that I should never approach a girl if she isn’t attracted to me. I’m not the most conventionally attractive guy. I do my best but my best to make myself look as good as possible but often isn’t good enough. 

Because of this I doubt there are more than a handful of women alive that could have a conversation with me. I don’t want to make a mistake and talk to the wrong girl and her pepper sprayed, or recorded and posted on social media, or even worse accused of sexual harassment for telling a girl I think she’s pretty.

I’m a woman in my 20s, never been in a relationship and never had any of my “firsts” in the romantic department either.  I’m what you’d call a hopeless romantic and I want to wait for the right person. I also suffer from some mental health issues so for a long time it was difficult for me to meet new people, but it’s much better nowadays. Now I finally feel ready and really wish to meet someone with whom I could share that special connection. I’ve been trying to get to know more people, but here comes the problem: I only seem to attract men I’m not attracted to myself. It’s starting to be very frustrating and nagging at my self esteem. 

Despite definitely being far from the perfect person, I think I am, or try to be, an interesting person and I’ve often heard other people say that about me (perhaps they say that to everyone?). I have broad interests connected to culture and arts, I’m active in various creative fields (if only as an amateur), I am empathetic and a good conversationalist. Still, for some reason the only people I attract are from the opposite side of the spectrum of interests - mostly men into IT, games and technology. I know that those are the most popular interests for men, and of course I don’t mean to say that they’re in any way worse, I just personally don’t have any interest in them and from a love interest I wish for the intellectual stimulation and exchange that stems from sharing interests and hobbies. 

The other more controversial  aspect would be appearance… I’m not expecting to meet a male super model, but I take great care about my appearance and outfits and I’d just like to expect the same from a potential partner… which doesn’t seem to be the case. 

This situation is starting me to think that perhaps I’m delusional or have too high standards. Or perhaps I overestimate myself and I’m not as “attractive” and “interesting” as I seem to think I am. My mental health struggles were also coupled with self esteem struggles so it took me quite some time to finally start believing in my own worth, but now that’s being tested again. I mean, don’t similar people attract each other? Don’t the people I attract speak about who I am as a person? What am I doing wrong? I don’t want to settle for someone I’m not attracted to, but perhaps my dream man doesn’t exist…


What I want to add is that most men I’ve been meeting were through various online platforms, perhaps that’s also one of the reasons.

I'm looking at asking a girl out tomorrow. I've known her for about 4 months and felt a connection. Lately she has been growing distant because she's on the Soccer team and busy with school. I went to her first Soccer game this year, and going to attend the next one tomorrow. 

We both attended the same high school. In the first occurrence I met her, I said hello and made small conversation. Later that day, I followed her on Instagram and asked if she wanted to go for a few runs during the Summer.

Throughout the Summer we engaged in one/two runs a week. She wanted to go for runs to better her cardio for the Soccer season. Nearing our last few runs, we've had deep conversations and she thanked me for my help in training her and was very appreciative.

During one of our runs, I asked her if she was talking to anyone at her school. She said she wanted to stay single at the moment. She asked me if I was taking to anyone, I replied that I was not. She mentioned that she talks to a few guys but wanted to talk to them to a point of knowing whether it's enough to pursue a relationship as well.

\[Flash forward three months\] We've both talked everyday through texting. She moved across the state for her college. She's busy with Soccer and school throughout the week, and sometimes has to go out of state for games. I've attended two of her Soccer games this season and each time she was very appreciative that I went. After the first game, I drove home (3 hours) and we talked during that time through text. She told me several times to drive safe and be ok. And most of our conversations through text end in ""have a good night.""

Lately, I've noticed that through most of the conversations, I've been the initiator with questions. Throughout the Summer, I've felt a stronger attraction to her, but I feel that she is growing distant as well. There's been nights where we've had deep conversations and talked about vulnerable things, but I feel that it's hard to maintain conversations when I'm initiating them.

Not sure if this is cringy, but I made a script to kind of rehearse what I wanted to say, as I don't want to  say it over text, rather in person.

Lately she's been growing distant, and I'm at a crossroads of whether I should tell her how I feel. I want to keep the friendship, but I don't want to confess my feelings to her as a last resort of trying to rejuvenate our conversations.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,992186,public,self,Asking Someone Out,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pj34f3/asking_someone_out/,all_ads,6,,,

1. Not going to therapy themselves

2. Going to therapy but not implementing anything from it in a relationship setting/ everyday life


I’m also running into a lot of women who have all these traumatic experiences (being r*ped, physically/sexually/verbally abused, molested) but yet are still in the dating world trying to maneuver through life as if everything they been through isn’t something that needs to be treated by a professional.

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve needed therapy myself, and before going I did a lot of processing, took a lot of accountability and self reflection. Now I feel as if therapy for me is just to finishing touches. It had definitely helped me A LOT.

I say that to say there is NOTHING wrong with getting therapy on either side, man or woman.

There is something wrong with maneuvering through the dating world thinking you are fine when you’re not, or belittling others for not going to therapy when you’re not going yourself or if you are going, not implementing nothing from sessions. Because THATS when therapy doesn’t work.

I’m starting to see both in real life and online where people are using “going to therapy” as a crutch to belittle someone else. Also starting to see a lot of hurt people damage healthy people in the dating world.

This needs to stop, and no matter what color, gender, sexuality etc.

Until I told my friend, who didn’t believe that was true and she said she was going to like him on Hinge to see if they matched/if he would message her.

So I spend the night a few nights ago, and the next morning my friend texts me a screenshot of him matching her and messaging her “hey 😊” 20 minutes after I left his place. Long story short, we ended things because I confronted him about it and he ended up telling me he wanted to make things work but wasn’t ready for a relationship. 

I’m just so fucking hurt right now and makes me question everything. He was clear about really liking me and put so much energy into texting and seeing me.

So I am an introvert by nature but I would like to start getting a life again, make friends, find again my passions/hobbies etc.  Nothing will ever make me an extrovert but I’d like to find someone that could help bring me out of my shell and into the world.

I went out on a date with this woman.  She was not physically attractive whatsoever.  This was when I first started using online dating, so I had went thinking ""well maybe she looks better in real life.""  She definitely didn't.

But she was soo funny.  Her jokes had me turning purple, and she was a breeze to chat with.  We had the same exact humor (the type of humor that would have you put on a list somewhere if anyone knew).

She starts texting me the day after, and I would think and think.  It's like I tried telling myself it's okay to date her, but my monkey brain would scream ""NO! Do not mate!""  So I made up some BS excuse about how I felt like we were just friends and didn't feel a romantic spark.  She texted back asking if it was because of her appearance, and I lied saying ""No you're cute.  I just got friendship vibes was all.  I wish you the best.""

Now that poor girl is probably going on dates hiding her awesome personality.

I post here a lot.  As many of you guys know I'm a substitute teacher living at home with parents while I work on a full time credential.  I have seen so many flirtatious smiles and giggly eyes turn into a 1000 yard stare when I tell people I'm 33 living at home with mom.  I've seen it, time and time again.

It's like I'm trying to plant a flower, then some guy named ""substitute teacher living at home with mom"" comes by and repeatedly stomps on it till it's dead.  And then I naively try again the next day.

Of course no woman has ever admitted that was the issue.  I too am just given the BS ""no spark"" texts even though I know what killed it.  The weird thing I'm noticing with women is...it's like they don't even want to admit it themselves.  It's like they don't want to believe that something relatively shallow can make a decision for them.  I kinda realized that last week.

We have been friends for five years and he had been an absolutely peach! Respectful, kind understanding etc

I kinda got a crush on him but didn't act on it and to be honest the way he used to talk to me...I thought he liked me too.

But when I was talking about his preference about relationships and stuff so that I can ask him out.... He said that he just wants a physical relationship with anyone and is not thinking of relationships.

I was hurt but glad that I didn't ask him out on a date only to be rejected and being awkward. The friendship dynamic continued. Sure we flirted but nothing too much.

I tried a lot to get over him and nothing worked. I thought why not just fuck and get over it myself. I'm the only one who stands to hurt.

After a lot of drinks I called him and acted on it. He was surprised but very respectful and we did it.  It was great! I also got over him aa little because ultimately I know he didn't want a relationship.

He wanted to do it again and I kinda felt awkward. I said no once but he kept making jokes and bringing it into our regular conversation. Once I seriously said stop. He stopped and was normal again.

After a few months he suggested it. I don't know what came over me but that was the best sex ever for both of us!  All night, so many times! I made it clear that it was a one time thing and he said he understood but was sad because we're great together. I wanted to tell him that I kinda have a crush on him but that seemed like a very dumb decision so I laughed and said I wanted different things so we should stop and just be friends.

He again stated that he wants it to be a regular thing. I respectfully said no. But I noticed that he was constantly testing waters and didn't text me add enthusiastically as before. And for days he would immediately jump to that night or won't talk to me for days. Also maybe I'm overthinking but seemed a bit disrespectful. He would still say sorry and not repeat.

Recently I asked him what's the issue and he said nothing but kept acting weird. So, I said there's s disconnect and we should catch up to make it fine.
He kept delaying and said he wanted to keep things light. While simultaneously asking me whether he hurt me or am I fine. I was annoyed because he would ask the question and then not do anything to catch up while trying to make it fine 

I called him out and told him that if he doesn't want to resolve he shouldn't ask the question. That I have no issue till he asked and now I look like the bad guy for getting angry and letting things get dragged. He said sorry but I have no idea what to think of it.

I'm also scared that he might be pressuring/ manipulating me into abandoning what I want and just have casual sex with him. It's not like I hide my thoughts about relationships. If he talks about it, I always state that I love human connection more.

And I talk to him through the night and go out of my way to resolve his issues. He also used to do the same. 

Recently he started talking about kissing in the rain and how rain makes things beautiful etc. 

That's when I got pissed off. Like enticing me with a romantic scenario. 

Sometimes I think I really have a curse in relationships. He is a really caring and loving friend. Remembers every little thing I have said. Self flagellation is what I thought.. Think..

But then he sounds soo confident while talking about sex or doing it.

He actively avoids even the slight mention of relationships or emotions or love.

He used to comment on my every photo but now just ignores even my text when I don't properly text about fun.

He also says how much he cares for me and would do nothing to ruin our friendship. And he says that with so much grumption and sincerity. It's confusing.

I have asked him to talk a lot but at the I'm not going to school him on how to act with me.

Except for my feelings I haven't kept much from him. He knows my preference but just makes it so tha I also want to have just fun. 

We're both 26 years old.

This is far, far too simple for life and interactions with living human beings. The right thing with one potential person could be the wrong thing with another person. The wrong thing at this moment could be the right thing at another moment.

For context sake, regarding appearances I definitely saw myself as being out of this guy’s league. I’ve been told I could or should be a model and I do model.  He had terrible photos on his profile but we still clicked when I met him for a drink. My main goal is connection and that’s what turns me on. We had two dates and he left for a month and a half vacation. We knew it was happening and I told him I was dating around. We hit it off to the point where we almost hooked up on the first night though and later hooked up on the second date. We kept in contact while he was gone. I looked forward to his return especially because the other dates I went on while he was gone were boring to me. While he was on vacation, in a foreign country, he invited me out there for a long weekend. It’s a foreign country with high sex trafficking and it just seemed like the safer thing to decline and not over extend myself, but this detail is important.

Upon his return we had another date that went very well. I knew his birthday was coming up so a few days after his birthday We had planned an adventure day in our city and I took him out for a lunch. It cost me $60 and he makes significantly more money than I do. And we both know it. He usually pays for everything but I wanted to reciprocate because I liked him. 

We spent all day together and even came back to my house for a planned nap and sex because I knew we would be drinking later. I also let him nap for a while in my bed because I don’t normally nap. It was the only time he had really made me cum which feels weird but whatever.

Later at night we’re in his neighborhood and at a bar. He was talking a lot about people he dated right before meeting me. The problem I noticed was that it revealed he had lied to me- his lies made it possible to convince me that not using protection like condoms would be okay. He told me he was tested in May and hadn’t had sex since before then. But that didn’t line up with what he was randomly talking about at the bar. 

Later at night when we were in his bed I asked him about it. He said Im the only person he is dating now and when I pointed out the timeframe of incompatible things he told me, he said “I’m going to call you an Uber.” This is at 3am.

The whole day leading up to this moment he was smooching me and holding my hand. It was very jarring how abrupt the flip switched. He became very rude and mean. At least he called me an Uber because he told me that I didn’t need my transit pass or debit card for the night. I came home to my bed that I changed the sheets of because it smelled like his gross self. 

I’ve been so depressed and anxious I can’t eat. I sent him a message over social media which he hasn’t unfollowed me on or anything and he read my message but no reply. I said something like “hey I know we had a long day yesterday. I apologize for crossing a boundary of yours. I was concerned about my own sexual health boundaries. If you enjoyed spending any of the time you had with me I hope you give it a second thought and we could clear the air. But either way thanks for the enjoyable time beforehand.”

I think he realized I caught him in multiple lies and he wanted to reject me by making me feel like was actually nothing to him.

I don’t know how I’m supposed to stand out to a girl when she has literally thousands of men who’d drop everything to meet her on her phone. All the dating apps have made dating more of a game where girls can just switch from different love interest

I’m just a normal guy. I’m not a D1 athlete, I’m not the frat boy who has a party every weekend, I’m not the guy with tons of money. I’m not anything special. I do my best and try to make myself as good as possible but it doesn’t matter when a girl could easily find someone who doesn’t have to work on it. To not be replaceable as a man you have to be perfect. I’m in shape, I make people laugh, I’m caring, and kind, and empathetic, but even if I had every trait a girl was looking for it’s easy to find that but better looking from a few swipes.

Most girls my age are already seeing multiple guys, she could easily replace me with just some other guy. I’m effectively competing with every man in my town and I don’t know how I’m supposed to win. I have never seen an average guy my age with. I see the tall athletes, the handsome party boys, the frat boys, the guys that are above normal guys.

I'm also very much interested in a general sense, but a big part of what I'm interested in is the question of do women typically want to tell men explicitly what they want, whether they're enjoying it, etc., or do they want men to just be knowing and competent and typically in charge without any real discussion--the cliche of ""He should just know!""?

I'm asking because I'm a guy and I don't feel like I'm that good at sex. A super secret about me is I watch porn; I might be comparing myself to that. I absolutely don't consider it a model, like I don't want to literally reproduce what I see there and in fact it's very much part of my experience with porn that I don't think about it really at all apart from my actual direct consumption of it, but I think what I take from it is that the man is typically depicted as sort of an overwhelming force. There isn't a lot of communication and typically what there is is kind of commands from the man. That doesn't feel like me.

Maybe this is a failing on my part, but I've never really sat a woman down and asked her, ""What do you want from me, sexually?"" The best sexual relationship I ever had was the woman was fairly explicit what she wanted me to do, and incidentally what she wanted me to do was be fairly dominant, so it was this weird thing where she was in charge, but I was *really giving it to her.* BUT she was much more experienced than I was and I never really knew if she was okay with this of if she was just constantly putting up with my constant fuck-ups, basically.

TLDR: Guy (32M) plans great dates, seems into me (30F), but will wait 24 hours between texts and it's beginning to feel very purposeful, like he's playing games with me. What do I do and am I reading too much into this or is it a red flag?

I've (30F) recently started dating again after a long hiatus. I'm currently using dating apps and going on a bunch of dates with different guys. One guy in particular I've had a much better connection with than the others (32M) and we've been on three dates.

However, it's been about a month, with roughly 1 date a week, except one week he was out of town. After our last great date, I was thinking about not scheduling any more dates until I see how I feel about him. But here's what annoys me. He's great at planning dates but his communication feels like he's playing games with me. Like, he'll text me about something (and good quality texts too, asking questions, multiple texts in a row, etc) but then when I respond, he will take 24 hours to get back to me. It's really hard to have a conversation this way and feels very purposeful on his end.

I'm also really busy and prefer dates to be planned further in advance. So after our date last week, he said he'd love to see me again this week. But our conversation has been difficult because he's waited a day between every reply. Now it's Monday and no date planned yet.

It'd be one thing if he was super busy (like when he was out of town), but he works 4 day weeks and didn't seem to have much of a plan for this weekend. I also wouldn't care about his shit communication if we'd had the next date scheduled, as I'd rather talk in person anyway. I get the feeling he's waiting to respond to play games and it's making me less attracted to him. Plus, I'm losing the momentum we've built up.

I went from thinking I might want to see where things go with him exclusively to feeling a little blown off and like he's not that into me. Now I'm thinking I might as well schedule dates with other men because he doesn't seem to care much. What do you think? Do guys do this to seem hard to get? It just feels so immature and pointless. It also makes me feel over eager when I respond in a normal amount of time, so I feel like I'm getting roped into game playing too - like well, if he's going to wait 24 hours, then I should too, and I don't want to feel that way.

She’s gorgeous and although I’m a decent looking guy, I feel as though she’s way out of my league.

Fast forward to this past weekend. I was with a group of friends and as we were leaving the bar I run into my crush whom I haven’t seen in probably 4 years. She gives me a big hug and we talk for 5 or 10 minutes about what we’ve been up to, I crack a few jokes which are met with big laughs and smiles - all while my friends are waiting to leave. As I go to leave she gives me another big hug saying it was great to see me and I should text her sometime if I ever wanted to hang out. Obviously this took me by surprise so I just smiled and said “I will!”.

Being a little intoxicated and quite caught off guard, I didn’t realize I don’t have her number. But we are friends on Instagram where we always like each others posts and what not. Which brings me to the title question - should I DM her since I don’t have her number?

I’ve always felt weird about DMing people as I think it can come off as thirsty but I feel this may be an exception since there was an invitation for outreach.

He may have money, other women chasing him, is talented or skilled. But if he finds a woman particularly alluring or special, and falls into the trap of putting her on pedestal, or views her as someone who must be praised, his status will go out the window. This is particularly true if he spills his feelings, is overly effusive with compliments.

Whether you love him or hate him, Drake has been the most popular musical artist in the world for the past decade. Due to this, he obviously is high status. However, high status men can still make the critical error of putting a particular woman on pedestal.

The following example is from a few years back, but is an excellent example of how being too effusive with verbal praise, and over sharing of feelings in a needy way makes women uncomfortable, and is one of the biggest turnoffs, even if it comes from a high status man. This is the end of a speech Drake gave honoring Rihana in 2016:

“She's someone...she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old, she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life, I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry.”

Now read an interview she gave regarding the speech and the impact it had on their relationship:

“Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don't like too many compliments. I don't like to be put on blast. We don't have a friendship now, but we're not enemies either. It is what it is.""

It is an extreme example, but it applies to a general concept of attraction. Verbal compliments when overdone will make women extremely uncomfortable, especially those who are high quality. It is better to show appreciation through action rather than verbal praise. It’s fine to be heartfelt and vulnerable, but if it becomes unbalanced, then it will make things uncomfortable, no matter the ‘status’ of the man",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,992564,public,self,Certified Lover Boy?

Below I’ve written up a text conversation between a girl I dated and myself. This happened about halfway through the time we dated. We dated over a month but would see each other 2-3 times a week and I really care about her. She broke up with me a month ago but I feel like I could learn from this and do better going forward. Thank you for any advice. 

Her: Hmm I guess it depends what I’m thinking. Honestly, I’ve had a lot of up and down of how I think this will turn out. It’s hard to know really. I’m glad you’re enjoying the new job.

Me: I sensed that sometimes. I appreciate you hanging in there with me and for being honest. Hate that you have an up and down feeling. How are you feeling now? Of course you know I’m willing to talk anytime about anything. If it’s right thing for both of us then I’m hoping it works out. Well I’ll ask you this as well. What are your concerns with me?

Her: friend thinks I just need to take a break from dating people, but the truth is I’ve never had anything that lasted long term. It’s always a bunch of 1-2 month things. I analyze everything wayyy too much. Always trying to figure out why I do what I do and why other people do what they do. Sometimes I’m not sure if we really click. And maybe that comes with time. I like you because you let me take my time and don’t push me further into it than I’m ready. But sometimes I think I freaked you out and you’re afraid that you’ll scare me away so you hold back. You said you dated someone for 6-7 months but never made it official that makes me wonder if things will also go that way for me. I think I’m staying because I never stay. Because I’m trying to figure out if I confuse intensity with intimacy. The extreme highs and lows of bad relationships can have an adrenaline rush to them. So what if the reason I’m not sure this is right is actually because it’s just different and maybe that’s a good thing.

Me: Truthfully that’s how most of mine have been too. Especially online dating. The longest “relationship” I had was during this past year. We dated for 6-7 months. I threw the idea around the 3-4 month mark of being gf/bf and she just brushed it off. Just kinda sucked you know. I broke off our “relationship” with her. I do want something that’s long term if it’s right for both of us.

Her: yeah it doesn’t seem like she wanted something serious.

Me: I also over analyze everything as well and it’s a terrible habit of mine. I’m trying to learn to just relax and trust the process if it’s meant to be. I do wonder if we really click sometimes. I feel like we have most of the time. I think we can and will! I’m hoping that comes with time. I try to be open and vulnerable around you but I don’t get that back sometimes. Honestly I do get frustrated because I am always initiating and I’m like I think she likes me but I’m not sure. Yes, you’re exactly right. I did get a little freaked out and I actually thought I freaked you out so of course I don’t want to ruin it over a stupid mistake on my part. Truthfully (I know I do not need to say this but I’m being brutally honest) you are the best girl I’ve dated in a long time. It’s not even close.
She was 29 so I would’ve guessed that she wanted something serious. She wasn’t sure where she wanted to be in life. She actually said idk what her purpose in life is. So I think she had a lot of stuff going on for her. At the end of the day it wasn’t the right person so I pulled the plug. I think you and I are similar in a lot of ways. I feel like I understand you and I hope you understand me.

Her: I think I just still have some walls up. I don’t like to share too much when I’m not sure how things will go because then it’ll just feel like a waste and I’ll feel raw. And I don’t know how I fell. And maybe I’m numb or maybe we just don’t fit or I don’t know. That’s just where I am. 

Me: You do but that’s ok. They’ll come down when they’re ready. I don’t want it to be a waste thought. It’s still early and it sounds like a lot of confusion. Wish it was easy. Regardless of what happens in the future I just want us both to be happy. I think we both deserve that.


Her: The last relationship I had, I did have sex with him. I felt very obligated and guilted into, but I still agreed to it. I did it with a good conscience. Before, I kinda thought he was arrogant and maybe a bit manipulative. Afterwards, I was very attached. I was do or die so quickly. He made all kinds of promises. He talked about getting married. He talked about wanting to be careful about having sex since it was my first time, but then kinda pushed me into it. In the end he ghosted me. So I guess all those promises were lies. I agree with you that it wasn’t something I lost. I learned a lot from that. It was more the creation of a connection than the loss of a piece of myself. At the time, I was certain sex before marriage was all well and good. When he ghosted, I knew I couldn’t connect on that level with someone again unless they were my forever. 

Me: I absolutely hate that happened to you. You deserve better and it sounds like that guy was a piece of shit. So many people have had a bad experience like that with sex. I had a bad experience in a different way. I don’t know how long you guys dated or how recent it was. I promise you one day you will let go from that and move on. You will be able to connect with someone like that again. I don’t know if you feel that it’s necessary but you can always talk to a therapist about that. They might be able to help you process it better. Just a thought.

Her: Yeah, I don’t know. I went to therapy a while back about something else and then stopped. I’ve thought about going back. It’s expensive. Most of my friends know about it though, so that’s helpful. The way it happened was not super cut and dry. I have described explicitly step by step what he did to one person. She said that sounds more like rape. Technically, I did agree, so I don’t think it was. I think he took advantage of the situation, but I don’t think he raped me (at least not the first time lol). I also shouldn’t have slept over and that was my first mistake. But he had a lot of issues. He also was like twice my size so that didn’t help matters. I don’t know. I’m fine really and I don’t want this to affect us. Obviously, it probably will, which is why I’d rather you know. But I would rather it not.

Me: I appreciate you sharing. Really that is terrible and I’m sorry you had to deal with that. It’s almost never clear cut and dry. I know they’re expensive but if you feel like it could be a benefit then worry about the costs later. There’s gotta be ways to help. Your health is number 1. I don’t want it to affect us either but I know it could and I’m willing to work through it if we can. Just know that I have your back and I’m willing to listen.

Her Well I appreciate it.

I get upset reading that ex boyfriend portion. She is a fit 5’8 girl so this guy must’ve been massive if he was twice her size. The guy ended up ghosting her. Just hate that she had to go through a negative experience like that. I tried really hard to be patient, understanding and kind to her. 

So this was a few weeks before we ended things and I really feel like this was a critical conversation that led to us ending things. Never had a conversation lie this before and I wanted to make it work. I want to be able to learn from this and do better? How can I? I know she’s not coming back so I need to move on. 

Tl;dr

Dated a girl for over a month. We had a lot of conversations and lots of dates in that timeframe. I really care about her. Above is a critical conversation we had about halfway through our time together. Really just want to learn how I can do better? I’m really bummed it didn’t work out and I kinda blame myself since I had anxiety and probably pushed her too hard.

That was a minor one. I've had the ones where you try to keep like communication going so it isn't the next day flake where you are anticipating to do something during a certain time. And they don't respond to the following day with ""I don't think I can make it my uncle is flying in from BLAH BLAH"". And I'll be like okay did you know yesterday?. ""Yeah but i just didn't think anything of it"". Or they come up with some story about not feeling well.

&amp;#x200B;

So the funny story is this. I matched with this chick off of bumble. We are chatting. And like the texting where you guys are like messing and responding back right away and having a good flow going. Anyway she goes off to another city to enjoy herself and says she will be back the following week. She asks for my number saying it would be easier I'm like sure. Then we are chatting and shes like what you doing this weekend. I'm like i like to go somewhere to grab food at this cool place. And she says oh with me right? So she basically invites herself. And i was more than happy to do that with her. Anyways the night before she texts me and doesn't respond to my text after she texted me. The next day she says Oh sorry I am not feeling well. I am no worries. Leave it and move on with my life. I check the app and it says she basically went to this beach which is a party spot. She told me where she lives and all her family is. So just thought it was funny. Just waiting for the opportunity for her to reach out, if she ever does, to be like ""My friends were like lets go to (THE PLACE SHE WENT TO) but i was like naw, I had plans and i didn't want to be an ass and cancel and lie to the person I was gonna meet).

I spread rumors about her. She hated me at that time. Soon quarantine came along. During that period I realized me missing her so much. I would text her here and there. She would either reply with dry texts or not respond at all. When we went back to school I found her flirting with me all of a sudden. She would hold my hand. Hug me. Hold my leg. And I asked her if she liked me and she said that she just flirts like that with everyone. She would brush it off my saying that she was basically gay. Soon we started hanging out more often. We went to the movies and we even made out, cuddled and etc. She would still say that we're still friends. I didn't get it! Does this girl have stereo type I don't know about!? Soon she told me that she liked me. I loved her. So I asked her out and she said yes! Everything was romantic for the next week and of all of a sudden this morning she called and said that she thinks that this is a bad idea. She said that she thinks it's unfair that I love her and that she only likes me and that it's not balanced. She also said that she thinks she's not ready for a relationship. What should I do?! She's slipping away from me. I truly love her. I don't love her because of the sex, or anything physical. I don't know what I find in her but I truly love her.
