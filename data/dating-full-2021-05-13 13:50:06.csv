There’s a girl in my circuit class at the gym that I talk to before / after class, casually. She’s single and cute. I am about to turn 43 but could pass for late 20s / early 30s. 

While of course I am very attracted to her, physically, she also has a spark in her eye, a laugh, and energy / enthusiasm for life I find just as attractive. 

I am pretty sure she’d say yes if I asked her out, but after being in the wrong relationship for so many years...I don’t want to waste anyone’s time, mine or hers...I don’t want to pursue if the age gap is too great to ever potentially have a serious relationship.

Older men always try to convince him he is missing out on dating older women because he is not ""growing up"" with a woman who could match his maturity level (i mean what?).

Some of his female colleagues tease him for dating a ""baby snatcher"". I was caught off guard when i heard that term. He confronted one of them and she simply told him its because he needs to be mothered all the time, probably wont be able to look after himself or is ""lusting"" after his own mother. 

Theyve been going out for about 2 years now, the feelings were mutual, both successful in their careers. So what gives? What are the issues younger men face when it comes to dating older women?

I am a 21 year old White man, he is a 21 year old Asian man. We are both bisexual and we are each other's first same-sex partner. This is all important information. TL;DR at the bottom, this is gonna be long but I would really appreciate it if you read it and gave me advice.

&amp;#x200B;

We met through having multiple mutual friends, we don't actually have a single class in common. We've known each other for around 8 months now. After a while we really started to click and I could feel myself really developing feelings for him but held them back because I assumed he was straight. One day we were chilling alone he randomly decided to come out to me as bi, and happily I came out back to him, but his face dropped. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, my boyfriend's past relationship trauma comes from a white girl he dated when he was around 17. He told me in depth about all the creepy shit this girl has said and done to him, long story short she was hardcore fetishising him and basically saw him as some race trophy. She only started showing her true colours a few months down their relationship, he was trapped and essentially felt like he was getting sexually (verbally) assaulted everyday until he got the courage to break her off. He said this put him off entirely of dating white people (reasonably so) and swore never to date another white person, male or female. 

&amp;#x200B;

He literally told me all of this shit right after I came out to him, I think he assumed I was straight and now that he knows I like guys too it was obvious I had a crush on him. He admitted to liking me too but held back cause I was white (and also didn't know my sexuality). It took the whole night but I convinced him that we should start dating and he agreed and decided to look past my race. Honesty looking back, this was such a shitty thing for me to do as I was clearly the one coercing him into a relationship with me instead of just letting him overcome his trauma himself. This should have been the first major red flag for BOTH of us.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as of this post we've been dating almost 5 months. It's been mostly good but the most offputting part is still because of his past fetishisation trauma. One time, I complimented him about how good his eyes looked in a pic and he snapped, apparently the way I said it was 'word to word' exactly like how his ex said it. Another time, I said I like that we're the same height because his lips are more accessible to kiss (I know its fucking cringe get over it), he snapped AGAIN, apparently his ex also mentioned a lot about how he's tall (we're 6ft) and she wanted to make tall mixed race babies or some weird shit like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the most recent incident, about 2 days ago, I wanted to say something about his body hair. Admittedly, I could not care less about his body hair, I wanted to say this solely to make it seem like I wasn't fetishising him for typical Asian features because he actually is super hairy and not like the stereotypical 'smooth Asian body', it was a dumb strategy but it sounded good in my head. I said I loved his body hair and guess what fucking happened... HE GOT FUCKING ANGRY cause his ex said the 'exact' same thing that she loves how hairy he is for an Asian guy. This time, stupidly I snap back at him for the first time about this issue, I definitely said some things I shouldn't have that were ignorant, victim-shaming and possibly borderline racist due to being in the heat of the moment. He stormed out and we have not talked or even texted since then, its been almost a full 48 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you've read this far, idk who's side you'll be on but if you think he's being overdramatic, he is not, this chick is batshit crazy. He's shown me her past messages and she even managed to track me down on Instagram despite my bf blocking her on everywhere, I guess she connected that I was his new partner and dm'd me, she didn't say anything creepy but I still blocked her cause that was creepy enough that she managed to find me.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, now that you know the whole story, WHAT THE FUCK SHOULD I DO? I've convinced him many times I do not fetishise him AT ALL anytime this topic comes up, I have never even dated an Asian girl and have never inherently found Asian features especially attractive. When I first started liking him I didn't even register the fact he's Asian. Yes he has very typical Asian features (he's Malaysian Chinese) and yes he's very attractive but those 2 things are mutually exclusive.

&amp;#x200B;

As a white man, I know I will probably never face a problem like this in my life and will never relate to him so I try to be as understanding and patient with him about his trauma but I hope you can see where I'm coming from and why I finally snapped back at him 2 days ago. He brings it up quite often whenever I mess up and I can see he kinda feels bad after he snaps at me because he thinks it's not my fault when it partially is because I'm the one who brings it out of him. But also I'm at that point where I don't even know how to compliment my bf about anything without reminding him of his trauma. 

&amp;#x200B;

This all doesn't matter anyway because I'm fucking stupid and probably scared him in deeper into his trauma for getting angry at him. At this point I don't even know if we're still dating. I feel like I'm at such a unique problem and no one in my family or friends have faced a relationship problem like this so I don't know who or where to go other than on Reddit. I even tried searching on Google but what do I even search? 'Fetishisation trauma'? 'White girl damages Asian guy and now a stupid White guy is trying to fix it but messes up even harder'? 

&amp;#x200B;

Final paragraph, I'm sorry for rambling so much, me typing this whole post out was honestly kinda relaxing and probably a major sign I need therapy lmao. I love this man and I know he loves me too and he is fucking perfect (and I mean it) except for this flaw and I hate myself for even calling it a flaw because it wasn't even his fault. Please help me. I don't want to lose him.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- My Asian boyfriend was fetishised hardcore by an ex-White girlfriend. To the point where he gets angry at me for any simple compliment, I finally snap at him about it and we haven't talked in 2 whole days.

I lived a state or two away and I was visiting family once I went on our first date. My gut told me not to go and that I will regret it, and I was right. 

I was visiting my brother's town and I decided to go on a date with someone I matched with. It was alright at first, I wasn't sure if I liked him, but he was super laid back and fun to talk to. Towards the end we kissed and said goodbye. He wanted to see me later if I had time and I said maybe. After telling my family about him they said I should give him another shot so I ended up going on another date with him later that day. 

The date was great, we kissed a lot and talked about our lives. He gave me some things so I would remember him, yeah all that cheesy sweet talk. We took pictures together and the chemistry was awesome! Towards the end of the date I promised him I'd see him again and he promised me he would text me and keep in touch. I came back from the date crushing hard and right after he got back he texted me. We were talking for about two weeks while I was back at home. He kept asking me when I will come and I told him I would try to come the next month.

 Towards the end of April I noticed he was pulling back and he would message me less. Sometimes he would pop up with  a ""hey"" or apologize and still tell me how hes excited to see me. But one off putting thing he told me was that he's pissed at everyone in his town because they are ""boring"" and it would be less boring if I was there. I felt hurt because it just made me think that I was boring him at this point.

That's when I felt something off. After that he would go days without texting me. I would try to reach out time to time and I even let him know that I will be in town. He responded telling me to let him know once I'm there. When I was about to leave soon with my family I texted him asking if he was down for making plans with me. He finally opened up and said that after two weeks of us talking he met another girl and now they are currently dating. I responded wishing him luck pn his new girl and offered up on getting to know me as friend, which I know was dumb. He said yes and then invited me to hangout with him and his friends cause he thinks I will like them. My dumbass said ""yeah! What will you guys be doing?"" and then silence. A few days later I texted him letting him know that I was in town and, yet again, I got no response. He wasn't even interested in being my friend, which is understandable.

Welp there's my message. He found someone else who was better, less boring, and more convenient. I'm glad he finally told me that, but I really liked him in person. I feel so stupid about being upset over this because I was from another state. Please be nice though, I am still really hurt about this. I just needed to let this out. I'm in his town right now about to leave soon, but it's still painful. I want to move on but it's so hard, my friends are supporting me, but they're also telling me to forget him and that he was an asshole who led me on. He still has me on social media and everything so I feel like that makes moving on harder. But I will leave it at this, I know I will move on eventually and find someone who will actually stick around and is closer, but this is just god damn painful.

I've been social media free for almost a year and I've noticed a few things, but I'll just focus on this one: people make no effort. 

It's so easy to reply to an instagram story or leave a like in a picture. You don't actually need to start a conversation, and if said conversation does happen it can be superficial and post-related. 

Without social media, you actually have to text the person SOMETHING (or call, but let's keep the bar really low) otherwise you won't talk. ''Good morning, how are you today'' gets old pretty quickly and you either meet up, or the ''thing'' dies.

If you don't have sexy selfies online, people can't even perceive you as attractive, and without a daily post people can't bother to keep in touch.

I (M27) started studying with an introverted classmate (F24) last September and we’ve become friends. We’ve been on hikes, watch movies, and see each other a couple times each week. She mentioned she has rejected guys that wanted a relationship after a couple months, and said something along the lines of *”I’m glad you haven’t asked me to be your girlfriend yet, not that I don’t like you, but I prefer to establish a friendship first.”* I haven’t said if I want to date her or not but I’m guessing she knows I do. Last week I put my arm around her when we were watching a movie. She seemed to like it because she laid on my chest. This week we had plans but she didn’t return my call. I think she might need time, but I don’t know how long I should let her be or what to do next. I’m afraid of making the wrong decision.


I (M27) started studying with a classmate (F24) last September. We met in the library when she was looking for our class (which had been cancelled), and we sat and talked in the hall the rest of the class period until a fire alarm interrupted us. We had arranged to work on the assignments together.

It was a tough class and I was impressed with her intelligence since I was struggling to understand the material. After working together once or twice I was afraid I’d hold her back and stopped working with her. She reached out after the midterm to work together again because she hadn’t been doing the assignments. She started a tradition of bringing new Oreo flavors when she came over.

We started watching TV shows and movies after we finished homework, and I felt like we were friends by the end of the semester. We even played old video games we enjoyed from our childhood. I had been actively suppressing any thoughts about dating but she was definitely growing on me. I thought she wouldn’t want to see me anymore after the Christmas break.

I was happy to see her again after the break and we continued seeing each other to make food, watch shows, and whatever else. I was glad that the Oreos kept coming. We started going on hikes as the weather warmed up and exploring new restaurants. I’ve been pleasantly surprised to see her musical talents and general charm. Things have felt warm and friendly between us.

I told her that I like that she’s introverted (and shy and awkward, but I didn’t say that) like I am, and that she’s authentic. She appreciated what I said, and we got on the subject of dating. She said she doesn’t like being one of many dates that a guy has in a week. I agreed, and said I don’t like dating girls who have a lot of dates to get attention. She then said something along the lines of *”I’m glad you haven’t asked me to be your girlfriend yet, not that I don’t like you, but I prefer to establish a friendship first.”*

I haven’t said if I want to date her or not but I’m guessing she knows I do. Last week we watched movies at her apartment and we were laying next to each other. The first night I chickened out, but the next night I put my arm around her. She seemed to like it because she laid on my chest and I felt so happy.

Panic has set in for the first time because we had plans to get food this week but she didn’t return my call, and so far she usually has. We’ve never texted much but we always have long conversations when we’re together. I’m afraid that I might have scared her by putting my arm around her, but I also know that she’s introverted and wants time to develop a relationship. I’m scared to make a mistake because I’ve had bad luck with dating. I know what I want to say but I don’t know what I *should* say/not say.

So people are supposed to trust their partners but also don't ever rely on someone, and the faster you get used to people disappointing the easier will be.

You should be happy with someone but also don't seek happiness from someone. 

Your partner should be there for you but you should never be dependent on them. 

In the case that you are single like me you shouldn't seek out being in a relationship ... But you also should? The right person will get to you, but there's not such thing as a right person, we are alone and you shouldn't be looking for comfort from someone yet this is a dating sub. 

All relationships end up poorly, people lose interest in some years that's it if it doesn't end up like a toxic relationship. But some say all relationships are toxic as you're relying on someone else. 

You should look out for someone willing to open up, care for you, be attractive to you, being attracted to you, compromised, good at sex, good at communicating and your best friend, but be awarded cause that doesn't exist you are wanting to much out of someone those fairy tales have definitely get you into a inexistent idea of relationship.

I got the feeling that either people get into a relationship and is the most incredible thing in the world they compliment each other and solve out their problems with communication and love or people get into a relationship and is the most anguish thing in the world they only do it cause they want sex and for trying to feel less lonely.

So I'm a 29 year old male, 5'7"", average/slim build. 

I live in a major city and live around a lot of people who are on these apps. 

I don't have the best pictures, like even friends that are close to me have told me I don't, and say I look better in person. It doesn't offend or bother me at all that they say that, I'm not a fan of those pictures as well but their the best ones I have. I haven't posted an updated photo in a couple years but I don't take pictures of myself that often in general. I don't do selfies, just think selfies are just ""oh look at me!"" I personally don't get it, but whatever. 

I have a decent profile in terms of hobbies, career, I go out on runs on the regular so I do check some of those boxes that people look for, and make an effort in presenting myself well.

I swipe right on pretty much every profile I see, mainly because I thought that maybe I was too picky, so swipe right on all and give all women a chance. My only filter is religion based (which I expect to be understandable)

I get maybe 1 match every couple months, I start a conversation and don't get a reply back, and that's the end of that. I've used 3 different dating apps to widen the pool.

He contacted me this morning to confirm a good time. He asked for 5:45, I requested 6:15 since I get off at 5 and wanted to sure I’d be on time. I wanted to factor in a quick stop at home (I live 5 minutes from my job) to freshen of my face, change my top and factor in traffic. He said that was cool and told me the restaurant name. I said cool and asked him to text me which location we’d meet at... I haven’t heard from him since this morning. 🤨

Now I’m wondering, are we not texting because we’ll see each other this evening? That seems logical. 

Is he uncertain of which location yet or maybe he’ll change his food desires closer to the time? 

Does he have cold feet?! But then why would you confirm at 8 AM?!

Male King Cobra's have an unwritten rule when fighting over the same female King Cobra, they cannot use their mouths or venom to subdue the other but must actually pin the other in a wrestling match that is often mistaken for a ritualistic mating dance by onlookers. The winning male then gets to claim not only the female King Cobra, but the losing male's territory.

If the female will not mate with the winning male, the male may believe she has already slept with the losing male and then straight up murder her. The female will then roll around in circles until she dies and the male will eat/attempt to eat (sometimes they're too big) her head first.

Girls have asked me out and shortly after tell me that they love me. Personally, I don't understand how you can love someone so quickly.

And, here is the kicker, they are the ones that leave. I stay. Maybe that doesn't earn me any brownie points but its true. I always try to hold on and mend relationships when we have problems, and these girls would rather just leave. 

Is it because I don't ask girls out and then they will want to stay? Or is it because they tell me they love me and then get to actually know me and not be into me anymore? Or am I literally just seen as some kind of catch/prize that when women get me, and I am stupid enough to fall in love with them back, they loose interest because women only want what they cant have?

And it’ll be about that things are seemingly very obvious to me. Like for instance, my female friends all agree that OLD is easier for girls. My friend said “I can go on tinder right now and get a date within an hour, most guys can’t do that”. And they agree that having a ton of matches and options is infinitely better than having very few/none at all. But in the online space, I notice the narrative is pushed that online dating is just as hard for women.

Then there’s also the debate about attractiveness. IRL, my female friends openly admit they’re swiping on and matching with the hottest/best looking guys. That that is literally the point of swiping, it’s impossible to accurately judge a personality from pictures. But if you come online and say women prefer tall, white good looking men, women will fight tooth and nail to say that isn’t true and there’s so much more to it than that (I notice this on this sub a lot). And its so strange to me that its difficult to acknowledge that shorter, non white men definitely have a rougher time, and that its not all in their heads.

And then when it comes to actual advice when I bring up dating struggles, I never get the “you need to work on yourself” lines that are prevalent online. I actually get the opposite, that I’m good enough as is, there’s nothing wrong with me I just need to keep trying. I think this one might be because it would come off as rude IRL to say the person needs to improve themselves. Like it would be acknowledging I’m not good enough for a relationship as I am. This one might be where online advice is actually better because it’s a more neutral opinion.

I want to ask her if she wants to hang out at a park or a cafe in a friendly way but don't want to make it awkward. Should I go like this or try another approach?

I do have high standards but mainly in terms of personality. I like mature caring men but they’re hard to come by. 

I’ve tried dating apps but the convos are dead however hard I try. Most of the time guys don’t reply to me despite me creating a nice opener.

I’ve never been approached on the street or anywhere public, never received flowers, never taken out for a meal or a trip.

It may be a bit difficult to maintain the relationship with not being able to see each other as often as well.

Some advice would be greatly appreciated.

My previous relationship, I was always having to rationalize staying. When things finally ended, I felt relief and realized my gut was right all along. Now I'm in a situation where rationally I should probably end things but my gut is telling me to stay. I don't think this is infatuation or loneliness either. I just for some reason feel strongly that the person I'm seeing is going through a particularly rough stretch and I should ride it out.
