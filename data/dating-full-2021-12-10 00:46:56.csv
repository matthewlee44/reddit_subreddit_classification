At first I didn't think anything of it but then I realized she could have grabbed plates from anywhere but chose to ask me.

I thought maybe I was being delusional because I'm arrogant at times. But then she came back for more and we joked around a bit and I playfully punched her in the arm.

Then later I passed her and she smiled at me.

And then he tells me he's dating in a weird way?

We’ve hooked up before, but ended up distance for nearly 2 years. He started talking to me when he was overseas just before Covid hit. He wants to come back to Melb (he got stuck in Perth) but doesnt know when he can. I know he wants to, but his band is in Perth and its easier to do shows from there and hes got family there. Covid/border situations don’t make it easy rn. He was meant to come to Melb a couple times this year, but borders closed/lockdowns and he couldnt.

I can’t stop thinking about how initially he wanted to see me. “We don’t have to catch up, but I would love to see you x” That was before that show got locked in (and I know that’s the truth, I work with his band)

It got very intense and sexual last year, he didnt even start it for the first few months, it felt respectful. But I was still holding back going too deep talking. It came to a tipping point in Jan where I questioned his intentions, but I honestly thought I revealed feelings at that point. I thought he might run. Or if he had a bad response, I was gonna end it there.

He ended up going “You have to talk to me more!” I said “Woah ok, I thought it was just sex? But I can talk more” Since he knew I was going thru shit too (separate to covid) he said stuff like “Are you ACTUALLY doing ok?” “Were you crying this morning?” He seemed genuinely concerned.

Saying shit like “I feel like this has brought us closer” (what does that even mean if you don’t want anything?)

“I think you’re wonderful, I obviously wasn’t treating you amazingly”

Why is he pushing to connect so much, finding all these things in common, telling me when he’s sad too. He compliments me like crazy, which has been consistent the whole time. I moved into my own place this year and he was like “Do you like it or is it lonely” You don’t get to ask me if I’m lonely if you don’t really want anything😭

But then...he tells me this

“I just downloaded Bumble!!No matches and it’s hitting me in the feels hahahaWho knew it could hurt your feelings 😂😂”

The wishful thinker in me was thinking maybe he’s saying he doesn’t want to date cause he’s thinking of me instead. I doubt it. Otherwise he would have said it.

I just said, “haha really, I kinda hate the apps”

Then a bit later “I would swipe you”

He goes “Haha that’s so cute of you to say!!”

That doesn’t sound like a good response, and I shouldn’t have even boosted him like that??

These interests are things that help me feel like myself. There’s a reason I was guarding them last year, I wasn’t sure what he wanted anything more. This year I thought it was safe to let my walls down. Now I associate these things with him, which I was trying to avoid.

You can’t get the emotional stuff from me without the strings. Why do they do that :(

If he wants to bond over common interests, he can stick to his friends he’s not sexual with.

I know this doesn’t make sense, cause of course we are allowed to see other people if we can’t be there in person. But why tell me like that? It’s given we can be dating, but is that weird? It feels like he’s setting some kind of standard to make sure it's not gonna be anything with us and it’s really upset me now.

I need to let go of this. I just feel fucking stupid for thinking we were connecting, for thinking something might be building.

I really wanted to have the next conversation in person, cause you cant REALLY tell over text anyway. I want to know what Im like too in person.

I told her that I dont want her to convert for me because she felt overwhelmed in my community so that makes me feel insecure that she does not really want to do it for herself. She is fine the way she is so why should she change for a man.

We have been on the phone for 2-3 afterwards and actually talked a bit about the torah etc. and I noticed she has been studying a lot and I told her that I want to see her again and hope she feels the same about me. She said yes, but we should take it slowly and I agreed. Then 2 days later she suddenly texted that it is best to not be in contact because she feels that I am not ready to overcome the obstacles we had and invest in what it needs in order to make it work this time. She wants real commitment and not something in between and said that I should be with a Jewish woman. Then she deleted my contact, deleted me as a friend on Facebook and Instagram and I blocked her afterwards.

I blocked her because it has been an up and down between the two of us. She left me alone when I had a mental health crisis (paranoid behaviour), then she moved countries to start med school and quit med school and I did not want to support her because 6 years is too long to wait for her to finished, then she moved back to the USA and now lives in a different country again which is a bit unstable to me. She broke up with me like 3 times. She always came running back to me. The second time we got back together I cheated on her (talking/texting with other women). I really really loved her the first time we got to know each other. I really did. But now it seems like there are too many obstacles.

I’m in a reversed situation. A guy and I went on a couple of dates. The chemistry was good, but confusing, and I wasn’t quite sure about him. I was also seeing another person who assaulted me, and I just needed a break in general.

I told the guy with confusing chemistry that I didn’t think he and I would be a good match and wished him well. He was kind and said the same to me.

Fast forward about 2 months later, and I was in a different headspace. I had started dating again, but none of those were a great fit. Then the “confusing chemistry” guy texts me out of nowhere to ask how I am doing.

We had a nice chat and I asked him if he wanted to go on a date. He said yes. It was a nice date.

Same confusing chemistry. He’s nice, but there are a couple of things that don’t click. I’ve decided that I want to give it a little time to see if the confusion clears up.

Our careers, our values, our political stances, we are even practically neighbors. 

We met once and had a great time, but he always took forever to answer my texts. He did say that he sucks at texting and asked to meet again. We met once more and had a great time, but then he never texted and neither did I. That was a month ago. 

I’ve met other people since, but they are very different from me and I don’t see it going anywhere with them. Going out with them made me think about him and wondering what happened. 

Here are the facts:

- we went walking both times. We met during the day the first time and it made sense. The second time, however, was a cold night and we could’ve gone for a drink but we didn’t (he suggested walking). 

- the second time we met I had just gotten back from a run. I was about 10-15min late and I did apologize for it. I was also a bit tired, so I was probably a less delightful company than my normal self. 

- he never made a move on me. In fact, we never discussed what we were looking for or said anything about relationships. That may be a bad thing, but it might also be a good thing because we were so busy talking about everything we have in common. 

- he walked me to my apartment both times and I never asked him to come hang out. 

- the second time, he asked me what I was doing that weekend and I said a bunch of half-baked sentences because I was so tired. This makes me think he probably thinks I was trying to fake having a plan to get out of hanging out with him. 

- I’ve recently learned that I don’t properly communicate when I’m interested in someone. People I genuinely like told me they thought I was uninterested. 

- bumble still shows his distance from me. Does that mean that he’s still swiping?

We hit it off, I feel comfortable talking to him, we agree on several fundamental issues, and I have slowly begun developing feelings for him. We texted for two weeks before meeting, kissed on the 3rd date, slept together on the 5th. In total it’s almost been two months. There have been three dates where we have slept together. However, he has expressed that he “doesn’t want everything to be about sex” two days out of the three we’ve slept together. When we have slept together, it was fun, intimate and passionate. I personally have not dated or slept with anyone in years. I’m exceptionally picky and felt lucky to find a guy like him in this crazy dating world. 

He’s implied that this has something to do with previous relationships. On our last date he dropped me off at my place. We were mid conversation about a different topic but he parked, and immediately stated, “I’m not coming in tonight. I don’t want you to think that I’m going to have sex with you after every date.” I didn’t even have a chance to invite him in before he rejected me. 

I left feeling really conflicted. On one hand, what woman wants a man who’s obsessed with sex and pressures their partner all the time? On the other, I felt insulted for several reasons. One, that he feels I’m incapable of being in a private setting without trying to seduce him, another, that sex is all I want. We spend hours together doing various activities talking, getting to know each other and finding common interests. For me, sex is deeply personal and intimate. Why limit something that is fun? If it feels right why do we have to be mindful of how often we’re having it? To me a relationship purely about sex happens when people are only hooking up and nothing else. Late night booty calls, no sleeping over, no spending quality time together sharing personal information. We aren’t doing that. But he made me feel like some psycho nymphomaniac.

We aren’t even in an official relationship and now I feel insecure about initiating any sort of intimacy in fear that it’s going to be too much for him. Am I grotesquely overthinking this and should enjoy a man who is seeking something deeper than sex?

I am 22 from France! 

Quick question here, i would like to know if something like this has ever work for any of you.
Have you ever asked a girl out but didn't '' built up '' to it beforehand? 

I ask this because i am in a situation where i feel like something like this could work. 

Usually regarding dating i'm a pretty slow guy, i like to get to know the person before asking her out. But here i am on a university campus and there's this girl that i always found cute but we didn't talk or spend much time together (and we still don't actually). But last Friday we were at a party together and we talked a bit and i felt like maybe she was waiting for me to make a move but like i'm not sure... Around all that i learned that she recently got dumped and it was a bit difficult for her. 

My thought was that maybe she wants a rebound guy and i am totally down to be that guy, but i am not emotionally invested enough to text her and put in the effort to get to know her better... 
So i am wandering if maybe i should just out of nowhere ask her out and see where it goes? 


What do you think people i'll be very interessed in having your opinions on that matter. Because I feel like i always put to much efforts in my relationships and i have difficulties to just live in the moment and enjoy certain situations regardless of the consequences!

I dont mean that you need to buy her everything, text her everyday etc. Just keep things casual, dont show women TOO much interest or else they will feel creeped out and just be nice. Respect her boundaries, show interest when she's trying to show you something.
You ask her out, she says ok, few days later she says she cant go because some shit happened who cares. Dont stress but also DONT try to set up another date already. It sounds needy. Instead, tell her that its fine, and to hit you up if she ever wants to go out some other time. This will make her feel like you arent desesperate, and if she really wants to go out with you, she will set a date.
Do not crack jokes which can be offensive before you and her are VERY confortable with each other. Jokes about racism, politics, body image, religion, you get it right? On the first dates you must be very careful not to offend her in anyway, she's just getting to know you and will have no issues leaving you if she feels unconfortable.
Dont force yourself to pay the bill... if you take her out, offer to pay, but if she insists on paying her meal, dont try to change her mind. Let her do it. Some women dont like when men force them to accept it. It can be seen as bossy, as if you are her owner. Some of them dont like it aswell because some men use it later to demand things, such as a kiss or a sexual favour for paying dinner...

We broke up 2 years ago and got back together after 10 months. Our relationship before the breakup was toxic, I must admit. In the first 2 years of our relationship he was really caring and kind to me, but after that it kind of went problematic. Whenever I bring up something that bothers me (jealousy, communication, time), he brushes it off, we fight, he gets mad, I apologize. I’d like to add that whenever we’re not in good terms and he knows it’s his fault, he never apologizes to me in person, only through chat. One of the reasons why we broke up is because of time and that I felt he was becoming distant. When I asked him if maybe we could bond more and spend a little more time together, he wasn’t having it. He got pissed at me, I apologized, we fought, then he broke up with me. (No, he didn’t have a side chick nor did he cheat on me) Few days and weeks after the breakup I tried patching things up, but all he could say was “Sorry”. And so I gave up from trying to get us back together. 

Like I said, we got back together. He apologized and promised not to cause me pain again. He tried to pursue me for 2 months, of course I gave in. I could say that right now, he’s really trying his best to change for the better. Whenever we get a misunderstanding, he pauses, apologizes to me, and tries to reflect on what wrong he did. He’d ask me what should he avoid doing, or what I expect more of him to do. He was really trying. And up until now, he still is. The problem right now is I can’t move on from his past mistakes. I’d always get flashbacks to when he got mad at me when I got jealous, or that time when he told me I was being too sensitive, that time when he blamed me for his mistakes, everything. I can see he’s trying, but I just can’t seem to move on from the past pain I went through. We’ve talked about it multiple times and he has apologized for the past mistakes that he did, I forgave him but I couldn’t really forget all the pain I went through.

I love him so much, I really do. I just find it really difficult to move on from the past. He’s trying his best to be better, and I’m trying my best too. But recently we’ve been fighting about the things that we’d already talked about. I told him not to do this, because it triggers me, then he does it but it’s not really on purpose. He apologizes and tries to make it up to me. And now we just had a misunderstanding, he did apologize, but it’s getting tiring now.

I (22F) started talking to this guy on Tinder back in late 2018. We never met up irl, but we were really hitting it off and kept meaning to go on a real date, it just never happened. A few months into our little pen-pal type relationship, he was deployed suddenly to another country. I lost contact with him and didn’t know what happened for months, until he was back in town for a week or so and I found him again on Tinder.

We started talking again, with his new number for the country he was in, and it was nice bc it was flirty but we would also still discuss our dating lives outside of each other being as we were on separate continents and knew nothing could happen at least at the moment.

December of 2019 he told me he was going to be back in town in a few months, and asked me “what would happen” if we met up. At the time I was really fragile recovering from being sexually assaulted earlier that year, and I panicked and believed he was only implying we would sleep together if we met up. I flipped out on him and he of course got defensive, and we stopped talking.

Sometime last year I was trying to work on getting closure or apologizing with people from the past. I decided to text him apologizing for how I flipped out, and I explained briefly my situation. He said he didn’t even remember I had acted that way, and we started talking again for a little bit. He told me he was being sent to a different country soon, and we again lost contact. 

I’ve been struggling a lot with dating (as usual with me) and tonight he suddenly just popped in my mind. And god I’m really sad that we lost contact, and I have no way of contacting him again.

Okay but aside from that ^, what is the best way to ask someone you love out? I’ve been loving that person since elementary. If they reject me, I’ll probably lose motive to love again and just start a casual poly/open relationship.

I’m academically %1 in my state, straight A student, I’m motivated to be successful so I can provide for my love in the future. I was a failure back in middle school but after becoming friends with my love (it’s more than a crush, therefore I say my love), we got to know each other and I found out they loved hard workers, etc. 

We separated before 9th grade since we had a fight—physical fight, I felt sad alright and I thought this way, being successful, I'd be able to earn our friendship back. Of course not just with success but communication too eventually.

I'll try to keep it brief... but I'll probably fail.  
I matched with a girl on a dating App over a month ago..  
I sent her one message, she replied and then so did I. Then nothing.  


So a few days later I sent her a swing for the fence message of “do you want to meet?”. Surprisingly  replied saying she didn't know a lot about me but wanted to swap numbers to chat.  


We seemed to hit it off, over WhatsApp, quite quickly. We sent probably 100s of messages to each other every day. She's also sent me lots of videos of her dog Monty, or her parents house or her mum with her dog.  
So after about a 1.5 weeks we arranged to meet for a meal. I sent her a message in the morning to check we were still meeting later and if not giving her an easy out if not. She didn't reply (although she had to the message 10 minutes before that one).  
About 2 hours before we were meant to meet I asked her again and she said that she'd thought she'd replied, that she'd had a difficult day in work and wanted to rearrange.  


I gotta be honest I was frustrated and annoyed, but I lied and said I understood. I'd actually put down a £10 deposit for the table (granted she didn't know about that) and generally this felt like very late notice and so it all kinda sounded like bullshit due to the time delay.   
But the biggest frustration, by far, was that I didn't get to spend time with her as she had come across as really lovely women with very similar interests. She's also gorgeous and very funny, but I'm most attracted to her personality/brain more.  
Nb. In her defence I literally did the same thing to an old work colleague the other day i.e. thought I'd replied, but hadn't. You live and you learn.  


We sent a few messages to each other later in the evening. She explained that she was struggling to get her washing machine fixed and then her dog had tore up a cushion. I did express concern, but equally she seemed to be dancing around rearranging the date.   
So the next morning I sent her a bit of a shitty message (not my finest hour) basically explaining how I felt and did she want to rearrange or not?  


She, understandably, sent me a shitty message back explaining her side, and saying that today she'd additionally had an argument with her boss in work and had been sent home. She basically, and correctly, said I hadn't shown much empathy with her situation and just focussed on rearranging the date.  
I sent her a message back saying that I was emotionally vulnerable and didn't deal with it very well, that I apologise unreservedly for my lack of empathy and that I should've done much better. Also, if I in any way contributed to her argument with her management that I was really sorry.  


She said that it deserved a response, but was too busy right now. But she replied the next day.  
She then opened up to me (a lot) about her work situation and then we gradually moved on to messaging each other like before. The videos of her dog resumed too. He's a cutie.  


Then one Friday a week ago we were talking and she said she'd scratched her chin on a Christmas box.   
I said I'm sure it's not as bad as you fear, but I think she was concerned by how she'd look when we eventually met as we'd already agreed to do so (she did say later on, prior to us meeting say: “I hope I'm not a catfish”.). Cue complete radio silence.  
I sent her a message Saturday afternoon simply asking if she'd received my message? From my perspective it was really weird to go from hundreds of messages a day to none so quickly. No reply.  
Sunday night I asked if she was ok and if I should be concerned? She replied saying that she'd had “a blip” and was staying with her parents (who live quite close. She lives alone).  


I didn't pry for further information, I said it was fine (it very much was this time), that I was glad she was ok and we continued to chat like before.  


We finally arranged to meet for cocktails last Friday. Her response to us meeting was: “Yes please”.  
We live in the same place so she asked what train I was catching into the city nearby so we could get the same one.  
The evening went really well (even though she openly admitted to being nervous). We talked as easily as when we messaged. About the big, small and inconsequential stuff.  
Even though she said she had to go home early to her young dog, who goes a bit crazy in her absence, we still had 7 cocktails each (she led the way, even thought she'd previously said she wasn't a big drinker) and spoke pretty no stop for 3.5 hours. She said stuff like “my parents should adopt you”, that they hoped I wasn't a Torrie (I'm not), she asked to see photos of my nephew, she let me touch her hair to understand the texture and hold her foot to look at her boot. We laughed at each other and together. She talked to me about her friend's partners/husbands, which ones she liked and why.  
She did also mention that her friends thought that it was odd that at my age (35) I didn't have any kids or never been married, which I haven't.  


Anyway, she said she had to get home but asked me if I wanted to go get some takeaway food? I paid for us both and she said: “We're going there already are we?”. We also shared a taxi home and while we waited she said, while eating her chicken, “One for the wank bank?” as I was watching her eat because I was holding her drink and the rest of her food, so couldn't eat my own.  
Prior to catching the taxi, but a while after she'd finished eating, I asked if I could kiss her and she said “I'm not there yet”, but said I could kiss her on the cheek instead. Early, during drinks she didn't want to share her drink as she's a germaphobe so it all seemed to make sense (maybe even kissing her on the cheek was a big step?).  


I got dropped off first, understandably so, even though I live further away (even though she's sent my a photo of her house number and also told me her estate). Her last few words were something like “I'll send you videos of Monty and let's speak soon”.  


The next morning (Saturday) I sent her a message: I had a great time with you last night. I hope that we can do something again soon?  
Radio silence again.  


I sent her a long message Sunday afternoon, whereby I definitely over shared, but essentially asking her to let me know where she stands? Yes, her lack of response probably tells me already, but she'd also previously gone radio silent in the past and eventually got back to me.... but in a shorter timeframe.  
Still no reply.  


I sent another a brief message Sunday night just asking for her to tell me so was ok as the last time I'd heard from her she was in a random taxi. She replied back saying: “Sorry, I'm ok. Just a bit overwhelmed”.  


I backed off.  
I did send her another brief message Monday night apologising for oversharing and probably making her uncomfortable.  
She replied: I just need to take time to read it all over fully.  


It's now Friday morning and I've not heard from her. To clarify I've not messaged her since Monday.  
That's fine (again truthfully) she can take as long as she needs, but I'll be honest (I am that, probably sometimes to my detriment) and say that it's not a happy place to currently be in.   
I wonder whether with her work problems (she's still not gone back to work), her family troubles (her uncle died 2 months ago), her germaphobia, mixed with the ongoing pandemic, that she's just overloaded and I'm not helping?  


Additionally, due to her problems, I was paying her a lot of compliments to hopefully make her feel better. I do think she is beautiful, but maybe I freaked her out by how much I did it? She has in the past had men who came on too strong (obviously I'm now guilty of this too :( )  
Also, she said that she had been nice to guys in the past and it's got her in trouble because they thinking she's flirting. Could that be this situation too? It certainly seems like flirting based on the the quotes I've shared above? But maybe, since meeting in person, she's had a change of heart?  


The obvious answer is if she wants to get back in touch, she will, but it's the waiting that hurts.  
I have started talking to other women and arranging dates with them, I'm exercising more to clear my head (doesn't really work), but this girl seems to have crawled into my brain and won't leave.  


Yeah, it's all very, very early days, she doesn't owe me an explanation (I agree), but I feel I do deserve a response about meeting again after speaking for so long. I was brave to ask so surely it's not to much for her to be brave in answering? If I get an answer I can move on or not a lot easier.  


Also, yes at some points I've been a dick, but equally she's gone radio silent at some points and that's not ideal either. I think neither of us is coming out of this situation with much glory, maybe other than her being REALY patient with me. Maybe I should do the very same for her in return?I suppose it's the least I could do.  


Thoughts?  
(apologises for the length, but it was good to get it off my chest)

I feel for men that dating someone that was raised in a lower/even socioeconomic category is seen as an easy situation.

For men dating into higher classes than they were raised seems much more difficult. Feelings of inadequacy tend to creep in.

My story, I was raised lower-middle class. We had enough to get by but nothing fancy or extravagant. At one point I was dating an heiress, everything that she was used to was new to me and way out of my price range. 

Fast forward a few years, I’m back in the dating pool and “my type” that I keep matching and meeting up with seem to have a much more privileged upbringing. In the short term it’s fine but I know deep down that I would not be able live/give the lifestyle they’re used to.

When we were sexually exclusive he exhibited some behaviors that were questionable which I’m now wondering if I stupidly looked past them. His hinge location was changing, and he tried meeting up with a co-worker of mine after we agreed to be exclusive ( sexually). 

It does not matter because herpes is very complex but I have been with less than 5 people but you can get it through simply sharing a drink. Anyway, my appt has been made.

My attention was disconnected from myself and anxiously focused on her. Trying to analyze her. Read her. Be approved of by her.

Constant overthinking and not enough feeling.

So I started practicing going on first dates and just paying attention to the energy and sensations of my body.

The subtle signs from my body that say ""yes this person""

Signs such as...

Rising sexual energy from the base of my spine.

The faster beating of my heart when we make eye contact that's a second longer than usual.

The warm, fuzzing sensation in my chest when she laughs.

Weirdly, I realized that most of the women I was going on dates with I wasn't actually attracted to. I just wanted their approval.

My head, with all its insecurities and fears, was in charge. 

Not my body.

So I vowed to stop pursuing women if I didn't feel this body centred attraction. 

I let my body tell me if I truly desired this woman or not and allowed my head to take a backseat.

And honestly this was the catalyst for the biggest change in my dating life.

Over the following 6 months afterwards I experienced...

Tears.
Belly laughs.
Soul piercing eye contact.
Some of the best sex of my life.
Powerful and deep emotional connection.

All on first dates.

I honestly never believed this kind of thing was possible previously.

And most of the time neither did she.

""How is this possible?"" ... one beautiful Chilean woman said as she lay with her head on my chest drawing letters on my skin with her fingers.

Yet there it was.

And it came from something so simple.

Letting my body lead. Letting my mind go.

And being present with both her AND myself.

I matched with this girl and I really really like her but she is very promiscuous and I want to be in a monogamous relationship with her; we met and had an amazing time, we watched movies, cuddled, had sex and pillow talked for hours and made each other laugh all night.

My problem is that after this meet up I feel like she's grown more distant, we talked for hours and hours every day but now she's stopped texting as frequently or as in depth.

Even worse I noticed today that she had added something new to her bio, meaning she is still using the app. 

I really like this girl and I want her and I to be exclusive, can someone reassure me and tell me I'm crazy or something? I want to let her know that I want to see her and only her, but I don't want to be too pushy and seem too needy.

I’ve been told im toxic and negative while I’m hitting rockbottom. Also while i was venting, my past relationship and my behaviour in that relationship was brought up. Can’t help but feel neglected 

I’ll run through what happened in the past 2 days. Yesterday my long distance BF and I were watching a tv show together, and maybe because of some network glitch the screen went off and he left. I get a text that says, ‘I’ll be back in 10’. He didn’t tell me where he’s going and for what and I didn’t pay much attention to it and instead i started watching the some other show. He came back in 10mins, and he came back while i was watching the tv show and warming up my food as it was dinner time. I asked him where he went, he told me he went to smoke. And i was like what? Not that I didn’t hear him but i was like you just leave like this? That too for a smoke. Yes i do have problems with him smoking, i too smoke but very occasionally. I tell him smoke once in a while not everyday that too 5 cigs a day! And he’ll tell me to look at his friends who smoke almost or maybe more than a pack a day. I was stunned last night like how can you just go like this and not say anything? I called him twice during the time he left but he didn’t pick up neither did he say what he was doing. I kinda got a bit angry on him and told him why would he go for a smoke so abruptly? That too without even telling me anything? Because this has happened before that he’s gone for a smoke with his friends and he’ll tell me he’ll smoke and come and I’ll be chilling there. Like that’s okay but it came as a shock to me because it was all so sudden and i lost it when i kept asking him why would he go like this and not tell me, his response to that was, ‘i told you what i had to, believe me if you want to!’ And that’s it. I lost it! Firstly because if I’m asking you something multiple times i deserve an answer and not just being left in the wild. Secondly, I don’t like the laid back attitude which he knows, like just help me out. Your one sentence isn’t gonna be believable no matter how many times you chose to tell me! So all that happened and i shouted and he despises that and i get it that he doesn’t like me shouting at him. But that entire call he kept telling me to calm down and talk with some respect! Yes i agree i let anger get the best of me but all my point is, if i have a problem or a doubt help me out instead of leaving me in the wild to deal with it! That’s all I expected. 
After that as it was dinner time, i wanted to eat because i was looking forward to my dinner last night and i told him to give me 15mins so that i could eat and it took me way more than 15mins! I took almost 45mins and he slept in that time and I didn’t update him that it’ll take me longer. He kept telling me why would you do something that you despise off, that’s hypocrisy. I swear my intention wasn’t to get back at him but i lost track of time and then my mum asked me to help her around the house. But he told me its my ego and I’m getting back at him, even if i did the same shit like him he’s calm and i shouted at him earlier. So he told me he thought about all of this and he wants to take the relationship slow, this slow and casual thing we’ve done multiple times till a point where we shout and breakdown and are on the verge of breaking up and then we’ll decide to work on it. I don’t want to fall in that loop over and over again! Btw we had a big fight 5-6 days ago a pretty big one tbh and since then i know he’s changed but last night when he was i feel acting like what he used to do before and i told him he’s not changed and he’s just the same narcissistic and egoistic person that he was. He was hurt and i did apologise and i did realise my mistake after a while. But last night we end that fight resolve it and go to sleep and dismiss the ‘taking it slow part’ 

Last night when we were talking i spoke to him about what i was feeling and how unmotivated i felt, how pathetic i was feeling because i never got any work done, i couldn’t work on myself for some reason, can’t focus on school and on myself or anything! Its like right now I’m in a puddle and I can see no way out. He told me to rest and take like slow and just chill for a while and everything shall fall into place. It was a mellow conversation and i liked it tbh. We ended that call with more of love and less of fight and disagreements and we also spoke about a few problems we had. It was overall good. 

And today, I didn’t have a best day! I spoke to him about the mess of today and then he was like he’ll go work and he leaves. I was like okay I’ll finish my stuff. But after a while i text him, that I’m not being completely vulnerable with you because i fear that my problems will be ignored, its roots from a childhood trauma and also because in this relationship I’ve lied to him several times and he’s lost all trust in me but he still was trying to make it work but he couldn’t resolve me problems and this went on for like 3 months and none of my problems were resolved. He called me immediately when i told him I’m not vulnerable with him and maybe he hoped he could talk me through it but i told him i need some time. I go do my stuff for a while, shower and eat and then call him. I call him and he says i called him for 5 seconds honestly I don’t even remember if it was 5 or 10. He text me before i called him how i was feeling and i thought I’ll talk to him on call. He didn’t pick because he was cooking. But i think while he was doing that he was texting me all i told him instead of texting me emojis could you not have called? He told me to stop nitpick everything he does and not get annoyed for everything. All I expected was a call back since at this point reaching out to anyone is a big thing for me and he’s been in my shoes and i expect him to understand where i come from. I asked him what was your moto behind telling me to that I called for 5secs? He told me I’m being very negative and toxic and he doesn’t want this in his life as he wants to focus on his career. I do get that, I’ve started offline school after almost 2 years and its a lot for me too and i too wanna focus on it!  But I don’t see me doing anything about it instead of being in a constant low energy and low motivation phase. Even today he told me he wants to take this slow. I feel I’m in a middle of a breakdown. And if he is expecting me to be calm and talk to me then I don’t think I’m so strong to control my emotions and talk? I don’t and I can’t trust me! I for once want some to just be there so i can talk my head out and be done with it and not keep this all to myself! Right now he’s ghosting me because im toxic or negative i dont know man! But all i think right now is my fear of not being heard just came back to life and I’m going back into my shell! 

Update: I couldn’t talk to him about my problems because i was trying to talk to him about what happened earlier today. I lost what my problem was, but as soon as i could pick something up about what i want, he brought up the fuck up i said in the previous conversation (the one that happened earlier today) and he brought my past relationship up started saying weren’t you like this in your past relationship? That too when I’m trying to talk to him about my problems! I can’t help but feel he’s neglecting me. What am i doing wrong? Do i not deserve some time where i can just vent and not be told about what i did wrong?

Me(M/26) her(F/26)
I’m high af emotional and just woke up so my grammar will not be on point &amp;’ it may seem a bit disorganized but bear with me.
First let me say I’m in love y’all, like deeply in love. I’ve loved before &amp;’ thought I’ve been in love before but never like this at all. 
We’ve been in what ever this situation were in is called for a few years now things were good but recently things have changed our intimacy is low &amp;’ sex is basically out the question. I’ve also been noticing more signs that she’s probably feeling someone else which shouldn’t be a problem because we’re not really together but it is. I’ve tried talking to her about things a few times even tried to end things all together twice but that obviously didn’t work either. She doesn’t want a relationship right now but also wants a need me in her life (her words). I do want a relationship &amp;’ feel the same about wanting her in my life but this friend position really just been breaking me down slowly. 
When I think of her she’s everything I look for in a partner with the looks to match when things were going well I felt like the richest man on the planet. 
We always have each other back there is no tit for tat she actually feel I do more for her than she do for me, I feel like she dose plenty already. We have deep insightful conversation even on bad days just seeing her n hanging out makes me forget anything was ever wrong I truly feel she is my life partner but I also believe a relationship between us just is not in the cards for me.
Idk what to do my natural instinct is to just end it get over her &amp;’ move on but knowing she doesn’t want to lose me as a friend &amp;’ hearing how she feels about me makes me not want to just abandon her. I feel selfish.

Guys list off their attractive qualities like a resume:

They’re tall, they work out, they make a six figure salary, they say all of their female friends wonder why they’re still single, etc. They wonder the same thing themselves. They don’t have trouble meeting women, but none of them want to stick around, and they’re often befuddled by this.

It’s because attraction isn’t based solely on having superficial qualities based on what society are desirable. Attraction is not a checklist, nor is it a points based system.

The Nice Guy believes that if he buys a woman a nice dinner, opens doors, treats her a certain way, that in return she will fall for him. False.

The same concept applies here. If you are boring, too available, too nice, you don’t have your own hobbies, you are too formal, having superficial attractive qualities will only sustain you for so long.

For instance, if you have a large circle of single female friends who tell you what a catch you are, but none of them want to date you themselves, then that is in indication that you are too subscribed to the “I’m a catch mentality”. Here are some things to keep in mind:

There is a difference in believing you are a catch on a superficial level and that you a prize on a deeper level. When you feel like you’ve marked the checkboxes-good looks, money, etc-this is the false belief of “being a catch” you should avoid. That is simply a crutch for your ego. When you truly believe that you’re a prize, you believe you are interesting, unique, independent, that you offer something that most people can’t, aside from just looks or money.

You’re likely too nice/boring. This doesn’t mean you have to be an asshole, but you likely have a false White Night mentality, that since you’re this great handsome guy, you have to be overly polite, agreeable, and put the woman in your life on a pedestal.

You might be getting false feedback, or have a false self-perception of your looks. You might not be as physically attractive as you think you are. Sometimes when people encounter rejection, they inflate their self image as a defense mechanism. You have to take an honest look at yourself and your deficiencies, and work to develop those areas.

You are too available. This doesn’t mean you should be deceptive and withdraw yourself, but if you are a dynamic person, you should be busy and not readily available at the drop of a hat. If you are being active, working on your career or passion, maintaining your other personal relationships, your time will be limited. It is a turnoff for men and women alike If they person they’re seeing is willing to drop what they’re doing at the drop of a hat every single time to see them. A little bit of mystery and limited access is attractive.

Be interesting, be ballsy, be independent, be busy. Have some whimsy and some edge. Don’t assume that a woman should be happy to be with you just because of a few superficial qualities—you have to have depth.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1134887,public,self,"Men’s advice.

With this most recent one, it was 5 dates within 3 month period.  We didn't see other often due to her busy schedule (she was taking classes for a MBA part time) and my constant traveling.  Whenever we did date we always went somewhere exciting from fancy restaurants to art shows to halloween parties to Christmas lights exhibit.  

After each date there will be an increase of physical intimacy but we never got to sex.

* date 3 longer makeout in her apt's vestibule
* date 4 longer makeout at my place 
* date 5 cuddling at my place on the couch and undressing her from the top

The only thing that was off about our relationship is we didn't text much or get on calls.  Most of our texts were to the point of setting the next date.
