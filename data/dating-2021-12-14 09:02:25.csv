2,rg9nyu,1639494995,Men’s advice. Men who are unsuccessful with women share one characteristic: they make excuses,"Men who struggle with women almost always have a mindset of self-victimization. They believe that their unattractive qualities are static, and that women are a monolithic group that have somehow deemed them unworthy. 

When I was unsuccessful, I had the same mindset as well. It wasn’t until I took ownership of my situation, and realized that there were things about myself that I needed to change, that things began improving. It’s uncomfortable, but it’s also freeing. You realize you have control over most aspects of your life. 

- “I’m ugly.” There is a difference between being physically attractive and naturally good looking. Being physically attractive involves being in shape, wearing clothes that fit, having good posture and body language, being well groomed. Being physically attractive, which you have control over, is more important than being naturally good looking.

- “I’m short.” There are some women who put emphasis on height, and there’s nothing you can do about that. Move on. You see short guys with beautiful women all the time. The height requirement is usually a fabrication of the online dating world. A gregarious personality and confidence is far more powerful than height. 

- “I’m shy.” This isn’t a static quality. Being introverted and shy aren’t one in the same. It’s extremely uncomfortable, but you have to ask yourself if you really want to change. Being shy is the single biggest inhibitor to social success. If you can’t function socially, you should pursue therapy, or even medication if a mental health professional feels it’s necessary.

-“I’m boring.” This is on you. You likely aren’t boring, you are just afraid to be vulnerable and show people who you are. This is normal; it’s difficult to share ourselves with others, and face rejection.  If you do",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rg9nyu/mens_advice_men_who_are_unsuccessful_with_women/
3,rg9opk,1639495056,Should I go on a date with an acquaintance of my ex ?,"Hi, 
I (f,24) am out of 4 year old relationships. This has been a very serious ones, we were engaged and publicly very official. 

So first years of relationships with my ex, he was in the university for some program and had a group of classmate with whom he’d hang out, around 15 people. He wasn’t close with everyone but there were sometimes big gatherings where everyone would come and spend some time together. 

There was a guy (let’s call him B) with whom my ex was an acquaintance but never friends. We all (my fiancé brought me to the events, as many people would bring there significant other) hang out maybe 4 times. Including once when we went to this (B’s) house for a big barbecue party. Me and him were never flirty, max of what we could do was some friendly small talk, I did kind of like him but I’d never cross the line as I was in relationship. Even for my fiancé it was never more than that, they never hang out one to one.  

He was on my fb page and would like any of  pics I post but many good acquaintances are this way. Then, when we broke up I got on dating apps. Once I saw that this guy was on bumble and that he gave me a like. Then I also was on tinder, saw him and gave him a like too. It was a month ago when we matched. A month after he He messaged me :”Am I wrong or we have met some time before?”. 

I honestly didn’t expect him to message and I decided to go with a joke too. I said: “not sure, but I’m getting a feeling we might have met before” , he’s like : “ abc  bar in xyz location possibly?” I’m like “most likely”. And final was that he’s like “ wanna meet for a drink over the weekend and talk about it?” And we set the meeting. So basically everyone understands everything but it’s all been a joke manner :D 

I’m thinking whether it’s okay to go out with or is it too much including the fact they never were friends and I like him and could give it a chance to talk and see how it goes? I feel that it is. But I mean, I’m also shocked by the guys move as he was also just friendly with me always but would he invite me knowing all prior history if he was like really interested?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rg9opk/should_i_go_on_a_date_with_an_acquaintance_of_my/

33,rgdzj2,1639506902,How can I ask a girl out if I don't know where to find her,"There is a girl in my town that I am interested in so much, I want to ask her out.  
But the problem is that it's hard for me to find a place to meet her (I saw her about a week ago, and I did not have the opportunity to talk to her).  
And I have been struggling to find a way to meet her again.  


What I have is two things:  
\*  I found her on Instagram (By coincidence).  
\*  I know which university she studies in - unfortunately, I don't study there.

What is the best way to reach her out if she doesn't know me?

34,rge0uz,1639506998,What does exactly “something friendly…something casual” mean?,"So, a couple of weeks ago I matched a girl on one of the dating apps. Very quickly we moved from the app to exchanging phone numbers and texting. Sometime during texting she asked me what I was looking for from this and I replied by saying I’m a kind of person who likes to go with the flow. I suggested let’s meet and see where it goes. But  while she agreed to meet she made it clear that she is not looking for anything serious but “something friendly…something casual”. And I was completely ok with this (I completely understand that not everyone on the dating app is looking for a relationship). As I also like to make new friends, we kept texting (mostly goofy memes and gifs nothing flirty or serious). Last Sunday both of us didn’t have any plans so I suggested we can go to watch a movie and maybe grab a drink afterwards (now by this point in time, she was in my buddy zone and I had completely stopped thinking about her as potential date). As planned we went for a movie and a beer afterwards really enjoyed our conversation but in my mind we were just two friends hanging out. 
Meanwhile I had matched with other girl on the same dating app and I was having some sporadic conversations with her. Today I received a message from the first girl saying she just realized she and one of her friends were dating a same guy. Now as any normal friend would do I laughed at her message (now in retrospect maybe insensitive). Then after entire day of silence I received a message something on the lines of how dare I date her and her friend (the other girl I matched, who I haven’t even met yet)simultaneously and laugh about it to her face. So, now I was super confused about who misread this entire situation is my interpretation of “something friendly and casual” was wrong? Or somehow I lead her to believe that I was still interested in formal exclusive dating? If former is the case I would most certainly like to not repeat the mistake again if later is the case I would like to apologize (although I am blocked now so not sure how to do it).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rge0uz/what_does_exactly_something_friendlysomething/

Now when we’re at his place we usually have lunch and spend 3/4 hours together. I don’t mind having sex at all but sometimes we just do it and then an hour later he wants a blowjob. Most of the time I do it even if I’m not really in the mood but the last couple times I told him I didn’t want to and thought it was fine. I don’t mind doing it that much but I don’t wanna spend all the time having sex and doing stuff, I also just want to spend time with him just talking and doing other things. Today it happened again and when I was reluctant to do it he said something along the lines of me not having enough hormones, which I did find kind of offensive, and he said we’re 18 not 70. When he realized I was offended he apologised for the hormone comment but still kept saying that I was acting like we’re 70 and not 18, and just the way he worded it sounded like there’s something wrong with me and all people do it like he says. I just want to know if I’m crazy or it’s reasonable? I just feel like shit because I’m a people pleaser and always do things to please other people but this is making me feel like I’m not enough.

46,rgfaak,1639510410,Guys and Sexpectations,"Hello everyone, I have a dating question I’m a little confused about. 

So, recently I’ve been back in the dating world (F-27) and I’ve been on a few dates. Some bad, some good. However, on the dates that I do like, I’ve noticed that men seem disappointed that I don’t put out on the first date.

I like to wait a few dates before sex, even if I’ve invited them over to hangout. For me personally, I have to have a connection with a person and feel comfortable with them. Which I can not achieve on just one date. 

For example, I had a date over the other day and we spent several hours picking each others brains and before he left we made-out. I did let him touch my chest and I think he took that as me wanting sex (he put his hand between my legs) and I said I’d like to wait a few more dates before we go there. He seemed frustrated and awkwardly left. I’ve noticed this with a few other guys. It’s like they automatically lose interest.

I felt bad as if I wasted his time or something but I did mention earlier that day I prefer to wait a few dates. 

Anywho, am I wrong that I like to wait and would prefer just basic intimacy on a first date and build up to going all the way?  

I feel so pressured for immediate sex these days, like people don’t know what to do with each other if they’re not having sex.

He's my work bestie's brother and he started working here a few weeks after I did. We talk every day after work and turns out we have similar interests! (Nerdy things) We talk about these things all the time and we joke around a lot. There's been a couple instances where I thought he might be flirting or maybe he's interested.

1. After school one day, we walked out together and I told him I park in the same spot every morning. He jokingly told me he'd remember so that he can steal it from me one morning. (This one is a stretch, I know)
2. He was going to an event one weekend with his sister and she invited me to tag along. I couldn't go and later found out that my friends went to the same event. I told him about this and he said ""See?! You should have come with us!"" (Also a stretch)
3. We were hanging out and talking in the hallway with his sister. We were all dressed in movie character outfits and his sister noticed my nails matched my outfit. She asked ""Did you REALLY get your nails done just to match?"" I told her ""Nooo. I've been wanting to get this color for awhile now and it just worked out this way!"" He says ""That's adorable.""
4. My team and I were discussing Secret Santa because another coworker of ours has him as their Secret Santa assignment and didn't know what to get him. Work bestie (his sister) was listing things off that he likes and I added ""Oh he really likes Spiderman"" and my team lead playfully says ""Oooo so you really know a lot about \*blank\*, huh?"" Later, I give work bestie a car ride home and this comes up in convo. She tells me her family has mentioned the same thing to him at home because we are close in age and have similar interests. We joke around about the fact that we hardly know each other. I blanked when she told me this so I didn't think about asking her what his reaction is.

Sidenote: After reading this back, I'm pretty sure I'm reading too into things. Regardless, any advice for what my next steps should be? Is this too complicated of a situation to even consider anyway? We're coworkers and he's related to my friend who is also a coworker.

And tbh, I’ve never have brought DTR, so I’ll be nervous about bringing up, and hoping he will bring it up before me.

So we meet in August and only had 3 dates which all were amazing, I had sex with him the first but he still acted really into me and was extremely romantic.

Then my dad died and I went through a manic episode and ghosted him because I didn’t want him to see me that way. 

So fast forward last Friday I sent him a long text that I was sorry. He understood and he invited me to a house party. 

He introduced me to his friends as his girlfriend (which was surprising), and the whole night he was saying how he would want me to come back, texting me and thought about me non stop. He was very happy that whole night. He slept over my house and that was that. 

So now last night, he came over, he was smoking a cigarette outside and I was gonna ask him something. I saw he was texting someone on hinge. 

I acted like I didn’t see it. I don’t like it but at the same time there was no DTR, and we just reunited literally 3 days prior. 

 What’s going on - when is it normal to get off the dating apps, I would of thought DTR is way too early but he brought this upon himself.

She didn't give one word answers but went in depth and also laughed a lot at my jokes. My point is that as far as I can tell we get along okay and I think on the off chance if we ever did date we would have a lot to talk about. 

I understand that my infatuation is acting as a blinder after all it's in her contract to be nice. I haven't seen her interact too closely with other customers but she seems very outgoing in general.

I feel really bad about the whole thing, about my role in everything. 

For one I was never really into her the same way she liked me.  She was an attractive woman, but I still wasnt attracted to her, at least not nearly as she acted towards me. 

 I'm really not good about letting someone know that I'm not into them, at least without being rude and hurting them, which I didnt want to do.  And she was really bad at taking hints.  I would take long to respond to texts, try to tell her I was going to be busy, that sort of thing...

But over time things just became more serious on their own, even after telling her that i wanted more time to myself. 

 It got to the point that she basically stayed every night at my house.

Aside from letting things get so out of hand like that,  I was running around with other girls at the beginning of ou relationship.  I did eventually stop and made the decision to be faithful, but she eventually became suspicious because she would go through my phone and must have seen some old texts or something.

I really worry about her though, like whatever happened to her and what's going to happen to her.  I dont know what she ever saw in me, but shes just too nice and I feel like shes going to get hurt again and taken advantage of.  

Honestly as much as I'd like to find someone to be happy with , I hope she finds someone first.

88,rgjhry,1639522022,Hurting and confused,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

So 6 months ago, I broke up with my girlfriend of 6 months, we were really in love but because I felt I wasn't good enough or emotional ready to handle her. She had said she loved me more than anyone, that she'd wait for me, I told her not to wait for me because I don't know how long it would take for me to fix myself. For the next couple of months after break up, she would email me now and then.

A few weeks ago she emails me, saying she is doing a clear out of her clothes, she didn't want to bin my favourite jumper, and said she could send it to me if I gave her my address. But I wanted to see her, so said I'd come get it.  I wanted to tell her that I'm better and I still love her and would love to get back together again.  When I saw her, I was so happy to see her again, we chatted, we had laughs, as if nothing had happened before.  But I saw a polaroid on her tv unit, I couldn't see it properly, I asked who is that, your nephew?  She looked at it for a good minute before she replied and said it was her boyfriend.  I felt a massive sting in me, so I grabbed my jumper and said I was going.

For the next few days, we are messaging each other,  and I decided that I should give her her birthday present and card that I had for her before we broke up (her birthday is in August).   I sent it to her with a letter, explaining that breaking up with her is my biggest regret, and I wish that I never let her go.  But she couldn't read it until after work, so she read the letter and it made her cry, said the card and present were lovely.  She said, she is frustrated that it took me so long to say what she had wanted to hear all this time, she said she had gotten into this relationship still being in love with me but wanted to get over me, and if I had got back to her 3 months ago, she would have been with me again but she is dating this guy and she loves him and wants to see where it goes.  I'm pretty much hurting, cause I was frustrated at myself, and that the girl I've lost more than anything was with someone else, I know this was my own fault.

I said that we should stop messaging as I kept wanting to win her back, and couldn't help but message her. She said she still had feelings for me.... and enjoys talking to me as I'm easy to talk to.

So, on sunday there, I receive a text from her, saying she is hurting, and if I would talk to her as a friend. I ask her what's wrong, I can talk.  I then said, I'll come over to talk, she said I shouldn't, then said it was a mistake for me to message you.  I got to hers, she invited me in, she was crying, she told me her boyfriend broke up with her a few hours ago.  I was sad that she was hurting but deep down I was happy that they broke up. Sorry, not sorry.  She explained what happened, that he couldn't handle her issues, and left her at the door. She had been drinking quite a bit, I did my best to console her, we chatted and watched tv for quite a while, then I said you should get to bed, as it is 4am.  I put her in bed, I lay on the floor next to her bed, just chatting and listening to music, she had sobered up at this time.  After a while, she said I didn't have to sit on the floor, and can get in bed, I replied, that if I did, I wouldn't be able to resist cuddling her. After a few moments, I said fuck it, I might never get to again.  So get in bed and cuddle her, after some singing together, she snuggles up to me and sniffs me, and then goes in to kiss me.  I stop her and asked her what she was doing, I said I can't take advantage of you in this state, it's not that I don't want to kiss you, I REALLY WANT TO KISS YOU SO FUCKING MUCH.  She looked sad then faced the other way, I began to think... what if this is what I needed to do to remind her of us again, so I said out loud, fuck it, turned her face towards me and we kissed passionately for a good while, all of it was rushing back to me, I kissed her on the eyes, the forehead, twiddled our noses like I did when we were together, she was smiling and looking at me like how she did before.  I knew my love for her was definitely real after all this time, she wanted to do more as she tried to put her body underneath me but I don't know why but I stopped her from doing this, I mean I started kissing her but I didn't go in for making love to her... I hesitated and said we shouldn't... so we ended up cuddling and falling asleep.

I wake up early as I have work at 8:30am, slipped out of bed as quietly as possible without waking her, and leave her a text saying I had to leave for work, and that whatever happens after that, I'm happy that I got to spend one last night with her, it was like a christmas miracle. And you know where I am if you need me.  
Later in the day, she replies back.  Saying she is still heartbroken, and wants to get back with him, she loves him, and he had messaged her saying that, he didn't know how to control the situation because of her issues and left but wants to work it out with her.  I say to her, what about what happened last night between us?  She said it was a mistake, and that she shouldn't have led me on, and that she was vulnerable, even though she has feelings for me.... she said she is confused but still wants to be with him.  In my head, I'm thinking, if she really did love him, would you have kissed me and wanted more?!?

I wanted to marry this girl, I wanted a life with her... but now I'm just hurting... so much.  I'm frustrated at myself for letting her go.... and there is nothing I can do...

I know I should move on as my friends say... but I feel every bone in my body say that we should be together, when we were together, I had always said, maybe it isn't the right time or place for us to be properly together, and that there will be a right time and right place in the future which I believe....

But I guess I'm just being totally stupid, and should just forget about her...

  
TL;DR I lost the most important person in my life, she is dating someone new, loves him but also still has feelings for me, stuff happened between us on sunday night after the broke up.  She still wants to be with him despite her feelings for me, and I'm hurting a lot.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgjhry/hurting_and_confused/

I’ve noticed that whenever we meet for the next 2 days he seems a bit quiet which makes me overthink, I do have abandonment issues so I may to be blame for the overthinking. I was concerned that if we slept together I would start to get attached and overthink etc. 

So the weekend just gone I travelled 2 hours to stay with him for the full weekend. We had an amazing time the sex was incredible! He treated me like a princess, cooked us dinner and was very loving. However since I’ve been home he has barely text me, didn’t answer my call yesterday when I rang him and didn’t follow up with a message. Today I woke up with no message from him or again a message to say he had been busy etc. I panicked and sent a message saying I don’t know why he hasn’t communicated with me and let me worry about him but I hope everything’s ok.

He rang me a few hours later and 2bh I was a little annoyed that he couldn’t be bothered to message me so I didn’t really make conversation. Since then he hasn’t messaged or even read my message from 4pm and hasn’t been on his phone! Am I overthinking and being needy?

And It's not about sex it's so much deeper than that. I feel like I can tell you things that I don't feel comfortable sharing with others. Whenever I'm upset or having a rough day I know I can see you and that makes things so much better. I appreciate and value you so much I'm so thankful for your kindness and support. You have so many qualities which are similar to my parents which is why they like you so much. You acknowledge the things that I've accomplished and it honestly means so much to me. I regret not meeting up with you when you asked to see me again. I wish I would have got the chance to date you even if it didn't result in us being together. For me it's not so much about being in a relationship it's about enjoying life and spending time getting to know each other. I just love how carefree you are and how no matter how long we go without seeing or talking to each other. It's like we pick up where we left off and nothing is different. I just needed to tell you how I really felt I only wish that I would have told you sooner.

94,rgk7ae,1639523951,We just started dating and cuddling with my girlfriend is my favorite thing ever,"I (22m) have never been in a full relationship before where we hang out frequently and get to be physically intimate until now. The girl I am seeing (24f) invites me over a lot and we just watch tv together late at night and she lets me wrap my arms around her and she likes when I kiss her arm or hand and when I tell her how happy she makes me. I really love cuddling, maybe it's because I really like the person I am doing it with but it literally makes me extremely happy and I love cuddling with this girl. She's so sweet and cute and seeing her laugh and smile and say thanks when I say boyfriend stuff to her makes me feel so smooth lol I was not expecting the simple act of hugging and cuddling to be so nice but when it's with a person you really like it guess it just makes you feel super warm and fuzzy on the inside. We held hands and I leaned my head against her shoulder in the movie theater too it was so nice..

95,rgk9hy,1639524120,Is there any chance she likes me? I'm somewhat sure but would appreciate some opinions.,"Not a lot of information here and English isn't my first language but this is the best I can do: I've known her through school for only about 2 months, but on the first day of our classes together she approached me out of nowhere as I was sitting alone and started talking asking me random questions such as my name, how things in life are going, and whether I was happy to be at school or not. From what I can tell she doesn't really talk to anyone else in the class, and is not as outgoing when questioned or greeted by another classmate. We had a class lab and our seats were separated far apart, yet she still came to me (seemingly before she even came to the teacher) to ask me for help on the lab which gradually turned into casual conversation before we had to attend to our business. On one of my tests where we weren't supposed to look at another's desk she out of nowhere peeked at a question I was struggling with and gave me some hints on the knowledge I needed to solve it, without me even asking for help. Another event was  me politely asking her if she needed help when she made her sighing loud and clear as she was doing homework. She immediately responded no, but then continued the conversation towards the subject of being tired/not wanting to be in this class and asking me all sorts of questions about how I was enjoying class like she did on the first day. When doing work in class she constantly glances at me (can't tell if she's judging me or my actions) sometimes for extended periods of time (1.5 extra seconds) before I return the glance and she always immediately turns her head back. Outside of class though, she seems hesitant to talk to me and at times ignores my existence. I'd appreciate some help here, does she have a minor or major crush on me, does she think I'm a friend or is she just trying to get my attention? I definitely like her company a lot, so my mind has been biased towards the idea of her having a crush on me, but is asking her out the right move or would I just be embarrassing myself?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgk9hy/is_there_any_chance_she_likes_me_im_somewhat_sure/
96,rgk9iq,1639524122,"Met a girl that I *really* like, she's beautiful and she seems to like me a lot too. Yet, I have somehow convinced myself that she's not interested, an anxiety that I haven't felt in years.","27, M. I met this girl recently, she's flippin beautiful and we get along well, we have a lot in common. She's a friend of a friend so we've hung out in a group and even had some one-to-one time, and honestly, she makes me feel that giddy/lovey feeling that I haven't felt in years. 

We were out with friends the other night and spoke about having a day of watching this trashy TV show that we both like together, or going for a walk in this beautiful park near my place. I went to bed last night with the biggest smile on my face, I could barely sleep because of all these loved up feeling that I had. 

I decided I had to ask her out, so I sent her a message asking if she'd like to go the park with me at lunchtime on Thursday or Friday. She responded with a pretty resounding yes, saying that it sounded amazing, but told me that she's busy on Thursday and Friday lunchtime. I suggested we could go in the morning if it was easier, but she suggested we do it around New Years instead. 

All good signs, right? Yet, somehow I feel depressed about it and have convinced myself that her response means she's not interested. It's really dumb because she basically said yes but is busy this week, yet I somehow flip it around in my head like she's just trying to be nice without saying on. 

This is a problem I had years ago, I'd have a fantastic experience with a crush or girlfriend, yet the moment I left her, I felt like things had gone to shit. 

For example, right now I'm thinking ""She's probably going to bring a friend, I didn't explicitly say that I wanted to take her on a date. She's way out of my league, and she's a lovely person, so she's just trying to be nice. If she really wanted to go on the date, she'd want to find time this week in her schedule"". 

I know this is just bullshit, and my friend is telling me that her response was an excellent sign. I'm just anxious as fuck about it and wish I could just settle with her response. I got over this problem years ago, but I feel like I haven't liked someone so much in a long time, and COVID has wrecked my social skills. I haven't been with a girl in years, so my dating or sex game is another story.

I realize I'm totally overthinking this, and from my own experience, getting carried away with thoughts like this can completely wreck an opportunity. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to deal with these thoughts, as I'm sure I can't be the only one...

**TL;DR:** Met a girl I really, really like, asked her to go to the park with me for a walk and she said yes, but not for a couple weeks. Somehow my brain turns this into a ""no"", and I have depressing anxiety as a result. Any one else deal with such thoughts?

97,rgkail,1639524198,Am I being ghosted?,"So I was messaging this guy on a dating app, we exchanged numbers a couple of weeks ago and then in the middle of last week we met up for drinks. We got along really well and while neither of us communicated what we wanted out of the date we ended up going back to his place to hook up. We spent a lot of time just chatting with each other and I ended up staying the night. The next day we talked about meeting up again soon, he is leaving on a trip by the end of this week. After I left he even texted me about how he had fun and really liked meeting up and I agreed with him and told him to let me know when he’s around to hang out again. And ever since he hasn’t messaged me back. It’s been like nearly a week now and I can’t help but feel kinda ghosted. Idk if I should just accept it and move on or what I should do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgkail/am_i_being_ghosted/
98,rgkcyq,1639524383,Is he not interested,"He’s a good friend of mine and we have been on a few dates in the past. We live in two different state and I’ve asked a few times for him to hangout when he is home but he hasn’t really had the time to and once chose to hangout with his boys instead of me (but invited me to come with). I’ve asked to FaceTime him recently too, and he never follows through with them. I’ve noticed he never ever likes any of my Instagram or Facebook posts. And I know, social media isn’t the biggest thing ever, but I feel like if I liked someone, I’d like their stuff. 

He has admitted to liking me in the past and even invited me multiple times to see him. But I’m not sure if he sees me as potential or he just wants one thing. He seems very hot and cold sometimes.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgkcyq/is_he_not_interested/
99,rgkfxp,1639524610,Guy introduces me to his parents but then told me he isn’t ready for a relationship?,"Guy is very hot And cold but not in a sense that’s even remotely normal. It is like two extremes. He will introduce me to all his friends talk about wanting to go on a trip together but then starts to cancel plans with me and text me less. Then when I start to think that he isn’t interested anymore he one day invites me to meet his parents? This pattern has been going on for a few weeks now. We’ve only known each other for three months though. Finally after he started acting cold again I confronted him in a very nice way but basically telling him that I’d like to see him more and that’s when he tells me that he isn’t ready for a relationship right now? 
Not to say I haven’t had a guy tell me that before but usually the guy isn’t introducing me to his parents and acting super serious with me on second and then acting cold the next",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgkfxp/guy_introduces_me_to_his_parents_but_then_told_me/
