I met this girl, shes really nice and i would describe her as my type of person to be around, if we didnt meet as we did i would definetly be friends with her. We seem to agree on alot of things. I would also like to describe it as «we speak the same language», and there is actually really good conversation going on. For me i find that really rare.

However, i think about family life, religious, enjoy indoor activites and eat just about everything.

Shes the totally opposite in these areas, after talking with her she has a very nihilistic way of thinking, doesnt consider familylife and generally thinks alot of her excistence should be as quiet and non connected to other as possible. (But she really wants to talk with me??) She loves hiking and outdoors. Shes also a devoted vegitatian (but doesnt mind others eating whatever they want).

Personally i dont mind eating differently, atleast more greens, and i dont mind taking on the great outdoors, as i like being outside but i just never found time and people to go with.
I can also understand her way of thinking, as i was just like her years ago, but i have changed and i can really thank my friends for the fact that i did, as i feel amazing today compared to earlier.


My issue is that i feel hesitant and unsure in persuing something where i want things she does not, but at the same time i dont want to let go of an opportunity if i really like the girl. Considering how i used to be just like her i also understand her point of view.

At the beginning he was very sweet and romantic. While of course the longer we date there are a few things that I knew would stop like flowers every time my bouquet died, really planned out expensive  dates, and of course him paying all the time. We used to have sex all the time even three times in one night and I loved it. Not only was it just fun but the cuddling at the end was even better. Now I’m not saying everything has completed stopped. He still cuddles me every second we are together, constant kisses, always wake up to a good morning gorgeous, cutie, or beautiful either in person or in text, and when I am away for work he FaceTimes at least once per day. Not to mention little things like taking care or me when I am sick, always doing the dishes, and always says yes to any date idea I can come up with if we have the time. Now here comes the tricky part this amazing man is very blunt like to the point I have to remind myself that he is truthful to the point I think it pains him to lie. Not only that but he has some extreme ADHD and is back on his meds though which has now led to him not even thinking about sex *common side affect of adderall. So one day a little after Christmas his phone is laying on the couch in our living room and he is in the kitchen getting us sweets. Now here is where I know I am the asshole. I had previously been engaged to a man when I was 24 found out he was cheating with a now ex friend of mine and when I found out because his phone was blowing up he choked me and hit me to the point I couldn’t walk straight for months. Back to this story though. So due to all of my past trauma I have a little trust issues and I unlock his phone and look at his Snapchat. His Snapchat used to go off all the time and he always said it was those scams where girls send links to try to get you to join their only fans. So sure enough I see a bunch of girls in his Snapchat. I check them and these girls are sending pictures and videos of themselves doing things naked. When I scroll all the way to the top though there are some links to say please join my only fans. So of course I start crying and he comes in asking what’s wrong. Scared to say anything it took me awhile to tell him what I found. He then precedes to tell me him and his best friend, who is also in a relationship, answer those fake girls and convince them to confess they are scammers. We sit and talk for hours and I did apologize to him about looking in his phone. He said it was okay because he 1. gave me the password 2. leaves his phone around me all the time without worry and 3. I found something that looks like cheating and made me feel validated in looking. He never once yelled at me and hugged me a lot. He told me he thought he had told me all about this prank him and his best friend like to pull on these scammers until the other person either gets frustrated or admits they are scammers. I chose to believe him because again never lied to me, never hid his phone from me, leaves it lying around everywhere and the only places he go to are to work and then home where I come only an half an hour later.  He cancels plans with his friends cause he wants to spend time with me and always compliments me in every way. However it still ate at me for weeks. Every day I would cry a little and ask him more questions which he would always answer. Then one day I had enough worrying and asked him if I could help him delete all the people he does not talk to on his Snapchat anymore, there were a lot. He agreed immediately and spent the evening deleting people and explaining who each one was that he did keep in his phone and each one deleted and why we were deleting them. All of this made me feel controlling but he assured me he just wanted to regain my trust and he was even willing to let me call his best friend and interrogate him to get more answers. I chose not to do that since I felt that was too much. After we deleted everything I told him if I every find anything like that again I am gone no words, no tears, and no excuses. He agreed and said that something that has upset red me this much will never happen again and he wish he would have remembered telling me about these stupid little pranks. I agreed in forgiving him and we had been perfect ever since. Fast forward to a month long work trip in California where I feel like I am telling him about things he does that upsets me more than when I am home. Again I cry more, talk about my insecurities , and explain to him why his actions make me sad. Mind you they are not mean things but like making plans and forgetting due to video games. He said it’s a done deal he will never do that again, or trying to make me feel better but he wants to find a solution while I want him to listen, he again agrees to us asking if we are listeners or problem solvers. Lastly was just me feeling inadequate and unattractive today. We talked to me on the phone for a few hours and reassured me that he thought I was perfect in every way and that he would never have told me he loves me if he didn’t truly mean it.

Idk why I wanna cry but let me explain my situation. There’s this girl I’ve found incredibly cute at my job for awhile now and I haven’t had the chance to really get to know her until today. We had like 5 hours together and talked that whole time so I got to know her more than I have before, I finally broke the ice from being strangers to being a little more comfortable around each other. I almost asked for her Instagram but right before she left she was talking about how weird she felt with middle aged dudes hitting on her. And while I’m young and now middle aged, it didn’t seem like an appropriate time and I was afraid I would seem like I wasn’t paying attention. But now I’m realizing since that was the first time I’ve ever really talked to her, will I ever have a chance to get to shoot my shot with her? As I was talking to her she literally reminded me of a more energetic girl version on myself, it’s weird. Her personality, humor, it all reminded me of...me. And i don’t really believe in “the one”. Although I do believe in God and I believe He knows who you’ll ultimately be with. But it just feels different than any other crush I’ve ever had. The fact that it seems like our personalities are so close and also accent each other perfectly is already crazy, but also our little weird quirks and experiences. She’s never been to prom and wants to go, uh, same! And I even hinted at it by saying “I’d love to go but I couldn’t convince my fitness to go and I didn’t have a girl to go with, I’d love to go tho”. To the fact that she takes her breaks during her shift almost the same time I do, about 3 quarters into her shifts. she’s also somewhat awkward and shy acting but not in a bad way, and is kind of how I feel like I act. It’s weird how much we seem share in common and she literally seems like a girl form of me. And I think I’m sad because I’m realizing I ruined my chance to get even closer to her and I’m worried I permanently missed what could’ve been a girl that would suit me perfectly. Is it normal to feel sad? What do I do from here?

A week goes by and I check in. She tells me she had something awkward to tell me. That she just found out she has herpes and has been fucked up about it, but she had to tell me. She says she doesn’t know who gave it to her.

I go get tested. I’m clean. She says she be bummed if I don’t want to see her again, but she’d understand and can she please have her earrings that she left at my place. I tell her I still want to see her. She says same and we meet up for a drink.

We walk back to her place afterwards and we kiss in her room momentarily. She says she doesn’t want to have sex tonight, is that okay. I say of course but inwardly I’m a little confused. 

On my way out she’s making these little excuses. Has to get up early, so tired, and stresses that she wore make up, got dressed up for me, I think to assure me that she’s interested, but not sure.

What happened? Feels like a rejection, but I won’t know for sure until I hear from her again. Kinda baffled.

Also, I’m on mobile so the format will be bad sorry if it’s hard to understand.
Let’s call him Alan.
I’m 14, he’s 15. I met him at the beginning of the school year through a mutual friend. I’ll call her Nora. There are two other friends in this group, Jake (Alan’s cousin) and May. We’re all freshmen. 
I went to a different middle and elementary school than them growing up. The only person I knew before high school was Nora, and she was also one of my only friends when school started. They were pretty quick to accept me into their friend group I think, but it took a few weeks since I’m kind of introverted. I also missed the second week of school (Covid). It was actually around the third week that I started talking to Nora’s friends. The last person in her friend group I met was Alan. 
The first time I ever met him was at the first home varsity football game. Nora invited me to go with her, May, and Jake. I’m not sure if they knew Alan was going to be there, but he was and ended up sitting with us. Me and Alan didn’t talk much that first game. I’m not even sure if we talked at all. 
The second game was when the flirting started. We hung out at Nora’s house before leaving to go to the game. When we were walking to the bay front to skate on a few of Nora’s skateboards, Alan walked next to me the whole way there. Nora and Jake were walking side by side in front and me and Alan were walking side by side right behind them. When we got to the game, Alan still sat next to me instead of next to his best friends. He talked to me a lot more than he did with them, he bought me candy (and only me), and was just a huge flirt the whole time. He was really into me, and I knew it. After that day, so was I. All four of us went to a bunch more games after that (May was on duty at the for something medical I’m not sure what). Then came homecoming. That’s when Alan and I started texting A LOT. We all went to the game, and we all went to the dance. I made a lot of great memories that night. Alan was the first boy I’ve ever slow danced with. He also taught me how. Of course, it wasn’t anything romantic. He didn’t know that I liked him at the time. Homecoming was fun, but nothing really eventful happened. A few weeks went by, and the county fair was coming up. About two weeks before the fair, I confessed my feelings for him. He actually had Covid at the time, so I did it through text. He said yes and we started dating. I was sooo happy that day. Everything was going great up until that point. Then it was the fair week. He had been really busy that week since he was raising animals to show. He always went to sleep early so that he could wake up super early in the mornings and work, and we also started having shorter conversations than we used to. He always had a reason to cut it short. I tried to ignore this though.
That Friday, Nora, Jake, May, Alan, and I got together and went to the fair Friday night. When we got there, Alan was being kind of weird. He didn’t say hi to me or May or Nora (the three of us came together). After a few minutes of everyone just wandering around while he was working, he eventually went and met my parents. I kind of just left him to it and then the five of us ran off to cause trouble. Later that night, when Nora, May, and I where grabbing a snack, Nora told me that Alan might try to kiss me. She said that she told Alan that he should. She didn’t tell me anything else, but I was freaking out. Later, we were all just running around again doing things we shouldn’t when everyone else locked me and Alan behind a stage that was in the art show room (sorry I’m not sure how to describe it). There was a lot of crap back there so the two of us looked around (not so) quietly trying not to get caught and thrown out. There was a piano back there that we messed with before going through the door we got in through. When we came out and found everybody, they were asking things like “Sooo what took y’all so long in there?” and stuff like that. We said that nothing happened and carried on with our night.
Then came the breakup.
The next morning, I texted Alan. I asked him if he still felt the same way about me since he had been acting so strange lately. He broke up with me. He said that he's always liked me, he just didn't want us to hate each other someday because of a bad breakup or something. He only ever wanted to be friends, and then asked me if we could still stay friends. I was devastated to say the least. All I did was cry. That's all I could do. To make matters even worse, my parents were out of town. The only person I really had was my grandma who was staying with us until they got back. I spent the whole weekend lying in bed and crying. I was actually going to go to the fair again that day with everyone because the rides were going to be open, but that was a hard pass. I just couldn't do it.
The entirety of the next week I spent avoiding him. It hurt so much just to look at him. Everyone was telling me how bad he felt for doing that to me and were saying that he really felt like an asshole. They also said that he was really sad at the fair the day he broke up with me, which wasn't like him at all. 

Before I get too far into this story, there is a very important detail I haven't mentioned yet that happened before we started dating. Alan helped me through one of the worst experiences I've EVER gone through. 
The third week of school is when it started. There was this boy in my second period. He's a Junior, 6'4, and easily twice my weight (I'm 5'3 and 123lbs for reference). So yeah, he's a lot bigger than me.
 We became friends, but things very quickly turned sour. He started by just poking me. I ignored it though because I've seen friends do this to each other before. Then he started doing it with a pencil. just on my upper leg and shoulder areas. Again, I ignored it. It got bad. Poking turned to kicks. They hurt a little, I said stop a few times, but he didn't stop. He even pulled my hair once. Then came the punching. He punched my arm and my upper leg still. Yes, it hurt. Yes, I said stop. But did he? NO. I was terrified of him. He hurt me, and I didn't know what to do about it. Every single day, I woke up knowing that, when I walked into that classroom, I would get hurt by him again. My whole 1st period would be spent dreading walking into that classroom. One day I even went to my 3rd period crying about what happened in 2nd.
 That's when I told him. I told Alan that some big guy in my 2nd period was hitting me. A few more of my friends knew a bit about what was going on, but nobody knew the full story. I didn't even tell Alan the full story, yet he was the only person to help me.
 HE WAS PISSED. 
He was actually sick when I told him, so he couldn't do anything about it until Tuesday the next week. I was so scared, for both Alan, and myself. What if they ended up fighting? The guy messing with me was a lot bigger than Alan as well (he's 5'7 and 150lbs). I didn't want him to get hurt because of me.
 Alan asked where my 2nd period was, and I told him. When I asked him what he planned on doing, he told me that he was just going to talk to him. I was glad he wasn't going to try and fight him (Alan likes fighting), but I was still extremely worried.
 On Tuesday, I couldn't stop shaking. That's all I did throughout my 1st and 2nd periods. I hadn't ever been more terrified about anything in my life up until that point. Then came 2nd period. Alan was planning on talking to him after the class ended. All I did was shake. I did my work in terror, and when I was done, I just sat there and stared into nothing. The kids around me (including the asshole) were telling me that my pupils were really big, asking what was wrong, if I had ADHD and if I didn't take my medicine for it, and were making jokes about how I was on drugs or something. I don't remember much else other than seeing black.
 I feel like I can't express how genuinely scared I was for me, and Alan's safety. I was scared I was going to get hurt. I was scared ALAN was going to get hurt. But I was powerless.
 At the end of class, things didn't go as planned. Alan didn't get the chance to talk to the guy. I only managed to point him out. He was going to talk to him the next day. On the next day, 2nd period went the exact same way. All I did was sit there, shaking and terrified. When class ended, I was one of the first out of the door, so the dude walked out behind me. I watched Alan walk up to him with one of his friends and start talking to him. I didn't stick around. I went to my next class as fast as I could. 
 I texted Alan during third period to see how it went. He said he got defensive but said he would stop. The relief I felt is indescribable. I've never felt so relieved in my entire life before. I was so thankful, and I made sure that Alan knew that. I don't think he understands how grateful I am for what he did for me. It was the bravest thing I've ever witnessed anyone do before. No one has ever done anything like that for me before. 
 I was scared to go to my 2nd period again the next day, but it was a different kind of scared. What if he was mad at me? I'm not sure if he was or not, but he tried to apologize to me. He said that my ""boyfriend"" said I was mad at him for hitting me. (Alan and I weren't dating at the time, so I'm a little confused on why he said that.) I ignored all his attempts to talk to me. The last words I've ever said to him were ""Don't talk to me."" 
 I ended up telling my mom about it the next day on Thursday. I had a full-on mental breakdown crying to her about it. She set up an appointment with one of the principals at my school for Monday. I ended up getting a No-contact-order against him and that was that. Everything was ok again and I wasn't scared anymore. I even got to skip 2nd period that day.
I'm still so grateful for what Alan did for me and I will NEVER forget it. 
Back to the main story ---&gt;

 There was so much going on in my life. New school, new people, new friends, getting fucking harassed, going through my first breakup, homework, grades... it was really fucking with me. I started losing sleep and I went back to a really bad coping method of mine: cutting. I won't get into too many details, but I kept it to my upper thighs since it was easier to hide. They got deep too. 
 A while before this all happened, I actually told my mom that I used to do this, but I stopped. She told me she wouldn't tell my dad because he would probably get mad.
Anyways, she eventually caught me in the act and ended up telling him. He wasn't mad though. She was actually the one who was mad. She thought it was stupid that I did what I did and took my blade away. They both let me know how much they loved me though and we all ended up crying. She told me to stop. I didn't stop. She put me in therapy, which I am still in to this day, though I stopped cutting in the beginning of December

Jump back to when Alan broke up with me 

After spending the whole week not talking to him at all, he made the first move to speak with each other. He texted me out of the blue Friday night and told me that he was sorry and that he wanted us to just be friends and start actually speaking to each other again. I said ok and tried to be friends with him.
 I wasn't anywhere near ready to be friends with him again. I cried nearly every night for at least two weeks after the break-up.
 Every time I was near him or even thought about him, I was sad. I was so, so sad. 
 Oh, and also, guess who IMMEDIATELY got another girlfriend? Alan started looking for another date right after we broke up. They only stayed together for about a week, and he even admitted that he didn't like her at all. He even acted all lovey in front of me with her. It really broke my heart seeing him get with her so fast right after we broke up. He talked to a few girls after that, but I only know that he's dated one girl after me. 
Months went by and I still cried at night listening to all the songs that made me think of him. We didn't stay near as close as we were before, but I still tried to be friends with him. I stayed sad for WAY too long compared to the time I actually spent dating him, which was 11 days. Pathetic right? 
 It took me a while, but I gradually stopped crying as much. Last week was the first time in a really long time that I actually cried about it.
 Anyways, when Christmas break came around, that's when things really cooled down for me. not seeing him for a while help a LOT. During Christmas break, I had a therapy appointment. My therapist asked me if I was doing alright with so much time to think to myself, but I was actually ok. I said that not seeing him for a while had really helped me cool down a bit. I predicted that it was probably going to get worse when I went back to school though, and I was right.
When I got back to school, my schedule changed so that I actually had lunch with him now. I started getting sad whenever I saw him again, but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as it used to be. I started seeing him more and we became better friends. 
 A few weeks ago, I had to start riding the bus to and from school every day since my parents couldn't drive me to school anymore. I told Alan that I had to start riding the bus every day, and that I didn't know anyone on there. He told me that he would try to ride the bus as much as he can for me!!! I feel bad because he has to get up earlier in order to catch it though.
 A few days ago, I asked him if he would be riding the bus that day and he said no and apologized. I told him that he didn't have to be sorry and feel like he has to ride with me. He said that he'd rather not leave me alone and that there were people on there that he didn't trust anyways. 
Another time he shared his AirPods with me and we listened to music together. He even played one of my favorite songs for me!
We sit by each other every time we ride the bus and I love when I'm with him. I want him back now more than I ever have before, and I don't know what to do about it. I've never felt this way before and I've never wanted someone so bad in my entire life. I want to ask him how he feels about me, because I get this feeling that he still may like me, but I'm scared. I'm scared of what he'll say. I'm scared to ruin our friendship and make things weird. I'm scared that he doesn't feel the same way about me.

Around 5 months ago this guy (M24) DMd me (F21) on Instagram. I have a public profile and he told me I look pretty and he asked for my Snapchat.

From that day on we talked every day, a lot. We got to know each other, our humor matched, and I could see he began slowly getting sweeter and sweeter with me - gave me nicknames, wished me “good morning/good night beautiful”. I know what love bombing is, and I doubt it was the case - in the beginning he was quite reserved and we just talked.

We live in different countries. We kept talking because my initial plan already was to move to work in his country, and I had an opportunity to apply for that workplace later. _So you could call this long distance talking stage_.

Every now and then I did notice he gets some distant or doesn’t text as much, but I took it easy cause we’ve only talking and it’s still not 100% sure whether we’d meet.

But he kept being persistent. He complimented me from head to toe, said I make him smile and how he’d want to make me smile while we cuddle etc. 

Of course we had regular convos too. We talked about dating. He told me straight up he needs to be on the same page with a girl to get intimate; and he doesn’t even get turned on if that’s not the case. Also, he doesn’t do hookups (I did believe him - all he did was work; eat, workout and repeat, cause we texted so much throughout the day). 

Some of his texts:

“How’s your day going beautiful”
“(my name) you deserve all of it. I wish you were here so I could treat you right”

we joked a lot, and he always said something cute like he wants to take me on a nice date, workout with me and watch the stars together. He also said he’d hope I could be his girlfriend. I’m usually very careful with this type of stuff, but his actions did actually align with his words.

Quite early in this talking stage he liked to show off his manhood, and I didn’t mind a little sexting with him here and there. I didn’t send him any nudes and I told him I don’t do that, which was fine to him. (This point is important for the next thing)

A week ago we sexted again a little, and I gave him a compliment, so he sent me an older teasing picture of him (not a total nude, but I won’t get into details. **However**, this time it showed clearly that it was **a screenshot and showed that he had posted that picture in a private story dedicated for nudes. It even showed that 2 people had seen the post.**

I got really confused. Why would he want to purposely show me that he acts like a h*e, when I’ve explicitly told him earlier I don’t like fboys. It gave me an instant ick. I asked him “do you really have a private story dedicated for nudes?” he said “of course”. As if it was no big deal.

**Was it to make me jealous?** Maybe; but why. I always gave him attention and talked with him; and never disclosed anything about whether I had other guys in my life.

**Or why; for some reason, didn’t he care anymore what kind of impression does he give me?** 

The next days I ignored his Snapchats. He sent quite a lot of them, so I’m surprised he didn’t remove me at this point. But rather, he messaged me again asking “so what are you up to”, and I just responded “I’m sorry but you really turned me off earlier”.

He responded “Because of the private story thing? You don’t wanna keep talking anymore?” ( _Wtf, makes it sound like I’m creating a problem out of nowhere and doesn’t even try to apologize or act like the guy he claimed to be and treat me so good_ )

I responded “yes”. 

He immediately removed me from friends, and unfollowed immediately on Instagram too.

I don’t get it: **How can a guy, who was clearly really into me, even confessed he had dreams about me; suddenly let me go so easily?**

**Why did he even risk showing off his other h*es suddenly; when he knows that behavior is a deal breaker for me?**

He literally didn’t get any nudes out of me; no money, nothing to “take advantage of”. He always remembered the small details I had told him weeks back. I can’t comprehend how did he end this so easily without even apologizing or trying to work things out.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155810,public,self,"How and why did he suddenly end our talking stage this way, and so easily, as if it didn’t mean anything to him?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sg42ud/how_and_why_did_he_suddenly_end_our_talking_stage/,no_ads,0,,,,,

He used to be really open with me about his feelings and would almost everynight we would cuddle and talk about life and just anything on our minds. He used to love cringy things and being so intimate and lovey and I miss it so much. Now hes so closed off and if I ask for him to either hug me back or kiss me he gets so pissy and acts like I’m asking for too much. Lately all I think I am to him is a burden. I recently also had to leave my mentally abusive household and moved in with my boyfriend and his family and I feel like I need extra love and care now because I been so sad about the situation. I feel like he has not been understanding of that situation at all either. He always gets angry if I am crying and I don’t say whats wrong, but when I say whats wrong he just makes me feel like my feelings are invalid and then I end up regretting even speaking up. So more often than not I dont anymore, but then it also makes me really upset when he sees me crying or sad and doesnt even care to ask or at least just hold me. At night he doesnt say goodnight or kiss me. We used to talk about how much we wanted to sleep together and now that we have it I just feel like he doesnt care or appreciate me at all. It made me really sad that on our anniversay he worked 6am-2pm and I had gotten ready to go out with him when he was off but when he got home he just ended up sleep for 4 hours straight and we ended up just getting a fast food place and barely spent any quality time together. Anytime I tell him that I want quality time he gets mad he thinks just because we now live together and if were laying in bed while were on our phones and dont talk at all that that is quality time. I feel like I’m constsntly crying and begging for the bare minimum. He always calls me insecure and all these things but I also read messages on his phone about him wanting to cheat on me with his co worker that he liked. He did not end up doing it from the texts I had seen but he had the intent and that will forever hurt me. I would never put him in the situations he has put me in and he gets so short tempered over me always and doesnt realize he caused all of it. He always sees it as me complaining everyday about the same shit and wanting attention but its because I feel so unimportant to him. I miss in the beginning of our relationship when he wanted me more than I wanted him (he asked me to be his gf 3 diff times and I said no) and he would put in so much effort to surprize me with little things, would send me cute paragraphs to wake up to and so much more. He would always find time to cuddle me and he would always want to kiss me and I just miss that. I don’t know what to do because everyday I honestly feel so depressed. I try to not think too much about it all but its so hard. Hes always on my mind and my first priority but I feel like I’m always the last thought on his mind. I even ask if he wants to do anything fun for valentines day and he just complains that I’m picky and that there is basically no point in doing anything and it rlly hurt my feelings because I’m stupid and was looking forward to it. There is no point in looking forward to it because he works that day too so he probably is just going to come home and sleep the whole night.

We ended up nearly sleeping together, which was not something I was looking for, to put it frankly. I also made sure to keep my boundaries, and although it seems like he was following them, he still maneuvered his way around to get what he wanted?.. 
Now he asked me for another date yet again at his place, and I am starting to get irritated. I am not sure whether this implies that the dude is just looking to hook up with me (which would be strange, since I didn't give in last time, and I think I made it pretty clear that this is not what I want at the moment), or is just too lazy to think of some better places to go.

Year 1:
So I’ve been with this girl for a total of 3 years now, the first year was amazing, she was always bubbly and happy to see me, the spark was strong, loads of sex. She never called me hurtful names, or go off on me for seemingly no reason. 
Year 2:
I could see the changes start to roll in, but I thought maybe we are just settling in. She was much more gripey about small things and was much more argumentative. This is also the time she started calling me smaller things like ,stupid, annoying, useless, dumbass and things along that nature. I know it might sound dumb, but these things have really began to put a number on me and I will get into how this effects me more in year 3. It’s the situations in witch she calls me annoying that really hits deep, I’ll be trying to cuddle up on her or try to initiate some kind of intimacy not even just sex, just something to be intimate, but it gets immediately shut down. We used to have sex at least 3 times a week, sometimes every day, but during year two maybe once a week or once every two weeks. 

Year 3 
Zero sex, like literally pretty much none, she never wants anything physical at all, she never masterbates and has ZERO LIBIDO no sex drive what’s so ever. And It’s really gotten to the point that I feel like just absolute scum. I crave an intimate relationship so badly. I don’t feel loved. I don’t feel like a man. I don’t feel like I please her sexually even though she never wants sex. She claims she loves me, but it’s like if u really love me why don’t you want to have sex with me. 
And it’s not just no sex, it’s no making out (she never wants it to escalate, so we just don’t make out) no cuddling (because once again she doesn’t want things to escalate) she just seems incapable of having any sexual relationship whatsoever. 
She’s also been on depo shot for the entire relationship too wonder if that could lead to this fucked ass libido 

In the span of 3 years she goes from a complete nympho to zero 

Sex more times than I could even handle to literally none. 

What do I do?

And yes I’ve tried my very best being super open to her about it, and she can care so much less. Gives no fucks about my sexual desires. 
She thinks Every single thing I do is just for sex, if I be extra nice she thinks it’s just for sex 
If I go to the gym for a nice pump she thinks just for sex 
If I try to cuddle she thinks just for sex
If I try to kiss her she thinks just for sex 
even if I complement her she thinks I only want sex 

She doesn’t understand that it’s not just having sex that I crave , i want her to have more fun than I do, I want her to want me, I want her to connect with me  again. I want some type of intimacy between us. 
I don’t feel loved anymore.

TLDR:

Basically long story short, I love the fuck out of her and want to be able to enjoy sex together like we once did, but it’s almost like the thought of it now is disgusting to her.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155832,public,self,"I (20M) have been with my girlfriend for 3 years although we now lack intimacy and it’s taking it’s toll on me, I need help from anyone",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sg5vgy/i_20m_have_been_with_my_girlfriend_for_3_years/,no_ads,0,,,,,

To introduce myself, I'm (20F) a very timid and conservative person when it comes to dating or relationships. Im also a hopeless romantic lol. So, I've never gone or dates or had a relationship bc I'm a very picky person with high standards for the person I want to invest time and effort in. (also when I fall for someone, I tend to fall prettyyy hard so Im careful with this.) It was the start of the pandemic (april 2020) and like everyone, I was pretty much bored. I downloaded a dating app purely for fun. I matched with this guy (19M) who lived like 10,000kms away lol and it was pretty basic at first, but as time went on I found myself losing interest in talking to my other matches and we were just exclusively talking to each other haha (we both even deleted the app) we def weren't expecting to meet someone we actually liked! We talked everyday, etc. and we had such a strong connection &amp; so much things in common to the point that we both found it kinda creepy!! This guy was literally written by a woman he was sooo sweet and ticked all the boxes. sounds so crazy but he's the first guy I ever actually considered being in a rel with (VERY RARE for me). We even had banter on visiting each other soon when pandemic is over. It wasnt just one of those guys u just snapchat. we would talk everywhere from ig, fbc, linked in (lmao for jokes) , google docs (we were working on his college essay and started goofin around) , and even emails lmao. We def confessed our feelings for each other. 

After two months I pretty much realized how I started to have intense feelings for him and the fear started to kick in. So we video called and I asked him where this was going. To sum it up, he basically said that he def liked me no doubt abt it and if he was here or I was there he would date me straight away....but we cant rly turn into anything serious bc of our distance (he had friends who were miserable in LDR). I suggested to stop bc I wouldnt wana lead anything on but he didnt want to stop talking to me and he pretty much even talks to me more than he talks to his friends. :""((

We still talked after that but it faded when I started to pull away. Im not rly good with uncertainty and im just the type to know where things are going (i have anxiety). It ended around August 2020 with no closure or explanation. I hit him up around dec 2020 cos i rly missed it and basically said thanks for everything etc. and he mentioned he "" found someone, shes great""  and I assume he thought I had someone too (I posted a  guy friend on my story)  my friends thought he was lying to save face lmao but idk

Its basically been two yrs and Ive done EVERYTHING to get him off my mind but nothing seems to work (finally tried dating, got into a rel, etc.) Idk if reconnecting would be a good idea bc Im not even sure if hes single or not rn. its up to the point where I just rly miss having him in my life even if its just as a friend. Sometimes I feel so stupid for feeling this way?? Like it seems so shallow and invalid coz why tf would I fall for someone ive never even met lol but thats that. not rly sure what to do now bc he's definitely still alive in my heart. ahhhh!!!!!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155834,public,self,had a summer fling and still can't move on after 2 years :(,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sg5w9m/had_a_summer_fling_and_still_cant_move_on_after_2/,no_ads,0,,,,,

She said she wanted to stay in contact, but knew that since I am (lf a relationship), it isn't fair to me. I told her ok, she has to do what is best for her.

I let a few weeks go by and text her, just asking how she was doing. She responds instantly and says she misses me, after we text back and forth for a bit. I tell her if she wants to meet for a drink some time give me a message.

About a week goes by I don't text her anything, then she starts texting me, asking about my day and stuff, at the end of the exchange she asks me to go out to dinner next week. We text throughout the week.

Day of the day she asked me out; Ask her how she is doing and if up for today. I am totally ghosted. Not a word now it's been 24 hours. Damn, that feels like shit. I feel that is so rude honestly. Am I being treated like shit here? Should I just block her and forget she exists?

So I finished high school while my new living environment was in the group home. I went to college after high school and graduated while in college I moved out of the group home and into my own apartment. I got a job while going to school and then eventually got a car. Then I graduated college with a certificate and then a few months later I got hired at the college I graduated from. 

I still receive disability services because they help me with medical care if I need help. But that is almost a rarity because I'm pretty self-sufficient outside of maybe having an surgery here and there.

Also In my whole life I didn't had much dates at all and the last year I had the first time sex also.

Now I'm back in the dating world and I'm once again looking for my SO. The prob is, I'm not sure why, but I'd really like to have more sex and I have to say for me currently it doesn't matter if its with a GF or a ONS. Of course I'd like to do it with my gf, but thats way harder to get.

Now I'm currently dating 2 girls (yeah suddenly it's way easier for me) and both seems interested. The first one is also very inexperienced in dating and relations, but I really love that we have so much in common. The problem is, she is kind of reserved and I can't tell where we are.

The other girl is completely different. She is a very direct girl and she shows  some I'd say yellow-flags. But I decided to give her a chance because I think she is really interested in me and already asked me for a date. Yes, she asked me. I've never experienced anything like that.

However. Fact is, I like both of them at this early state (with the first girl I had one date till now, and with the second I'm currently planning the first one). The problem is, that my brain obviously just want to fuck.Sometimes I feel like shit because of that, because I'm not a fuck-boy, but it's a behavior like that, and I don't want to be that way. But I also don't want to ""stop"" my sex-life just right after it started (I waited 25 years for that)

When I was with the first girl I managed it to not be that way. The first date was really good, and we're soon planning our second one.

The second girl was different. She was really direct, what makes me kind of anxious tbh.She started to ask questions, but in a different kind of way. First it felt like she did it really aggressive and direct.

But first you have to know the following: I've never had any success on Tinder, and after the relationship ends I decided to do an experiment. I wanted to have more sex and therefore I made a new profile on tinder with just one pic and wrote, that I wanted to have some fun, but I'm open for everything also (included relationship).Honestly, I've never thought that I would get at least one like, because I'm not really good looking, but she liked me and I did also.

But in her first message she told me that she is looking for a relationship. We chatted a lot, also about past relationships (just how much we had and how long they were) and she said, that she also was sexually very active. So this topic came up. During that, she also said, that she thinks sex binds each other. 

However. As I said we're currently planning our first date and I don't know how to tell, but I have the feeling that I want to fuck her.   
I know it sounds like I'm a fuckboy or something like that, and want to use her just for that, but I don't know. This feeling is quite new to me but I notice how fast this topic pops up in my brain when dating.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do or what to think and feel about this.  
It feels like I shouldn't have this feeling, but on the other side it also feels like a good sign, because I think her attractive.

I’ve realized that I’m very passive and I’m honestly too afraid to approach women half the time. 

So I started trying to stop being “beta”. Regardless how you view the alpha/beta thing. The terminology exists and a certain visualization of these two does come up when the terms are used. 

So I am in essence a typical beta. I’m passive in nature, non-confrontational, I don’t like arguing or debating, I don’t take initiative, I’ve been burnt before and never stood up for myself. I’ve been made fun of, even at 30 and never fought back or said anything back to defend myself. I simply take hits and later take the anger out in private by screaming into a pillow or hitting objects. 

I want to stop being a beta but people seem to consistently see me as one. Despite me being tall, people still treat me badly. They think im nice but that’s it. 

I don’t have many friends and the ones I had are also pretty much beta males. They live at home with parents. Have absolutely no game or sex appeal. Im pretty much the only one that actually tries to dress nice and is interested in talking to women. My friends, unfortunately are weirdos. They look weird, dress weird and are anime neck beards. I recently just gave up on them and said I’d rather go out alone and since then I’ve been doing that. 

I started recently going to Meetups to meet new people. But I’ve realized that the meetups are also filled with extremely odd people. Many of them are guys and they all have no real game either and honestly are very similar to my friends. 

I recently read blogs about trying to be more assertive, more confident in myself. I hit the gym and try to talk to women in public. The only women I can talk to are bartenders. I forwhatever reason can’t talk to women at bars but bartenders are easier. So I’ve been practicing with them. I also read having friends who can get women is a huge plus. But I can’t seem to find any group of guys who are good with women. I also think that I would be too beta or passive to hang out with these guys. It seems that guys who can get laid stick together and have nights out where they try to get numbers. None of my friends have ever done that and if we tried then I would always have to be the one trying to put the work in. 

So now I’m essentially friendless and I want to be more alpha. I want to stop being passive, be more assertive, have less people make fun of or take advantage of me but I’m not sure how to emit that kind of aura. It seems that people have no issue touching me or make remarks because I feel like they sense I’m very passive.

Okay, so I have been texting a girl and getting to know her for the last two weeks or so. From her profile photos, she appeared very petite in terms of body type. She was out with a friend of hers two nights ago and she sent a photo of her friend and herself to me as she sometimes refers to her in our conversations. So, when I viewed the photo, I realized that she isn't near as petite as I originally thought by her Tinder photos, she is more overweight than any other body type. 

This has disappointed me a fair amount as this is not what I find attractive. I get that that may sound shallow, although I can't help what I find attractive or not. I was thinking of just cancelling our date as I don't really see the point of going. This would disappoint her though as she said many times that she is very much looking forward to meeting me.

But can you put your blinders off and realize that once an individual becomes an adult, it becomes very hard to meet new people, especially in the same age group and with similar interests, and that these apps are the most likely way they can ever meet someone great? 

Bad dating experiences do happen everywhere, so let's not demonize the apps, and instead try to help people who are having a hard time on what they could be doing wrong and we ourselves can stop approaching the apps with such defensive pessimism.

Also, what's the hate with Tinder? Dating is a numbers game, so most people go there because it's the most likely place they'll find someone, so stop saying it only for hookups. If you're only meeting people who are interested in hookups, you should look inwards and see why you're swiping on those kinds of people and if there were warning signs.

And for God's sake unmatch people if you're no longer interested in talking to them. It declutters your conversations and makes it easier to have meaningful conversation. Unless you're looking for attention in seeing how many like you can get, in which case, fuck you and your eyebrows.

I don’t know I have just always been attracted to really masculine men. I am not homophobic at all. I am actually bi myself. But I don’t know I just can’t get attracted to effeminate men. His mannerisms were very much similar to a gay man. And I don’t know if I should settle for that. Because he said he liked me after the first date and said he was super comfortable with me. He is also from a culture where homophobia is rampant. But he could very well be straight but just be more feminine. I honestly have no idea what I should do. He pressurized me into telling me how the date went. Even though I was worried for his safety as he drove from another state to go on a date. And he kind of blew up on me saying he’s a good person and deserves better than me because I didn’t feel that connection. So I don’t know I can’t force myself to like him sexually. So I know he’s hurting and I wish it was different and I didn’t cause him this trauma.
