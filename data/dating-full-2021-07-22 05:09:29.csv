I am 25 years old, I’m a guy, I’ve never had a girlfriend, I am a virgin, and A LOT of girls have told me I’m ugly. So naturally, when I find out about something like this, my mind thinks of it more seriously, like is this an actual potential option to not be completely alone? Yes, the idea depresses me, nonetheless. 

But, being that I’ve seen 30-40+ year old men online claiming to be virgins who have never had a girlfriend, I figure since I’ve already had such a track record for being “ugly”, and reached 25, I’m pretty likely to end up the same way. Especially since all other aspects of my life are broken and I’ll probably end up homeless worst case, or best case, maybe in a decent paying career that is meaningless just like these dead end (but way below living wage, even fulltime hours) retail jobs.

So maybe I’ll somehow end up in a decent career that I can live off of, but it’ll probably be meaningless and/or get boring quick, even worse when having to serve authority above me and deal with BS company policies. My mental health will only get worse, but I suppose it’d still be way worse if I was homeless.

I’m not sure if I even have the mental or emotional capacity to be in a serious long-term relationship anyway, I couldn’t last 25 years of misery and 7 years of more particular isolation without further psychological damage. That time is gone, and I’m still getting older.

They say you’re not supposed to pursue relationships until you “got your life together”. Supposedly you’re NEVER supposed to actively look for a relationship, but realistically you don’t get ANYTHING in life if you’re not even actively trying to. Even worse when your natural lifestyle is inside playing videogames and shit and you just don’t seem to understand how social connection in general works. 

You can swipe on every single woman on Tinder (assuming the algorithm doesn’t detect that and automatically ban you for doing that) and get literally not one match, it’s so superficial and based off of pictures, before any actual messaging. 

Dating is like a competition (just like working jobs) which I get has an aspect of nature to it, but to me, that just kind of devalues relationships. It should be a naturally, organic, connection, right? Fueled by the brain chemicals or whatever the hell we operate on (Rick Sanchez needed to explain LOL).

I’ve spent most of my time at home on the internet (aside from going to a meaningless miserable dead end retail job) but I also went to grade school/high school once, and what I experienced was a social nightmare, so I’ve been in a “physical social world”, I guess.

In addition to that, in MORE RECENT YEARS, I got told I was ugly by a lot online, which made me feel even lower than I already did, especially because I was feeling hopeful that I might actually be attractive.

So, look at what I’ve went through, and I’m 25 now, and there exist guys in their 30s, 40s, older, just like me. So seems pretty certain I’m already set in their fate, right?

I don’t know, surely there must be things they could have done better in their control, maybe they’re not telling the full story (since it’s so easy to lie and be believed online).

But I once asked someone “maybe women just tell me I’m ugly because they’ve been abused and assume/fear I’m the same” (it’s not just that I’m “ugly”, they’re unnecessarily extra mean about it) and they said “no that is probably not true”, which means that I really must just be ugly.

I’ve been hit on by guys, even happened in real life. Upset me more because I’m not gay but it’s only guys who think I’m attractive?

I mean, I had a female friend who once wanted to do it, but I chickened out. A few LDR online (but really like that can count).

A lot of people say “romantic” relationships are less important than “friendship” and “family” anyway, so that implies “romantic” isn’t special, or it is less special? So, if anything, wouldn’t “friends with benefits” (as far as sex being considered important and special) be better than a “romantic” relationship?

I’m very confused, I have no personal reference to understand. But I think in a very logical, precise way, otherwise it’d be too easy to fool me….. 

I doubt I’m able to communicate my thoughts exactly as I intend to, it’s very hard to do so.

I very much wish I had a girlfriend sometimes. Yes, I get horny and just have that animal urge for sex, but I also crave the more emotional aspects too. Like, just cuddling and talking, being touched, haven’t even hugged a female since, 5 or 6 years, maybe?

It seems kind of ridiculous to think that I’m some kind of anomaly who just can’t attract any females (specified females because I’m not gay, even though I’ve been desirable to males) but it obviously happens to other guys, who are even much older than me.

Maybe it’ll happen ONE DAY, right? Maybe when I’m in my 30s, 40s, even 50s? Personally I find it particularly devastating to still be a virgin who’s never had a girlfriend at 25, definitely more so past 20s, but everyone says “AGE DOESN’T MATTER!!!!!” 

To me, age kind of matters, because there’s like a magic with being younger, the whole young love I’ll never get to experience now. Aside from that, it’s just simply getting older, closer to death (and we’re not even guaranteed to live another day) but we live in a society where everyone yells at you that it “doesn’t matter WHEN things happen”, even though they’re usually saying this hypocritically.

Maybe I could just have an AI companion and a real good fleshlight until that “one day” but even that idea doesn’t strike me right, it rubs me the wrong way (no pun intended). Seems like it’d be unhealthy and worsen the ability to connect, even though I may never meet anyone to connect with anyway, but it could also just be far into the future.

Biology has time limits (I’m antinatalist so don’t want kids, but still have desires for sex and companionship).

For some reason having these experiences WHILE I’M YOUNG matters a lot to me, even though so many people say it doesn’t matter if it happens now or 20 years from now. A lot of people also say you shouldn’t plan on enjoying life in general until “retirement” which I think is absolutely ridiculous, because you just worked away all of your youth and most of your entire life, TO JUST NOW ENJOY LIFE?

This is my first post here and I’m so relieved there is somewhere I can ask questions! 

A little background on myself. I am a 28yr old male and I have been in 5 total relationships 2 of which were long term. and the last one ending after 4 years in 2012. Ever since then I haven’t felt very good about myself. Lack of self esteem. The last relationship really broke me even though we ended on ok terms. 

Recently (the last 3 years) I’ve been getting back into being healthy and confident again. Dealing with anxiety but slowly building myself up as best as I can! The whole thing is. It’s been so long that I’ve even tried to engage in anything other than just friendships with women that I wouldn’t really know where to start with dating again… 

I have a few mutual friends who try to hook me up with girls sometimes but that’s not what I want. I want to find someone with similar interests who is independent with her endeavors as well. I like someone who chases their dreams. Someone I can spend time talking to about those dreams and mine. I am not a bad looking guy either! I’m 6ft 192lbs with long black hair and quite a few tattoos. I take very good care of myself. 

I just don’t know where to start with the whole thing lol. There are a few girls who I have a mutual friends with other but it’s kinda hard meeting people right now especially with the whole new covid variants going on :(.

I asked him on a second date he sound excited, after couple hours he said he was busy but wants to reschedule it. We even add each other on steam to play games. The talking was going good too like nothing weird was sticking out! 

We were planning to play games and the next thing I see was he deleted me from every social platform.

1. Is it best to comment directly on the picture or to DM her the compliment? I feel like there are pros and cons to both.

2. What kind of compliments do girls enjoy receiving even if by a somewhat random guy you think is somewhat cute? 
- Is it good to keep it simple and generic like : ""You're pretty"" ""You're hot"" You're beautiful"" etc..
-Compliment something specific, but none sexual: ""You have a nice smile"" ""You have a pretty smile"" ? ""I like your eyelashes"" ""your hair looks good like that"" ""You have beautiful eyes""

The day before the date she messages me asking for my Instagram saying her sister wants to see a photo of me. I give her my account handle. The next text I get says “don’t worry about tomorrow. You’ve gotta girl :)))”. Clearly she snooped into my insta and saw my ex girl. I archived the obvious posts of her but there were a couple of other photos of in there she must have found. 

I say ‘ That’s my ex’ and leave it till the morning. She didn’t reply, I messaged her saying that was a really past thing and I’m just keen to have lunch and meet her. She didn’t even open the message. After the time of the date was passed I just deleted her number.

I just needed to vent because it really was my first shot in so long. I don’t even feel like I did anything wrong but I’ve gone through and cleaned my socials. Honestly, part of me doesn’t mind because I didn’t loss anything in the situation as she came to me randomly. But I am disappointed because I did have my hopes up to go on a date.

We usually only text at least once a week or a couple times a month but going back over a lot of our texts during 2020 she was a bit flirtatious with me (calling my pictures cute/handsome, cool hair, etc. etc.) and joking around a lot.

Like, I commented on a post about sex and hookups on a different sub where I said something about seeing sex as something very intimate (to me personally) and I had some people acting like I was weird. Is there something wrong with me? I am just legitimately repulsed at the idea of allowing random people to touch me like that (I am *not* repulsed by people who enjoy casual sex).

I have been on dating apps for about 6 years, I have been on matchfinder websites, I have gone to social clubs, tried to go out whenever a work group or personal friend has organized something social. I drink, smoke, and sometimes use drugs socially but never alone. I think I am very presentable, I am told I am very friendly and well-spoken. I see myself as a bit dry and dull but equally I'm told I'm actually very interesting and I regularly host parties that everyone seems to really enjoy coming to so I can't be that dull. I feel a little like bragging here which is not good but I do think my interests and knowledge and hobbies extend across such a broad spectrum I really can offer something for pretty much anyone. I have had male and female friends go through my app profiles and the like and everything seems to be both well-presented and accurate... 

Yet there is nothing. I have not met a single person in nearing 8 years. I repeatedly find someone I am interested in only to exchange a few words before they seem to think nothing clicks and move on to someone else. I have seen friends fall out of long-term relationships, date as a single person for a while, find a new mate, develop a long-term partnership, and now everyone in my social circle is starting to settle down and marry. Its not even a failure at dating its like I can't even make it past those first initial barriers of chatting and making a basic level connection with someone before they decide they're not really that in to me. 

I am really at my wits end. I have long-standing issues with depression and absent self-esteem (I don't really understand the concept?). I don't want a relationship to get rid of these things but equally its hard to see anything positive in myself when my attempts are just met with this constant low-level rejection. Is it better to switch off and just hope I luck into something and don't wind up one of those sad lonely people who've never had romance in their life, or is there something more proactive I'm just completely missing?

Gross teeth/bad breath


Please fellas, use mints/gum. And brush your teeth before a date. Plaque is nasty and if your date notices she is not going to want to kiss you. Teeth whitening kits are $30 at most supermarkets.... If you need one, use one. 


2. Clothes


Wear CLEAN clothes that fit well.  Wear Nice pants or shorts ( no basketball shorts or cargo shorts on a first date). You're trying to make a good first impression. No holes unless the clothing is made that way, and absolutely no stains . And fellas, if your date is at 6 p.m. do not come wearing the same shirt you put on at 6a.m. Even if you're a clean and hygienic guy, it's not going to smell like downy anymore and she's going to think you have B.O. Bonus points if you're wearing something that isn't in your OLD pics. 


3. Shit talking how hard dating is. 


Don't complain about OLD apps, the women you've met on them, or your other exes. It comes across as bitter AF and misogynistic. 


4. Negativity


If you spend most of the date complaining about your job, your family, your dating past, your friends, the pandemic, etc... It's going to be a major turn off. Very few women want to date or fuck someone that they feel sorry for. Save all your drama and bullshit for your therapist, close friends, or for future dates when you've built an emotional connection

5. Being too complimentary. 


You don't need to shower your date with compliments the entire time. If you do, it comes across cheesy and disingenuous.


6. Getting too deep too fast. 


Don't ask about her biggest regrets, sexual history,  break ups, ten year plan, etc. Avoid topics like religion and politics. Don't mention money at all. 


7. Getting too invested. 


Just enjoy the moment.. the only plans you should discuss on the first date, are the plans for the second date (and honestly I wouldn't even do that. So many times I see posts where OP is confused about why she would agree to a second date during the first and then ghost/cancel. Truth is most of those times she just agreed because you were in front of her when she asked  it's just super weird and awkward to reject a total stranger to their face on a date). Even if you're joking, do not talk about future dates, holidays together, vacations, and God forbid what your kids would look like or what you'd want to name them. 


8. Being too sexual or touchy feely


Fellas, I see this topic thrown around and discussed a lot on dating subreddits. It is 100% better to not physical enough than to be too physical. I've never said no to a second date because the guy wasn't physical or didn't go for a kiss, but I have said no because he acted in the opposite way (and I fucking love sex and have a high sex drive). Truth is, too many guys only want sex and even if you are not one of those guys, if you lead with that she's just going to assume that you are.


9. Making it too long/Trying too hard


Fellas, keep it short, sweet, and casual. Leave her wanting more! She shouldn't think that she knows your entire life story after the first date, and if she does, she might not be in a huge rush to see you and learn more. Don't plan a date that will last hours and don't take her to a fancy expensive restaurant. Meet for a couple rounds of drinks, one cup of coffee, play one game of bowling. 
And lastly...


10. It wasn't fun


Make it fun and light hearted!  You are on a first date, not trying to determine if she's going to be your wife and the mother of your kids. Have fun and try to make sure she has fun. Don't ask the same generic interview type questions we all get tired of.

Thank you. 

As an immigrant living here in the United States since 2017, I find it very challenging to connect with Americans when it comes to dating, im 31 y/o gay, so I am basically looking for 31 to 45 y/o, so basically not into younger than me, and not too old either that we would end up having nothing in common due to age gap. I know it is extremely difficult to find a good match in the gay world, I am also surprised to find out is not that shiny and glowing in the straight world as well. 
The only time I had a mutual connection with an American is when I was living in rural Oregon in during the fall of 2017, but things were bit complicated back then and it would be impossible to have a relationship. 
Since I moved back to NYC in 2019, I never had a genuine connection even sexual with an American,  it's always a one time date or a one time sex, the only American guys who seem interested in me are guys older than 50. 
On the flip side, I had genuine connections with Europeans, even if they didn't lead to the outcome that I truly want (wich is a Long-term relationship), but I could see that there was something,  like multiple dates, good sex, or even friendship. Actually the only 3 guys I felt something for since I moved to New York were 3 Europeans(a French, a British and a German), im still friend with the French guy(who recently told me that he wants to go back to Europe cause he's having the same problem, he can't find genuine connections with Americans).

When I put my tinder in Europe, I can have hundreds of matches in a week and endless conversations, but due to the distance and also with travel it's almost impossible to have a follow up. On the other hand, I rarely get matches when I put my profile locally and when I do the conversations always end up dry and one of us will quickly lose interest. 

I met a guy in 2019, before I moved to NYC, he lives in DC, he didn't want to get serious, he kept saying that I'm too far, but now he's in a serious relationship with someone who lives in Philly(while he keeps asking me to have sex with him, I recently ask him why he wants chose the other guy over me, he honestly said that he always saw me as a sex friend, nothing more. On the flip side, I met this Austrian guy at the gym, we were both attracted to each other, but he said he can't go any further cause he's in a relationship(that was a great sign of respect for me), and now we're friends and he's the person I chat the most with on WhatsApp, like basically everyday.

Sometimes I wonder if the problem is me, or if it's a cultural shock, I don't know.  And wonder if some of you have noticed that pattern.

I was in a long term relationship for 6 years that was going south. Had a crush on another girl (NOT the reason my ex and I broke up). Recently went with my crush and other friends in our friend group to the Bucks game 6 in Milwaukee at the deer district where crowds were ridiculous. We held hands through the crowds and kept each other close. There was a point where we were just standing and holding hands watching the game. Honestly, I've never felt such a rush like that with my ex. It was amazing. Her hands are the softest I've ever felt and I could've held them for hours. Never felt this with my ex.

We're really good friends. But to my knowledge, she didn't know I liked her, especially since I'm coming out of a long term relationship. But our interactions always seem a bit too flirty for just friends and we make each other laugh a ton. The 2 of us drove 1.5 hours to and from the game and we have such great conversations that are very open and authentic. 

I ended up confessing to her after the game when I dropped her off at like 2:30AM. She was smiling a ton and I couldn't stop blushing or having a goofy grin. She was really thankful I told her instead of keeping it to myself. Didn't reject me or reciprocate though. We agreed I should be single for a while after my LTR, but I really hope this goes somewhere down the road. She agreed to be my +1 for some upcoming weddings so I'm super excited for that. We're also going to the bars tonight with some friends so we'll see how that goes 😅 

We're both in our mid to late 20's, but I honestly haven't felt something like this since my teens.

So i (16m) and a girl (16f) i’ve been talking to for a while get along very well and we’ve told eachother we like eachother and we’ve kissed and currently she’s at a cottage with her friends and i was planning on asking to make things official when she got back. Basically a few months back we were watching a movie over facetime and she made a comment about all men being trash and such which i didn’t like because i find it bad to generalize a whole group and she had said men are disgusting so does that make me disgusting? but anyway i told her the next day how i didn’t like it and how it’s not good to generalize and she apologized and everything was fine. fast forward to last night her and her friends had been drinking and i get a call from her and we start talking. then her friend comes in the room and we start talking and just being kind to eachother and everything’s normal. out of nowhere she makes a comment about how all men are trash and i say to her that it’s not good to generalize and then she says it’s based on her experience so she can. I didn’t like that she said this at all but i don’t want to argue or anything especially while she’s  drunk so i left it and just continued in as normal. Am i wrong for not liking this? I feel like if i said all women are disgusting/ trash t would be very sexist and wrong so wouldn’t it be the same for men? anyway let me know what you think and if i’m not wrong what i should do.
