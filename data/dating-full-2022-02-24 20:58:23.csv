We haven't had sex (been dating for four months) and that's the first red flag haha. It hasnt been for lack of me bringing it up. His last relationship ended 8 years ago and since then he hasn't had sex with anyone (I've asked him). I was single for two years before I got desperate and dabbled in a FWB relationship. He haven't masturbated for these four months we've been dating, but that's because he has come like twice just from making out with me (is that normal?). When we get close to finally doing it, he loses his boner. He keeps saying he might be able to have sex in the morning better but he wakes up at 7am and that's not a time I like being awake at. He has tried, he always wakes me up by touching me non-consensally at 7 am or earlier, I've told him to stop doing that, that it is not arousing me, it's the opposite, but he doesn't stop. Always says that he thought I was awake and that's why he was doing it  It's weird cause it's like he has a low sex drive but he still doesn't respect my boundaries. Anyway I've brought up that we might be incompatible but he doesn't think I have enough info because we haven't done it.

Why is it so hard to end a relationship when I find out we are sexually incompatible and that's a deal breaker for me?

I'm really having issues trying to determine if i am the problem. I ended my long term high school relationship in 2020 it was very loveless and we basically out grew each other and stayed anyway. I was miserable and i will admit because of this i became very mean and guarded. Since then i have been looking for love in the wrong places (dating apps) which has resulted in numerous flings that led me absolutely nowhere.

 In this time frame i ran into 3 guys who actually wanted something serious with me. The first was too clingy from the start he came to my dorm building 4 days in the row (sat in the car or went different places.) and i became uninterested because I felt he was too in love too soon. i later realized i was not interested in him at all and set the record straight that I don't see a romantic relationship with him. 

The second guy was a foreign exchange student from Ghana who seemed very sweet and told me he loved me the second day we spoke  after months of trying to get my attention through my direct messages shortly after. he is not currently a U.S citizen so it raised major concerns that his feelings were genuine he always treats me really kind and is funny I simply don't trust him. And his definition of i miss you basically means i miss your vagina. because he doesn't ask to do anything but get a hotel and he is very controlling at times so i became uninterested.

Lastly this guy i've known since high school and talked to on and off has come back into my life nothing bad ever happens between us life just constantly takes us in different directions. we decided to pursue our first date and it was really nice he seems a bit antsy but overall great conversation and makes me laugh and smile he tells me that he wants to pursue me seriously and i simply don't believe anything that comes out of his mouth he hasn't proven himself to be deceitful but I just feel like i have become dead to words he tells me how much he misses me when we aren't together and that he feels himself starting to get attached to me romantically. He also feels that we could be long ter.

 For me I have to spend time with a person in order to feel an attachment to them but i don't like feeling too much at once because it feels fake. Is something wrong with me. Its really hard for me to trust people with my heart and I just don't want to give anyone a chance to hurt me but ultimately i want to be loved by someone. And grow old with them. Am i crazy for thinking something is wrong with people expressing there feelings to me or are they just liars and i smell the bullshit

&amp;#x200B;

Also I get told that I'm mean a lot but I can say I have a very harsh way of telling the truth which i am working on. and I don't want to be seen as a mean or negative person. Guys have told me that they cant tell if i like them or not or I'm a mystery.

I have never been in a serious relationship but i really only started to actually try dating two years ago. I mostly have been struggling with OLD apps,  I'm a 25-year-old dude, getting my bachelor's in MechE this spring, and based off what people have told me i guess I'm not a bad-looking guy, though I'm not entirely convinced of that yet lol. I also think i have a pretty decent personality, though i do struggle with depression and anxiety but I've been seeing my therapist to work on that. Despite this people seem to like hanging out with me and i've noticed that women seem to feel comfortable around me. For some reason, i still can't manage to get a date from apps, like last semester i hit around 70ish matches and had some pretty good conversations with most of them, but they either stop replying or unmatch. I had a few girls agree to go on dates, but the day of they would just ghost. It really sucks because there was this one girl who i really vibed with and she seemed very excited about going on a date, but then she just ended up ghosting me too. I'm really confused about what i could be doing wrong, all my friends think its kinda weird that i was able to get so many matches but no dates, and tbh i do too. I would usually just ask them out after a few days or the same day if we vibed well, i also showed my convos to lots of people and no one thought i was doing anything wrong. Its been bugging me for a while now and i've started to think that maybe me being Black/Hispanic is the reason why i know its kinda silly to think that but i can't think of anything else. What's kinda funny is that irl i seem to do a lot better, i've managed to hook up and mess around with girls i thought were completely out of my league. The last person i was seeing was actually someone i had matched with before on tinder, talked with for a bit, and then she stop replying. When i met her last fall we realized a few days after that we had already spoken on tinder before. She did tell me that my tinder profile didn't do me justice at all, which I'm not quite sure what she meant by that but I'm assuming its a good thing.  

So yeah i don't really know what to do at this point, I'm not desperate to be in a relationship but it would be nice.

A month later I accepted a new position at my old job and have since moved back (partially I think so I could see her again.)

She wanted to grab breakfast when I got back to town and it was nice. My feelings for her fluttered back and even after a year of not seeing her in person our vibe was very natural. She had Uber‚Äôd there but I drove her home and she told me she‚Äôd like to hang out if I wanted to as well, to which I said of course.

We see eachother socially in a bigger group weekly. 2 weeks ago i finally asked her to dinner on the pretext that i had never had a certain type of cuisine before that she had talked about when we were at a dinner party previously.  i was not totally surprised when she said yes because we always have had good chemistry but was pleasant happy that she accepted because we usually socialize in a larger group exclusively and chat in a larger group thread so to pull jer out of that and get some one on one time was huge I think. She could not go to dinner the weekend of so we had to plan it 2 weeks out. Plenty of time for her to get cold feet or ditch out but she stuck with it even though we had to change our day and reservations several times. She even offered to change her schedule so she was very accomodating and seemed eager to go out. Day of the date she was the first to confirm we were still on. Usually i am the first one to do this so I took that as a good sign too. She did not hug when we first met but she doesnt strike me as much of a hugger.  Dinner was great. Conversation was lively and.interesting and did not lag. She seemed a bit tense but loosened after a bit and a couple drinks.  we passed on dessert but I suggested going someplace else for drinks and she accepted. She said she wanted to go someplace quiet which I liked. Seems she wanted to carry on conversation. We headed home after 1 drink at 1030 which was early but we had to both work today and it was a weeknight. t/o the date I tried to initiate physical contact eg. it was cold outside so I linked our elbows and leaned in as we walked down the street. She did not pull or lean away  but i did notice she did not initiate this type if contact during subsequent opportunites. During the cab ride home we sat in the back but w the middle seat btwn us.  I grabbed her hand and was commenting on her nails which she let me do but we did not hold hands.  We ended the date with a hug goodbye.  I of course was hoping for more but didnt want to psuh it and feel i made a respectful read of the situation.  Also.  She offered to pay half the dinner tab.  idk if this is a good or bad thing.  i always insist on paying and somehow feel miffed if she offers, as if she is saying maybe this is just a friendly date...who knows ultimately she let me pay and i said you can take me out and pay next time which she was agreeable too.

I thought she looked cute in it and took of a screenshot (snapchat lets the other user know if you take a screenshot). I did this in a flirty way, but she left my next message on opened.

That was 2 years ago and I've only casually dated since then, 3 weeks to a couple months was all and I was fine with that. 

But this is where the problem lies...I met this girl and she's really incredible, i haven't been impressed like this. Sweet, beautiful, smart, the whole 9 yards. We had an instant connection and ended up going on a date last weekend and it was the best date I've been on and she was definitely having a great time too...But the end of the night rolls around and I felt a shift in the mood. I was really confused, then no kiss at the end of the night just a hug and the texts that have been sent since then just seem like she's just being polite.

In all this I'm thinking what is going on? and then I realized, I've never really had to pursue a girl. It's just been sex on the first date kinda thing since i was 18 and i didn't think anything of it because it's a privilege to get laid lol.

So in this situation now, idk if I just don't know what pursuit looks like? or if she's just not interested.

And I kind of resented that she dumped me out of something that wasn't in my control.

Plus, I think she works remote a few days a week, so that doesn‚Äôt help. From the interactions I‚Äôve had with her she is warm, friendly, talkative, and pretty. As far as I know, she is single.

I am friends with her on Facebook and we follow eachother on Instagram. However, she barely posts. I think the last time she posted something was a picture of her cats in September. Even though she doesn‚Äôt post, she is online pretty much every day consistently.

My question is, seeing as how we barely see eachother and she barely posts on social media, how can I reach out to her without coming across as completely random and weird? I‚Äôd definitely want to take it easy and not rush into asking her out right off the bat, but how do I get a conversation started? She liked a picture of my cat I posted over the weekend. Is that a good starting point? üòπ I‚Äôm just at a loss of how to start.

But as a single father of my son, I have bunch of things to do in my life, have to take care of him, do all the stuff, work, meanwhile building a house, planning vacations, doing house stuff, etc, etc. 

My life is generally filled with things to do, I am not sitting and doing nothing, I am finding easy things to entertain myself and my son, we go to the amusement parks, walk around, socialise and increase pool of people I know.

**BUT dating is being pain in the \*ss for me, literally. I just hate it.**

On my sons birthday party, I talked with one woman, let's call her Jenny. Mother of one child, and she was being interested in talking with me, I asked her if she remembers me from some other birthday party, she said that she doesn't remember me at all. We did some chit chat, and it seemed like that she is positively responding with a body language, and I told her that we can go sometimes casually with children to amusement park, close by to her place, as I go often there, she said that she knows that I am going there and that her friend was telling her that she saw me there. I was like, how a friend can know me and I myself don't know that lady, unless they spoke to each other about me beforehand, so I thought that this might be worth a shot.

I got covid, and eventually when things ended, 10 days later, I called her out casually to that particular amusement park. Message went on read with no response. 

Another 2 girls, met on a dating app, chatted for a while. I sent jokingly a voice message to one, and expressed opinion to have a audio call, as I think that's way cooler to get to know to each other, one put some lame excuse that she heard a message too late, and the other didn't respond at all.

Third girl, let's call her Sara. With her I had a good connection (according to her I had things to talk with her, and we talked for 2 hours straight, I had to cut, due to being too late), everything went well, I was talking with her and when trying to set a date, messaged her to set a date and that I am free at this and that time over the weekend. Message seen, no response.

**I mean really? Am I doing something wrong? Am I supposed to message with people for a month, before even calling them out, or instead just simply have a friendly coffee and chit chat and if it doesn't work out, it doesn't. Should we have this ""fake"" texting infatuation, before we meet and find out that all that has been an illusion? (it happened to me more than once and I am not willing to partake it again)**

Just to mention, that Jenny and Sara are still possible choices, since proposed time by me yet hasn't ended, but I have doubt that anything will happen and that I will get another set of lame excuses that I didn't even asked for or failing to setup any meeting even if I try further on. Maybe I am wrong but time will tell me very soon.

I was talking with this cute girl at work and she gives me her number. We had some good conversations at work, but nothing very deep or long. Just good casual conversation. I text her a few days after she gives me her number, I‚Äôm planning to ask her out but I figured it did not have to be the first message I send, second or third or whatever after the usual ‚Äúhey, this is ___‚Äù. So she sends me a really thoughtful message which I respond to with some enthusiasm and a question. She then just doesn‚Äôt answer for 3 days. So I figured she wasn‚Äôt interested but maybe she just forgot or was busy. So I ask her to the event anyway, but by this point (the day before) she says she would love to but that she already had plans that day, but she would rain check for next time (it‚Äôs a trivia every two weeks). A few days later I go to a nearby brewery and she is there with a couple of coworkers; there happens to be trivia there that night so I ask if I can join them and things seemed fine. I message her a few days later to thank her for letting me join their group not really expecting any sort of response at this point, but she gives me the ole ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm glad you came it was great to see you you really helped us out!‚Äù. So over the next few weeks it goes like this: I‚Äôll try to invite her to something, she won‚Äôt respond for days and then will text me apologizing saying she would‚Äôve loved to have gone but such and such came up. She seems genuinely like she would‚Äôve liked to go. So I try to continue the conversation with her and she just goes ghost again without saying anything. So like she clearly is not interested, why she is framing her responses to sound like she is upset she couldn‚Äôt go is beyond me, but whatever. Anyway, come today she texts me saying her and her friends are going to that trivia again and asking if I want to join them. So I say sure, I‚Äôll see you there. Well come time for trivia,she, nor none of her friends even show up?! Never sends me any sort of message, doesn‚Äôt call. I already assumed she was not interested based on the fact it was like pulling the to try to talk to her through text. I was going to leave her alone at this point until she asks me to join her and her friends.

I had gotten these Star Wars with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra tickets for my birthday. I texted my boyfriend about scheduling the date we would want to go. So he asks to Zoom. So we Zoom and we start talking and everything seems fine. He wanted to look at my Ancestry since I just got my results a couple days ago. After that he starts talking about not being sure if we are meant to be together and talking about taking a pause.  He gets emotional and continues to say whether we stay in a relationship or remain friends, he wants me in the rest of his life and talked about still taking me to Medieval Times (for my birthday) and to Galaxy's Edge during the summer with his sister's park passes. And that was just really confusing. 

After calming down and when he was less emotional, he said he was feeling better and that all he wanted to do in that moment was have me come over so he could cuddle me, hug me, and kiss me. He then proceeded to ask for some time to think and would call me back. I don't like talking about such things as taking a pause virtually or over the phone. These kinds of conversations are best held in person so both people can have the same understanding and be on the same page.

Anyways, he calls back on Snapchat video chat. He apologizes for what he said earlier. Basically, he called his one friend and through their conversation he said he has been feeling stressed about not getting to do all the things he was into pre-pandemic. So he wants to take time to get back into those hobbies without feeling the pressure to think about/focus on/entertain a relationship. In addition, a new position is opening up at his job and he wants some time to think about if he wants to make that part of his career path. However, while he was talking to his friend, he said he felt less and less inclined to actually take a pause. He also said he felt torn between taking the pause vs. inviting me over.

When discussing the ""guidelines"" for the pause, he said he wants keep our Snapchat streak going, and can still send each other things on Instagram and from Facebook, but no calling or texting unless it's like an emergency.  He also is not going to watch the new episodes of the show we watch together till after the pause. In addition, he mentioned he may or may not jump my bones after the pause. He even said he may reach out on Saturday asking to see that booty (lol). We decided to reevaluate and check in after two weeks. He said he still loved a lot about me and indirectly said that he would still want me at the end of a very hard two weeks. 

My track record in relationships that continue after taking time/space/a break/pause has not been good. Taking a break worked for my brother and his wife. It also worked for the friend my boyfriend called. 

My boyfriend has already sent me snap on snapchat and shared things with me on Instagram and Facebook and it's only day 1. I'm also a bit confused by him wanting to take a pause, but staying in touch and talking about being together afterwards. Is this a good sign for a positive result after the two week pause?

Tl/dr: Boyfriend asked for a pause, but wants to stay in touch through social media and talks about being together at the end of the two weeks. Personally, it's not been good when relationships take time/space/break/pause. I'm confused by him wanting to take a pause and at the same time wanting to be together afterwards. My boyfriend initiated contact on Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook on Day 1.

Firstly, I can't believe the amount of responses I got on my original post (over 200 holy shiz). Thank you to everyone who took the time to read my post and provide me with helpful advice. I read each and every comment and really took everything to heart. 

A week ago, I ended up seeing him for the first time in a few months and essentially just told him everything I wrote in that post. I also apologized for anything I may have said or done that hurt him or made him feel inadequate, and I told him I wish I had spoken up sooner because at the end of the day I just really wanted my friend back. 

Surprisingly he was super receptive to me explaining my feelings, and after I was done he profusely apologized for everything. He said he knows he was taking out his insecurities on me, and he apologized for vocalizing his feelings for me at the wrong time in his life. He told me that despite everything, he loves and cares about me and wants to be a part of my life. We both agreed we can't change the past (as much as we wish we could) but that we would make up for lost time together in the future. We committed to moving forward as FRIENDS without tension, passive aggression or resentment.

Not the cliche type of guy tho, I just was dealt a rough hand at birth and it took me some years to feel emotionally available for anyone. On the opposite, I'm a pretty chatty and flirtatious guy and I've been told quite some times I'm good looking, I've just never seized any opportunity further than that because I didn't feel comfortable with intimacy. I always had a good excuse to not do anything more than kissing. Not trying to justify myself, but just that I know everyone who learns I'm a virgin is pretty shocked usually, and I'm 99% sure it never crossed my match's mind.

Anyway, I'm in a better place now for about a year or so and am supposed to go on a date tomorrow with a Tinder girl. Nothing guarantees sex of course and I'm not going there just for sex, I believe we had a good connection through text and I'm really curious to meet her. 

But there's a possibility that one day or another we might have sex and idk how to deal with the fact that I'm a virgin. If I do tell her, that'd be once we're getting physical I guess, but that might throw off the whole vibe. On the other hand, I don't think I'd feel comfortable not saying it, not mentioning the fact I might be a bad lay anyway because a first is a first.

I (M, 24) recently took a woman (23) that I met on Tinder out for dinner. It went really well, and she also told me that I looked better in person. After dinner, we went back to my place and had sex. I thought it was really good; and by all accounts, she seemed to feel the same way.

We did not discuss what we were on the app for proactively. Personally, I'm interested in a relationship.

Anyway, after we slept together, she told me a lot of personal stuff. I asked her if she wanted to sleep over, but she said that she wanted to get home because she had work in the morning. I asked her if she wanted to see me again; and she looked at me dumbfounded--like 'Duh. Of course, I want to see you again.'

I felt really intense feelings about her after I dropped her off. Honestly, this is unusual for me. Generally, I can't tell whether I like a woman or not. I sleep with her and realize that I don't. During the following days, historically, women have texted me--almost as if we were already in a relationship because of the act of sex--and I've been kind of disinterested.

Anyway, I texted her during the following days, and we engaged in a lot of perfunctory conversations. At night, I've sent her some long text confessing that I felt strongly. She told me that it was better to talk about in person. The only thing she said definitively is that she wants to take things slowly. I did tell her that I was looking for something serious, and she said she was open to things--only that she was NOT interested in casual sex.

When we were planning the date, she told me she would be busy all week, so I don't feel like she's evading me. But she said ""maybe"" to plans for the weekend (we've set them up tentatively, but she said she may have to run out of town for family obligations).

Since I dropped her off, all I've thought about is seeing her again. She hasn't really given off the same vibe. I never thought ""simping"" after sex would be a problem--only beforehand. Is it off-putting? Have I freaked her out? Seemed desperate? Do I risk giving her the so-called ""ick""?

But that doesn't match with what I see elsewhere or in real life. In real life, most of my friends say to give online dating a try. Every single one of them met their girlfriends/boyfriends on a dating app.

This study from Stanford says that heterosexual couples are more likely to meet a romantic partner online than through personal contact and connections. Meeting online is now the most popular way U.S. couples connect. This was before the pandemic, and I think the pandemic has pushed even more people towards online dating, so it's probably even more popular now.

The Pew Research Center did a study in 2020 and found that:

* 3 in 10 American have used a dating site or app overall, but if you look at the 18-29-year-old age group, then it's higher at 48%
* 77% have gone on a date with someone they met through the dating site/apps, and 39% have gotten married or been in a committed relationship with someone they met through the dating site/app
* 57% who have ever used a dating site or app say their own personal experiences have been very or somewhat positive; the majority say it was easy to find other users they found attractive, shared their interests
* 71% of online daters report that it was at least somewhat easy to find people on dating sites or apps that they found physically attractive
* About 2/3 say it was easy to find people who shared their hobbies or interests or seemed like someone they would want to meet in person
* 50% say dating apps have had neither a good or a bad effect on relationships. 22% say it's had a mostly positive effect, and 26% say it's had a mostly negative effect.

Why does there seem to be such a skewed perspective here? Is it because of a loud minority? Or a self-selecting bias since people who do find success wouldn't be here to begin with? Because when I look at the data above, dating apps don't seem like such a bad way to meet people.

All the people I meet in real life say I should just give it a go. If it works great! If it doesn't work, so what? It's just another method to use, so why not just try it out?

She(F22) and I(M22) met at our job. we started talking on way back to metro after leaving office and during lunch hours.

After around a week ,3rd wave hit and it was complete work for home for 3 weeks ‚Ä¶during that time she left the job to study for the professional degree she is pursuing(i am pursuing the same degree) and went back to her home town.
I didn‚Äôt have her number and it felt like a creep to get her number from the company records so i e-mailed her a meme, she replied in text and we got on calls from that day on. 

We clicked immediately and have the same nerdy interests .  I‚Äôm sure she likes me (gives me compliments and flirts) but there is one issue . She says says that she will come back to the city after the exam for job .. which will happen at least after 1 year. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do , i have read that long distance relationships don‚Äôt last very long and i am scared as i feel that basically what i am doing is delaying the pain of breakup( now or in 2-3 months).

I‚Äôm not that good looking and it‚Äôs extremely difficult to  find a girl who is even half as smart beautiful and self aware as she is, not the mention as ambitious as i am. 

I even don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just a practice guy for her or she really likes me and could lead to something serious. I seriously doubt i am that I‚Äôm actually attractive/interesting to her.

 **23\[M4F\] California looking for a reason to not off myself.** 

 I‚Äôm ugly af, I‚Äôm short, I‚Äôm fat, I‚Äôm pretty quite and boring I guess. My jokes range from wishing death upon myself and making fun of messed up shit üåö. I hate being alive, I hate existing I drink pretty much every night to forget that my existence for women is meaningless and ‚Äúloving‚Äù myself wouldn‚Äôt change how they view because of everything above. I‚Äôll never be normal I‚Äôll always be clingy and will wish I had a girlfriend that actually loved me. Idk only things I like nowadays are video games and music. I wasted my time making this post because I‚Äôm not going to fuckin meet anyone who actually gives a fuck to help me be complete eve, not worth it.

So anyway I just thought I'd share that guy's post with everyone and here is his username as well:  u/Foreveralone2123 

I was thinking about messaging to help him out but can someone please send out their own messages too? Because I'm honestly not the best therapist.

Honestly idk why he's posting on here if he's hopeless.

I feel bad for people like this, and idk if that's a good thing or a bad thing.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1161486,public,self,I feel bad for this guy that I found on r/ForeverAloneDating.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t0v2o0/i_feel_bad_for_this_guy_that_i_found_on/,no_ads,0.0,,,
