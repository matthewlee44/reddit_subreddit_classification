I enjoyed talking with her. I thought she was attractive so I thought I‚Äôd see if there was any physical connection. I didn‚Äôt want to have sex per say, just to feel the energy behind the kissing.

13,ptnetc,1632370814,I get the sense that one of my friends is jealous that I'm with the person who's now my boyfriend instead of him. Should I talk to him about it?,"So, for reference, I'm 16. And I have a group of about 10 friends that I've been with since kindergarten and first grade. We've grown up in the same neighborhood together and have generally just been there for each other when we needed it. And I'm one of three other girls in our group. Growing up, I never really thought any of my guy friends had a crush on me and we never really expressed our feelings much. It was when I was in middle school that I had my first boyfriend, which wasn't any of them and was just another classmate. Didn't last long though.

At the end of last year, I was approached by who is essentially the ""quiet one"" of our group. Doesn't talk much but is kind of funny and polite and all that. We share a lot of the same interests too like video games, comics, etc. And when he ""asked me out"", I legit thought he just wanted to hang out like we normally do lol. But no, he actually wanted to take me on a date and things went from there.

Now, the person I'm referencing in my title is essentially the ""class clown"" of us. Always making jokes and generally a hilarious person. But ever since I started seeing my now boyfriend, I noticed he's just not the same as he used to be. He doesn't make jokes like he used to, especially when me and my boyfriend are in the same room as him. Though whenever he's with other people, he's normal. I can only suspect jealousy is what he's feeling.

For example there‚Äôs this girl in my class, I think she‚Äôs really cute, we talked once or twice and I‚Äôd say there seems like a neutral vibe going on, but it‚Äôs hard to tell bc she‚Äôs not that expressive. I don‚Äôt like rejection, especially from girls I actually like and now that I go to bars and clubs, I find real life is a lot harder in the sense that when everyone is drunk, things just happen and you‚Äôll know if someone finds you attractive. 

I can‚Äôt get over the fact that it might be awkward and that I‚Äôm going to look like an idiot if I take that leap of faith.

I'd like to see him more and feel he is intentionally creating space due to lockdowns.

I've been very cautious due to some bad experiences after now being single over 2 years and he discussed coming out of a 7 year relationship about 1.5 years ago. 
We have been open about our pasts although I still have a wall up.

While I'm still building trust with him, I'm feeling triggered since he gave me flowers after I was quite sick for a few days. The triggers are memories of bad experiences which has led me to overthink EVERYTHING about our relationship and how genuine he actually is, what he thinks and wants. 

He's been thoughtful, kind and has insisted on paying for everything. He remembers everything I share with him and initiates all our dates. None of this however is enough to make me feel he is trusting and I don't know how to share this with him, and if I even should? 

Is it too soon to discuss triggers and my overall anxiety with moving things forward? How is it best to communicate this?

I wish I'd dealt with the warnings signs earlier when I could fix them because I really liked this girl and thought it would go the distance. But I was tied up with work 24/7 and I just didn't have the space for anything else. I kept thinking I'm gonna finish my work and then rekindle my relationship later. I finally finished my work project a couple days after we broke up, I guess that's just how life goes. We broke up over a very brief 30-second phone call. I just said we should see different people and she agreed. We wished each other well and hung up. It wasn't cordial or polite per se but just quick and to the point. There was a lot left unsaid.

Anyway, I sent my ex back her stuff yesterday. I found a funny pair of panties that said GET YOUR FREAK ON in big neon letters that she wore to my place one time. I wrote her a brief letter to let her know there were no hard feelings, said thank you for the great moments we shared, and signed the letter with ""BD' (not my actual initials) for something she used to call me jokingly before we had sex. Then I tied the letter with the funny panties and put it in the box.

She had a great sense of humor so I hope she got a chuckle out of it. We used to make corny weird sex jokes all the time. I just wanted her to know there are no hard feelings and I'm really glad I met her. But now I'm wondering if it was disrespectful.

23,ptohzc,1632375259,[M22] girls stopped liking me overnight - major dating problems.,"I had my first girlfriend in Kindergarten and many more throughout jr. high and early high school - this was something I never even thought about. I mean 10/10 amazing girls (e.g., smart, popular, cool, beautiful girls). Girls just wanted to be my girlfriend... until junior year of high school. Junior year of high school I went through puberty, and overnight, my relationship with girls changed drastically. I was a goon: girls felt comfortable around me and I'd win them over with humor. However, after Junior year that changed... now I get cold-shouldered, ignored, and honestly, it just seems like I repel women.

I don't think I'm bad-looking. I'm pretty confident, good at sales, I rock climb, play instruments, speak Spanish; I'm pretty educated for my age, and I'm pretty successful, too - like I think I'm pretty cool... I've even asked friends to critique what I'm doing wrong in the social settings; they always come back pretty dumbfounded: they say there is nothing I could have done better. I'm good at sales and always had girlfriends lol - I promise I'm not socially inept. Really it just feels like the only thing that has changed is girls aren't down to give me a chance, at all.

I feel pretty bad, honestly - like I'm cursed. I don't think I've changed really. I'm the same dude I always have been. I watch all my friends &amp; roommates go on dates, have girlfriends, hookups pretty effortlessly, and I'm totally isolated. Is there any advice out there?

I‚Äôm back again with another question. Before I get to that I just wanna say I (a male) recently had a first date with this girl I met who is currently in college and I‚Äôm not but will be starting it back up again next spring season. Our first date went pretty well I believe. We were both very awkward and we both did a lot to try and keep the conversation going. The only thing I‚Äôd say was bad was the ending. When I brought her back to her home I was really nervous and panicked on what I should do and just dropped her off without saying really anything. I felt really bad and messaged her a thank you for the date and an apology for being really awkward and dropping her off without so much as even a handshake. She told me it was alright and that she‚Äôd be down to hangout again when she comes back in a few weeks (I believe it‚Äôs every 2 weeks). We only have a single day to go on a date every few weeks because of our schedules. Even texting isn‚Äôt an option because she‚Äôs not very good at responding and I don‚Äôt try texting her because I don‚Äôt wanna bother her and waiting days or up to a week for a response isn‚Äôt really what I want which like I said in another post I made I‚Äôm ok with it now because she‚Äôs busy with school and I‚Äôm working and doing my stuff. 

Advice I want: 

I just wanna ask what I should do for a second date in terms of progressing the relationship between us. I was very awkward and stiff as a board the first date and I didn‚Äôt try to make any moves on her and didn‚Äôt touch her in any way not even an attempt at a kiss. I want to make it known to her that I want to hold her hand or just walk close together arms around waist or shoulders or even kiss her but I‚Äôm not sure if I should just ask her or make some subtle move that ends up with my arms around her shoulders. I‚Äôm not very good or experienced when it comes to taking girls on dates and making moves, flirting that type of stuff.

Two of them have been serious relationships and the most recent one seems like it has potential to be another serious relationship. This is almost half the women I have been with and it's feeling pretty weird. It doesn't help that I have a relative with the same name. I feel weird, I don't like it and think my family is also going to start to feel weird if I bring home another girl with the same name. However, I don't want to let something stupid like a name or what my family thinks come in between something potentially great. 
I don't particularly have an attraction to the name as a a matter of fact I find it a very bland name, like a man being named Bill or George. 
I'm not really into ""basic"" women either so it's not like I'm seeking out the white girl yoga pants pumpkin spice crowd that will typically have names like Kaitlyn, Emily, Jessica etc...
All of these women have been very different people with different interests, style, and physical features. 
The girl I'm seeing now is a very crunchy granola outdoorsy girl who is also a musician and went to a hippy college and she's really fucking cool. The last girl (Kaitlyn) was a ski racing banker farmers daughter who went to an ivy league school. 
What I am trying to say is the only thing these women have in common is the same name and it makes me feel weird for seemingly no reason. I need some advice on whether I should just never date women with that name out of principal and just call this current fling off or if I should just ignore it and keep doing what I'm doing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ptqc30/dating_multiple_women_with_the_same_name/

43,ptqr1z,1632385642,Dealing with Jealousy,"Long story short. I've never been incredibly successful in dating. That seems to be the titular consensus that many of us have but mine has been, especially rough. I have lost weight, changed jobs, and have acquired a small inner circle of friends so that I can facilitate some semblance of a social life.   


The problem is this: of my male social group, which is just really 2 other bro's, I am, it seems subjectively/objectively, the uglier of the bunch. These guys are great btw, and how I feel isn't any sort of indictment on them, by any means. 

  
That being said, I'm beginning to despise that aspect of our friendship. It's becoming more difficult to enjoy the comradery as the sort of attention they receive from women is not what I experience on any sort of level.   


For instance, on multiple occasions, when we've been to bars together, they both, have had women purchase drinks for them, flirtations happen quite a bit but that same can't be said of me. Also, the sheer amount of rejections is...alarming. I'm not some sort of social pariah. I've never had the feeling that I come across as creepy, just...a lack of interest. It's becoming embarrassing and when they are around at least, I do not approach women any longer because of the unsettling feeling.   


To a degree, I've come to bear a grudge against them for something that is not their fault at all.   


I feel absolutely foolish. I'm 37. This should be a non-issue, yet, my mind drifts towards it. How do I deal with these feelings of inadequacy and not bear ill will against my friends? I, like them, prefer casual dating, absolutely nothing serious, however their results are remarkable, compared to mine.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ptqr1z/dealing_with_jealousy/
44,ptqvhf,1632386227,Texting people should not make you anxious : a friendly reminder,"You sit by your phone. Your heart races. Will he/she text me back? You open snapchat and to your horror, there it is. The empty red/purple arrow next to their bitmoji saying ""opened 20 minutes ago"". Or you go to your iMessage and it says ""read at..."". Now, your heart sinks. Your head spins. Why didn't they reply? Do they not like me anymore? And then they ghost you.

It sucks. Its so so so hurtful. You question everything you ever said or did around them. You question your entire self-worth. And then one day- they suddenly come back with a lame excuse. You know you shouldn't take them back, but you do because of how desperate you were for them to want you. And then they do it all over again. I am here to tell you, you don't deserve to feel that way. 

I don't know why dating has come to this in todays generation (I'm 22F so I'm a part of it). This kind of behaviour is abusive, period. 

This is not normal. Sitting there waiting for a text from someone, wasting your precious and limited time on the planet is. not. normal. Wondering why someone suddenly stopped contacting you is unfair on no one but you. Your phone should be a useful piece of technology. Not a source of anxiety and temporary self-worth. 

If they make you wonder whether they like you- drop their sorry ass and move on. You deserve better. Seriously, your time here is limited. You don't want to look back and realise you wasted your hottest years questioning yourself because of someone else's shitty behaviour.

Focus on yourself. Your goals. What makes you happy? Block them if you need to. No, blocking is not petty. It gives you peace of mind and cuts off energy vampires who do not deserve any kind of insight into your life.

while a bit introverted, i do make an effort to be social at least sometimes. admittedly i haven't made a move on anyone, i just feel too shy and awkward. but i do have a good group of friends, i go out to places with those friends every now and then. during lockdown i've even made some great online friends and i've kept in contact with a girl i met in class earlier this year. so it's not like i'm completely horrible at talking to people

i don't think i'm picky when it comes to dating, all i want it someone who's nice and someone who lives nearby me (as opposed to meeting someone online from another country, which is advice i've received elsewhere)

i know i can be 'ocd' sometimes, but it doesn't seem to be an issue with my friends, they just understand me. i also have a phobia of phone calls and always say no to them (which has annoyed friends before) but i promise i try my best

i've tried to be as open and willing and relaxed as possible when it comes to dating (especially lately). dating wasn't really a problem in my mind until recently, i always told myself it'd happen eventually, but sometimes i wonder why nothing's ever happened before

Dear prospective friend/ women,

I'm welcoming any open-minded women who respect my views &amp; opinions, as I will too. 

I am 27 years old and I'm from Bangladesh. 

My hobbies are: Reading, Vocal composing, online research, ideological gossiping,  travelling etc. 

My strengths are: passionately curious, Straightforward, open-hearted, ambitious, well-mannered, empathic, caring, family-oriented, Shy, funny, friendly, respectful, self-esteemed, grateful.

Moreover, I'm a virtual assistant, able to business develop through, lead generation, build over lacs of phone contacts database, any data collection like email, mobile etc. from any website, 2d to 3d design, audio isolation and mixing &amp; so on.

My dreams: Exploration Geologist, Audio production with moral lyrics, make videography with traveling on an open places etc.

And also consider myself a decent-looking man. But appearance is not the key element about me, cause I can offer way more than that!

I believe every human being does mistakes, and so do I, so does everyone else. It's what makes us human and we have to learn from those mistakes.

I'm happy to get to know you and adjust to you, as do I welcome learning new things for you and from you, being an eager learner.

I have many dreams and wishes I would love to share with you, I see myself as very hardworking and dedicated to achieve what I want to.

I am invested into religion and have been for the past 10 years, but I don't traditionally follow it, but logically.

Now with being 27, I'm worried I'm running out of time, so I do hope to find a woman who fits to me and who thinks the same about me. I hope there might be someone on the corner of the world who could feel deeply for me. As I would for them.

I would love to hear from you!

Many thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ptrdwf/neurodiversity_makes_my_relationship_and/

Months later she admits she wasn't over her ex and only was talking to me like that because she was ""vulnerable"". Lol

This whole thing was a huge blow to my self esteem and I'm still suffering mentally from it honestly. I'm not super experienced with relationships (dating as a racially ambiguous dude fucking sucks) so I got pretty attached to her.

We got really close emotionally during this time and I helped her through a bunch of depressive episodes. We talked about a lot of shit and actually started a nonprofit org together earlier so she eventually started to reengage with me saying she wanted to 'keep me around' and that I 'had potential'. Whatever that means. She asked for us to be friends so we could work on stuff together for grad school.

I got ticked off and went off on her because of the way she gave me the cold shoulder, and basically told her I didn't feel like she cared about me. I said that I don't know how I'm supposed to be friends with someone who's willing to cast me aside like trash after the way I was there for them. Her response was to say I was being ""very manipulative with her.""

Apparently telling somebody how I feel and why I'm upset with them is being manipulative now? It feels like these gen z girls just call everybody who has an issue with them manipulative/gaslighting just to absolve themselves of blame. I honestly wish I could be friends with her but even just thinking about her and the way she treated me makes me way too upset.

Again she's plainly expressed she wants more. 

We had a chat about our futures. I love her and could see us being together but there's 2 issues, one of which i feel like a selfish ass for. 
1 - I want kids, she does not. I've always known I wanted children. Adopting does appeal to me somewhat but even if I did adopt a child I want bio kids too. She doesn't want kids for a few reasons, primary reasons include fears of passing on genetic issues her family has. 
2 - I want to sexually experiement. I don't really consider myself poly but I like the idea of me and my partner sometimes bringing in another girl. I feel like an ass for this, i feel selfish as fuck but when i think about what id want in life this is a part of it. She has no interest in this whatsoever. 

We talked about it and we're pretty much where we were before except now we both know what each person is thinking. We consider ourselves to be datting while im here and when im gone... super flirty friends. She's glad I was fully honest with her though she is disappointed. We've only known each other about 4 months and this has been a faster romance than ive ever experienced, I know thats related to my emotional instability and she recognizes it too. As for her Im actually her first boyfriend. 

So we have an emotionally fucked up 26 year old boy trying to figure out life and a 29 year old virgin girl in her first relationship. Yah she's a virgin, and Im fucking terrified of hurting her because I realize how easy I could being her first if we get there and things don't work out. I realize how much trust she's put into me, how vunerable she's let herself be too me both emotionally and physically. We've done some things sexually but she won't have penetrative sex because of no long term commitment and fearing how it'd hurt her heart. I respect that, at this point I'd sooner be shot in the arm than have her feel like I used her. 

So idk what I'm doing. Idk what the purpose of this post even is, I just felt like I needed to say it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pttw5g/im_emotionally_unstable_have_the_best_girl_on_the/
73,ptucjc,1632400900,Girl I am seeing is giving me mixed signals,"So I have been seeing this girl for some weeks now, and I'm hella confused what to do next. 

I feel like after the 6 dates we had we know some stuff about each other, but our conversations are often lacking a flow. She barely asks me stuff and seems barely interested in me when we talk. The only time I feel like we have great chemistry, is when we make out, although we didn't have sex yet. The intensity how we make out, however is getting more intense everytime. This is actually one of the few times I see some type of passion in her eyes. The conversation problems we have are making me kinda insecure, paired with her talking about cool other guys are and stuff like that. So some days I felt very confident, and the dates and conversations were better, but sometimes her lack of affection makes me insecure, so we have a hard time talking to each other. 

The problem is: I don't know if I am like this, because I kinda like her already and want to make it work (expecting my insecurities to vanish after we're more close to each other), I am probably expecting to get really in love with her if we keep this going. Or the second possibility could be, and I'm feeling this for a long time, that she's just leading me on for attention and doesn't really care about me. I never was in a situation like this, so I don't know if I am just being an insecure fuck, or my gut feeling is actually correct on this. 

For some context: even when our dates aren't that great, she always asks me when we are meeting the next time. Also on the better date we had last time, she asked if I am meeting other girls, and we decided to be date each other exclusively. I kinda told her about the vibe I am getting from our dates, that I like her as a person and asked her about her opinion, she just said she can't say much about it and 'wants to go with the flow'. 

Please tell me how I should interpret this, maybe I'm just being crazy and everything is fine lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ptucjc/girl_i_am_seeing_is_giving_me_mixed_signals/
74,ptulip,1632401686,How do I stop feeling ashamed of dating someone?,"I'm a single M23, a pure introvert and quite a loner. My social skills are basic at most, so I mostly hang out with my old friends. Everyone, including my family, knows that.

Because of this I never had a girlfriend until high school. She dumped me for another guy farily quickly. I wasn't really surprised, but certainly upset. People mocked me for being a 'loser' until the end of school, as did my family, though not as bluntly. My older sister had sex with her third boyfriend at the age of 16, which made me look undesirable at least. I was totally pissed when I discovered my father's secretly setting me up with his friends' daughters 'so I don't end up alone' (I wasn't 18 yet). Yes, he did it out of pity/shame. Without my knowledge. Twice.

I've tried dating since but with no luck. The first girl I've met through dating app stole my wallet and the other one, from college, was a crackhead. There were no more attempts, since I had to do this in secret and it's not easy. Because of my family's cringe behaviour I'm embarrassed to show interest in women even in front of my friends. It became like a taboo in my head, I feel bad and guilty for wanting a relationship.

I also didn't want to waste anyone's time so I just quit dating for all those years, but it's unbearable for me in the long run.

I'm amazed how casual people are with dating and bringing up the topic, even here. Has anyone experienced this?

We go on said date, every single thing i said got one word responses followed by her texting her phone then looking at me when she finished, i felt like a lab rat who was being studied more than a human being, she said a full sentence like twice on the entire date.

Also everytime i asked for her input on anything, whether it be her opinion on something or literally what flavor of ice cream she wanted, i got ""i don't know, you choose i can't decide lmao"".

Hi guys, I am looking for some hope. As sad as it sounds, I was physically abused by my Dad a couple times a week for 8 years. The verbal torture was also another thing I dealt with. I have been functional for the most part of my life, moving onto becoming educated and a good person- not resorting to drugs or alcohol as coping mechanisms. However, I‚Äôve noticed in the area of intimate relationships I struggle the most. I have seen a therapist for a couple of years now (I‚Äôm a 33 year old female btw). That has been really helpful. Now onto the fun part, I‚Äôm in a new relationship where my boyfriend is kind, loving, secure and respectful. Due to my past, I am having a hard time getting physically close to him because of my deep rooted fears. My therapist says I have a fearful avoidant attachment style and I‚Äôm terrified of men getting close to me because they will hurt me. My boyfriend would never hurt me and I consciously know that but it doesn‚Äôt stop the anxiety when he‚Äôs close. I‚Äôve tried so many coping mechanisms and I still can‚Äôt shake it.

So let's get to the point.

I am currently 20 years old, and I am a Racecar driver. Not professionaly, just as a big side-hobby.
My family has a racing background and everyone has an interest for it, therefore I always travel to races with them. Mother, Father and sister.

During this season I have been fighting (competing racing-wise not actual fighting) closesly with another racer, she is really good and we almost broke even at the end of the season.

I got to know her a little bit at the end, but as of now we are just sending casual texts/snapchats or liking /commenting on social media. Neutral but good friends.

She also brings her family when there is a race, we are very similar in that fashion. Only difference is that I dont know if she has a GF or BF, and she is 25.
She is maybe the first girl I've met that actually shares the same interests and seems nice or kind, and looks cute.

I believe she dosen't have a GF/BF but I am afraid to ask. Because if I ask that, she'll imedietly know what I am looking for... or .. well yeah you get what I am saying.

I am also afraid of the akwardness if i where to ask her to go out sometime or the ""have you got a BF/GF"" question. I know her father now so the akwardness would also affect the relationship with him..

I have a friend who I have known for since I was born. We're are both 27 living in different cities.

We met four years ago and the connection felt electric. He contacted me on Facebook when I got back home and we have been great friends ever since then. 

I met him before the pandemic and when I returned, I felt a new connection towards him. It took me by shock, still does. I never expected to fall for him. 

He is amazing and brilliant. Yet, he tells me that I'm the brilliant one. He is so genuine. A beautiful soul. In my eyes, there's no one hotter than him. 

 For two years I brushed it off and treated him as a friend. This year to stop myself from feeling I didn't talk to him for 4 months. That didn't work. I wanted to remove the infatuation, physical attraction. I tried everything. It's crazy because I have other people who are good and are present and interesting. He always feels like destiny.
 I finally gave in and decided to tell him. I went into literal high. Singing and dancing

We always talked every night. Many nights till morning about absolutely nothing. 

I thought he felt the same and I told him. It was s very scary decision but I couldn't hold back. Him not knowing. I told him that when we're in the same city, and ready to date, I'd like to see how it'll be with me and him. I told him that this thought in my head of me and him, I can't keep out.

Turns out he doesn't think we'd work out or click. And he was worried that I'd be mad at him and he'd loose me. His words. 

I offered to forget everything. I said that we go back to before that stupid day.

He said he wants to talk to me after i get over this feeling as he doesn't want to hurt me. And I again acted normal with great. 

But he ghosted me for 5 days. It was the longest days. 
And now he is contacting me on instagram with really cute memes. Funny ones.

I just reply normally but haven't initiated any conversation.
I don't think I can go back to normal now. The five days hurt like hell.

I kinda want to tell him that I can't be his friend. Because being friends would mean watching him with someone else and being okay. I can't do that. I know it'll hurt me. He is a kind spirit. And I love him. Every second about his thought makes my whole body act happy. 

I fear I'll hurt him, if I tell him that I don't want to be just friends with him. That when I decided to tell him, it was a calculated decision. I tried for a year to get over him and a year before brushing that feeling off.

Now the thing is that I didn't really pay him as much attention because I never met him and honestly I was just busy with other life things.

He moved to another city for work and mentioned that he might have a trip my city for work and that if I was interested in meeting then he would let me know when he was coming into town - I said ""Yes sounds cool"". Now, a few days ago, he said that he's coming into my city in like 2 weeks and asked to meet for lunch and texted me at like 8pm saying ""Hope you're doing well, just wondering if \[date\] works fine for you for lunch."" I honestly was busy with a lot of stuff and forgot to reply (and didn't really think it was an issue), but then the next day around 5pm he texts me ""I'll take it that you're not interested, that's totally okay and I wish that you just said that. Best of luck going forward"". Like what? What changed now? Anyways I deleted him from my Instagram and everything but then when I started to look into him (his Linkedin and Facebook, etc) he seems like a very very smart guy (went to a top law and business school in the US, like Ivy) and has a job that pays very well. Most of his pictures are with his mom and brother on Facebook/Instagram. I think he might be a little socially awkward and might have not that many friends because his replies are always like he's responding to a work email (who even says ""Hope you're doing well"" in text?) And honestly, I was really taken aback by his reply saying ""Best of luck going forward"", he was kind of snobbish but nice at the same time? Did he kind of reject me, or did he honestly think that I rejected him? What does his reply even mean?

Now that I had more time to think about this, I think I would like to meet him, but I'm not sure how to take this - did he reject me or if I rejected him? Because that affects whether or not I should text him and try to reschedule this. I know he's in my city for a week so that should be enough time for us to meet.

tl;dr I met this guy through a dating app, he moved to a different city and was visiting my city again and asked to meet, but I forgot to reply to his message.
