Tons of emotional things have happened that have complicated our relationship that I won't bore you all with. Basically, we got extremely close super fast, hanging out and talking all day every day. She has a very obsessive personality and so do I. A month or so in she had a ""mental breakdown"" and subsequently quit her job to pursue business ventures. I think I was part of what caused her breakdown because the night before we had talked about being in a relationship. Then afterward, she told me she is so scared of another relationship because of what happened with her recent ex.  Kind of annoying as she was the first to ever bring up being in a relationship.

She gets so stressed out if I ever try to ask her where we stand and acts like she can't even bear to talk about it. She just left on a 9-day business trip to start her business ventures. I tried to talk about ""us"" with her the night before she left while we were at a bar with her friends (bad timing, I know) and the same thing happened. She got upset with me and told me to go home. 

Ever since then (4 days ago), she has completely stopped initiating contact with me. I basically begged her to call me because my anxiety was through the roof and she just said ""I don't have time right now. Stop worrying about it, it's fine. Neither of us needs more stress."" I called her two days later and we talked for 15 minutes but never even talked about what happened because I was scared of stressing her out. I feel like I broke her attraction for me but she said it's fine so I really don't know. 

I don't know what to do because clearly me talking about ""us"" stresses her out but I really want to know where we stand.

As a woman, I can see this meaning (2) things, depending on the personality type of the man it’s coming from:

One one hand “No attitude” could mean that he prefers…

• A woman who’s emotionally mature enough to have a discussion rather than turn every little thing into an argument.  
• A woman who can LISTEN to her man’s  words and compromise with him.
• One who wants to be an assert than expects her man to do EVERYTHING for her, then gets upset or throws tantrums like a 3yo when he doesn’t. 


On the other hand, I can see this coming from a man who’s on the controlling end of the spectrum and possibly has a lot of “attitude” himself… (I consider these to be somewhat toxic traits in a relationship.)

In that case, maybe it means:
• A woman who is emotionless, passive — purely submissive and maybe even codependent on him.
• A woman who isn’t passionate about her beliefs, never stands up for herself and just lets people walk all over her or follows his “rules”. 

• I say this because when I think of the phrase “NO attitude”, it seems a bit drastic and unrealistic, as a majority of women (and all humans willing to feel their vulnerable side) ARE somewhat emotional beings.
Women are genetically designed to be more emotional than a majority of men (via chemical balances/hormones).  It’s what feeds our maternal, nurturing side.  We cannot force ourself to act just like men, nor should we.


IMO, suppression or NOT receiving the proper guidance on how to express these things is when it can lead to unfit behaviors that we sometimes refer to as “attitude”.

Her(18F) and I(18M) cuddled all night and continued in the morning/afternoon in front of our friend group, but she is in a relationship as of right now.

my friends and i had a little party for passing semester 1 so we drank. when i got there, this girl(my friend) was asleep and prior to this, there were no feelings other than some sort of platonic love towards her. i mean if i had to pick, out of anyone before hand, it would still probably be her that i would go for, but this just ended up happening. after we woke her up which was probably around 11 pm, we made sure she stayed up with music blasting, because she pregamed for a couple hours. it got to the point where her and i eventually faded off from the group because two of the other three were upstairs staring at eachother on the bathroom floor and the hallway floor, and the other one ended up falling asleep on the wooden landing halfway up the stairs.

once they had gone upstairs, her and i decided it would be a plan to smoke two joints, and take 3 more shots, and by the time that we came inside, that's when buddy had fallen asleep on the stairs, previously waiting for them to come down, only to be disappointed because they went to the bedroom without remembering it once he was already asleep to go to sleep aswell.

when we realized that we were the only ones left awake, we decided to continue watching euphoria which we had been binge watching as a group beforehand, so we both cuddled up to eachother on the couch for hours and hours on end, even continuing until 3 pm the next day, even after everyone of our close friends came downstairs and woke up, one of which who introduced us. another one of our friends showed up at 12;30 ish pm the next day to see one of her best friends who IS IN a relationship (although it is very flawed and possibly on the verge of ending, even without the circumstances) cuddling up to me and the continuation of that up until when i left.

I (24m) have been thinking about dating again recently. I haven’t dated since my ex and I broke up. We dated for six years, and while it was good for awhile, ultimately parts of the relationship were toxic and overtime I became far too attached. Long story short for about a month after the break up I stalked her, took some of her possessions, and really made a mess of things. 

Ultimately we had a restraining order, I’ve been in therapy ever since, and I’ve been working hard on myself for awhile. 

I am still not planning on dating any time soon. Honestly I may never, I read about abuse and abusers online quite a bit and feel deeply disheartened when I see a common rhetoric that we never change. As far as I am planning I will probably never actively date again (creating a dating profile, going out for the purpose of meeting women, ect.) but if I meet someone that I really felt connected to I would probably go for it. 

In this case I’m not sure how to approach what happened. I feel like they should know early on, so that I am not hiding anything or being manipulative, but I also can’t expect anyone to trust me again.

I need some advice on what to do in this situation. Having previously been badly betrayed gaslighted, and cheated on, I am wondering if I am thinking too negatively about it.

I (f24) matched with this guy R (m26) on Tinder on Christmas Eve, we pretty much hit it off right away, both having a super weird jokey conversation that stood out from other conversations. At one point I saw he was only 1km and asked where he was from, then he dropped that he actually recently moved around 600km away but he was staying with his sister for the Christmas period. This was a little bit disappointing but I kept an open mind. We chatted all through Christmas, staying up late sending pictures and voice notes until we eventually decided to go out on a date. 

We went out for drinks a few days after matching and had the best time. I thought he was super interesting, hardworking and creative. We ended up getting super drunk and making out quite a lot. It was clear we had a lot of chemistry. A couple days after he went back home, we kept chatting at the same frequency. We still stayed up super late, he talked so highly of me and made me feel so good about myself, even making me an appreciation list with 20 things he liked about me, which included ‘is genuinely intelligent and in touch with the world’ which honestly meant so much to me. 

After how we left the date, we decided to meet up half way between us, get a hotel and do a bit of exploring. We both made the effort and travelled, had a good weekend, slept together, explored. He surprised me with my favourite chocolate, wine and a bath bomb when I got there which I loved. However, as much as i was enjoying the time, I kept having little moments of fear, as the situation was super complicated and I’m quite concerned about getting hurt. On the weekend he opened up that his living situation was complicated, he was staying at his aunts and paying half the rent for his ex to live at their old place. She was leaving soon but it meant he was stuck paying a lot of money for expenses and couldn’t get out of the lease. I appreciated that his situation was complicated so didn’t want to stress him out by having a feelings conversation on the weekend.

After the weekend I came back home, I knew the week ahead would have been stressful for him so I didn’t bring up a ‘what happens now’ sort of conversation. Particularly because he expressed that it was difficult being back in the house himself, which I got completely and let him know I was there for him. He let me know that he was travelling back towards me for work the following week and asked if I wanted to do something. We arranged to go out for lunch on the Sunday. He again, got me my fave chocolate. We had a good lunch and such a laugh, after he went to go meet a friend which I was a little disappointed about as I kinda wanted to spend more time with him, however I completely understood he had a lot going on. This is where i started to feel a bit weird. As we were saying bye he gave me a hug and said: ‘I don’t know when I’ll be back up, but I’m about until Thursday so let me know if you’re bored’ idk what it was about it but it felt weird, like I wanted him to say, I hope to see you again soon or something. 

Anyway the next day, as he was at his sisters  we decided to go a dog walk. We took my dog a local walk, again had a laugh but it wasn’t necessarily romantic. As I dropped him off at his sisters he brought out her new puppy and let me hold him, which was amazing. As we left he gave me a kiss on the cheek. He sent me a bunch of photos of the puppy etc and communication was still good. 

The next day he was busy with work, so I knew we wouldn’t be texting much, it’s important to note at this point we weren’t exclusive, but I personally focused all my energy on him because I just felt a connection. I was bored in the evening and went to look at our convo on tinder and I noticed that he had one of the pictures of the puppy that he sent me on tinder, which could only have been recent. I know that we are both single and he has every right to do that, I just found it a bit strange considering how it had only been a day and he was super busy with work, why was updating his tinder a priority? I guess it made me realise how much I liked him and that scared me a bit. I assumed that obviously he is still exploring his options so it made me feel like I shouldn’t be getting so attached. I tried to have a conversation with him about our situation which he didn’t really get. He seemed like he didn’t want to have it at all so I didn’t push it. The jist of the conversation was me wanting to talk about where our heads our at, him admitting he had been weird or distant and not understanding what the conversation would be about. 

R: ‘I guess i just dont see what needs to be resolved, i thought we were on the same page’

Me: ‘I don’t know if I would necessarily say ‘resolved’ ? What’s the same page to you?’

R: ‘We are hanging out, going on dates when we can and seeing how thing go 
Is what i thought’

Me: ‘That is what we are doing, but what does that actually mean? We also talk every day, share things about our lives. I’m not saying that we aren’t on the same page about the situation, but that is a bit separate from issues such as feelings and attachments that I feel are important to talk about or else someone could get hurt 🤷‍♂️’

R: ‘i dont really understand. We can chat tomorrow? Im a bit lost and tired. Im not trying to hurt you :/, I’m not good at this sorta stuff but I’m honestly really trying’

Me: ‘I honestly appreciate that you’re trying, goodnight speak tomorrow x’

Honestly, this reaction annoyed me. But I decided to wait for the conversation, while we have been talking, it’s a lot more brief than usual, and there hasn’t really been an opening for that kind of chat. I can’t help but feel it’s deliberate. Like I’m being breadcrumbed almost? No plans to see each other again I felt in limbo.  So I decided to follow his lead and keep my options open. I went on hinge and started matching and chatting to people, I eventually started talking to this guy J (22M) who dared me to go on a date with him that night. I thought fuck it and I did, we went out for dinner, had a laugh and then went to a gig as he is an artist manager so it was super cool to check out and meet his artist. Again got really drunk but had a great time. 

The thing is tho, J is super into me and isn’t shy about saying it. It feels good but I can’t forget about how much I like R. But I just feel like he has lost interest a bit, things aren’t the same as they were, the guy who wrote 20 things he liked about me seems so far away now. He is super busy with work which I get, and he still talks to me and takes an interest in my life. I’m just not sure what the best way to approach it is. I honestly do like R but I don’t want to put myself out there and get hurt. 

Should I assert a conversation about feelings even tho I get the feeling he doesn’t want to? Or should I taper our conversations and see how he reacts and use that as a basis before taking a big leap with my emotions and ask if he sees it going anywhere, or wants to move towards exclusivity. Advice on this would be greatly appreciated.

Last month, we went out to dinner and talked for 3 hrs on first meet up. We were in contact via Instagram messages. Then we talked on the phone to buy tickets &amp; see the Spider-Man movie. The day before movie I asked if he could stop sending those IG video reels politely, it was a bit overboard. On day of movie, he said good morning and I replied with a wave emoji. He normally would continue the conversation via Instagram but doesn’t message again until he said he was waiting at the theater. I was not as bubbly as I was on first meet up , I was very quiet (not against him). He was annoying me during the movie, he’s the type to laugh and make noises when something exciting came on. He nudged me during the movie and asked if I was ok because I was quiet and I said yes. At the end I told him thanks, he said you’re welcome and he said drive safe. When I spoke with him on phone day before movie, he told me that he talked about me with his friends but after movie he sent a message just now saying that he wasn’t really feeling it from me and it’s not going to work for him. I was more upset that he beat me to rejecting him, I would have done it if he didn’t. Flash fwd to last week, he sends me a dm with an inside joke, I just left him on read again.

Me (F25) and my boyfriend (M32) have an amazing relationship and sex life. We’ve been seeing one other since the summer and have never been in a fight or anything we always talk everything out and it’s been perfect in every way so far. We’re best friends and tell eachother everything. We both have talked about our kinks and I’ve never once judged his kinks and he’s never judged mine. I know that he sometimes watches porn with certain topics like student/teacher, stepmom/ stepsister, teen etc. and it doesn’t really bother me because they’re all consenting adults and it’s just a fantasy and I watch some weird stuff too sometimes.

We went out to a concert and took some pictures together and were both pretty drunk, so I think he didn’t think about it that I’d see what was on his phone. But he went to show me some of the pics we took together and I saw 2 pictures of girls who looked pretty young like a teen in high school or something. They were both fully clothed and were just mirror pics but it creeped me out. I asked why he had that and he said “I found the pics on Reddit and they’re 18+.” He looked and acted super embarrassed and couldn’t even look me in the eyes. I said how did you know they’re over 18? They don’t look like it and he’s like the post says they were.

Super cute, super funny, addictive laugh and personality. We had an absolute BLAST on our first date of having drinks (best bar night I've had in a long time).

TBH though, the bar regulars made it more fun that night vs just a 1 on 1 so it was more memorable.

We text for a few days and we plan a second date. I picked the place - Axe throwing because this girl is into cross-fit and I thought a physical activity would be fun between the both of us to see how we vibe. The interactions were just not there that night (I don't know how to explain it but I feel like I could have improved the situation in a different way). I felt boring. We basically threw the axe, laughed about how much we sucked, wrote down the score, little bit of banter and repeat. We left, I followed her to her car, kissed her a couple of times and she left. The kiss felt good and real. But like, I didn't even think to bring any other conversation pieces up since we were being too active with the throwing. I think it could be a confidence thing with me though because this girl just seems like on another level. I WANT to get to that level (always make her laugh, not just sometimes) but don't know how to improve it and keep the witticism up. Has anyone else ever been in this type of situation?

Because that to me is how you have average sex. I understand that most people need to 'get comfortable' in order to discuss these things, but again... that is putting up with rounds and rounds of boring average sex that actually lacks intimacy - it's more of a performance than anything else. 

If you can't talk about sex and seek out sexual information about your partner, then... you're not comfortable enough to have sex with them. But here's the thing - for me, the interest HAS to come from my partner to get things started. I do not mean initiating sex - I am happy to initiate sex with partners I have come to desire and want to have sex with - I am talking about initiating and activating my desire. 

Unfortunately, I've spent years trying to forward information and my wants and desires about the kind of sex I'd like to have with past partners, so now, if someone doesn't seek out this information in me, I don't have desire for them. I know that to be satisfied, the interest needs to come from them (and yes, I'm a woman, talking about men). If the interest to seek out my sexual nature doesn't come from them seeking it out - I don't fantasize about them, I don't want to have sex with them. My desire has turned entirely reactionary and is dependent on the level of interest and investment someone else shows to me before I even begin to want them. 

It has taken me a long time to feel like it's okay to be this way. It feels like I live in a world where I'm just expected to sleep with people when I have low desire for them, just to ""create"" the desire - which usually doesn't turn out. 

I feel like men will just be disinterested or hostile to this boundary of mine. But is it worth having sex I don't want? I don't think so. And by the way, I am not a low libido person - I would say I'm average without inspiration (aka nothing but porn and my own mind to inspire me). But if I had a chance to sleep with someone who is actually connected to my desire and sexuality, I could probably not get enough. I've never had the chance.

I (20F) have been seeing this guy (19M) for about a month now. I have never been in a relationship and have constantly been used for sex so I made it very clear from the beginning that I wasn’t looking for just sex. He reassured me many times that he was not just using me for sex, so I allowed myself to be vulnerable with him. He has shown such sweet traits that I am not used to seeing in guys that I’m talking to, leading me to believe he was actually serious about me. We live in the same uni accomodation so we began spending the night together most nights over the last 2 weeks, some nights without any sexual stuff just kissing and cuddling. Last week in bed he told me he really likes me, which is something no one had ever told me before so I really thought it was going somewhere. Last night after a night out I went back to his room and it started off with us just chatting like normal.

I personally don’t talk or hookup with more than one person at a time to see how things progress; however, I know not a lot of people do that. 

We’ve seen each other... 5 times in the span of about 2 weeks. And by this I mean actually hang out. First date which transitioned into her staying at my place, then the next night she invited me over to hers, and a few other times since. Each time we’re together it’s awesome and she’s cool, and we obviously end up hooking up since we’re both very attracted to each other. Things do click, and she likes to cuddle/hold me, but she’s also the least expressive girl I’ve met (doesn’t show a lot of emotion and clearly has a hard time being vulnerable). I know because I’m an expressive man and have no problem showing my emotions. 

However, she never holds a conversation on text. Most of the time it’s to hang out and hookup or go on a date. If I ask how her day was over text I either get a response the next morning or something simple like “it was good!”. Generally, the women who I’ve dated (and even had flings with) previously would engage in text.... quite a bit more, which has me questioning whether this is just an “adult” who has their shit together and hates texting or she just wants to hookup.

Plus women couldn’t have proper careers so average men had hope of having a partner who wasn’t really into them at best. However in the last century, that has changed women can choose careers they want and gain more education, and as a result average/below average men no longer have a shot. 

I’m not saying that women shouldn’t work or that feminism ruined dating or whatever. But the only asset an average man had was the ability to provide for a woman and potential family. But that appeal is gone, now women will only date who they are physically attracted to. These are men who are 6ft or above, handsome face, and abs, in the 21st century these men are the only men who can now find loving girlfriends/wives. 

Plus tinder has made things even more dire, since you are also competing against men older than you, and men in other communities. Back in the day you really only competed against men in your neighbourhood, because of these factors most men won’t ever find love. The only men who will find love soon are Chris Hemsworth or Channing Tatum types this is just the truth and its hardwired in biology for women to want these men. 

Lots of men complain about this, and rightfully so however complaining solves nothing. Instead just accept and let go, me personally I’ve chosen suicide but you may choose whatever option appeals to you.

I'm a single parent in my 30s, have an ok job and I'm financially fine but nothing special. I have 2 college friends I keep in touch with and I moved to a part of the US where I know exactly zero people. I'm pretty introverted now but I wasn't always. When I was younger I dated a lot more but since my ex left 10 years ago I've lost interest in meeting new people. I thought I wanted to focus on myself and raising my child but I'm now staring down the barrel of a very lonely existence and I don't know how to change it.

I really want to meet someone but I don't know anyone in my area or have any local friends. My coworkers are 100% male so no options there. I don't use dating apps because everyone looks happy and takes tons of pictures of themselves at parties and I don't have any pictures like that. I like gardening and hiking and video games and working out in my garage. That's about it though, so not a very exciting life. 

My dating prospects since my ex have all been their own brand of strange but fun. The people I tend to meet are all sort of insane. I have been told I'm BPD but I never got diagnosed. I think I attract crazy because I am a bit crazy and I like being around people who I resonate with, if that makes sense. I have only dated about 3 women since my kid's mom. I don't do casual hook ups and I don't pay for sex. I started getting into this one cam girl but it just made me feel sad and weird. Never again.

I don't know what to do besides give up on dating altogether. I can't keep bringing dangerous women into my kid's life but I really do want to meet someone. I hate being alone and the thought of being in my 40s and still looking has me thinking really negative thoughts. 

Is there any way to meet women for a man like me anymore or has the world changed so much that I have to be on social media posting pictures of food and scrolling through pages of people I don't relate to for years before I meet a decent person?

Basically it’s incurable. Note that these pull ups are very discreet and when I have accidents it’s almost always just leaks on my way to the bathroom. I can usually get away with wearing a large pad however that means frequent changes (which means I have to carry them with me). Being a boy there is no real way to have the pad stay in place when you do pretty much anything except sit or walk. The pads also press firmly on your body leaving your skin wet. The briefs hold it away from your body leaving your skin dry and much more sanitary. Additionally sometimes my bladder flares up and the leaks become worse or if I’m stuck in car or something like that I might have a larger accident the pads could not contain. I will still use them very rarely if I want to wear like really thin pants and i know there will be easy bathroom acces where I’m going.

The more I realize that this is- no should be the norm. We have come to an age where dating is least important. ""Hook-up culture"" isn't dating. To have sex with someone to feel like it isn't dating. I think we as a society have come to the point where we realized that going through the trouble of being in a relationship... Doesn't really benefit us in any way. Yes, it gives us positive feelings for a while but what about when those feelings end? And they do end. We are left with pain and despair. Some of us can't even work because we're so heartbroken. To risk our livelihood...To commit to someone...It does sound a bit wrong, doesn't it? 

If I think really hard about how my life as someone who's single would change from being in a relationship, I think it may be worse. Yes, there's some emotional fulfillment from being in one. But if we think in the grand scheme of things, spending money on our partner(s) to make them happy, making sure to test them enough times in a day, giving them enough attention that's needed, that's time being taken away from ourselves. Being single we have time on our hands, we don't have to worry if we're a good partner or not and we can have sex with whoever we want. I think more and more people are realizing this lifestyle is better for themselves when looking at the rising rate of single people.
