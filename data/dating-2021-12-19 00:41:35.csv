0,rjr185,1639896345,Dating someone who has different values and beliefs while in college?,"I would like some advice/guidance so I can make a well thought out decision.

Context:  We had an impromptu date that started with hanging out with other  friends over food, then she (f22) and I (m21) went back to her place to  watch a movie that resulted in us talking about our interest in each  other + cuddling. We've only been friends for a few months. Both of us  transferred to a college this semester and formed a friend group with  some others.

I do like her. I  think we have really good chemistry + she's the only person I've talked  to for hours without realizing how much time has passed. However, the  doubt and uncertainty I'm experiencing now are the same ones I felt when  I started to date my ex.

She and I  have opposing religious and political views. Additionally, she doesn't  want to have sex until marriage, and I think sex is vital for any  short-term or long-term relationship. We also kinda have different  opinions on kids - she wants to have 4ish and start at like 27. I want a  couple, but it's not something I'm heavily thinking about at this time  like she seems to. Oh, and this is likely shallow, but she does have a  similar name to my mom's.

But she  prioritizes communication and discussions like I do. Both of us have  talked about the difference in our values and beliefs. Both of us were  willing to try but not sure how things would go. Neither of us have  experience dating someone who isn't close to our values and beliefs.

Additionally,  her ex still reaches out to her multiple times a day. When we hung out,  she must have received 10+ phone calls over the few hours we hung out. I  asked her how many times he calls a day, and she said sometimes its  30+. She won't block him because he's a part of her friend group back  home and thinks it's important to maintain a positive relationship with  him for her group. As of early last month, she was still on the fence  about getting back with him too.

Yes,  this does bother me. She says she has told him numerous times over the  semester that they're not getting back together, but he laughs at her  and ignores her. She also saw him sometime in October(?), but she said  she regretted it because it's just made him more determined. My view on  the situation is he's abusive/doesn't respect her and is trying to wear  her down to get back with him. I don't think she wants to get back with  him, but the situation does make me uneasy.

Am  I just overthinking and over-doubting this? On one hand, college is a  place for exploration, and I don't want to turn down an opportunity  because I'm too negative. On the other hand, there's 4 billion women in  the world for me and 4 billion men for her; If we stop it now, maybe our  group won't be majorly impacted.

Ultimately,  should I give it a try and reevaluate in a few weeks? Or is it best to  call it off now so we can try to squash feelings over winter break.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjr185/dating_someone_who_has_different_values_and/
1,rjr472,1639896699,How to nicely say that we need better communication or else it’s better to stop dating?,"I have been dating a guy for a month and a week now. Believe it or not, this entire time we have NEVER FaceTimed or had a phone call. Our ""communication"" is iMessage games. Every once in a while he'll ask how my day went (..and barley respond to it too, making me feel like he doesn't even care to begin with)

Anyways, it just feels weird. How are we together for a month and never talked on the phone or facetime? Why don't we have better text convos? Why if he hates texting then maybe why doesn't he add me on snap? (that way we can send each other pictures and still keep in touch)

Idk... it just feels weird to me. We went on 7 dates so far. 

And what annoys me, is that I constantly see him active on Instagram. Why doesn't he send me posts or something? Does he not want to talk to me other than those stupid iMessage games?

Sigh. I am just tired feeling sad about this. It makes me feel like he doesn't actually like me, no matter how many times he tells me he does in person. 

Aside from that, two weeks ago the convo of bf and gf came up and he said he isn't ready yet.

So, I want to talk to him and just share my feelings. But I also don't want to sound like Im just saying ""why dont you think about me"". How do I express all of this in a good way? Because this past week I just felt like I want to break things off with him due to this. But id hate to do that without trying to communicate first and resolve things.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjr472/how_to_nicely_say_that_we_need_better/

3,rjr84z,1639897165,Am I wrong for talking to my ex’s friend?,"For background, I’m 17 year old senior in Highschool. I moved to a small town my junior year of Highschool but due to COVID, I stayed home and did schooling online. I just so happened to meet my ex through an app that let me make friends nearby since 1) I was new to the area and since I wasn’t physically going to school I didn’t really have the opportunity to meet people and 2) the friends I did have lived in the next state over back ‘home’. He messaged me and we became pretty good friends after realizing we coincidentally went to the same school together. After a few months and going to some events together, He asked me out in early July and I accepted. Right off the bat I noticed that we had two very different dating styles. I was raised by a single mother, taught to never completely depend on my partner (especially financially), to never settle for something, and to always communicate, even if it meant having the uncomfortable and emotional conversations. My ex (let’s just call him M) was heavily insistent on being the only way to pay for things, would argue to be right, and purposely ignore situations to not have tough conversations. I let it go and just accepted that we would butt heads on certain things. Fast forward many arguments and infidelity on his end, I ended things in early October. I packed his things up neatly and drove them to his house only to get cursed out and threatened. He took the break up hard and eventually acted like such an ass towards me in public, that he lost multiple friends. About a month ago, I was in Walmart with my cousin, laughing and joking around when I noticed someone looking at me pretty heavily. I stared back for a few seconds but I didn’t recognize him . About an hour later I got a snap from someone and after opening it I realized it was the same guy from Walmart! We talked for a little bit and he admitted that he had recognized me from posts on Facebook and being tagged in story’s on snap (I added back all of his friends since he insisted I must have been hiding something if I wouldn’t add the back). We started talking on the daily, sending funny pictures and genuinely just being decent people to one another. Last week, I noticed that he had started taking more of a flirtatious tome occasionally but was always very sweet and never said anything too much. I jokingly made a flirtatious remark back and upon seeing how flustered he got, I couldn’t help but think that he was taking his flirting seriously. So I asked him bluntly and he said that he had been since he had seen me in Walmart that day. I was shocked but I admitted that I find him funny and frankly put, attractive. We’ve been flirting nonstop since then and planning friendly hangouts like watching movies together or something as simple as going on a walk around some of the trails and grabbing lunch. I really enjoy how laid back he is and how it seems that he genuinely enjoys me for me. Now being in a small town where everyone knows everything, I know that sooner or later even just us visibly hanging out will get around town fast and the thought recently hit me, “Am I wrong for talking to one of his (now ex) friend especially when we haven’t even been broken up for 3 months?” What do or do I not do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjr84z/am_i_wrong_for_talking_to_my_exs_friend/

While we texted regularly, we only had one video date (we both have demanding jobs). After the last video date, I tried to set up another one but he just got a new file at work that requires a lot of him (just told me no and didn't try to reschedule anything). I got tired of trying set things up and realized that while there was a connection, I didn't want a passive text convo. 

So today I told him I am no longer interested in connecting because I don't want a passive text relationship. He told me he understood but said if I'm ever in his area, to message him for a coffee. Do you think he was sincere in his statement? 

*we both work busy jobs and it was initially exciting talking to someone who understood being busy. I've struggled with men in the past who wanted more from me than I could give.

11,rjrmzc,1639898849,Eventhough I’m 18(almost 19) can I still be in a relationship with someone under age as long as we don’t have sex?,"Okay now let me explain, so just last May I graduated from high school and now I go to an adult transition program which teaches people on the spectrum on how to live a good adult life(cooking, finance, jobs, communication skills, etc) and I do have autism but I’ve overcame the majority of it to the point that if someone just met me, they would not know that I’m on the spectrum until I told them.
But yeah with all of that aside, I do often go to the high school that I recently graduated from to do recycling work as well as putting food in vending machines and most of the time when I’m finished I head over to the library to have some time to myself for a few minutes before I go home, and there has been plenty of times where I would see cute girls but I just don’t know if I should talk to them or not because I’m 18 and I don’t want to end up being with someone below that age because I may get in trouble with the law even if we just kissed.
So my question is no matter what, should I go talk to a girl and ask her out anyways although they may be under age?

13,rjrr0t,1639899325,Exclusivity,"So, I’m a woman in my 40s, recently divorced and new to dating.  The last time I was dating, online dating had a stigma around it, now it’s how everyone meets.  The thing with online dating is there is an opportunity to date so many people.  It’s great in that if you put in the time and effort, you’ll eventually meet someone you like since it’s basically a numbers game.  The part where I’m getting confused is how much do people talk about this, especially while in the early phases of dating and when is exclusivity expected?  

I’ve been seeing a guy for close to a year, but it’s not very serious.  We see each other every couple of weeks (I don’t date while on my weeks with the kids).  He’s sweet, we get along, he’s smart.  The problem is he smokes a lot of weed, and consequently has not much ambition.  It’s not a low paying job that bothers me, but that he is limited by his drug use because he won’t apply for jobs that drug test.  It doesn’t bother me now since we aren’t living together, but I can foresee resentment if I’m working hard to promote, get better, etc. and he is happy at a minimum wage job with no benefits and no safety net. 

We had a mild disagreement and I got back on the app and met someone I’ve been out with twice.  I can’t say if we’ll keep getting along, but I’m interested to find out.  Do I need to cut it off with the other guy or can I ethically see both while I test the waters?  I feel the first guy is someone whose friendship I would miss if we ended things,

15,rjrvdz,1639899844,Is it weird to move on from a long term relationship almost immediately?,"So my ex was pretty emotionally abusive (and sometimes physically) we dated for 6 years, from age 15 to age 21. I feel like I was under some sort of spell or Stockholm syndrome type stuff; I didn't break up with him because I was convinced I'd never find anyone else as good??? Idk what I was thinking. he wasn't good at anything including being nice or even being attractive. What was I on lol? 

So yeah he ended up breaking up with me because he said I was boring and that he wanted to try threesomes and polyamory.

I cried for a week, moved back in with my parents and suddenly I was fine. It felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders, and suddenly I wasn't so stressed all of the time. I started talking to someone new over tinder only 1 week after the breakup. 
The new guy and I connected so strongly, we met up in person 12 days after our first chat. Then he asked me to be his girlfriend...20 days after the mentioned breakup.

He's practically perfect as far as boyfriends go in my opinion. We've been together for 8 months now and both incredibly happy with eachother. He's become my best friend. It's domestic bliss. He's absolutely perfect for me in all the ways my ex wasn't. Instead of feeling on edge when I am around him, he makes me feel safe and secure. I can't believe I got so lucky. 

The only thing is. New boyfriend has no idea my last relationship ended so close to when I met him. He's not a rebound, and I don't want him to think as such. My past relationship was so dead by the time it ended that it kinda felt like it had already been over for a while if that makes any sense. 

I know the new bf told me he took a year and a half break after his ex before dating again, and that was coming from a 4 year relationship. Knowing this, it kinda made me stop for a sec and go ""woah wait, I only waited a week, am I a sociopath?"" Jk I know I'm not a sociopath but that sounds like some sociopath behavior for sure. 

And now it makes me feel weird and guilty when I think about it. Is this something I should tell the new boyfriend or is it better off not spoken? Is it important that he knows? Or does he need to? 

Is it weird to move on from a relationship this quickly? It felt very natural to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjrvdz/is_it_weird_to_move_on_from_a_long_term/

17,rjrzix,1639900352,Another “I got ghosted” story but with a twist.,"Just kidding, there’s not much of a twist. It is somewhat of an odd one though and I really need some clarity please.

So around 2 weeks ago I (F23) get a text from a random guy’s number that’s not one of my contacts, telling me to go to a bar that he’s at. From the way the message was worded, I thought it was from someone that I actually knew and was about to hook up with once but didn’t. This guy (M23) was staying in a different city at the time though so I thought that he had mixed my number up with some other girl there that he wanted to get with. I replied saying “no thanks but you have fun xx”. He replies again but I just leave it on read thinking this guy is so pathetic, he can’t even get his numbers right.

Anyway the next day goes by and I get a call that night from the same number. I’m thinking he’s calling to clear things up or he still thinks I’m that other woman. I answer the call and it’s this totally unfamiliar guy’s voice apologising for texting me accidentally. I say that’s fine I thought you were someone else. We end up talking about random shit for the next couple of hours. Turns out we have quite a lot in common, same age, go to the same uni, similar interests, and I’m quite familiar with where he lives.

We end up texting/calling/FaceTiming more over the next week and we actually have some really enjoyable conversations; a lot more enjoyable than I’ve had of late. We talk about family and work issues. He’s really into gardening, does botany at uni, and he showed me the book of taxonomy he made with all the plants in his garden, (sounds lame but I thought it was cute). 

We had our last conversation about a week ago, it ended on a really positive note and he said he would text me the next day. He never ended up texting me. I thought he may have been busy, but in all my experiences of guys who have not followed through, it’s because they have slipped away and moved on. Sure enough he has ghosted me. I even called him a few days ago and he actually declined the call lol.

I am so confused. How can you be so interested in someone just for it to disappear within a matter of hours?? I understand ghosting someone youre
not connecting with, but how could you say all these emotionally intimate  things and then just nothing? It’s fine if he’s not feeling it but I just don’t get ghosting at all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjrzix/another_i_got_ghosted_story_but_with_a_twist/

23,rjsmdy,1639903121,How do i navigate dating without apps when it’s all i used for the last 8 years?,"I’ve been in three long-term monogamous relationships over the last 8 years. All happened because of tinder. After sometime of being single I [26F] really wanted to go on a date again. Maybe find a nice consistent FWB. Before this, i never tired anything other than tinder. I regret redownloading for a couple reasons. 
I’m not sure if anyone has talked about  this, but i feel like the algorithms that these dating apps use are really fucking with everyone’s heads. They also shadow-ban very easily. They try to rope you into buying the higher tier levels and spend more money. It’s disgusting that they’re making all this profit over exploiting peoples love and sex lives. Especially in a pandemic where it’s like ‘how the fuck am i supposed to meet people when i can’t really do a lot of the things i used to do?’ 
It’s kind of nauseating. Technology is ruling a lot of people’s love/sex lives. They decide what matches you see, they decide who sees you. It also takes up so much time. The amount of screen time online dating takes is absurd. While I do give props to people for very creative and amusing bios, the messaging back and forth is frequently painful and a drag. 
Don’t get me wrong tho, almost all of my long term relationships have occurred because of online dating. So i have to be thankful for that because they were all with great partners. But my return to online dating was prefaced by an almost 5 year hiatus from it. I can see a lot has changed and I’m feeling pretty jaded i guess.

I wouldn't say it's in her character to ghost. She usually gets excited when I ask her to go out with me.

26,rjsnzi,1639903317,How long does it take before it's considered ghosting?,"I (25m) have on 3 dates so far with a girl (25f) in about these past 4 months. Mostly went well, we have good chemistry, but nothing sexual happened yet (difficult if you meet in public places). Lately, I  wanted to ask her out on a 4th date, but she hasn't replied. It's been exactly a week and no response. 

I wouldn't say it's in her character to ghost. She usually gets excited when I ask her to go out with me. Another thing she mentioned when she gets overwhelmed, from work or whatever, she cuts off contact with other people for a while. I have no idea if this is the case now, because I texted asking her if she is okay and she could vent to me, but no response. I do see her coming online for a while but she ignored my message.

I saw him again at a circumstance I am healing and things have improved. But so many things are broken and so many things found. It triggered some feelings. I truly understand how it feels to see someone you used to love.. my mood was down because he's someone else's. I think everyone in the world knows I love this man. People have told me and also, people have told me he ain't a good catch.

But my feelings for him are very deep, I think it's for life. This is something I tried to get rid of. But I failed. I accepted that I will have feelings for him forever and I have to leave him a lone.

Bc I slept with him and gave him my all. But I was young and a part of me wanted to explore the world. Now I see him as a man... who parts of him are damaged greatly. I didn't want him to die.. I wanted him to live. I felt parts of him of thinking he is worthless.. I did try to save him. He knows I worked hard and beat the unthinkable. I am sad we didn't make it.

We’re both very socially awkward as well, which hasn’t helped. 

About a week ago, we were talking extensively about a band both of us really like, and I mentioned one of their songs that I particularly love. The next day, he sent me a fairly high effort cover of this song (with backing instrumentals and everything), despite him never having told me he played an instrument or sang. He’s very shy, so this surprised me a lot. I thought it was a very nice gesture, and wondered if this potentially indicates further interest?

Now fast forward three days ago, I asked if we should meet up again for a movie next week, she was quick to find a day that worked for her and I said that hopefully I would be free that day too. 

The day after I asked if we should maybe book the tickets for the movie, and she replied that she no longer was sure if she even had time to meet up before christmas (as she studies a lot). I replied that maybe we should wait with the tickets in that case. 

Then the next day I asked if we should just replan and meet up after christmas instead, as it would maybe suit us both better. 

After that she really hasn’t been as active and not opening my messages as fast as she would before.

33,rju39r,1639909717,My 30yo boyfriend is busy trying to go viral on TIKTOK while I'm sitting here waiting for him to get his shit together.,"Hi, I'm a 25F I've always been a hustler since day one. I've finished school, I have my career set (I work at a fintech) and I love what I do. I also have a few streams of income and make six figures annually. 

My boyfriend of one year is a truck driver, he recently took this job to make more money than he was previously making at his family business working for his dad. He does not have any post secondary education, and does not wish to go back to school. 

Recently he got temporarily let go from his job (too long to explain but he has around 2 weeks off from work). His long term goal is not to do trucking but to start a business. He will stick to a business idea for a while and then switch it up completely within weeks. For some reason he believes he is going to be 'rich' one day. I asked him why he thinks that or how he's going to achieve it but he has no answer. 

Since the time he's been let go he's been devastated, he says he can not afford to take days off from work. So I told him this is a golden opportunity to work on his business idea since he hardly has time for that during the week. Instead of working on his idea that he's talked abt for a few weeks now he's been trying to go viral on ticktok. (For reference he's not a content creator, has no following and is starting this whole thing from scratch). I am beyond frustrated because I feel like I have my shit together, I work my ass off, I care abt my financial future and I been waiting on him to figure his career/ long term financial situation out. 

I've always been surrounded by hustlers my whole life, my parents are super hard working, I'm surrounded by hard working colleagues but it feels like my boyfriend is looking for shortcuts to become 'rich'.

He is a super sweet and caring person but I am just beyond frustrated when it comes to this topic. My parents are very strict and have not met him yet. I can not introduce him to my parents if hes a truck driver/ticktoker or w.e. I try to guide him and help him with his business ideas but it seems like that not his priority right now. 

I'm not sure how to approach this topic with him without hurting his feelings or having him think I'm doubting his 'plans'.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rju39r/my_30yo_boyfriend_is_busy_trying_to_go_viral_on/

38,rjuyim,1639913450,Lost the girl of my dreams (long text),"Yesterday i was out partying having a good time with my friends,tons of fine girls,great music maybe too loud 😆 overall great time.But then every one of these girls i saw i had this feeling which i only figured out later this feeling of nothing being there.What do i mean by that? well i was 👌 this close to getting into a relationship for the first time in my 18 years with a dream girl,a girl who is beautiful,kind,sweet every single positive word.She is just perfect we met in driving school 3/4 months ago went out on coffea with other friends and she said i was the funniest guy she ever met.I made her laugh every single time i said anything,she was just ugh i love her still…I just love her her smile her beatiful eyes her hair her body her voice.We started chatting and it was quite possibly the most dry conversation ever so i quit thought about it for a week straight was in somewhat of a pain and forgot it.She just broke up at that time,she was totally uninterested,then few weeks later she invited me to this party,tells her friend who told me that she asked him to record her driving and send it to me,and was asking what i have been up to where am i and that sort of stuff.In the meantime i bought a nice car,found a good job,got closer to god (not quite close to where i wanna be) got serious about making money,got real plans for the future,etc…I basically grown into a more mature serious guy not the funny guy who doesn’t do anything the whole day and spends all his time playing video games.I decide to message her and every message i reply within a few minutes she takes much longer as she says she is doing something always so she isn’t available.Starts like the old way we talked uninterested and dry and then i said the first day or two that i liked her just to let her know.And somehow went left and right but at the end started out good.She started replying much more and was into it,it was 50/50 and not just me carrying it.She started being freaky started sending me all sorts of couple tiktoks,one in specific where it says hard working men are so hot and it made me feel really good like she sees the effort i put in to become a better version of myself,she told me all sort of stuff about sex and that sort of stuff and she was more freaky than me ( i practice no fap for multiple months,for religious and bodybuilding reasons) i never wanted to talk about sex and that sort of stuff since i really dont care about it.And especially because i know she prays daily and always said how she will NOT have sex till marriage so every time she send one of these and there are many tiktoks she would remind me after marriage only.She asked what i would call my kids name wise.She would ask about the wedding would i like it big or something small.She made me giggle of happines for the first time in my life,and then sometimes she would go to sleep usually at 10 11 since she has school she has one year left and i finished half a year ago.And then she would say in chat that she is my wife in random ways like i would work and be almost done and go home and she would say your wife is waiting for you and that just would make me happy like nothing else.She then would wait for me for half an hour or an hour and we would text for a hour straight or more and reply right away because she would not leave the chat just message with me.That made me feel special too,and then one night a week or two weeks ago not sure myself lol we stayed late and we started talking deep like she noticed and it shocked me that she was having a hard time first year of school she was suicidal and that was a big shock for me but she didn’t want to talk about it so i didn’t force it,and i wasn’t really ever suicidal but i guess i did think about it like everyone else sometimes life just gets hard.And then word to word she asks what made me change my opinion from leaving her on seen to writing back like 10 weeks later and i straight up told her the truth which is that my friend told me that she was asking about me if he didnt say that she was asking about me i would never message her again because in my mind she is not worth chasing since i dont belive in chasing girls.She replyed with he is lying i did invite you to the party but i didnt ask about you.My friend then sweared that she did and that she is lying.Idk who to belive but i do belive my friend more seems to make more sense and he is my homie…I got shocked because then i started questioning everything.Is this even real? like if she didnt say anything to me then i messaged her again and im chasing her and that dissapointed me soo much since it looked like she was somewhat interested in me after all she said to me and the tiktoks and the way she was chatting to me so i was confused and i asked her one question.What does she think of me? like does she think that we can work togethor or is she just being insanely over the top friendly because if she is she needs to tell me because i think of her more than a friend and i made my intentions clear i told her already before that i liked her and her reaction was oh really? is this sarcasm or? i said wth no 💀 and she replyed with well we might fight or might not (which made no sense like what does that even mean) and she said how previously she wasn’t ready for a relationship as she just stopped being in one and can now move on and she said how when i messaged her the first time it was not the right time and then i asked well is not the right time she said maybe.But then that night she made what i belive a mess of it no you cant ask me that we have been chatting for 3 days you want me to grow feelings if we date for months and we broke up you will be desperate and stuff like that i told her i wont and that it wont make a change (oh boy was i wrong) and basically she just changed from 0-100 insane quick i said im sorry u got the wrong idea i didnt mean it like that and she said that she is angry and that she needs to sleep i told her sorry again and we can disscus this tomorrow she likes the message and then tomorrow she dont reply open my messages replies later with i have made up my opinion and she says its best not to start it at the first place.Out of nothing i ruined everything.Is it my fault? How can that be too early if she jokingly started saying how i should install a pole in “our” house so she can tie me and she can do whatever i want.That isn’t too early? then after that well i mean i was heartbroken obvisouly i lost my girl of dreams.A one im a milion,i told my friend this and he said it was my fault and how she was just being freaky and she isnt wrong about just being freaky.How can that not be too early then is my question she literaly said i will tie you and all you get to do is watch that is not too early to say? Idek she deleted me from tiktok but left us friends on ig main accounts and ig private and on facebook too.And on that party my friend told me it was the night prior to the party that if i only waited one more night for that party me asking her that would not be a big deal since she already asked did i think about taking her somewhere else which i did so we can be just two of us.She and i and our friends still went to the party but i was mostly quiet and she looked at me a few times didn’t say a word 🥺 i remember coming back home and my dad asking me what is wrong why am i sad.I never cried and i still dont know how i held back the tears and i just said that she changed her opinion on me and he said there will be other girls.The same night she told me that i went to clear my mind and i scraped my front bumper+that day was stresfull at work too.When my dad asked me that question it just made my hearth break into a milion pieces because there is still that one glimmer of hope in my mind that she will come back say hey sorry i overreacted or her asking about me again or something happening.I later told my friend about how she said how he lied and he confronted her and basically told me how she said that she didnt lie.Nothing else and then said that i stop talking about her.I felt guilty when i came back home yesterday from a different party all these girls but non of them are her.I just want to hug her and not let go but i can’t now.And when my mom once came in my room and asked what happend to that girl you used to talk about i just was quiet she told me girls will come and go and i told her what happend she said that she overreacted but at the same time she told me that i asked her that a little bit too early and she told me that i need to take some time to let it grow itself and that she would fell in love with me as time goes on and she gets to know me.Her friend which i know from elementary and just sort of know and would hang out and talk a little bit sometimes started hating me seems like.I feel like she turned against me beacuse on the party she didn’t say a word to me.I have been through a lot alone a lof pain mentaly and physicaly i have been bullied the entire elementary school years i suffered a lot of pain but got through it alone.But this is a different type of pain she would have been my first girl.Because i never even tried to be in a relationship before.Knowing that she is not going to be the mother of my kids,that she will not be with me for the rest of my life hurts in a different way.I almost feel like there is something else that stopped her but i dont know what cant figure it out aswell and honestly its probably not worth to try to figure it out if she isnt interested.Which looks like she dont care one bit even if i died right now.And that is happening,i am literally dying i feel empty but dont want to feel that way i try to be thankfull to god but i still ask for her.So to recap everything i lost the girl of my dreams and now every girl i see i know that she isnt as perfect as her.Its been 2 weeks and i eventually just accepted the defeat and thing is if she messaged me right now all my homies tell me no man dont try she will make a fool from you i still would message her back right away no questions i still love her for who she is.Even tho i know that its a mistake from me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjuyim/lost_the_girl_of_my_dreams_long_text/

Couple days later I proposed to go get lunch together. He agreed to that and we had a great time. He picked up the check with no hesitation, I didn’t even get the chance to get my wallet out. We said goodbye, he said he had a great time. Once I got home I texted him, saying I had a great time and that he should venmo me for lunch (it’s pretty normal to go Dutch where we live, we actually are Dutch lol). Also I just wanted to acknowledge him paying because I didn’t get the chance to while on the spot. He once again said he had a great time, too and: “No, don’t worry about it. You can pay next time.” I answered by saying thank you and promising I’d treat him to a snack he’d mentioned during the date and he said he’d keep me to that. 

It’s been almost a month since we had lunch together. However, I went out of town for a week in the meantime and he went out of a town a week later. So we didn’t really get the chance to meet up either. We’ve been keeping in touch over text and when I mentioned doing something again soon he said he’d love that and that I still owe him that snack, but we haven’t made actual plans yet. 

Am I wrong for seeing his “you pay next time” as an invitation for a second date? Could it be he was just being polite? What makes me doubt his intentions is that he hasn’t taken the initiative to actually plan something yet.

50,rjw85y,1639918599,"""You're just different to other guys""","Recently I've been messaging back and forth with an amazing woman. 

We've met a few times but I'm in the UK at the moment for Christmas. Usually, I wouldn't message anyone this much without meeting but it's all we can do so why not.

Anyway, the chat is hot and heavy. She's been sending me nudes which is obviously great. No complaints from me, surprisingly. 

Amidst the passion, she mentions last night that ""I've never shown anyone my body this much before""

To which I replied ""why am I so special""

She said ""You're just different to other guys. I feel safe to be myself with you""

And honestly, I get what she means because it's true. She really IS safe to be herself.

I feel this intense acceptance of her. I want her to show me all sides of her. Good, bad and ugly. She can feel profoundly safe with me because I won't fuck her over, lie to her and abuse her trust.

When I look into her eyes it isn't judgement. It's an appreciation of this amazing, beautiful woman in front of me. Not a desire to change her, just a playful wish to explore her.

And I think THIS is the key when it comes to women opening up to you as a man. 

Physically, emotionally, sexually, spiritually. 

It's SAFETY. 

If she doesn't feel physically, emotionally, sexually and spiritually safe with you, her guard will be up (and rightly so).

If you're finding that women are consistently ghosting you, being hot/cold with you or not opening up to you in the ways I mentioned above....

Maybe she just doesn't feel safe with you.

Now, you can't MAKE her feel that way. You can't make anyone feel anything and building safety with her is a long process. Longer for some guys than others, but still long.

But immediately you can work on being honest, vulnerable and setting the tone of the connection.

You can work on taking the lead (at least in the beginning). You can create a bubble between you where she can be fully herself without fearing judgement or harm from you. 

You can work on expressing yourself in direct, clear and unapologetic ways. That means your appreciation but also your boundaries (which also helps her feel safe).

You can soul-check your intentions. Do you just want to fuck her for your own ego? Do you just want her validation or approval? Do you care about her at all? Or is it all just for you?

Her openness to you is in direct proportion to how safe she feels with you.

And if she feels profoundly safe with you...

She will show you who she is. You will connect on a more profound emotional level. Your sex will be 1000x better. She will likely want to be around you way more because that kind of acceptance is extremely rare. We crave it.

So men. Learn from my lesson. It's as we've always been told.

Safety first ;)

53,rjwj56,1639919674,Masculinity in Eastern Europe vs rest of Europe and the world.,"27 years old, lived in 3 countries.

Since when being masculine is considered toxic?

Treating your partner with lust, desire. Slapping her ass when i come home, making time to make sex out of nowhere, doing unpredictable things, not following routine, suprising your partner with new things.


As far as im concerned, pure lust and desire is objectification in simplest form.

I wont be naughty, i wont be prude i wont desire to do unimaginable things to someone who doesnt reciprocate or doesnt enjoy it at all.

So my question is:

Why is this considered objefication of women and its treated like the most hateful thing to do to women, while when im not doing it after they got used to it, its suddenly not okay that i stopped doing it, because they liked it.

It feels like im guilty for doing it. Feels like im guilty to be the villain to manipulate them only to show them what they will like or what not. How they are supposed to know what they like if they didnt try it yet.

58,rjxbi7,1639922443,To date or not to date?,"As you can probably think from the question, I’m not sure if I want to date. However, I do feel like I want to add positive changes in my life. I want to put myself out there so that there would be a higher chance that I can meet that one person who I can spend the rest of my life with.

Am I rushing? I’m in my mid-20s and I haven’t dated anyone. Growing up, I just focused on what’s in front of me (studies, work, and family). But, there’s this feeling that I want to give myself a chance to meet that someone who would cherish and respect me for the way I am. That person who I can grow and have fun with. Someone who will choose me every time. 

I’m a bit reserved (I mostly keep to myself to avoid trouble) and I don’t care much about my appearance (I’m comfy with a hoody and sweatpants hahaha). I think those were the reasons why I don’t catch anyone’s attention (and that’s what people around me say). 

I haven’t found anyone irl and the global pandemic isn’t helping my situation, so I’m thinking about trying online dating apps. I do have my doubts (catfishing, lies, etc.). So… do you have any advice? Should I wait for love/ companionship to come to me in the real world since I’m still young and “good things come to those who wait” or should I actively approach people and build connections that might benefit me (increased self-confidence, assertiveness, wisdom)?

I went to a restaurant that holds a budget I'm comfortable with--presuming a girl doesn't ""abuse"" my generosity.

Girl sits down. Proceeds to order double appetizers, double entrees (the most expensive on the menu) and then tells me she only drinks champagne. Of course, the restuarant doesn't sell champagne by the glass. She wanted the most expensive bottle of champagne on the menu. I told the waiter, no, MOET will suffice.

Girl walked away with 2 massive leftover bags. 

Despite agreeing to a 2d date, I no showed. I told her ""You're a fantastic girl, but $550 USD in Kyiv for a first date is 🤯. Ordering double for everything (for you and mom), ordering the most expensive items on the menu...just doesn't work for me.

65,rjya2o,1639925577,crush on old classmate,"Hey, first of all, sorry for the longer post and if i have any typos, english is not my main language and im using a phone.

Im pretty shy and introverted guy, and i dont have really that much confidence in myself since im bigger guy (190cm tall, 122kg)

I(20M) used to have and still have a crush on my old classmate(20F), we havent talked since 4 years or something like that. We used to go out with our group of friends or chill at my place pretty much every night (the girl i have crush on was mostly the one who asked if we could go to my place etc). I stopped going out with them because of my injury, and after some time passed and i still didnt go out with them, they kicked me from that group (we also finished school that year and everyone went to study something else or go to work or something). I havent spoken to some of them for the last 4 years (I still talk with some of the boys, including the one who kicked me. He told me pretty much that since i didnt go out with them, then why am i in the group, he told me there was no hate, and i dont really give a fuck also about that group).

Im kind of shy, i never post any pics of myself anywhere, i just feel really awkward. I recently downloaded tinder (with fake name etc just to see who are using tinder near me etc), there was that same girl in tinder, and i dont know what to do. It just feels weird for me to make real tinder profile and swipe her right because tinder is pretty much ""hey, wanna date?"" kind of thing. Ofcourse i would like to date her,but i would like to start talking with her first etc, but it also feels really awkward to just message her on messenger or something since we havent spoken in so long.

 I was planning to message her and ask if she wanted to go to a song contest where they choose the song for Eurovision 2022. Its pretty much like a country based song contest, where winner represents our country at Eurovision. I know that she enjoyed the show alot when we were chilling at our place, she always loved watching it and even went to watch the live show. Thinking about saying like i got 2 tickets there for christmas or something and i dont have anyone else to bring or something, and i knew she was really interested in this song contest, and if she wanted to come. 

I have seen her sometimes around the city, when driving past her or something, and i cannot get her out of my head. I literally keep thinking about her. Ofcourse ive been thinking about her before, but now they have gone pretty crazy. Thinking about her got literally so bad that its difficult for me to even fall asleep, doesnt matter what time i go to bed, i still fall sleep around 3am, and my alarm is 5.30 am, So that really fucks me up at work.

What should i do?

My last 3 boyfriends after that relationship ended have been very skinny. I am very attracted to men that have sunken cheeks or some sort of indentation on their cheeks. I find that most men that have that look on their face tend to be very skinny. 

Now that I’ve noticed this trend it’s starting to make me feel a little weird. One other thing I’ve noticed is that they can be very focused on eating healthy or not eating anywhere near everyone else I know. Other times they have been into working out a lot of fasting. This usually leads to them wanting me to be more in shape, eat less or be skinnier. I’m somewhat critical of my own body and I feel a lot of pressure when they expect me to start working out more or eat less but I also see it as them caring about me since I can be hard on my self about weight gain.

I kind of dense when girls are talking to me, I've had girls try to engage me romantically but I'm so clueless it just goes right over my head and I don't realize it until later and kick myself for not reciprocating. This may sound weird but last night I had a dream that I went on a date with a girl and we kissed in the end. In the dream I remembered being so happy and over the moon that I was loved a desired, but then I woke up. I'm not ashamed to say cried a little when I realized it was just a dream.

Some people just say ""Oh you're entitled"" or ""Oh you just want s\*x and validation"" first off I know I'm not entitled to a girlfriend and anyone who does think they're entitled is wrong. Second, I've had s\*x and in my opinion, it's not that big of a deal in my opinion. I just think it would be nice to be in a reciprocating relationship, the loneliness is kind of soul-crushing. I've given up on dating apps because I'm camera shy and am not photogenic and more or less average in looks. I did get some matches and conversations but for the most part, I got radio silence. One interaction stuck with me the most, on tinder I was talking to this girl we were both average in looks and seemed to get along, and on paper, we seemed like a good couple but then she said something along the lines of ""you seem like a  genuine person but I kind of want to mess around with the hot guys on the app."" I understand this is one crappy interaction and tinder is a shit app, to begin with, but it really stuck with me. I know that not all women are like this but it really left a sour taste in my mouth.

The apps made me depressed so I got off. I know I'm not completely hopeless because I've gotten with women before but I think my issue is mental or I feel like I'm not relationship material or I'm too shy.

81,rjzo3t,1639929822,Suddenly feeling totally insecure. Am I messing this up?,"Long story short, been on a few dates with this new guy. He is nothing like anyone I’ve ever dated before. When we leave one date we always make plans for the next one, and it follows through. 

I have been single for about 2 years now. And just got back into dating recently. I feel I gave myself plenty of time to feel comfortable where I’m at in my life and confident within myself. 

In the beginning of this I felt like the most confident person. But I have this bad habit of once I start to like someone, I begin to feel like maybe I’m not good enough for them and feel as though I start to self sabotage myself. I haven’t had these feelings in years and I am trying so hard to swallow these feelings and not let them surface themself. However I feel like I may have show a bit of my insecurities already and am so afraid of turning this guy away.

He is still following through with plans, and assured me that he understands and it’s ok. But my gosh, I feel so dumb. I know it’s probably more (or all) within myself. But I am so afraid of messing this up. 

I don’t really have much of a question, more so just venting and wondering if anyone else ever feels this way and how you get through it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjzo3t/suddenly_feeling_totally_insecure_am_i_messing/
82,rjzoei,1639929847,"How would you react if your date messaged ""I also want to come"" to your girl friend's story at a bar?","tl;dr : Guy I have been seeing messaged one of my girl friend's saying ""I also want to come"" in response to her story at a bar. The night I had introduced to her over drinks, he had only spoken to her. And later kept teasing me with her name. 

&amp;#x200B;

longer version: been seeing this guy for a month, slept over at his place for a week before he traveled to his home country for Christmas. Since date 1, I had noticed himc checking out other girls and he kept talking about how his exes are in love with him, etc. I thought he's doing that since he's insecure about his height (he's 165 cm) and so wants to show he's desirable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I introduced him to my friends one night and he spent the entire night talking to just one girl friend of mine (they;re from the same city). She was also flirting with him. I walked out of the bar 4 hours later because I could not take it anymore. He followed me and told me that he was just trying to be nice and get along with my friends and was not interested in her. Anyway, he continued pulling my leg about the girl just for fun...until he met my friends another time and this time, I see my friend flirting with him. But I admit this time he didn't flirt - there was nothing from his side. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 days ago, my friend posted an Instagram story of her at a bar and he replied to the story saying ""I also want to come"". she told me this. i contacted him and asking him whats wrong with him because I don't want to be getting this unnecessary girl drama in my life - its awkward receiving messages from your friends saying my date messaged them this. he said he assumed I am with her and thought it was a normal message to send. he was looking for me in the rest of her insta stories later but didn't catch me and wondered why she found his message weird..I explained to him how he's always had 1000 girls in the picture, so much so, I don't expect us to go anywhere, but the least he could do is not hit on my friends when there's a million others he can find on bumble. 

&amp;#x200B;

AM I over reacting to this or do you also think it is weird for him to send such a message to my friend? 

&amp;#x200B;

please note; I work with this friend of mine and don't want to bring this in front of her...don't want her to see me getting insecure or something..appreciate your advice. thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjzoei/how_would_you_react_if_your_date_messaged_i_also/

I (f20) recently started dating this (M22) guy who’s in the navy. It’s been really great this far, I really like and care for the guy and we are on the same page about a lot of things both inside and outside of the relationship.

I never saw myself dating anyone in the military because of my own political beliefs and what not. But after the last election I opened myself up to the idea that it’s good to be open to listening to others experiences even though you may not agree with their beliefs and what not.

All this to say, sometimes good things come from not having a stick up your butt and being open to experiencing new things despite how you may have grown up and what you may have experienced in the past. :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjzwe4/never_did_i_ever_think_id_date_someone_in_the_navy/

I assume maybe she's just drunk and think nothing of it.

Our sex life has been pretty much dead for the past month. I personally have a high sex drive, she doesn't, I try tolerate it and it doesn't really seem like she wants to meet me halfway.

I'd sometimes try to cuddle her when we sleep and she'd just push me away, and just say ""I'm not in the mood"". Couple days later she starts questioning our relationship again and still implies that she doesn't love me anymore.

At this point I'm thinking... ok she's probably about to break up with me so I start preparing myself for that.

At some point I gave up.

I got an invite from an ex to have lunch and it went a little further than expected.

She goes on my computer (don't have a password on that one because I usually only use it for gaming and Netflix) checks my emails, sees bank transactions then checks my Instagram DMs, sees plans for lunch with one of my exes on my computer and loses it (understandably so).

(Straight) men: ""Every woman is so shallow or only cares about looks as such not getting any matches/likes.""

90,rk07j2,1639931478,Dating a satanist,"So a couple months ago I met a guy that I worked with who was a satanist. I didn’t want to judge him based on his religion bc I have always known satanist don’t literally worship satan, or at least i thought. We hung out and the first time we hung out we went to a bar and I got very fucked up to the point where I didn’t remember what happened the next day but when I woke up something didn’t feel right down there. I asked him if we had sex and he said we did he said i was asking for it. i immediately felt disgusted and taken advantage of but I knew I myself was also fucked up and what he said “I said” sounded like me so I never wanted to accept that he raped me so I just accepted it as I was too fucked up and I had sex. After that I continued to talk to him and even had sex w him after bc I felt like I would have more control over the situation if I had memorable sex with him I felt so taken advantage of not being able to remember the sex but he did. So then we start being open about our relationship at work and then rumors start that he is married, that he is a sex offender and ect. We talk about everything and he admits to me that he is a sex offender but that he didn’t have sex with a minor he said that he talked to a girl on Snapchat and got pics from her and once he realized she was underage he told her to stop contacting him and she got mad so she went to the police.....and then he told me he wasn’t married or living with the mother of his kids. Something wasn’t adding up to me it felt like he was lying and I tried leaving him countless times but it got to the point where he would beg me to be with him and since we worked together it was easier to just stay with him bc he would threaten me and say things like he was going to spread rumors about me or show people pictures of me so it was easier for me to just stay with him for the moment. Fast foward to yesterday, I kept trying to break up w him he started crying at work bc he had concert tickets and wanted to go w me even if it was the last time we hung out. I didn’t want to but after he started crying and acting hurt I was like fine I’ll go with you to the concert. We get to the concert and he is disgustingly fucked up can’t even stand straight, I had to baby him and at one point I decide to check his phone and read the convo between him and the mother of his child and sure enough the way the messages were they definitely lived together and were together. The night ended horribly he ended up breaking my phone and assaulting me bc I was talking to my ex even tho I kept trying to break up with him. I felt very suicidal after and it seems like from that first night of hanging w him my mental has been just getting darker and darker. I had to call my job and tell them about the assault and now I am pressing charges. I am so happy to say that I am out of this situation I hate that it had to get here. I say all of this to say, I’m never the type to judge anyone for their religion or anything honestly and although I am very spiritual. This situation really put my eyes in a different view when it comes to satanist, I don’t want to say all satanist are manipulative and liars but why is it that the one person I meet who is a satanist I have this horrible experience with? Most people assume satanist are bad people, I didn’t want to assume that but now I feel like I really should have.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rk07j2/dating_a_satanist/

I've been talking with a girl I like the past 3 months, yesterday was our first date, we went to the cinema and had a couple drinks.

Date was going smooth but nearly at the end she said that right now she can offer friendship because she is healing from a past relationship (Due to her ex, she cut relationship with her parents, suffers anxiety and depression, etc.). 

I feel that since we are talking she cares about me because I've been like an emotional support for her, we do no talk about her past relationship, only about the problems with her parents, her job and her bad habits. She, in tears, said that im one of the reasons that make her feel motivated to never come back and improve in this new year 2022.

Stayed friends and met weekly during lockdowns. He had a life changing situation which I supported him through and it made us close. 

We text multiple times a day. And he has just good me he has gotten me a Christmas present. We agreed not to and never have before. 

I think I am getting feelings again. I can’t date properly as I compare people to him. I have tried to limit contact, but I enjoy my friends company. 

I want to say something. But not too sure he feels the same. Also I don’t want to spoil the friendship. At times I think he is interested but others not. He will tell me of his dates occasionally - he doesn’t date much. But nothing progresses to a second. 

So a guy friend how texts me multiple times a day and wants to plan things with me. He buys me treats, such as my favourite food or trips to cinema. I do make him food and pay for things too. But he always says they are treats. 

I don’t text my female friends this often and do pay for occasional lunches etc, but it’s normally split.  

When we were dating he was not this attentive. Now he is.  Is this a sign he interested? Or a mature friendship? Surely he would of made a move?
