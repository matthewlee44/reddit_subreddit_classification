A couple of them even said I was the first(only) person who they could rely on other than their mom.. Both of them were much older than me and knew me only for like 2 months.

3,n947ri,1620652640,My bf (24M) wont resolve things with my best friend (23F),"This is my first time posting so please bear with me… [T/W: su*cide/r*pe]

My bf (24M) and I (23F) have been dating for about a year and 5 months… About 3 months in, my best friend of 9 years (23F) and her boyfriend came to visit me, and they all met for the first time. We all had a really nice weekend together, and she told me how much she approves of my relationship.

Flash forward to September 2020, my best friends boyfriend (they had been dating for 4 years) broke up with her out of the blue. She was obviously devastated and I ended up cancelling several plans with my boyfriend to support her. My boyfriend was very empathetic (he even helped us redecorate her flat, mount her TV etc.) in the weeks after, but he did start to get frustrated about our lack of one on one time, which I can understand. We had already been doing long-distance through the first UK lockdown (which was very hard on both of us) so the fact that we could finally be together in person was obviously important to both of us.

I tried my best to compromise between the two of them (ie: seeing him on days that she had plans with other friends or bringing him w me to see her), but as this went on I did notice that my best friend was being a little passive aggressive/rude to him. For example, if he’d come with me to her flat she’d shut herself in her room n refuse to really interact with him, despite her being completely okay with me and our other friend before he’d show up. I tried to dismiss this as her just lashing out after her breakup, but obviously it did upset me a little. 

I have a complicated relationship with my best friend. She has a lot of flaws, she can be self absorbed, selfish and ungrateful sometimes, and we do have a difference in maturity… But she’s been with me through every high and low I’ve ever had, and she’s family to me. When we first started being friends (at age 14) I was diagnosed with panic disorder and anxiety, and she was supporting me with my daily panic attacks/vomiting etc at school. Throughout the years my MH deteriorated (I attempted su*cide when we were living together) and I’ve been diagnosed with depression, self harm, ED, OCD and a mood disorder. Her and her boyfriends visit that I mentioned earlier was actually to support me following a r*pe. She’s been there with me through it all. As much as we’ve had problems in the past, she is one of the very few people I know I can rely on if I ask.. But throughout the early days of her breakup she was especially awful to all the people who cared about her, and my boyfriend saw all of this first hand. I know that he didn’t really like how she was treating me and our other friends, especially because he knows about my MH issues… I was also angry and resentful. I kept comparing her behaviour with mine at my worst (saying that I was never mean to anyone after my attempt etc), but as time has gone on I’ve forgiven her as I do understand that she was in the worst place that SHE has ever been in and everyone copes differently.

Since those first 2 months of her breakup she ended up taking time off her post-grad studies and moving back home to stay with her family during covid, and my boyfriend and I were back on track. She was coping better away, and bc of time differences etc we were keeping less in touch. But as the UK went into lockdown again my boyfriend and I started having more and more fights, and struggled with long distance. After one big argument we ended up breaking up and didn’t have any contact for a few days… My best friend was face-timing me and supporting me through it, but was getting frustrated that my boyfriend wasn’t reaching out to resolve anything. She ended up posting a story on her instagram alluding to us both being single, and that evening is when my boyfriend finally spoke to me and told me he wanted to work on things.

Since then my boyfriend and I have patched things up, but after that post he basically blocked her off of his social media. Months have passed since then and he still hasn’t undone it, which is now making me feel uncomfortable. He keeps saying that hes not mad, he just doesn’t want to see her posts and that social media shouldn’t matter, but she’s mentioned to me that she feels upset and uncomfortable that my boyfriend has cut her out. I know social media is not that important, but given the fact that they have no face-to-face interaction, I do see my best friends side that it creates tension. I’ve begged him to smooth it over but he’s stubborn and just refuses to, even though I’ve told him that he’d be doing it for ME not for her… I can’t deal with the fact that I’ve been basically put in the middle of both of them for more than a year now… My best friend is planning to move back to the UK very soon, so I really don’t want tension between the two of them, especially if I want all of us to spend time together. 

Sorry if this was a really long-winded post, but theres a lot of layers to the issues between them… Does anyone have any advice on what I should do in this situation?  I feel like things would be easier if my boyfriend just unblocked her, but he refuses to see my side. I don’t really know what to do…",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n947ri/my_bf_24m_wont_resolve_things_with_my_best_friend/
4,n9490o,1620652743,"Ex date (F26) is dating someone new, but I (M23) would like to date her again. Should I tell her?"," Hey  Reddit, i was looking for some opinions.. Little backstory: I was in a  relationship with a girl (let's call her J), which was my first love. We  broke up around 1.5 years ago. After a few months I met M (F26) and we  started dating. We had an amazing time and it was all going really  great, with a lot of passion from both.

It  all went well until J contacted me again and again trying to get back  with me, which I refused, but where I also didn't completely block her.  After a while though, because of her being my first love probably, she  got back into my feelings a little bit and it felt I couldn't continue  with M. A while after, I got back together with J, but after some time  we also again noticed why it didn't work out and why we just didn't fit  together. Looking back at it, I should have known and it was a bit  against advice of people, but I guess I had to learn it this way.

Now,  a few months after again breaking up with J, M messaged me to just send  me happy birthday wishes. I already had a little bit in mind that I  fucked up and should have stayed with M, because everything was so  amazing with her, and I guess I was blind.. But then last week it was  her birthday and I send her a happy birthday message and in between we  talked a bit every here and there after not having contact for months.  Now I went to her place for her birthday just to talk and have a fun  day!

So I went there, we were  talking updating each other, having fun, got some food for us, drank a  bit and it was just all fun and laughing, making a little walk etc, all  just pretty much like it always was. At one point she mentioned she just  started dating someone again, which she said was going very good. From  the one side, I was very happy for her, also realising that she was hurt  in the past mostly by a guy that cheated on her etc. From the other  side though, I wanted to ask her that day if she wanted to try it again  with me, and it was a bit of a bummer also hearing that she started  dating.

Because I was happy to see  her feeling good and not trying to get her confused or something, I  didn't mention that I wanted to try it again with her. However, the rest  of the night was also just very fun, and I also slept over at her  place, in her bed also. She always was just okay with that and said it  was no problem, but I also kind of sensed she was feeling very good and  comfortable with me.

Now, what I'm  struggling with a bit is what I should do. I want to respect her  (that's also why I didn't mention that I wanted to get back with her  explicitly, and I didn't try anything with her that day), and I want to  see her happy. On the other side, I just would have liked to start  dating with her again.

So reddit..  Should I just let it go a bit, get some time over it and maybe next  time when we meet that we talk about it? Should I just text her that I  didn't want to tell her at first, but it's something that's just what I  want? Or should I just not tell her about it and see what happens if it  continues with the new guy she's dating? I am just looking for some  opinions, or advice.

Tldr: should I tell my ex date that I want to date her again, while she's dating someone new?

21,n96s7b,1620658481,In-A-Relationship Anxiety,"Being in a relationship can give you a complex set of feelings towards things and situations. And such feelings are of different kinds too. The toxic feeling in a relationship is one of them --which alot of us is mostly familiar with. I'll try to make this short and brief as much as I can. I dont know how to specifically express everything to stress out the main points but.. here it goes. 

When one has been through a toxic relationship from the past, things can be at times challenging with them.. if you're gf/bf has been through one before, know that they have (1) Trust issues — being lied to/cheated on hurts, a load lot. Which will lead them to feel insecure, resulting to them protecting low self esteem.  They have self doubts and they'd feel like they're not good enough for someone. Heartbreaking as it already is, it's one of the toughest things they are trying to overcome. 
May you be patient and genuine enough to make time, to reassure and remind them of their worth, that they are loved, they are enough, and you are proud of him/her. (2)Trauma, they hate it when flashbacks keep popping out of nowhere in their thoughts from the things that hurt them the most. Those that they wish they've buried for the rest of their lives. Most of the time, they will never tell you — and that's painful.
May you never get tired of giving kisses, cuddles and snuggles everytime you are next to them. Basically, just treat them right.  (3) They overthink ,(so) sensitive, and (or) has the need to say sorry everytime. A common result from trauma, their system will automatically think that if something is wrong or when you have misunderstandings, it's always their fault. 
They cry or walk away out of fear that they'll reexperience the amount of pain they have felt from the past. To them, they would choose that over hearing things that would make them feel worse. 
May you be able to set aside pride, reach out and comfort them, if you are in the middle of something — stop! Stop at what you are doing ,if you can, and talk to them. 

Being in their shoes is harder than you think. Most of the time, they get misunderstood. I'm not a relationship expert and I'm not saying this applies to everybody, but just want to share what one would mostly encounter or feel when he/she has been from a toxic realtionship. I experienced it too and I understand, a couple of years had already passed by but I'm still struggling to overcome some of it. It takes time to heal -- it takes a serious, dedicated, loving partner to wash away all the insecurities and fears toxic relationships gave them.

I'm dipping my toe back into dating after being in a 4.5-year relationship that was very toxic, so I'm wary of the people I talk to and their behaviours. 

So I've been talking to this guy for just under a week now, we met on Tinder and have been talking every day. We've arranged to meet up next weekend.

I feel like I'm overthinking this, but yesterday I went to check his Tinder profile (my friend wanted to see a picture of who I was talking to) and noticed that he had uploaded a new picture. 

Obviously, this in itself is totally fine, we're not committed hell we haven't even met IRL yet, but he keeps talking about how much he's into me and all the cute dates he wants to take me on and whatnot, and how 'perfect' I seem to be for him, but why upload a new picture the same day you're saying all this if that makes sense?

I don't mind if he's talking to other people, but I would just want to know. I personally don't like speaking to multiple people at once, I don't have the energy. The things he's been saying don't seem like something you'd say if you were also interested in other people.

30,n99g7q,1620664393,FWB - dating others as a way to avoid getting attached a valid option?,"So yeah...I kinda know the answer but feel stupid enough to ask anyway. I'm one of those that's ok being a single independent female and like to keep things casual. I'm lucky enough that I can go in and out of wanting to be alone and needing pp without a lot of effort so I just go get it when I need it. Before Covid, I did OLD for a few months and found a few pp for FWB type and had fun. I worked a lot and that worked for me. Then the pandemic happened, my area was pretty strict and to be safe I stopped casually socializing.

Now, I moved and in a new area and after being vaccinated etc. I got back to OLD and meeting pp again. But after the year we all had, it feels different. I have more time to reflect on what I'm doing and I dunno it's confusing me lol. I met a couple of pp so far irl that didn't go anywhere except ONS but found a FWB last month. FWB in that we keep meeting up still. We vibed pretty well from the start and met up 4 times now. Once a week we spend 5-6 hours together ""dating"". He might have been opened to meet more but I'm busy and told him I'm only free on weekends. We don't text much in between, but comes Friday, he'll check in and we starts again and making plans to meet up. I'm not a texter with him and prefer irl so it works. So what's the problem?

I guess I'm feeling self pressure to keep looking for other pp to ""date"" so that I don't get emotionally attached. Is this a thing that's healthy when there is not pressure from either of us to want more or to commit? I know most of you guys are going to be like if it works what's the big deal. Why am I tripping? I don't want a deeper commitment to or from anyone and I learned that ONS is too much effort for not enough return and too empty for me. So why all the confusion now?

I like going out and eating, drinking and talking and having sex with an easygoing chill person I'm attached to. I guessed that's what we're doing. What is that? Why do I feel like running away? I haven't had such an easy time with someone in a while. Is it even dating or what is going on? I dunno why I'm not chill. Sorry in advance for the long post.

Why the fuck should I seek a relationship?,"I polled redditors recently on how much they’d tell someone about themselves if they are extremely close and they fully trust the person. The results were roughly: about 1/3 would tell them only what they wanted them to know, 1/3 would tell them a lot but keep a good bit secret, 1/3 would tell them most things but keep a few things secret. Not that many said they would tell them everything. And this matches the way my intuitions about people. People are chameleons. They’re always hiding something and disguising themselves to a certain extent. And to whatever extent they are doing that, they cannot necessarily be trusted.

Maybe part of it is my personality too. I’ve kinda always been a little paranoid. And personal experiences haven’t helped: they’ve basically validated my “paranoia” as perhaps appropriate.

He has said he's lived with a cat before but not much of a cat person (he owns a dog). I have a cat but I'm not much of a dog person. He's also allergic to cats and says it's not a problem.

I feel like this is a deal breaker because it's just going to be awkward being alone with each others animal or maybe I am reading into things.

He would throw my cat off places she wasn't supposed to be on but didn't listen to me when I said she just needs a 'NO, DOWN'

But I can't tell if he's just playing or not...

For a starter, he has a wild past (Fraternity/drugs). He wanted to kiss me and invited me to his place on the first date. I told him I don't do hookups and asked him if that's what he wanted. He said, he's done it before and was up for it if there's chemistry.

Then he asked me out again. I was on the fence but I found him interesting as person so we did go on other dates. After the 4 dates, now I really like him. I think he's cute and has a great personality.

But only thing that makes me still skeptical is that he doesn't put much effort into the dates. He usually wants to hangout indoor, and I suggest outdoor activities. And he's really flirty. So whenever he says he can't wait to see me or he misses me, I can't tell if he's joking. He texts me everyday -good morning/goodnight.

We haven't done anything physical because I like going slow and getting to know the person first. And he said he's okay with that and didn't make a big deal.

A lot of guys are really bad about choosing pictures for dating profiles.

They helped me out with my profile and this is the advice they gave (for context I would say I am a pretty average looking guy, and am short, but I still had a pretty high success rate mostly because of the photos I choose):  
1. Make sure that you include a pic of your whole body, not just your face.   
2. Make sure to have at least 1 to 2 group pictures, and make sure there are girls in those photos. It makes you look more sociable and shows that you have female friends.   
3. Show some pics that demonstrate you are fun to be around. I had a photo of me in a big pink onesie as my first pic, and at least half of the girls I matched with mentioned the onesie is why they picked me.

53,n9by6c,1620670440,How to tell if it's you or not.,"Dating is a high rejection activity. That means if you get a ""no"" most of the time, it doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. This is hard because we learn that most of the time if you're getting mostly ""no's"" you need to step back and reassess. 

In dating, getting mostly rejection is not a sign of a problem...probably. Like looking for a job, or auditioning for a role, most people get turned down vastly more than they get picked. While you might feel like you're compatible with everyone, you're probably only really compatible with 5% of people you encounter in dating. So being turned down isn't a sign you're doing it wrong...it's a sign you're doing it!

Your past failure doesn't predict future success. 

Good people still struggle to know whether the common denominator in dating rejections is them. If you're wondering for some signs of whether your lack of dating success is about you, or about the fact that you just have found your compatible people yet, here are some things to ask yourself:

1. Do you have other good relationships in your life? Good friends, a healthy friend group, decent relationships with co-workers, and/or family if your family is nice and normal. Many people who complain the loudest about being alone, it turns out don't have any relationships and are wanting to put all of those needs onto a romantic partner. Making friends as an adult is HARD. But so is a romantic relationship! If you lonely, take some time to put some focus on your non-romantic relationships. You don't need a BFF, or to be close with your entire high school friend group. But you need people in your life you can talk to about hard things, spent time with, who appreciate who you are and treat you well. A lot of my friends who struggle with dating also have a long history of cutting off friends, huge dramatic friend breakups, and all that bitterness and anger is poured into dating, so that they can find their romantic partner and not ever need friends again. Friends are not a placeholder for a romantic partner. 

2. Do you have a support system? A romantic partner should be one thread in the safety net of a support system. If you put all your weight on one person, they will break. A support system can be family members, friends, mentors, online communities. Ideally at least one person you can text and say ""I'm having a hard time"" and get a healthy, welcoming response. This people don't fall into your life. You need to be that person for other people, and make sure they are also that person back to you. If you have never had a supportive, healthy non-romantic relationship then therapy is a good starting point. Therapy can be the first thread that you build the safety net around. 

3. Are constantly moving the goal posts of what it would take to make you happy? It's okay to be lonely as a single person, to wish for a relationship, to miss physical closeness. The same way it's normal to be unhappy in a bad job, or in a crappy apartment, or horrible roommates. But it's a red flag if you find yourself thinking ""If only for X thing, I would be a happy person."" ""If only for X thing, I would be the person I want to be."" If you have a horrible roommate, or a crappy apartment, or a bad job, or are unhappily single it's fine to think ""I am pretty happy expect for X thing, which I wish I could change."" But one's happiness shouldn't be tied up completely in one thing. If you think you are only unhappy because of X reason, and your life will totally turn around if X changes, you have an unrealistic idea of how happiness works. Happy people know how to be happy even when things aren't going well. Unhappy people are unhappy even when they get what they want. They just change the goal posts when it happens, and blame their unhappiness on other things. 

4. Do you know and talk to people of the opposite sex outside of romantic interests? (for hetero folks, clearly). If the only time you ever interact with a woman/man is when they are a romantic pursuit, you risk both idealizing and objectifying the opposite sex, and only seeing them as a means to an end. You're susceptible to this if you find yourself grouping all women/men together. If a woman dislikes you because you wear the wrong shoes, do you think ""All women care about shoes and now I have to care about shoes too if I want a relationship."" Or do you think ""That one woman sure cares a lot about shoes!"" Don't extrapolate about half the people in the world from a handful of experiences. And don't be a person who frames everything you like as what ""all"" men or women like. 

5. Do you have a combative attitude towards dating? If you approach dating as a conflict between you and the sex of your interest, then you will turn off a lot of people. Having a romantic partner means having a teammate. You can't find a teammate while hating everyone who's picking teams. If your only emotional response you can have to being rejected is to hate on the person rejecting you, then you aren't ready to date yet. 

6. Lastly, do you smell good and look clean? It merits being said. So many people are failing at dating because they do NOT smell good or do NOT look clean, and no one is telling them. Wear clean clothes, shower regularly, wash your sheets (at least one a month) open your windows to your bedroom so it doesn't smell like a gym. I should not smell anything when I'm a foot away from you, and I should smell nice things like laundry soap and shampoo smell when I go in for a hug. You don't need to go to the gym if you don't want to, you don't need to get in shape, you don't have to spent a lot of time or money on what you wear if you don't want to. But you need to smell nice, and look clean. (And wearing clothes that fit properly also helps). 

If you read through these five things, and say to yourself ""that's not really an issue with me"" then just trust that your success level with dating is a reflection of the reality that dating is majority rejection and your past failure isn't a prediction of future success. When you get rejected, that means you're dating! If it hits too hard, step back and take care of yourself. It's okay if rejection stings, it probably always will, but please don't take it as a sign that there is something wrong with *you* and examine everything you do and say to find the problem.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9by6c/how_to_tell_if_its_you_or_not/

55,n9cz3q,1620672948,I was hurt and humiliated by a woman on Bumble,"I recently matched with this very pretty woman who was my age (mid-30s) and we began chatting.

I told her I had never sent a dick pic before and she replied ""well, this might be a good time for your first."" I told her I was a little on the small side but she said it didn't matter and she wouldn't judge. So I stood in front of the mirror, pulled my pants and underwear down, and took one. I made sure I had a boner so it would look as big as possible. I sent it and nervously waited for a reply. I anxiously sat there for about 10 minutes and then she sent me back a pic. It was of her with 3 other women, each of them holding up their phones with my dick pic on them and they were all making the ""small peen"" hand sign! It looked like they were at a bar and they were laughing! I was so devastated!

I (30F) feel with my past experiences that my gut has always been right but I ignored it when I shouldn’t have, but this could be a case of things making sense in hindsight or confirmation bias.

I’m in a current situation where I’m dating a man (29M) (very short amount of time, only a month or two) and my gut is telling me that he’s not safe, not genuine, not completely honest and that somethings not right.  At first I couldn’t pinpoint exactly why I felt this way about him and I figured that it was my issue (that I’m not in touch with my needs, I’m not communicating clearly enough my boundaries/needs, I’m not asking enough direct questions to clear up the confusion in my head). But even after being more direct, having more open conversations, being very direct and explicit with my boundaries and needs, I still feel he’s contradictory, evasive with his answers and not being straight with me.  I still have this overwhelming feeling that he’s not genuine and that he’s just telling me whatever he thinks I want to hear.

My gut is saying run but my mind is saying “he’s not a bad guy, you’re overthinking things” and my mind is making excuses for his contradictions.

What are other people’s experiences with gut feelings? If your gut feels that someone is unsafe or disingenuous, have you been right?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9dc3s/is_your_gut_instinct_about_a_romantic_partner/

62,n9duyt,1620675135,The fundamental problem with reddit including this sub: views held by the majority are always felt to be right. Minority views aren’t actually protected. They are called toxic and extreme and dismissed as false and crazy,"Even though it is known that groups of people can often be irrational and harbor bias. And majority groups often dismiss and dehumanize minority groups of all types. But all that is fluid too. If a self-identified minority group or a gender rallies enough of the other side to the way they think about things. They are effectively the majority group in a democratic setting. They have political power. So it becomes especially easy to dehumanize the side without political power.

I think this is the fundamental thing that makes reddit so toxic. Everything becomes an opinion popularity contest. The actual truth of the matter doesn’t necessarily matter. The popular people just win. And real discourse is difficult because of the medium conversations happen in. It’s basically set up for people to talk past each other.

69,n9eq8c,1620677307,Getting on the right track,"So pretty much I've been seeing a girl lately. I've known her since September last year and we did meet up on a friendship base from time to time. She liked some boys at that time, tried a relationship but failed (only lasted 1 month) and I've been there kinda in the background. I didn't think about it more, but lately I did catch feelings for her and started to meet her in a more date-ish manner (going to the park , drinking a bit together, having fun, dancing etc. a bit cringy ik but it is very enjoyable for both of us :) ). Last time we even watched the stars and philosophized about stuff. 
I've been trying to make a buildup to ultimately ask her to be my girfriend, but even though I was close to doing it, I believe it needs some mlre time and 'dates'.

Now I do believe I made some mistakes too:
1. I never really explicitly asked for a date, just asked if we wanna see eachother
2. The second thing is that I've been doing some moves, like puttin my arms around her, she put her leg over mine while laying down, I touched her leg and held her hand. It all sounds nice but the thing that I never asked for consent because it just happened really buggs me out totally
3. This is not a mistake more like a question which is that she said that it was nice meeting me and stuff when I asked her the day after (I am kinda insecure if she really thinks the same about me)

What do u guys and girls ofc think?

Feels really weird coming to Reddit for dating support, but I don't want to go to some weird forum or something like that so here we go... :)

So, I've had a crush on this girl for 1,5 years now. I decided that nothing good was going to come out of it a few months back, so I told myself that I hated her, I talked shit about her, I changed the heart emojis to some Chinese food and chopsticks on her username on snap. It worked, but now we're back here again (yayyyy). I have a theory why I might have come back to liking her. The thing is, my social life is very limited, and I don't have many friends. Not because I do not have the option to, I just don't trust people enough to begin a friendship. The friends I do have are very toxic and I feel left out most of the time. So yeah my lack of friends played a roll in my setback, or what do you think Reddit psychologists?

She's by far the prettiest girl I have ever seen, she's intelligent, funny, charming, hard-working, passionate, athletic etc. This is the first time I have ever felt this way about someone, and I hate it because it won't evolve into something.

To anyone who comments, please state yes or no as to whether you personally think they work as a 'situationship' kind of deal. And also if you have been in one before and how did this play out.

For a solid definition, I would define a perfect FWB as both parties involved are friends, they have set the ground rules that they can't take things further (for whatever reason) and that no feelings will get involved. Just casual sex whenever they need it. And they can walk away whenever they need to without any emotional attachment or hurting either person.

For me personally, I have been involved in two and they didn't end well. Feelings got involved. The first FWB the other person caught feelings and I resisted, whilst my second FWB was the opposite, I caught the feels (ahhh karma). Both ended with someone being hurt.

Which begs the question for me, can intimate relationships of this kind last?

I can’t go anywhere or do anything that I don’t have to be reminded I’m too much of a freak for a relationship.

I started watching The Boys on Amazon and romantic relationship and sex are massive parts of a show about killing superheroes.

If I go on to Instagram all it is are just my friends all happy in relationships and in love.

We share similar ambitions career-wise, have a very similar type of humour, and in general mesh well personality-wise. We would speak often and plentiful over text messaging.

The third date that we had was just the same: incredibly fun and good with each other. It was so good we lost track of time and we could not leave due to curfew. We ended up sleeping the night together, fooled around a bit but since we both had to be up early for work we didn't escalate it further. In the morning I noticed, however, that she was particularly cranky. Now this could obviously be typical morning crankiness, so I left it at that but it did make me wonder. Anyways it still was pleasant talking and I was really enjoying it, and she seemed to still really enjoy talking to me.

Anyways, up to this points our dates had been relatively infrequent, every 3 weeks or so. I asked, also partially due to the crankiness, whether she would like to meet up more frequently. After an hour or two however, I got a text back saying she did not see the relationship going further than friendship. So, I thought, right, she friend-zoned me, good excuse, time to move on.

However, as it turned out, she did want to be actual friends. About a week or two after that text, she met up with me with a bunch of friends of mine and it was really good. We had fun, my friends liked her, she liked my friends. It was a fun day, and I was at peace with just being friends.

However, my friends were quick to point out the next day that whilst I still seemed to show some interest, she also was still showing interest through her body language and how she interacted with me and was still fairly huggy. Two weeks later, she came over again, with one of those friends, and I realised she was indeed very physically close with me and touchy-feely, and at the end of the night (albeit quite drunk) she gave me a peck on the lips before leaving. The next day I had to visit her for something else, and I spoke to her about it because she kept being fairly physically comfortable with me. Now, we were both again fairly drunk so it was not an in-depth conversation or anything, but she reiterated wanting to be friends and that she is not in a place right now where she feels like she can date because she values her alone time and feels like career-wise there isn't a place for dating again.

A few days ago she came over again to chill with just me this time, and I noticed that again, she was very huggy and touchy-feely, and, before getting too inebriated, I decided to initiate the conversation again in-depth. She again reiterated not really feeling a chemistry from her side between us, but that she did really wanna invest in our friendship.

Now, that might seem fairly evident by then, but I noticed that after that talk she got even more physically comfortable and at the end of the night, as she was leaving home and we said our goodbyes, she opened herself up for a kiss again, but I ended up just giving her one on the cheek. The last week or so, the text conversations have remained very positive and happy between each other.

So on the one hand I have a person, who I both like a lot as a person and romantically, say she does not feel a romantic interest in me. But at the same time, I get these signals from her, that my friends also pick up on and recognise and point out to me, that she still wants a bit more than a regular friendship entails (particularly of the opposite sex). This cognitive dissonance, in a way, is really starting to mess me up as if it were actual heartache, and it's affecting me physically and mentally. I really like this person, and would really want to invest in a good friendship with her, but the way she continues to behave really leaves me in a confused state. My friends have all these differing theories on the situation, but all seem a bit 'too' out there.

90,n9glem,1620682070,In my own head,"I've (23) been seeing this girl (20) for only 2 weeks we've been out 3 times now. So last time we went out I took her out to dinner at this really cool tapas bar that combined as a book and record store. Date went great. And we vibe really well. So after the date she invites me back to her place and things start heating up. Now I was able to get in the mood we had some foreplay and had some oral but when we went for PIV I went soft. We slowed down and tried again a bit after and the same happened.

I don't know what to think. I am really attracted to this girl and I want to satisfy her but I could not perform and I don't know why. I am a healthy person, I run regularly, I eat well, I wasn't even tipsy just had one drink at dinner. I just am not sure what was wrong with me...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9glem/in_my_own_head/

95,n9gzha,1620683080,Giving Up,"After five straight years of maintaining a tinder account, swiping on thousands of profiles, getting hundreds of matches and going on dozens of dates with no success whatsoever in terms of getting any kind of relationship going, today is the day I'm calling it quits. If you haven't already guessed, I'm a straight man. My whole life, I've been cursed with the #1 biggest turn-off among women, social awkwardness, and I am highly confident that I'm on the autism spectrum even though my parents never got me officially tested. I know I'm not unattractive as I get a decent amount of matches in comparison to lots of guys I know and I was rated a 7 on average on r/rateme but man, my lack of social skills has been killer. Nearly every woman I've gone on a date with has immediately either rejected me, ghosted me, or said they just wanted to be friends. The only time I got past the first date was with my ""ex-girlfriend"" who then turned out to be a lesbian though she and I are still decent friends. I'm in the process of coming to terms with the fact that I'm unloveable and it hurts. But once I do come to terms with all of this, I'm confident that I'll be able to move on with my life and it might be for the better as I'll be able to focus nearly all my attention towards investing in myself and my career. And I'll be able to meet my intimacy needs through hookups and my companionship needs through my two good friends. The main problem is that for our entire lives, society has brainwashed us into thinking that finding a woman/man is the most important thing in life, and that we can't live complete lives without marriage or an otherwise serious romantic relationship. Trying to rid our minds of that kind of societal programming is extremely difficult.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9gzha/giving_up/
96,n9gzje,1620683084,"I think i got an eye contact from a girl, but i am not sure if it tells me something or it was just a genuine smile that i misinterpreted","Today at work i moved to a new department, and after the lunch break and back to my post i noticed whenever i look to that girl coworker in front of my post i find her cutely looking at me and she dosen't take her eyes off when i look back at her, i got stressed and quickly took my eyes off, i thought she maybe was just looking at my direction and nothing else but i found her cute and so tried to look again and agin to make sure, and each time i do i got her looking at my eyes and so i get stressed up and take my eyes off again, after doing it several times i decided to strengthen my courage and keep my eyes on hers to see what will happens and i did it, we eye contacted like 3 secs and then she smiled to me, it was cute and i smiled back to her but my stupid anxiety makes me blushing so obvious and i forced myself to pretend being busy talking to the colleagues.

After work my transport came very early and didnt get the chance to say hello, i am new to the office and i think that maybe she saw me the first time there and maybe was trying to creat an eye contact while i stupidly ignoring it, i will mostly see her tomorrow again but i dont know if its worth to go talk to her after because my mind telling me she would probably just genuinely being kind or confused because she saw me at the office for the first time, but its also probably just my anxiety giving me reasons to not go and talk.

The girl is really cute but i fear i maybe misinterpreting and would put myself in a weird situation if i tried to eye contacting her again or talking to her after that, Any advices guys?

She came up on my hinge and I liked her photo. I waited a few days and she didn't like me back. I deleted the app as I wasn't having much luck on it anyway.

I downloaded it yesterday to find that she had matched with me and sent me a message 3 days ago. 

I apologised for my late response and explained that I had deleted the app and so couldn't receive her message. I also then answered her question and asked her a question too.

It's 24 hours later and she has not responded. I'm worried I missed my chance with her. I'm so heartbroken.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9h8zi/think_i_missed_my_chance/
