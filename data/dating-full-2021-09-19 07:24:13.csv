All 7 days of the week have melted into a blob. I can't tell you what I did this Monday and Tuesday. At all. I can't tell the difference between days anymore. The only way I could tell the passage of time these last 2 months is that I would go to my girlfriend's house on the weekends. 

I broke up with my girlfriend today and went out with some friends for drinks afterward. I was reflecting on the relationship and I thought of how long we were together, almost 3 months. I started a new job 3 weeks after we met and every single day between then and today is one single blob. I cannot tell you a single thing I did in August. In my mind it is July. Some past events feel near but turns out they actually happened in June. I am a drone. I code, I read, I eat the fastest thing I can to get back to more work, I put off showering until after work. I can't fall asleep at night because I feel guilty for not putting my ideas into action at that moment. I won't brush my teeth until after I've reviewed any comments on my CR's from last night and then I vigorously push out another CR. God forbid I don't make a CR by 5pm, someone might not see it and I'm fucked until next standup. When I finish a task, I feel relief but it only lasts until the next one. If I'm done with my tasks (miracle) I feel obliged to work on the side to get ahead. Only one person can get promoted a quarter. It needs to be me.

This is my week: Monday is when I need to push out code ASAP so that if it's blocked, I can fix it asap. Tuesday I make corrections or additions to Monday's work and wallow in too many meeting. Wednesday is my oh shit day because time is running out. Thursday I'm on damage control mode if I'm behind, and at this job I'm always behind in one or thing or the other. Friday I scramble to push out code before people leave for the weekend.

I had assigned a dollar value to every day spent socializing instead of working. My next promotion's raise (based on the salary band where I work) will be somewhere around \~50k. It could be high as 100 or as low as 35, but let's take 50k for a conservative estimate. This promotion takes 1-2 years. If I do it in a year that's 50k more I make in my next year. But I need to study on the weekends, I need to code like I breathe. 52 weekends in a year, 50k more from the promotion next year, that's $500 in lost opportunity cost I spend per Saturday/Sunday just to fuck my girl! Here's a worse number: If I retire at 65, and if the market does 6.5% over the next 39 years, that $500 will become $3105. That's over $3000 in NPV cost I'm sacrificing, sometimes twice a week. I'm a first-generation immigrant. Both my parents are remarried with no kids. My grandparents are broke as shit. My stepfather has cancer, my father is getting old with no savings. I feel a responsibility to use the opportunities available to me to do everything I can to succeed.

When I'm blocked at work, I do a side project. When I finish a piece of the side project, I read a book. I've developed a nervous tic of blinking or grinding my teeth if I'm tired. And I'm always tired now.

I don't like what I've become. Today was the first day since my second week of work that I felt really calm. I didn't understand what was happening to me until I saw my friends and I could laugh again. I've become some kind of robot. I immediately booked two separate vacations in the next month. I can wait a few months for that promo. I can't do this anymore.

I felt like my ex became the lazy one not contributing any effort but I think now this job has sapped me of any mental energy to devote to anything else.

She genuinely does like me and she really did enjoyed the dates we had with each other. Heck, she even got me addicted to a video game she fangirled over me. She's unsure of dating and may possibly get back to it after her school but she isn't firm and couldn't tell if she meant by me or just general dating other guys. She said she still wants to remain friends with me and we can still talk to each other on voice call or even do other things, but Im reluctant on staying friends as my insecurities may rise. At the same time apparently, I was actually the first person to ever hear her personal issues as she vented to me too about personal issues since she never emotionally opened them up to her friends or family. With my insecurities, first one being that she may end up dating someone else which would definitely hurt me and second with getting an unhealthy mindset with getting my hopes up believing that ""oh she will change her mind"" ""she'll want me back"".  I was reaffirmed from a friend of hers that she isn't the type to be dating around or even have time to think about guys as it always about work and school. She's also still relatively new in dating as she only dated one person in H.S but nothing happened between them as it was awkward. I and she was in fact the longest we ever dated each other, even though it was only 4 dates. All of them were so fun, we couldn't stop talking to each other. We even have voice calls to watch anime together.

My girlfriend (f23) loves doing FaceTime calls very early in the morning. I work usually from 12/4pm to 11pm-1am. She goes to bed very early in the morning as do I (1-4am). We work at the same job and work very similar shifts so on work days we see each other mostly our entire shift. But lately my gf has been FaceTiming me very late at night when she’s trying to sleep and they last over an hour.  I Pretty much have to stop whatever I’m doing and exclusively be on the phone with her the entire time. She says that she needs to see me and hear my voice to fall asleep. That’s normally fine but being on my phone, and having my mind engaged in something (like a phone call/conversation) makes it very very hard for me to fall asleep after. So I’m on the FaceTime, waiting for her to fall asleep while I’m sitting wide awake because the phone screen is keeping me up. I don’t want to be a dick because I love her and it genuinely seems to help her sleep, but I am busy most of the day as I now have a career internship and now all of my daily free time is sitting on FaceTime waiting for her to all asleep. I have to be up early now due to said internship, and it’s extremely inconvenient to have an hour of early morning time dedicated exclusively to her sleep schedule. For example today, after my 12 hour Shift I came home to do some internship work and had an hour of free time before bed. I wanted to listen to music and relax with a glass of whiskey (yes I’m texting her 24/7) but all of a sudden I have to be on a FaceTime call for 90 minutes looking at her sleeping face when I can’t do anything else. After it’s over, I’m 30 minutes late to bed, lying in bed wide awake due to the screen and had 0 free time to myself because the FT call took the only time I had. 

I love her so much but it’s just frustrating because I feel like she demands 100% of my time without any regard for me and my life, but I don’t have the heart to tell her no because ahe’s a good girlfriend. AITA for wanting to shorten the FT calls to maybe 20-30 mins?

Anyway, to get to the point.

My girlfriend studies graphic design and due to an ongoing short course at their college, the students from another class has to join theirs. A guy [M19] came into the class and now sits next to her.

Recently he asked her if she had a crush on anyone in the class. She told him that she has a boyfriend and he backtracked. He then told her that he likes this one girl in class, since then she has been trying to match make them. 

When she was struggling to come up with a concept drawing of herself, he drew a detailed drawing of her in her book, she was impressed and thought of it as sweet. He then left the class for a few moments and came back with an even better sticky note drawing of her and she has kept in her book ever since. 

They follow each other in Instagram, Spotify and I'm sure she has his number too. The problem isn't that she potentially made a new friend, the problem is that I know some guys can act like this to get with a girl and I don't know if I'm being reasonable or not in my suspicions.

It has been consistent ever since we started talking.

However my friends have spotted him twice on hookup apps and I had talks with him instead of yelling at him because I want to preserve this relationship. That my friends have spotted him on hookup apps more than once really f*cks me up. It makes me feel like he's starting to no longer find me attractive or that I'm not enough or I don't fulfil his desires anymore. The first time this happened, I checked his entire phone with his permission and our condom stash and found one missing (we counted them last time we had sex). Inside, paranoia, fear and jealousy really tore me the f*ck up, but I knew he was acting on impulse but he still truly loves me because of what he does for me and with me and especially in the presence of his close ones.

The second time was only days ago. I didn't cry when we called, but when the shock faded after it I bawled my heart out instead of sleeping. He only traded pictures but my friends showed me screenshots saying that he was willing to actually do stuff in person. I reacted a lot less harshly but I made it clear that I would vanish from his life if it happened a third time. Ever since, doubt has been eating me up like crazy. Any time he tells me he loves me or plays music for me, I feel like he is doing it to try and wash himself as an apology instead of sincerity. We're going to see eachother again this Thursday because he lives in another city. At this point I don't feel like checking our condom box because I just automatically assume at least one or two are missing. Doubt and paranoia have been tearing me up for weeks now. I cried a lot lately. It hurts me even more because I used to be the same kind of person as him in the past and I know what it feels like and why he did it.

In normal circumstances I would have already vanished. I know two months doesn't seem like a long time. Everything that I have just listed are legitimate grounds for a breakup. I know deep down he truly and sincerely loves me and he knows he has hurt both me and himself by what did. He just doesn't know how to be serious but he has every intention of making it clear to me, his friends and his family that I mean a tremendous deal to him. Being more experienced in relationships than him, I know he doesn't know how to act, but with the right guidance and support he will. I worry that, by committing ourselves to this relationship, I'm kind of trapping him and his desires because he's unfamiliar with commitment.

But I just got on the dating apps, and I've noticed an interesting trend of men being super sexual over text, and then getting offended when I don't reciprocate. I just have a couple questions: (1) Why are these men surprised that women don't like objectifying texts?? Keep in mind, I'm talking about conversations had right after matching on an app. Are there really that many women out there giving enough positive reinforcement to objectifying texts that it's SURPRISING when some women wouldn't want that? (2) I know this is a society thing but it honestly makes me so mad I want to cry: WHY DO MEN THINK THEY CAN SHAME WOMEN FOR NOT WANTING TO HOOK UP/SAVE SEX FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL? Like seriously, that's MY preference, and if that's not YOUR preference, MOVE ON! My personal experience is im recovering from an eating disorder, spent years and years of my life completely disrespecting my body, and having sex with randos was just another way I disrespected myself. So I made the decision to only have sex with people I care about, and it has seriously helped improve my self respect/recovery. It just makes me so mad that some men can't even begin to understand that and all they can see/hear is a blaring alarm in their head screaming ""SHE DOESNT WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH ME"".

I met a girl a few months ago on Hinge that I was very keen on meeting in person and getting to know. Unfortunately due to issues with my work schedule, her work schedule, then a COVID lockdown, that is still ongoing 10 weeks later, I was never able to actually meet with her. 

The conversations certainly weren’t dull; there was usually only about 1 message a day but they were substantial. There was around 5 or 6 different subjects and topics in the same message so it seemed to me that she was enjoying the conversation to a degree at the time. 

We had been chatting for upwards of a month and a half at least by this point. I’m not one to enjoy lengthy text chats endlessly without meeting the person, so I asked if she wanted to have a walk (which was allowed under the guise of “exercise” under our lockdown restrictions). She said that she would love to and checked how far we were from each other, but unfortunately we have a limited radius that we can travel at the moment and ours didn’t overlap anywhere. I said that I didn’t mind going an extra few kilometres outside of my radius (it was a very small gap), but she said that she wasn’t comfortable breaching the health restrictions and responded with ‘perhaps when things ease a bit’. I said that this was absolutely fair and didn’t push it any further. 

After this chat, though, she didn’t respond to any of the parts of my last message. I completely understand why she wouldn’t (I can sympathise: it’s tiring for me to maintain conversations endlessly with hinge/tinder matches that I have no idea when we will be able to meet), so I am not cut or upset about that. Normally I wouldn’t get hung up on dating app matches like this, but of all the ones I’ve had, she was someone who wanted to meet and get to know and see if there was any connection the most. 

My question is: now that there is a light at the end of the tunnel with our lockdown, would it be weird for me to re-initiate the text conversation with something simple and asking how she’s been? I’ve deleted hinge etc recently out of dating app fatigue, and I’ve toyed with the idea of finding her on there again (if she even still is) and rematching, but this idea seems very childish to me. 

I’d just like some external input to know if right now my desire to have an actual date with her is clouding my brain and I just need to straight up let it go. I don’t want to be a creepy or needy person.

She has always told me that you cannot trust some girls' intentions even if they know you are in a relationship

Anyway, to get to the point.

My girlfriend studies graphic design and due to an ongoing short course at their college, the students from another class has to join theirs. A guy [M19] came into the class and now sits next to her. The lecturer does not know she is in a relationship so asked her if that guy has a potential chance with her, to which she just nonchalantly replied ""Nah I don't know"". They talk about surface level things and she has constantly told me about what he has said. In a way, I'm glad for her because she doesn't have much friends and this is only a 1 year course. 

Recently he asked her if she had a crush on anyone in the class. She told him that she has a boyfriend and he backtracked. He then told her that he likes this one girl in class, since then she has been trying to match make them. 

When she was struggling to come up with a concept drawing of herself, he drew a detailed drawing of her in her book, she was impressed and thought of it as sweet. He then left the class for a few moments and came back with an even better sticky note drawing of her and she has kept in her book ever since. 

They follow each other in Instagram, Spotify and I'm sure she has his number too. The problem isn't that she potentially made a new friend, the problem is that I know some guys can act like this to get with a girl and I don't know if I'm being reasonable or not in my suspicions.

So when i started texting to her, at the same time this guy was doing the same thing to her. Before we were started dating she did explain this whole situation with this guy, she was very honest. She told me, they are texting almost every day, but she is very passive, bc that's how she is wanna showing to him that she doesn't want anything from him. But this guy is pretty persistent. He is just keep texting to her.   
A week ago she told me, that this guy is still texting to her. I told her, if she wants to be with me, why don't just focusing to me, and block this guy from messenger, the answer was: "" I don't want to seem like a jerk."" I was like okay ... She was saying if i wanna read the messages between them she will let me, bc they are not talking about serious things.  
Few days ago this guy was met with my GF (not a date or something else, he was just waited her at a bus station), while she was going to home from work and brought her a bouquet of flowers (...) and she accepted from him, bc she couldn't handle this situation. She told me this whole thing when we were out to date. U can imagine my feelings ...   
Honestly don't rly know what to feel rn. She is really into me, super honest, because she told me everything about her situation with this guy. She could have chosen that to not to tell me this thing and just simply keep her secret, but she told me.  
We weren't a couple till yesterday, thats why i didn't say to her to ban this guy from messenger. But i think in a normal situation a person doesn't need to say things like that... If u want that person, focus on him/her not to others ...  
I have a feeling that she is keeping this guy as a ""B"" plan or she is just ejnoying this situation where 2 ppl are ""fighting"" for her hands. Or idk... it's so fustrating, we are a couple since one day and we already have this problem. I explained to her that this thing is really annoys me and she would not be happy if i were doing Tinder next to her while we are together ... I really don't wanna leave her, bc we  really like each other, but my patience is already running out bc of this situation.

It's not a long journey we have met a month ago and we were started dating yesterday. Everything is super good with her, she is super clever, pretty, we are having a lots of fun when we are together, almost perfect to each other.  
So when i started texting to her, at the same time this guy was doing the same thing to her. Before we were started dating she did explain this whole situation with this guy, she was very honest. She told me, they are texting almost every day, but she is very passive, bc that's how she is wanna showing to him that she doesn't want anything from him. But this guy is pretty persistent. He is just keep texting to her.   
A week ago she told me, that this guy is still texting to her. I told her, if she wants to be with me, why don't just focusing to me, and block this guy from messenger, the answer was: "" I don't want to seem like a jerk."" I was like okay ... She was saying if i wanna read the messages between them she will let me, bc they are not talking about serious things.  
Few days ago this guy was met with my GF (not a date or something else, he was just waited her at a bus station), while she was going to home from work and brought her a bouquet of flowers (...) and she accepted from him, bc she couldn't handle this situation. She told me this whole thing when we were out to date. U can imagine my feelings ...   
Honestly don't rly know what to feel rn. She is really into me, super honest, because she told me everything about her situation with this guy. She could have chosen that to not to tell me this thing and just simply keep her secret, but she told me.  
We weren't a couple till yesterday, thats why i didn't say to her to ban this guy from messenger. But i think in a normal situation a person doesn't need to say things like that... If u want that person, focus on him/her not to others ...  
I have a feeling that she is keeping this guy as a ""B"" plan or she is just ejnoying this situation where 2 ppl are ""fighting"" for her hands. Or idk... it's so fustrating, we are a couple since one day and we already have this problem. I explained to her that this thing is really annoys me and she would not be happy if i were doing Tinder next to her while we are together ... I really don't wanna leave her, bc we  really like each other, but my patience is already running out bc of this situation.

I want to start trying to have something emotionally and sexually meaningful, but I'm afraid it's too late to start with zero history.

Why was I never interested in the past? I don't have a specific reason but it was just general low confidence + introversion. I also was always pretty busy with college, grad school, finding a job etc, and didn't feel like I had the energy to give up my ""recharge days"" to potentially emotionally draining difficult social situations. I started my first post-grad school job last year and its been the first time I've felt that I'm in a stable enough situation to deal with trying to get something more out of life...  I think I have become a fair bit less introverted and I want to take that risk now. In the past I was happy enough to get meet my fairly low social quota from just hanging out with my guy friends, and if I needed something physical, I could just jerk off or use a toy and get it out of my system. It also didn't help that I was obese until 28/29. I'm borderline normal weight now; still a little chubby but so are most people, and I'm still working on it. I hate gyms but I take a lot of long walks/short jogs and I love to go hiking, so I do exersize in some form. I also eat fairly healthy (now) and am a pretty good cook. I'm a fairly geeky dude with geeky interests and work in a STEM field, and I get along well with other nerds/geeks of all genders. Besides the weight, I'm okay looking, a bit over 6 feet, hairline at 30 not as good as at 20 but not awful... I'm not that interested in a meaningless hookup (not opposed, though...) but what I really want is something a bit more of a bonding experience, I want to truly understand, support, and accept a woman, and relieve the same in return. I never felt like I needed that in my life, I felt like those things were ""nice to haves"" instead of psychological human needs, but I think all that loneliness I shoved in the back of my mind is starting to overflow out of its container. 

I'm really hoping to meet someone more naturally rather than via a dating-aimed thing like an app or meetup. But I don't really know how to do that. There are a few single women at work around my age who I would be happy if they were interested in me, but I don't think they are, and I don't want to risk screwing up a valuable working relationship with an unwelcome advance. I started my job about 9 months ago and moved about 5 hours away... I lived in one region for my whole life until age 29, so I don't know anybody here apart from work. COVID hasn't made meeting people outside of work easy and I wasn't good at that in the first place. A lot of people at my workplace are in a similar situation, so we occasionally do simple meetups (like a rotation subsection of the ~50 of us, with a fairly even gender mix, will go to a bar or get dinner on a weekend or something, usually about 8-10 people at a time, maybe one or two times per month) and I'd love if something came out of that, but maybe that's just a fantasy. How do early-30s people who aren't beautiful meet singles? Do I just... go to a bar and ask women out? Ask out women I see walking around my neighborhood? That seems like something a creep would do.

Of course I also have no sexual experience but honestly I think the no RELATIONSHIP experience is probably a bigger red flag. Not really sure how to end this post, so I'll just stop typing.

I haven't had time to do laundry in a month and never have cooked food in the house. I would really like the weekend to myself to get my housework done, work-work done, AND school-work done. He offered Monday instead, which I technically could do, but I'll be working till probably 7 so it will be late, and I have to get myself organized and plan out transportation for going to the office for the first time the next morning. 

Would it be bad (i.e lose my chances) if I just reschedule this date? I do REALLY like him and think we are a great match so I don't want to screw that up.

I tried saying ""can we do next weekend instead"" and he said his next weekend is too packed. I guess I feel like if he can say that, I should be able to say my this weekend is too packed? But also if I cancel we can't reschedule right away.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1015372,public,self,Is it bad to reschedule a date you put on the calendar 2 weeks+ ago?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pr8bi5/is_it_bad_to_reschedule_a_date_you_put_on_the/,all_ads,6,,,,,

She’s gorgeous, hilarious, adventurous, and my kind of weird. I remember the day I asked her out years ago and unfortunately wasn’t interested, but still remained very close. We didn’t see each other often for the next few years due to going away for college however the pandemic brought us a bit closer when we needed some company during lockdown. Let me tell you, these last 2 years have been amazing. I was completely aware we were just friends and I wanted to respect her feelings. That being said we still were able to look past that and share some beautiful memories. We spent a lot of time doing long road trips, traveling together, learning to cook, and so many other fun activities. This past month things have felt different and I realized that I had some strong feelings I couldn’t hold back anymore and honestly it was starting to dig at me. When I look into her eyes I not only see a pretty face but someone whose chemistry is unmatched, shares all my favorite activities, and just really makes me happy. We were slow dancing on the beach last week (with a few drinks) and eventually kissed. I figured it was just the drinks in us and a spur of the moment thing, but figured it was something we should talk about if we were just friends. I also decided it was a good opportunity to be open about my feelings because honesty is the only way we can move forward from that. This week has made me very anxious because I was worried my feelings might ruin this beautiful friendship we have. Well, we had the conversation a few nights ago and I learned that she also had feelings for me over the past year. Neither of us wanted to act on it or even talk about it due to fear of making things awkward, but damnnn it felt nice to hear that feelings were reciprocated. We decided that we will give dating a try and I’ve been so giddy since. She came over after the conversation and we just cuddled all night. I still feel those dang butterflies. Tonight we are going on our first formal date and I am so thrilled. I know it’s early to say this, but I really do see a future with this girl. We’ve been spending so much time with each other over the past few years and share such a deep connection. She really makes me feel so special and I’m still expecting to wake up from this dream.

He asked me out, and I got to know him for a few hours over a drink at my work before giving it to him. 

Over the next few days we hit it off, talking for hours on the phone a few days. Well there is a few day stretch I don't hear from him and I figure maybe he's just busy.. I still show up for our planned date and he doesn't. I sent a text that was firm but understanding basically saying communication would be appreciated, but wishing him well (his mom is currently going thru cancer). 

He sent a long text sincerely apologizing, explaining how it was a rough few days with his family and mom, that he enjoyed getting to know me,  and he never blows people off and feels terrible. I  was understanding and empathetic, but maintained my stance that communication would have been appreciated at it takes 5 seconds to send a text that you won't make a date so my time wasn't wasted. 

Fast forward a few weeks, I reach out to see how he's doing. We talk about the possibility of getting together &amp; says he's busy but is open the following weekend and ""owes me one."" I text him a few days before the weekend he's supposedly free, and once again don't hear back at all. I gave it a few days. 

Last night I sent a final just saying that I didn't really understand him, that I totally get where he's at in life and wasn't trying to push anything but just to be honest with people if you aren't going to follow through. I get a phone call at 3 am then, but I didn't answer. He then texts explaining about how he's been a wreck with his mom &amp; he's depressed. He still really likes me, never met anyone like me and he's just really guarded. I was pissed he called me in the middle of the night and woke me up out of a dead sleep, and I called him out if he was drunk-he denied. We went back and forth and he just kept apologizing but all I kept saying is to communicate, and be consistent. That's all I ask for...cause I get he's in a rough place. He admitted maybe he's not mature and fit enough for me,"" and ended it with ""if you want to talk let me know."" 

I don't know if I'm being unreasonable here expecting communication? Should I give the benefit on the doubt? He has a lot on his plate, but it takes a few moments to send a text. I also see him posting on social media- like a golf trip one weekend so it's like you have time for that and can't send a text.

im 18 and very Shy and have big problems talking to new pp.

2 Weeks ago one of my Friends sent me a Girls Instagram Profile he met at a Party and he wanted me to slide in her Dms.

I never did this in my Life and also i am not a Party guy.

But i still desided to go out of my comfort zone and write her and so i did.

And it went well we talked for some days a bit and she also gave me her number.

This is were it begins.

I am a terrible writer and cant keep up long conversations or even start one. I send her Memes and orher Videos and so and she seems to like it at all but i never get into conversations that last longer than 30mins. She also writes me Bbtw so it isnt completly one sided.   
And we also met yesterday at a Party (it was planed) and at first i was extremly scared and couldnt talk to her but after some time and drinks we started to talk but i was still extremly shy and couldnt be myself? I talked to but i never talked to her like i talk to my friends because ye im shy.   
She also asked me question like can you Look after me (she was a bit drunk) and if i can be her safe spot.

Over all it was a good Night and Party but it couldve been better cuz i still didnt was 100% myself.

For one i dont want to be this shy anymore. I always think ahead when i write her and never do it spontaneously yk. I always need a plan like i wirte Hey, then i ask this question, if she answers this i write this. Thats what i think if i try to write her. I think i do this because im scared that the conversation end what if does but im scared of it thats why i plan it ye cuz im scared and i think i can control it with making a plan but i cant.  
Also im scared that if i cant get into conversation she will lose interest in me and i rly like her shes Cute, very Nice and Funny but im extremly scared that i fuck it up somehow with me being to shy.   


She also didnt wrote me in days (i wrote her) but i think its because i wrote her so she didnt had to.

We basically started flirting (alcohol helped me massively on this, ngl) and the next thing i know she is on my lap, thrusting and grinding. We make out, but i must have been drunk too cause i think i had the whiskey dick. I feel she had a good time beause at one point her breath got really heavy and her legs started shaking.

I've been on 5+ dates with this girl, we slept together and we keep in touch daily (texting and stuff).

Things are really looking well, we just have a really good time and all. I already met her parents and she met mine (both when driving each other home from dates, no real formal introduction).

Lately, we've said that we both want to pursue a relationship but still need to get to know each other a bit better, so we want to meet up more frequently. It's like a 2 hour drive to her dads place (where she is occasionally), so some of the dates costs me and her a lot of driving time.

At the same time, we both do not want to rush into stuff, so taking it slow as well (the hell does taking it slow but wanting to see each other more means?).

Though, I do not want to invest a buttload of time (which seeing each other more often would mean) in a relationship, while she might still have flings on the side now. And I have a feeling she might have those.  
Yesterday, she randomly started telling me about a colleague she thinks is a funny dude with real cool body features and that she and him want to go running together sometime (both are avid runners).   
I also occasionally catch her texting during some of our dates.   
She's pretty young (23), really attractive for most dudes (I've heard multiple groups of dudes talk about it without them knowing I'm dating her) and she did not have that much time in her life yet to 'screw around a bit' (to call it that way), as she pretty recently got out of a long relationship with her high school sweetheart.

I find that for many men TODAY are getting much fewer options than decades past. Many are lonely and are desperate. Many are reaching their 30s, where they dream of becoming a father and building a family , but instead living unattached , sexless lives where their only real interaction is behind a screen.

Whereas For majority women, they are getting more options than ever before. If they don't like someone out of boredom, or there are problems within the relationship, or they see a new shiny person there is no incentive to remain in a relationship. They do, however, have to deal with many unsolicited attention and many bad crops to get the ones they want. Their standards are obscenely unrealistic. Many love the idea of the marriage but don't actually want the marriage, or the man for that matter. Many want everything ( her career, the best man, the family , the whole 9 yards), otherwise she is settling.

I spent a little under 3 months talking to this girl I liked. She was blonde, blue eyes, slight chubby, freckles, and was the emo type. We would stay up till 2am talking about our favorites shows, movies, what we wanted to do with our lives, our families, we also began to start using faces like :3 and other emojis. It got to the point where she wouldn’t go a day without talking and one day she decided to finally set up an actual date. So when the date happens she also brings up the fact that one of my friends is also coming and i thought it would be like a third wheel type of thing so I didn’t want to make him uncomfortable.
 
 I ended up being the third wheel.

The whole time they were just talking on and on and we’re connecting extremely well, and they had just met that same day. They would laugh and tease each other, he gave her a piggy back ride and I was just off to the side very silent. After weeks of priming the situation to be right she ends up just being all fun and happy with him &amp; with me she would talk serious and posture up and look at me with an expressionless face. Like she was not attracted to me AT ALL.

 I’ll make it short &amp; say they had a friend with benefits situation after that trip &amp; she never spoke to me again. The story is longer but this is the gist.

I live close to the biggest middle school in the state. Good neighborhood. My kids will wear masks and know science facts aren’t optional. I have a secure science job. Only this time when the dating relationship ends, I keep the kids. Everyone should have prenups, background checks, credit reports shared, and eloping should be illegal, so the kids stay with the more stable parent at the time of divorce.

Kids are available for adoption in my state, and nationwide at a skyrocketing pace nowadays because adults, more and more are raised badly, then get into addiction, unprotected sex with the first available person, then become parents themselves. Which statistically leads to a few more adoptions every year. As a scientist I’m a huge fan of statistics.

I love and miss my 13yr. daughter 10 to 100 times more than I ever missed her other parent, so I live knowing the love parents have for their kids dwarfs anything spouses share. 

The dating scene in my state is a quagmire of meth addiction, distilleries, micro breweries, weed huts and republican zealots stealing state school money for religious school vouchers, which pops up faster than new house construction. The only real thing that matters is that children have a consistent place to come home, warm healthy meals, a safe quiet bed to wake up rested from and a parent who always does their best. The last nine years have been glorious because I don’t allow drugs or alcohol on my property, especially in peoples bodies. 

I am well aware of the friction adopted kids have with parents vs. biological kids. This however seems 1000 times easier to work on than dating an intentionally misleading adult. There are a lot of right wing religious people I could date locally (and have) and this vaccine hesitancy thing has finally shown me how scary that is. I now possess a much quicker question to figure out somebody’s science and political views.

Met him all the way back in college so I’ve almost known him a decade. What I can put together now is that I fully took it more seriously than he did. The kicker is he chased me for years and I wasn’t into it. Not because I didn’t like him but because he only ever wanted to talk about sexual things and I found it to be very immature. Our last interaction was me sending these huge long paragraphs to him trying to explain how I felt cause the entire year of us talking had been nothing but bullshit from him. But he’s so delusional I think he fully did not realize how in the wrong he had been the entire time. 

I just need confirmation and validation that I wasn’t the psycho one here. Here are some of the things he did while we were talking: 

When I first reached out to him, he completely ignored my texts but posted on ig that day. Turns out he was taking to someone. But a month later when things didn’t work out with her he hits me up saying “sorry didn’t mean to ignore you, I just suck with my phone now”. 

He saved a handful of my nudes to his Snapchat then matched two friends of mine on hinge/tinder within the next two weeks. He added them on ig right away too (granted it could be possible that he didn’t know they were friends of mine). But he went on a full dating app binge right after saving the photos, matching and adding a ton of girls, but had told me I could send more photos any time I wanted. The next time I hear from him, I ignore him. He asks why and I explain that I was upset. He defends himself immediately, gets clearly angry, and doesn’t apologize. Two weeks go by then he sends me a Snapchat and a text right after saying “sorry that was NOT meant for you”. Basically he tried to make it seem like he had sent me something risky meant to be sent to another girl, as a joke. So again no apology from him, but I get mocked instead. And again, when I didn’t answer was when he threw in a half assed apology.  

He had hooked up with a friend of mine in college and was still liking all her posts the entire time we were talking. Even tho her and I had posted stories together recently, clearly showing her and I were close enough to be hanging out. 

He invited me to go to a hockey game and said he’d get back to me in one to two weeks about it. Three weeks had passed and I heard nothing from him. Meanwhile I’m noticing that he’s still active on dating apps and adding a new girl on ig every other day. I confront him about not getting back to me like he said he would. He tells me he had lymes disease and hadn’t played hockey in three weeks. Meanwhile he had posted himself playing hockey two days prior, and when I looked at his hockey schedule he had scored goals in games the week prior as well. It was true that he had lymes, but he had been back to playing at that point. He even sends his doctors note as “proof” which also had him out for two weeks not three. He gets furious with me and then unfollows me on social media. We forget to take one another off Snapchat. And a week later I get a snap from him like nothings wrong.

He invites me again to another game, then of course when it comes down to the day it’s supposed to happen I hear nothing from him. I text him and ask if he still wants me to come and he replies with “You can if you want to,” followed by three other reasons as to why he needed to postpone it, which were full on lies. Let me just add that I was going to take off work early, drive an hour and sit through this hockey game that he was playing in, just to accommodate his schedule because he kept telling me he was too busy and exhausted to hang out with me anywhere else. 

By then I remove him off socials and am done with it. He says nothing for seven weeks then reaches back out to me because his parents aren’t home (yes he’s a 27 year old man who lives at home). Then when I don’t answer, he throws in an apology for cancelling the game again, but with no explanation as to why he did. Basically I tell him we can just be friends but that I’m not interested anymore otherwise. He tells me that he’s too attracted to me to just want to be friends. I kind of leave it at that, but we still would have small interactions over social media here and there which I tried to cut short because I was just so over the bullshit. At the same time tho it was hard not to flirt with him because I was so attracted to him. 

Earlier this week he reached back out and asked why I was so mad at him all the time. I asked if we could meet up so that I could talk to him in person, or over a phone call but he pressed me to explain it over text. Of course I couldn’t get all my thoughts together and I made myself sound like a dumb ass bringing up insignificant stuff, and just made myself look like an idiot. He again pretended to want to make plans with me, and then of course found a way to cancel. The fact he had cancelled yet again made me feel so incredibly insecure and like I wasn’t good enough for him. I don’t get why he would be the one to reach out if he was just going to cancel yet again. I had tried to be done with it so many times and each time he would be the one to come back. And what sucks the most is that I know for a fact he was able to follow through with plans with the girl he was talking to when I had first reached out, so it just consistently made me feel like there was something wrong with me. With me, he only ever wanted to hang out to hook up which was why we would always fight and why he would always cancel. So I sent him these huge long paragraphs explaining things and also trying apologize. He went hours and didn’t read it because he was busy. Then he finally replied with “I can’t answer that right now”. 

So these are just the bigger things. Typing this out it sounds crazy that I even stuck it out so long. But he had a way with words that was believable I guess? I just really liked him and wanted to believe he was the genuine guy I had met in college. 

He’d complain that all I wanted to do was yell at him all the time and now I can’t tell if he kept bailing and acting like a dick to me because he lost interest in me cause all I did was call him out on his shit? I just need someone to tell me I’m not the mean one here cause he kept telling me that I was. He kept saying that I couldn’t let go of shit after he had apologized for it, and that I save all my anger for him.

As we still leave close to each other and we're close in age - it's super likely we'll see each other if we're on the same app. Is there any way to block certain people off apps? 
If I go on at work, which is further away, could I avoid seeing him?
Will the app track my data and match me with people close to my home?

We met through mutual friends. We went to different colleges and would talk every now and then. We hooked up twice but never had sex. After not seeing each other for five years, he reached out to me and we would text for a few months. He would text me good morning every morning and ask me how my day was and even tried to FaceTime me. I wasn’t sure what his intentions were considering we hooked up years ago, but I always liked him a little bit. 

We finally met last year. He was living in a different state at the time and came back to my state to see his friend. I didn’t think it was a date, but we got dinner and drinks and we kissed towards the end. The date was great I would say. He held the door for me and paid. We then went on another date before he left to go back home. We went for a walk outside and danced and opened up. 

He then tells me that he is moving to a state even further away for a job opportunity. I initially thought there is no way this is going to workout and that he would probably meet someone there. He would continue to invite me to see him A LOT. I would reject because I was scared of Covid. He said told me that he understood; that he would treat me well and make me feel comfortable during the pandemic. But I rejected every time because I was very scared of it. I really wanted to see him. We would FaceTime every now and then and he told me that he hasn’t found the one but has liked me for a long time. I told him I felt the same. He then has a family member that passes away and comes back to my state. He invited me to the service and wanted me to meet his friends and family. Again, I said no because I didn’t feel comfortable going to a gathering. I felt awful. He even invited me to thanksgiving with his family. 

We then went out separate ways. He stopped talking to me (don’t blame him) and met a girl. They broke up a couple months ago, and he reached out to me two weeks ago. We have been texting a little and snapping. But the only thing is that he is making it sexual sometimes, sent me a d pic, asked me for a nude. I didn’t.

So I’m a 22 year old girl and I’ve been back in the dating scene for the past few months. For some background The guy I’m currently talking to I really like. He’s 23 and We had an instant connection we both opened up to each other about family, life, trauma, and school very quickly. We have been talking since July but things with him get hot and cold, he is very inconsistent. Some weeks we’ll talk non stop and he’ll show me off to his friends and other weeks I’ll maybe hear from him twice at best. We’re both in college and we live 2 hours away and have busy schedules so I don’t see him often which I’m fine with. He had called me to make plans and told me we would go out to a nice restaurant. In the days leading up to our date he had expressed how he’s been feeling depressed and has been having money issues bc he hasn’t been able to get this job on campus bc of paperwork issues. I gave him words of encouragement and tried to keep his spirt up and he told me that he really appreciated me and couldn’t wait to see me. The night before our date it seemed like he was trying to get me to cancel so I suggested that we go to the nice restaurant another time and we can just go to the beach or something and that seemed to solve that. When we met up he went into more detail about why he’s been down and his money problems. We ended up going to his place and we slept together for the first time. On a previous occasion I had spent the night before and he didn’t pressure me for sex which is part of why I like him so much. We ended up going to this bar to get food and watch the game. Bc I knew he was having money issues I covered the tab it was about $75 for food and drinks (I think that’s reasonable). After our date we’re texting and taking about how we had a good time. But the next 2 days I don’t hear from him. I knew that week he had to go back home so he texted me when his flight landed and tells me he’s going to a party. He’s ask me how I’m doing then leaves me on read. I tried to FaceTime him the next day to check on him bc I know he’s been feeling down but no answer. He’s been active on social media so I know he’s on his phone but I don’t wanna keep calling and texting bc I don’t want to be clingy. It’s been days and I still haven’t heard from him. My friends are saying that I’m being used bc if he was interested he wouldn’t be ignoring me and why would he ask me out if he didn’t have any money. I didn’t mind paying for our date i don’t expect a man to pay for everything. I’m not sure if I should keep pursuing this bc his reoccurring inconsistency tells me he’s not interested in me like that. But the things he says when we’re on good terms makes it seem like he really likes me. But I feel like If I backed away while he’s going through things that wouldn’t be fair to him bc I know he’s dealing with a lot rn and can’t constantly give me all his attention. My friends are saying that I’m making excuses for him. I genuinely like him bc he has great moral quality’s and is one of the few men who are interested in me beyond the aspect of sex.

About 3 years ago,  my ex and I ended a 4.5 year relationship. It was toxic, we didn't really have anything in common, but we both hated being alone more. It was a messy breakup, and honestly a messy couple of years for me. I haven't really dated since, because I got pretty deep into depression and got into a grind of work, eat, sleep, repeat. 

I spent a lot of time alone and worked on myself a bunch. I got back in decent shape, got some healthy hobbies like mountain biking. But ive always been a sort of old soul/introverted type of person. 

About two months ago, I shattered my collarbone out mountain biking. Ended up having to get surgery.  The whole experience has made me want to change careers and start dating again. 

So I've been trying tinder and okcupid to just try talking to girls again, but it seems like no one has any interest of an actual conversation. Its incredibly discouraging. 

Like, what do I try talking to them about? Is it an appearance thing?  I've worked construction for 5 years so Im a little rough around the edges. 
 

Im really just looking for some general advice. Im so far removed from the dating scene its overwhelming.
