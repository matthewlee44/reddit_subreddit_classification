Wikipedia defines a cornerman as a trainer or coach, assisting a fighter during a bout.

I read a nice quote from a woman today that gave me pause; it was so simple, but also very powerful.

“A man in your corner is way different than just a man in your bed.”

As a man, I thought about it from the perspective of switching man with woman, and the same applies.

Compatibility, in and out of the bedroom, is great, but when you add that in your corner/got your back element to it, the couple almost  certainly becomes unstoppable when it comes to achieving the life that they want to create, as their actions and energy are completely aligned.

Regardless of whether or not we “need” someone, it’s nice knowing that someone’s in our corner if ever the time came in which we did.

We met on a dating app, and early on she said she wanted a friend who might lead to a long-term relationship, and that she's had bad luck in relationships in the past due to depression &amp; anxiety, as well as trouble sleeping at night which leads to sleeping a lot during the day.  So, I've been patient and have been giving things time.

Things have seemed fairly friendly, but I've gotten to really like her.  We've always seemed to enjoy each other's company.  We have good conversations, and we've told each other we like each other.  But I feel like she's given mixed signals.  For instance, she recently told me she was falling for me (after I told her I've been falling for her) but she needs time to work through issues with affection. Then, recently we were out shopping and she was holding my hand and later cuddled a bit while watching TV.  When she wanted to go home, I asked if I could kiss her.  She said she isn't ready for that yet.  I texted to say sorry if I was too forward, and she said it's okay, and she has been enjoying my friendship and isn't quite ready to take things to the next level.  After 3 months, it feels like things are going fairly slow.

Since then (several days), it seems she has been more distant/quiet, not texting as much and not replying to texts as soon as she used to.  I really hope I haven't pushed her away.

I forgot my wallet and was so embarrassed. There was a thunderstorm and I was trying to get things situated at home. I never forget my wallet. 

He looked suspicious when I said I forgot my wallet. I offered cash app, he countered with venmo. We settled on PayPal.

I’m a happily married 42 year old woman, so I’m not looking for any dates, but I accidentally stumbled on a way to meet single men in the real world, and it doesn’t do me any good so I’m hoping it will help someone else!
Ok, so prior to COVID, every Friday I met up with my friends at the brewery and we would knit. 
We would get to the brewery, settle in, and throughout night, I, or one of the other women in the group, would make a lap around the place and invite people to come knit with us, something like “Hey we’re knitting over there if you want to learn. Stay for as long or as little as you’d like” 
I had extra needles and yarn from garage sales so people could keep their projects if they wanted to.
And... people came by our table to knit! Some nights we had as many as 20 additional people knit with us. Old, young, couples, singles, all sorts of people would stop by. This wasn’t *designed* to be a dating thing, it was meant to be (and was genuinely!) about us knitting and teaching people how to knit, but we noticed that the one type of group that almost always came by: men, age range of mid 20s-mid 50s. The younger guys, mid 20s, were the most into it, they were so excited! But older guys came by too. 
It was a brewery so we got lots of men knitting because, well, that’s who primarily came to the brewery. 
And they would come by and chat and knit, sometimes they were just curious and wanted to chat. But basically I think what we accidentally did was make it okay and easy and not weird for strangers to talk to eachother. I mean, we were the only weird ones because we were knitting at a brewery, and that’s not all that weird.
We eventually made it more formal - you got a name tag if you came to knit, but you HAD to use a fake name and we would say your fake name really loud like “Norm!” on Cheers. Over the months that we did this, only two men chose the name “boobs”, if you were wondering. 
My single girlfriends met more “good” men during our Stitch N Bitch sessions than they had during months of online dating AND everyone kept their penis in their pants, so, that’s a win there. Plus even if you don’t meet someone you eventually get a scarf out of the deal so that’s not a bad thing.
Should you all start knitting? I don’t know, but I do know people over 40 don’t often get a chance to mingle and somehow we stumbled upon a recipe for getting strangers to talk to eachother.
During the pandemic, I took up paint by number and watercolor and, like knitting, my ambitions were greater than my time so I have way more stuff than time to use it, so now I’m thinking I’ll bring those to the brewery post covid and see if people go for that.

I live in a remote area, so it seems like any relationship I get into will be long distance, at least for a good while. I’m on an app where I’ve met some promising matches, but I feel like even though I’m attractive enough, it’s going to be very difficult to find someone who will want to jump through all my hoops (including only being available for calls when my kids are with their dad a few days a week (but I love texting!), having to drive hours just to meet for the first time, not wanting to have sex immediately). 

So many things about getting into a relationship again make me nervous! All of a sudden my house is too chaotic to ever invite someone over, I look too old, I get nervous on FaceTime and lose my train of thought...I used to be very chipper and happy but after my mom died of cancer a few years ago I am still smiley but have an edge of negativity I fear will also be a turnoff. I see a lot of profiles saying they want a woman who is “confident and happy where she is in life”. Are any of us on a dating app really this?

My other concern that I hope can be addressed is probably due to my time on reddit GW, but I worry that a lot of guys are just looking to be “talked off”. Somehow about half the conversations I’ve had with prospective matches has veered into sexual preferences and I end up feeling like a prude if I say I’m not comfortable talking too extensively about it.

I’m sorry for the long message but I needed to explain well.
Last October I met a man on a virtual karaoke. We used to sang very often together and it was beautiful: he’s so sweet. In December we started to talk in private and in January he told to his kids (teenagers) that I am his “future wife”. He said to me all the sweetest things you could imagine, that I am the love of his life, that I surely have made a spell on him for him being so amazed by me, that he can’t wait to come to see me (we are in lockdown and he’s at 3 hours by train). He even made projects for us lo live together in another area within 18 months. He actually started to search a job in that area! 

I know that he’s quite “famous” in the karaoke app, as he sings very well and he’s also handsome and funny, and kind. I have told to him that I was a bit concerned by all the female fans (especially the same 5-6 that ALWAYS sing with him and to whom he say things like “love you”) and for a bit he stopped being so warm with them. But one day while we were chatting on WhatsApp I felt that the wanted more to go to sing with the “others” than to talk with me. Also, he started to show more public appreciations for the duets he had done with the others than the ones he had did with me. I also felt, reading some e public exchanges, that he was talking with some of them by private messages.

 I told him that I feel bad for this and he reacted saying only that I’m wrong, thaf he only talks with me, that he doesn’t want to argue because he has already lots of problems at the moment (which is true) and so things became a little “cold” between us and we are still in contact even if I officially left the karaoke app because I “no more wanted to see those exchanges he has with others” (in fact I’m checking every day and it’s going worse and worse).🤬🤬

We are supposed to meet as soon as possible as discussed yesterday and this night while checking the comments under his songs in the karaoke app I saw that’s he’s cursing a “fan” (one of the 5-6 that most concerne me) and that they are planning to meet and to go together for a walk at a lake. 😱🤬🤬🤬

I feel very sad and MAD! What I am supposed to do?? Talking of this with him would be him blocking me and definitely break up with me. And not give me any explanation, as this is the line he’s adopting.🤬

I am considering to write a pm to her, informing her that the man she is planning to meet has promised to go to the lake with ME, to LIVE with me, to LOVE me for the rest of his life and has also told to his kids that I AM his future wife.🥺 And that I can prove all of this with screenshots of the conversations.
What do you think about that? Is it a better idea than suffering in silence? Do you think that she would tell him? Even if I do not write the name of the man?

Some background: 39F. Never married, no kids, having a miserable time OLD this go around (been on and off for 5 years, off when I meet someone or need a break, 2 medium-term relationships and several mini ones in that time. Countless first dates)

When I was younger my mom and her friends set me up all the time. From 18-31. Nothing ever turned into a relationship and there were some horror stories, but it was still really nice to be considered and I was grateful for the help. Had one 5-yr relationship in that time where I met him at a friend’s party.

31-33 was in a serious relationship that ended badly and I needed a long break from dating. When I was ready again, two friends did set me up, but neither went past the first date (one guy only wanted sex, and was aggressive about it, and I think my friend felt horrible when I told her). I was still grateful and told my friends so, but they’ve never done it again. I did ask a couple of coworkers once if they knew anyone, but they said they didn’t and I was embarrassed I asked. My 75-year old neighbor tried to set me up with her allergist by asking him directly if he was single and he said that’s inappropriate and that didn’t go anywhere 😂

I live in a big city area, have many good friends and lots of acquaintances of different ages in different careers and social circles, but no one else has ever offered and I don’t know how to ask. Or if I even should.

I feel I do well IRL and thought I'd give OLD another try to see if I can find someone outside of my sphere. 
 
While I feel like I doing everything I should be doing to make myself atteactive to a potential partner- im well travel and educated, great hobbies, social life, stable career, good parent, I take care of myself, and have solid morals and values. I seem to get friend-zoned alot. 

While I live in a major city, I don't get very many matches, ¹probably don't have the look to stand out from the crowd. AAPI males rank pretty low on the scale unless you're The Rock or Jason Mamoa, so my expectations are pretty low and I just need one really good  match anyway. 

Looking for some brutally honest feedback because my female friends can't do it.  I'm pretty self aware, but even that has it limits and looking for feedback I wouldn't get otherwise.

I‘m 43M and feel like I’m pretty objective about my dating value. I’m good looking and take care of myself - the last person I dated asked if I enjoyed looking at my body in the mirror. Other women have made similar comments. I’m six-figures, house, no debt, and do well socially. I’ve never had an issue making friends. I know what creepy is and I’m far from it.

I can’t seem to find many women playing with a similar hand. At least not single ones. Eventually I get lonely and desperate for intimacy so I lower the bar. I easily get someone at this point, usually having made sacrifices in the age or fitness department, and “force” myself to date them for 1 or 2 months, thinking I’ll find the inner beauty if I just give it time. I can’t ever seem to last longer than that as I have trouble maintaining the effort without the physical attraction. So I raise the bar again and the cycle repeats. I hate doing this because in the end someone gets hurt and I feel awful about it. I much prefer being the one who gets broken up with.

There are so many great people out there who are good on the inside. How do I get past this superficial, surface-level need for hotness?

He’s very attentive and thoughtful, consistent with his communication, energy is coming towards me, strong emotional connection is definitely there, great sex and no games after 4 months. I really like him. 

But. He drinks a lot at times. Enough that some of our friends don’t want to be around him after an “episode.” He’s not mean per se,  but gets sloshy and slurs, he’s fallen, and can get aggressive if someone pokes the bear, so to speak. He’s pretty good about it when with me (I’ve heard about it from others usually)but there was a time he drove me before I realized he’d been drinking heavily. Safety is important of course,  so this is a huge red flag. I brought it up and He agreed he shouldn’t have done that. Since then I’ve seen the occasional beer before driving in the car. Probably not over the limit but can hard to say.  

Sooo, how do I talk to him about this without being judgmental or making him feel I’m trying to control him? I don’t want to stop dating him as he’s really great for me in all other ways and it doesn’t happen all the time. I know it not a good sign,  but my heart is telling me to try.

Met her via Bumble and quickly went to phone texting. She’s very much my type when it comes to appearance and her texting game is great. Lots of initiation from her end which tbh is rare amongst women I’ve dated. Her children are grown and barely college graduated but mine are still teens just entering HS. So I have been doing every other week dating with her although I’m about ready to transition to dating when I have my kids (50/50 custody, no baby mama drama). 

But I should have realized when kissing her it just did not feel natural. Like she was very hesitant or maybe didn’t enjoy it? I’ve always been complimented on my kissing so I’m not sure. Anyways we had great dates, lots of good conversations, just kissing was subpar and no foreplay type activities. We had a short conversation about sex on our last date where she mentioned it was important in a relationship. I remarked the same and that I feel strongly about it too. I also mentioned that this was the longest I’d waited to have sex with someone but that I was enjoying our time and didn’t mind. She seemed taken aback by this and made a comment about “what kind of women had I been dating”. I shrugged it off, but it left a weird feeling in my gut. Honestly I usually have sex within the first four dates and also request/require exclusivity for both of us. But with this woman I was fine waiting a little longer.

Well we broke it off today. I sensed she was pulling back based on her not making any time for us to date this weekend and her lack of texting. So I texted her and called it out which she confirmed. Said she wasn’t ready for sex yet and didn’t want to hold me back. Also wasn’t keen on the every other week dating. Not sure what I could have done differently. I was the one making the moves for kissing and we’d hung out at her place several times.

The convo didn't flow easily,  and I was a little bored but hung in there to give it a fair chance and to be polite. It was hot and humid, so I kept playing with my long hair and pulling it off the back of my neck. 

We had very different interests and so I thanked him for the date, I said he was a nice guy but I just wasn't feeling the romantic vibe, but wished him the best of luck. 

He asked me if I was sure? He said that this had happened with another lady he dated,  and he suggested to her that she Google sexual attraction because when ladies play with their hair, it means they are subconsciously sexually attracted to the guy. According to him,  the other lady did that and had some kind of epiphany that OMG she WAS attracted to him but just didn't know it!! Then they dated another two times. 

I'm like laughing hard and said ""so you think I should Google to check if I'm sexually attracted to you???"". I then told him that things had just got quite awkward so I was going to go.  

I thought that was the end of it. Two days later, I'm at work and there's a message from him. I open it to find a dick pic and a message saying ""Not all guys are equal. You should know that right?

We have vacationed together, met each other’s families, and are now living together. We have not said “I love you” to each other. He will say things like “this is how I show my love...” but not actually say it.

He has made comments when giving his friend advice on dating and uses me as reference regarding when women are difficult to read rather than push them move at their pace and take it slow and don’t make them uncomfortable. So as I’ve been waiting for him to tell me he loves me I realize that he may be waiting for me to let my guard down and say it first so that he doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable.

I do love this man. He is everything I hoped to find. I’m thankful that he came into my life available and ready for a relationship. He treats me with the most respect and love that I’ve experienced in my entire life. He is my friend, lover, and protector and I truly want him to know how I feel. I’m just not sure exactly how to say it. 

I, like many others, have a fear of rejection, even though his actions tell me he won’t reject me my head tells me to tread lightly. In the past I have found myself being the one who gives of myself, shares my feelings and then ultimately has the harsh realization that it’s just me and the feelings don’t go both directions. That past relationship stunted my growth for a long time and I have done a lot of work to realize that if something isn’t reciprocated it is best to know but also that everyone feels things differently and that’s ok too. 

Sorry if my thoughts are all over the place. I really just would love to know if anyone has found themselves wanting to say I love you and struggled? If so how did you overcome?

———————-
There are two new dating stereotypes that have cropped up this generation. They are:

1. The man who is fat, balding, underemployed, anti-social, unhygienic, who decorates his apartment with his collection of original, mint-condition, Star Wars action figures (all in fighting poses), who spends his weekends engrossed in Manga comic books and internet porn, and who is then perpetually frustrated that every woman he likes is somehow unable to appreciate all of his amazing qualities. He then comes to the conclusion that — obviously — there’s something horribly wrong with the women in the world.

2. The fashionable, beautiful, 30-something, career woman who wants to settle down, but despite having dates lined up every night of the week, she laments that there are “no good men out there.” The last man she dated was an accountant, played racquetball and spoke French. But she dumped him because he had bad fingernails and didn’t want to go to business school. The man before that won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, but she dumped him because chemistry is such an impractical profession anyway — I mean, really, get a clue!

The man feels entitled to date anyone despite the fact that he brings basically nothing to the table in an intimate/sexual relationship. The woman brings something to the table, but feels entitled to date someone who brings everything to the table in an intimate/sexual relationship. Both are terribly delusional in regards to their dating expectations.

These flavors of delusional expectations come down to perfection — people who expect perfection in others and people who expect others to acknowledge the perfection in themselves. It’s debatable which is more insufferable.
———————

Thoughts? There are many good points in the full article, but this part struck me because there are so many people who seem to focus on the red flags and scream “red flag! Run!” at the first sign of imperfection. And let’s not get hung up on the gendered examples. There are men and women in both categories.

I am surprised at how many women are giving me there real cell phone number for the first conversion (I know I am not a creep stalker) but they do not. 

In the OLD dating world is is a lot different then the collage bar days of the past. You new what the person looked like or you had a freind in common extra and if there were a creep well you told your freind and they yelled at them. 

So I wanted to put a quick note up hear on how to get a temporary phone number so you can keep  yours private until you are ready to give them the real one.

Why should I do this when I can just block them ?

Well there are web sites  out there that will do a reverse phone number search and give up your address. Also if you ever put your phone number on a site for a event or something like that google could find it and well then I have your full name extra. (That is how I found out who my wife was sleeping with) 

Yea it is scary when you think about it but you can protect your self. 

Free version 

google voice this will give  you a digital phone number and be anywhere  you choose and it can get text messages and phone calls there is even an app for  iphone and android.

If you want to pay there are some other services out there 

 [Burner](https://www.burnerapp.com/)  (this app will allow you to delete the number when done

 [Hushed](https://www.hushed.com/)  (also allows you make international calls for long distance dating) 

You can also used  WhatsApp Messenger 

Please if you have any other tricks or apps that you have used please comment them

While I can’t tell a joke to save my life, I do feel comfortable with making comments that are intended to be funny and, I think, generally are received as such.

It has been my experience, though, that many women are not so comfortable. To be sure, men may be just as awkward about it or, worse, like to make off-color or derogatory jokes but as one who only dates women, I am less familiar (in the dating context) in a mens sense of humor. Almost all of my dates express strong interest in a man who has a good sense of humor and I think that I usually meet that criteria, judging by reactions. 

I also really appreciate humor from my date for many reasons : humor is healthy and fun (when appropriate), it helps build rapport (at least if both parties have a compatible sense of humor) and it is a sign - to me - that my date has self confidence, a very attractive and sexy trait. My experience may be atypical but I don’t think that, traditionally, women were encouraged to be funny - some idiocy about not being “ladylike.” I hope that this is changing. Even if a joke falls flat, I appreciate the effort and actually do what I can to encourage more.

I do know that women can have wicked senses of humor, especially in the company of other women. Please share it with your date. I understand that some men react poorly to funny women and women have more to worry about when men take something the wrong way.

We started as hook up buddy which is okay. Meet atleast every other week. We became exclusive and enjoy each other. Very cleared from the beginning that it is casual only and no accidental pregnancy. That was since Jan. this year (2021). Our communication is up and down, crazy and roller coaster. Sometimes we argue like husband and wife then after few mins, we’re okay again. Next days or two, we’re texting crazy like talking about mistakes, whose fault who do what. We’re like Tom and Gerry but within the day we’re back talking as if nothing happens. We update each other whoever is busy. 

He doesn’t want to have a child and it became issues at some point when I asked why/what if etc. He pulled away and if I let him do what he is doing, he came back. There are cancelled meet ups, we fight about it then we’re okay again.

I will admit that I came to the point that I decided to cut him off completely. Sometimes I’m thinking maybe we can drop off the sex part and remain friends. We laughed, we pissed off each other, we annoyed each other but at the end of the day, we’re still okay.

This week is the most chaotic part so far. Something happened. It was a terrible unexpected situation he created. The text confrontation was epic. He came to the point he told me “do not contact me anymore”. “You’re acting like gf or wife, we’re over etc etc etc.
And I also said “I’m totally done and tired of you and I have no plan to be your gf or wife. You’re imagining things”. That fight goes on for a week texting nasty words to each other since Monday. Now is Friday and we ended up texting each other again and kinda patching up things and establishing what to do and what not to do so we can avoid chaos again.

Firstly I've not met anyone in his family. Granted his family circle is small but he lives with them and I've never been invited to his house. He only lives an hour or so away. No invite for dinner for an introduction, or even a drop in. He visits me and we stay in my town. 

Social media I had to ask/nag for him to add me and then there's been no declaration at all that we're in a relationship there. No making it official on FB, no photos. 

I've questioned him and he swears he's not hiding me from anyone but it's really hard to believe. 

This guy has been up in my life almost every weekend and met everyone I know and just doesn't bother to do the same. There are a few other issues too but for the most part he's sweet, just clueless in a lot of ways and I hate that I've become this kind of person that needs to try and drum things into his head when they bother me.

I thought he was the kindest man I had ever met. He would talk to me for hours about anything, especially if I was dealing with any issues and I tried to do the same for him. Well, date one was last week and wasn’t terrific. He was drinking and kind of sarcastically rude but I thought maybe he was nervous. The second date we both drank way too much. I rarely ever drink but tried to do it with him and ended up throwing up. He went to a bar the next night and was texting me drunk and rudely. Then finally, date three was tonight. It was like that last chance because he said we can go out and we don’t have to drink to have fun. I took this as his word and felt it was worth trying again since this man became important to me over four months and never did any of this until we met. It was the biggest disaster ever. I felt like I was with a drunk bachelorette. He was already drinking when I got there and he continued to get plastered. He had friends with him and even they seemed uncomfortable. He was yelling everything and falling down and just being a drunk asshole. They called an Uber and shockingly even though it was 1 am and the bar was closing he left me before my Uber came, which ended up getting canceled and was a total of one hour of me sitting in a parking lot waiting for the next one. I’m so confused. We had planned to go camping next weekend for my birthday with my friends and I just don’t understand who this rude obnoxious drunk guy is when we had (I thought) such a connection for months. I feel like if I just end it, I’m losing what has become a good friend too, but I don’t know how to handle it tomorrow when I’m sure he’ll feel like a jerk and text me.

 Beyond heartbroken again. Ever met someone that you feel is supposed to be part of your life for a long time?
My life feels like there is a hole missing. 
Anyway, it's been 4 months since we've spoken. I just found out, his dad passed away last week. I can't imagine the pain and lots he feels right now and I just want to reach out to say how sorry I am.
