1,osz638,1627432987,I've (F22) known him (M23) for a month. Is it strange to ask him on Vacation?,"I met this guy at the bar, we texted each other for two days, then went on a date. We slept together the same day we went on our date. I don't ever feel comfortable having a first date over my place, especially being a woman who lives alone; but I felt so comfortable with him and we got along so well.

We've been on about four or five dates with each other and every date has been great. We have a lot in common, we're both extremely chill around one another and we trust each other in our apartments (He left me alone at his place and said he trusted me).

Work has been taking a toll on my mental health so I'm privileged to have supporting family members and enough savings to be able to take a small break from work. On this break, I want to go on a vacation with someone (Not super comfortable going to another state alone). My friends are too busy with school or transitioning from school to work. And my family is busy as well. He's the only person I can think of going with that isn't going to be too busy to go. My mom even suggested I go with him. The only thing that's holding me back from asking him is the possibility of making things awkward between us.

Would it be weird to ask him to go on a vacation with me? And if he says yes is it a good idea?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osz638/ive_f22_known_him_m23_for_a_month_is_it_strange/

4,oszip1,1627434238,Is she worth moving forward with? (Adults only please),"I 22(M) have been with my girl 28(F) for about 3 months now. Ive noticed things she has said and done that makes me doubt moving forward with her. She did alot of things in her teens and early 20s and it just makes me wonder if she is worth it.

-her body count is 20+
-she has been tied up during sex
-she has done (pills) only 2 times supposedly
-she has a kid (girl 7yrs)
-her ex boyfriend is an alcoholic and does drugs but still communicates with him
-she still lives with her parents

-she bought a brand new vehicle but was working places like hotels. I'm sure most of her check goes towards her payment and insurance.
-she wants to trade it in and get a newer one. (Like wtf you get paid $10 an hr) 
-we are going on a 4hr trip to visit meow wolf and she wants a really nice hotel. (it has to have an indoor pool and jacuzzi)
- she said she spent about $115 on makeup one time

Her priorities seem to be wrong. She tells me she wants to live in some nice apartments or buy a house one day but shes not really in the position to be talking about that yet. She tells me her friends/family are moving forward and buying houses and stuff and she's still in the same spot. She has told me alot of guys in the past have played with her.  She just wants something ""serious"" but idk about that.

5,oszjj4,1627434328,Serious Question: Why do we date at all?,"Thinking logically about the concept for a short period honestly makes you realize how stupid the concept is. Ok, so you have two parties who both want the same thing - an ok time with someone they're compatible with. Here's the problem - 95% of people are already compatible with each other: the problem is that the majority of people don't want to go out of their way or have the patience to try something new despite the fact a sacrifice is almost guaranteed to be needed for a relationship. Even more so, those same people usually just want to have fun continually and will be bored of a relationship come ten years anyway - if that's the case, why go on a date at all? Just get a new hobby, go help out at the local animal shelter, or go buy a puppy.

6,oszkhn,1627434427,If one needs to go on many dates to meet the right person then I am never finding her.,"I just came from hanging out with a girl who wasn't even a date. We are both just new to this city and are trying to make friends. She was nice and pretty, but we had nothing in common. She is a nurse that is into watching sports, watching reality tv, and who likes all the shows that I do not like. I am a software developer who likes anime, cartoons like Rick and Morty, and comedy shows like House MD, Psych, How I Met Your Mother, etc. I really don't like The Office, and shows like that.  


She was nice, and I felt that she liked our conversation (maybe), since she was smiling and kept eye contact, and seemed comfortable. However, I was most of the time kind of bored (also I am a bit introverted). This non-dating experience just made me realized that even if a girl is nice, and pretty common interests are super important. And that one needs to meet lots of people to find someone with common interests.

She (F18) is going through a rough time right now and, like with all friends, I am trying to be there for her by texting back right away and being very encouraging and supportive. I am really enthusiastic and I compliment her a lot. She's just told me an hour ago that she doesn't like too much attention, and I'm worried that I'm being WAY too overbearing.

I'm really happy where things are going with us but I really want to have two things happen.

1) I want to find a way to fight overtexting or being anxious when she doesn't reply right away
2) I would love to see if she would sometimes text as much as I do. I know she's having a tough time right now, but reciprocation is important when things are normal.

Note: this is a little personal, but I do struggle with autism spectrum disorder and have some difficulties in social situations. I've had a lot of practice with socializing and can hide it pretty well, but my actual feelings are sometimes really difficult for me to not act out on.

17,ot0a48,1627437087,Situations where average guys need to lie or risk losing out.,"I know this advice will offend a lot of people. If you think you are one of those people who ""doesn't do what other people on dating apps do"", then kudos to you. You are in the ""good minority"".  I've had good success (3 dates a week with these rules and 2 relationships - that didn't end sourly) and failures (3 dates in 6 months by being too honest). This post is based on my experiences on dating apps and 50+ dates between 2017 and 2020 Dec and talking to hundreds of people on dating apps / calls.  Just because you don't approve, doesn't mean things aren't hard for average guys out there... And they can't always be honest.   


Note : This advice will ensure that you miss out on the 10-20 percent of women on OLD and applies to OLD only based on my (and my friends') experiences. 

***""Be Yourself"" is bad advice for average dudes. Do not be yourself.***  
Dating is a minefield. When people have options, they will reject you even for the smallest of reasons. He is too available. He is too agreeable. He tries too hard.. He doesn't put any effort at all. He took me to an expensive place.. He took me to an average place... He said this.. He said that... He didn't initiate touch.. He initiated touch that made me uncomfortable.. He is not a good kisser.. He has a small - apartment.. If you are too honest and be yourself, AKA lacking game, you are bound to fail.  OLD is a game without rules, sure, you can play it with honesty if you are in the top 10-20 percent of guys. If you are just average or above average dude, without game, you'll struggle to get 1 good date a month.  Below points / answers are the things that has gotten me multiple dates in the past. If you don't like pretending like you are important, then feel free to ignore this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

***1. How has your experience been on this app?***  
A:  You should always say it's going well. Put it casually like - \*It's going good\*. Do not elaborate. Do not talk about how hard it is for average guys to get dates. Do not talk about getting ghosted. She is there because she thinks you are in the top 20 percent. Any hint that shows that you aren't in it is game over.  Nobody cares about your struggle, they all want the ""awesome guys"" out there. Very few want to settle for the average dude.

&amp;#x200B;

***2. How many matches do you usually have?***  
A: \*A few\*.  Do not elaborate. Never complain. 

&amp;#x200B;

***3.  How many dates you've been to this year (or past couple of months)? :***  
A:  A few.  Do not elaborate. If she asks for a number, make it 2 to 3 dates a month.  If asked about why you aren't in a relationship,  just say ""I didn't find someone interesting"". Never mention that you don't go on many dates..   


***4. Never tell them that you are a virgin. They will think that you are a sad loser and in the bottom 10 percent. Game over.***

&amp;#x200B;

***5. Last time you had sex?***  
A: A couple of weeks ago.. Nothing more than a month. You haven't had sex in 3 years?. That's fine. You need them to believe that you have easy access to sex to get sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

***6. What are you looking for?***  
A: \*Something long-term. Always, something long-term\*. Average guys don't get picked for FWBs or casual dating. Online dating makes hot guys accessible to everyone.. Imagine having the option to get a free Ferrari or a free Corolla. What would most people prefer?. Average guys are like corollas, nobody picks them over a Ferrari / Bentley.. A lot of people won't approve of this.  But I would rather say this lie and go on a few dates that could lead to something (long term or short term) than be honest and not get a hug or a date for a year. It's not a fair game. An average guy can't play it fairly if he wants to get anything out of it.. 

&amp;#x200B;

***7. Questions about your ex, family, job?***  
A: You don't dislike any of them. They are all ""OK"". Your ex tried to set your house on fire?. That's okay - She was lovely. Nobody likes a whiner. Don't complain about anything. You can disagree with her. In fact, you should disagree with her sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

8. If you can find productive things to do, that's awesome. ***Else, act like you are bus***y. One thing that turns women off is an average looking guy who is always available.  Do not respond to texts too frequently. When someone has options, replying too frequently comes off as ""being clingy and too available"".

&amp;#x200B;

9. Don't agree with her always. If you feel like you are agreeing too much, force a disagreement on a minor issue. I've been rejected a few times because I've been too agreeable and that's apparently a turn off too.  If she likes nachos, you can say - \*Nachos are okay, but not great\* if you both liked the last few things you spoke about. 

  
PS : If you are a guy who thinks it's easy to get dates without the things mentioned above, congrats, you are either in the top 20 percent or too lucky.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ot0a48/situations_where_average_guys_need_to_lie_or_risk/

Life throws it's curveballs though and I've given my all to the wrong people, gotten close to this sun I envisioned in my head and got burned.. neglected the love from my family and friends chasing after a partner to attain these goals with, and to be completely real, it's not me anymore.  Growth is. Knowledge is. Wisdom, experience.. all easily attainable with hard work and effort. Solitude is my friend, I've pretty much always been a loner, a extroverted introvert, and thats a good thing. Love is officially taking a side seat, if it happens, it happens, but it is no longer being pushed along as a true goal by me. I have enough people who love and care about me as it is, you don't need many; just a few. My personal goals and successes are my new mistress. I wont put anyone on a pedestal but myself anymore.

- is leaving for their last year of university and says they know first hand how hard long distance is, and that they don’t want anyone to get hurt

I wanted to make sure she wanted this for her and not that she felt the need.  I tried to talk to her about her moving fast after the movie. She said she wasnt doing that then. Then later she texts me and said she was.Then I had an emotional breakdown. Traumatic family life caught up with me (after keeping it locked away for so long) to me I felt safe with her and I let it out. I told her this is the worst part of my life and I'm sorry she saw that. I said I didn't want her to fix me I just wanted her with me.Then she blocks me we talk again. Asks for my snap chat says she not looking for anything then blocks me. Then she flirts and gets close to me all day. She looks scared like she wants to trust me but won't from her past. She says shes to crazy for me but I want that. I don't get it I'm push so hard cause our chemistry is so good we get along so well. I met her at work everyone in the building sees it but her.

I tired to stop caring and I can't the only confort I can get right now I writing letters about her and some for her.
Everyone my age has told me to forget her and f**k anything with a pluse. Everyone older is telling me to move on. But no one was there with us. She got me that night I got her. Then everything went to shit. So quick and we tied to pick up the peices but she won't give it another go.

So the women “wears the pants” in the relationship and takes a leading role. I’m not too sure why but I feel a very strong attraction to what some might call domineering or aggressive women. I hate the opposite personality type so I feel like me and women like that would be a good match and balance each other. I’m kind of worried though that girls like that don’t really exist and if they did they wouldn’t want me. I also worry that not many women want a relationship like that.

40,ot1skm,1627442732,How to proceed with the man I’m dating?,"Hi all,
 
Looking for some advice re: a guy I’m dating. Much appreciated!

So, for context: I (28F) met a man (30M) on a dating app in late April when I back in my hometown, visiting my parents. I was set to fly back to my city in May, spend the month packing, and move back to my hometown for the summer on June 1. I had tentative plans to move to Europe at the end of August and I shared this with him. 

Over text we hit it off and began speaking primarily over the phone within two days. He’d call every night and we’d chat for hours. We didn’t have time to see each other before I left, so we spent the whole month of May getting to know each other via phone calls and FaceTime. It was during this time that we established that we weren’t going to be talking to or seeing other people. He initiated this. 

When I returned in June, I received a message from him a few days before we were supposed to meet. It was long but here’s the most important bit: 

“Knowing that most likely that you are going to be going away in the next few months and knowing that i have a lot on my plate and trying to figure and puzzle things in with my career and all i dont want to put myself in a situation where im left in the unknown and at the end im kicking myself mentally about it. I need to protect myself emotionally and mentally in the long run. In terms of a relationship I don't think i would be totally ready for it, it really does not have to do anything with you, its just my own problems that i want to figure out. I still want to hang out over the summer because you really are someone that i have connected with but at the same time i need to strive and complete myself before putting myself in that type of situation”

I told him I was okay with just meeting and seeing how things go. I mean, I hadn’t even met him yet. It felt like a slight rejection, but whatever, I didn’t know if I wanted him to be my boyfriend anyway. 

That week, we met for the first time and it was… electric. Having already made an emotional connection, I felt so close to him already. The banter was off the charts. He is so attractive too, and has so many qualities that I am looking for in a man. Not only is the spark and attraction there, but he is ambitious, smart, funny, gainfully employed, from a good family, and owns his own car and a $600,000 rental home. He also makes me feel beautiful and wanted. 

Since our first meeting, we see each other consistently once per week. He will block out an entire Friday or Saturday for me and we’ll have an amazing 8-hour date—usually drinks, an activity (beach, walk, etc.), a nice dinner, followed by a really hot make-out session in his car. He pays 95% of the time. The dates are incredible and we connect so well. We haven’t slept together yet, but there has been some occasional oral sex here and there.

While I love spending time with him in person (it seriously gets better and better), I feel so distant from him during the week. We’re both at our parents’ houses temporarily and I live about 1hr 20 mins outside of the city and away from him. We’ll be getting our own apartments in Sept/Oct, about a 10 min drive from each other, so this will change.

He’s also self-employed with an unpredictable weekday work schedule, which makes meeting up during the week even more difficult to plan out. But he’s been calling me much less (maybe once every other day) and doesn’t text me out of the blue as often. 

I can deal with these feelings of insecurity because I know our distance is coming to an end very soon and we should be able to meet up more often and more spontaneously. 

What I’m mainly concerned about is that I’m beginning to fall in love with him and I don’t know if he has more clarity on what he’s looking for. Remember his text message to me about how he’s “not ready for a relationship”? That was OK in the beginning when I didn’t know him IRL, but now it’s been two months of in-person dating and I don’t know if his thinking has changed. I’m also not moving to Europe because my request to work from there was denied, and I told him this in mid-June. I’m not going anywhere. 

It’s also confusing because we are dating each other exclusively—we’re not seeing or texting anyone else and we’ve both deleted the dating apps. So what’s the difference between this and the label of a “relationship”?

He’s also mentioned he’s felt “lost and indecisive” over the past year—mainly to do with his career and wanting to make a change, but I wonder if it has something to do with his ex, too… He broke up with his girlfriend of 3 years in May 2020 as she wanted to get married and have children like yesterday, but he wasn’t ready for that yet—not until his career is completely sorted. He ended things because it wasn’t fair to her to wait and since then he’s been channeling more energy into his own thing. 

All together this boils down to me just not feeling settled in what we have. We’re supposed to have an overnight date this weekend—which I initiated—and while I would love to be intimate with him, I want him to have an open heart about me. I want him to see me as someone who he could have a committed relationship with. 

So…how exactly should I proceed? My goal is an LTR with this man. I know that pushing him will make him run, so I’m planning on just letting him continue to lead the relationship. Our last date was the best yet. He was so touchy-feely with me and he talked about plans for future dates. I know he wants to continue seeing me at this current capacity and level. But I want more. How do I make this happen? 

On the flip side, though, am I just wasting my time with him? I go back-and-forth between wanting to tell him how I feel (and risk scaring him away) vs. waiting it out a more few months until I’ve moved closer to him (assuming we’re still “together” by then). 

TLDR: I’m in a more serious situationship and I want more. Not sure if he does. What do I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ot1skm/how_to_proceed_with_the_man_im_dating/

I have been with her for a little under a year now and we love each other quite deeply (so breaking up is completely out of the question), but it's only been in the last 6-7 months that she has mentioned hearing voices and has made it slip that she 'talks' to them; Originally, she told me she only started hearing them last year and only when she was playing an instrument (we both practice in a conservatory) did she really hear them intensely ""singing"" along with the music; Now however, she tells me that they've been there since around the time she was 16 or so and that she doesn't want to get treated for it, since it doesn't inhibit her.

My question is: What should I do? She really is hostiile to the idea of medication and admittingly I have heard her talk to the voices in the bathroom before and they don't seem hostile. It just seems like she's talking to a friend or something. How can I be most supportive? summary/question

**TL;DR** How can I be supportive to my girlfriend who has all the symptoms for schizophrenia, yet ultimately doesn't want to take any medication for it?

So last weekend I was out in line for a pretty popular nightclub/bar. I was with some friends of mine, but they got tired of waiting and decided to go back to the hotel. I decided to stay in the line and go in by myself. In front of me in the line were two girls who noticed that I was ditched and asked me what happened. They couldn’t believe I was ditched and invited me to come inside the bar with them. During which I got to know them a little bit. Once we finally got inside, they both asked for my Snapchat. All was good and they even bought me my drinks. They even “cheers’d me” for being “new friends”. They said they were going to get pizza after and they’d love for me to join them so I did. I decided to buy them their pizza. At this point I was pretty drunk and they said thank you for the pizza and I just kind of left to go back to the hotel without saying bye. I did text one of them afterwards saying it was nice meeting them and they said nice meeting me too and to enjoy the rest of my time in the city. I haven’t texted any of them since, as I’m scared they were just being nice. I do like one of them and want to get to know them better. I am essentially just hoping they’ll text me first.

We have talked about it, he also doesn't really see our relationship not working out, but I can't help but stress about it to myself. The fact that even when he thinks everything is going great, he still needs that, it's stressing me out. And like I've said, I respect it, I don't fight him on it.

I’ve tried being nice, I’ve tried being mysterious, tried telling women directly I think they’re pretty/cute, and nothing works. Every first date I’ve been on was because of online apps. In person though, never been able to make that flirtatious connection with a woman.

61,ot3jph,1627449918,Does anyone have an answer to this because I am genuinely at a loss here,"I dated this guy last year for 2 months, we were never official or anything but he was a really crappy person and a piece of work. There was a bit of a situation and I got fed up of being used so I kicked him out of my house and told him to sort his head out, but I also said that there were no issues and if he needed someone to talk to I was there but he didn’t want to, whatever. Then a situation arose where we had to communicate and then he responded to that situation by ghosting me, so I then responded by ghosting back and deleting him. I had put up with enough.

Anyway, I get on with it lived my life how I was before no issues, then a month later I find out by a few people he had twisted words and basically had been spreading awful rumours about me, now I was pissed at this because we live in the same area and it’s a small village so everyone practically knows each other. But I took the high road and thought whatever I don’t need to explain myself, the only reason he was doing it was cause he clearly felt guilty about what he did and wanted to make sure I came off as the bad one first…but that’s where he went wrong in the first place because I didn’t tell anyone I just moved on like an adult should. 

He got a new gf pretty much straight away so I was somewhat relieved thinking he’d stop talking about me. It’s been 8 months now and he’s still going on, I was told lastnight by my brother (as they used to be good mates, emphasis on the used) that when they attended a funeral last week for a mutual friend, he had brought it up again, not only that but his girlfriend shamelessly went right up to my brother and said “I heard (said rumour) about your sister”.

My brother responded by saying no it isn’t true, she wouldn’t do that now mind your own business. Now it’s very clear to me that his gf must be somewhat curious to go up to a guy she doesn’t know to ask about me, which creeps me out, I don’t know why it’s even being brought up in the first place because it’s not relevant and we ended 8 months ago. Why is he still talking about it? May seem like an overreaction but it’s stressing me out, he wanted to be a dick, he wanted to leave so why go on like I’m the issue? 

Also I had a guy bang and kick my door at 3am yesterday early morning  and trying to get in shouting my name and it sounded like him but I can’t confirm this until I look at my neighbours cameras. It’s all just freaking me out a little and making me really uncomfortable, I’ve never regretted an ex or dating guys before but he is the exception, he’s still causing me crap and I’ve not seen or spoke to him in 8 months and I’m getting tired of this, I don’t even want to live here anymore. When I spoke to the police about it they asked me if it could have been an ex and at the time I said no as I didn’t think so but now I’m not so sure.

Bare in mind that incident could totally be unrelated but people are saying I should put two and two together and they’re adamant it’s him but I cannot understand why he’d even bother or risk it when he has a gf.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ot3jph/does_anyone_have_an_answer_to_this_because_i_am/

64,ot3z0m,1627451900,Please help with dating advice,"24 M. I moved to a new city about 9 months ago and so far have had zero luck with finding women or getting dates. I had hinge, tinder, and bumble and deleted all them because I could barely even get likes not to mention matches or dates which never happens. (I used to get a good amount of matches back home so idk why it’s a problem now). I have tried multiple meetup groups and that kind of thing, ideally for activities I enjoy but I never really mesh with anyone I meet there. Bars have never worked well for me and I am good at having an intelligent conversation but possibly the worst flirter on the planet lol, and with covid still a thing that option is even more difficult. I have a pretty good group of friends from work but they are all guys and not really many opportunities to find girls with the activities we do such as camping, hiking, golf, etc just to name a few. 

I feel like I am at a good place in my life to have a relationship now that I am out of college and am totally independent with a good paying job, but it just feels like it keeps getting harder and harder to have success. I have never had a serious girlfriend or any thing more than like a “thing”. I have only kissed a couple girls and never had sex. I have a good amount of female friends but never can get a girlfriend which I think has something to do with my inability to flirt and make my intentions clear. 

I really don’t want to have a negative mindset but at this point I feel like I have tried everything I can think of to put myself out there with no luck. I usually try not to think about it and just do things that make me happy and better myself but at the same time constantly seeing or hearing about people my age getting married and/or having kids and combined with my total lack of success in life makes it hard to feel like I never will. 

I guess I mostly just wanted to vent but if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.

When we are physically together, he is attentive and I feel special. We haven’t had slept together but we got pretty close to it already. He tells me all the right things. The problem is when we are not together. He rarely texts me throughout the day…. I would say in total maybe 5-10 times if I lead the conversation. I am used to getting good mornings and good nights everyday from my previous relationship and I’m just not used to this. He would take a few hours to respond and that bothers me a lot. He rarely complements me and makes me wonder if he truly have feeling for him. I kept thinking he might be busy at work but what about when he is off? It makes me think he is just not that in to me. 

I had 3 serious relationships (1yr - 3yrs) but from what I know, he only had two relationships in total and they were less than a year.

Physically I am repulsive, my face is asymmetric, my one leg is slightly longer than the other, my eyes are not the same color, and my height is below average. Yet life and whomever created it gifted me one final woe, autism. It’s the metaphoric “cherry on top”. It acts as a yet another hurdle for my soul and it’s search for love. Very few people with autism will see what romantic love is like. Of course this will not stop me from pursuing my dream of falling in love however, I am aware the odds are not in my favor. I can not get mad at the world or at women. I would never blame someone for not wanting to be in a relationship with an autistic boy. I never blamed any of the women who rejected me. I feel that at best a woman would settle for me because perhaps companionship with me would be slightly better than dying alone. I say I feel like a prisoner because I know there is so much more to me than what meets the eye. I’m a poet, a student, a writer, a lover, a brother, a son, a friend, an employee, a dreamer, an adventure and a human being navigation the shifting waters of life.

All of her friends say that she likes me, but any moves i make that are semi romantic she doesn’t seem enthusiast at all about. I have pretty much figured out that if i really want to get into a serious relationship with her i’m gonnna have to wait till junior or senior year of highschool, but i just don’t know if it is worth all the effort if i may just get rejected before things even get serious. anyways i would love to hear any advice you guys may have, thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ot4fal/sophomore_year_dating_advice/

91,ot6roj,1627466074,"Asking him out, but how?","I'm 36, have had a crush on the same dude for almost two years, and have decided to take the leap and ask him out.

Short background:

* We have 26 mutual friends on Facebook and through them I know he's a kind person.
* We live in a small community, so I will see him often, which will suck if I get rejected
* I have a fear of rejection, which is why I haven't asked him out, yet.
* I lose all sense of reality when he's around. I push the wrong buttons and bump into things. The other day he parked next to my car in the parking lot without getting out of his car (he was looking at his phone). When I saw it was him I got so flustered I forgot how to start the car. My friend sitting next to me just laughed.
* Even my ex-husband (we're good friends) approves of him
* I have worked with his mum. She's a lovely person and can be my MIL any time.

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned I have a fear of rejection. Mostly due to being bullied as a child. I feel my confidence is ok. I am diagnosed with a disorder that makes it profusely difficult to lose weight. I'm not obese, and I don't hate my body, but I hate the activities I cannot do (like running). I am active and love hiking up mountains, so I'm not lazy. I know he is very active and loves to run marathons, so I'm scared my condition will cause him to reject me. 

I also don't get the vibe that he feels the same way, but he could just be shy as a friend said.

All of these things have led to me almost dropping out of high school, I ended up going to special Ed starting in middle school (I’ve since graduated and am 19) and never really had friends IRL, only online. A lot of my friendships online have lasted over 4 years, so I am able to keep and maintain those relationships but I’ve only had a couple long term IRL friends. This means dating has always always been online, it’s just how I’ve always met people because my disabilities have made socializing very difficult.

Since the pandemic, meeting people in person is even more bleak. I have tried dating apps, but the last guy I met up with assaulted me so I have since not felt comfortable on those at all. There isn’t many places I can go to meet people, especially since covid means normal social spots are not open to loitering. Not to mention, I’ve almost been kidnapped once and I don’t feel safe going anywhere by myself anymore. Being a woman makes stuff so much complicated I swear lol.

My disabilities also make it a bit dangerous for me to go out alone. I have been considering a service dog because of this. I have very severe tics and migraines, the tics can trigger a migraine, I can have tic attacks which can trigger panic attacks and my vision and hearing can become impaired. I can pass out, or disassociate and have difficulty getting somewhere quiet to calm down. I could list more but you get the idea.

I can’t currently drive, but I’m working on it cause I would still like to get my license despite my condition making it more difficult. Because of how difficult all this is I decided not to go to college and instead I am pursuing a career in art and starting my own online shop. Right now I make minimum wage  working for myself, but I’m hoping the shop will give me a more livable income once I open it. Traditional careers are simply not an option, despite popular belief I can easily still be discriminated against for my vulgar tics and most people with my condition find that they cannot hold a job due to this and the chronic pain/fatigue.

I’m getting over an emotionally abusive relationship from a month ago and it was online so he was easily able to lie about a lot (like cheating). It’s made me realize I really hate dating online, but I feel like I have no other choice? I would also in general love to have friends irl but again idk how to go about that at all when going out isn’t really an option and places I could go aren’t open to just chilling anymore.

What I want advice on a how should I go about dating or meeting people in general when going out to social spots isn’t really an option? I’ve gone to some events like reptile expos (with family), but never met anyone there that I talked to for long. I could probably really use another disabled person’s perspective though I’m open to others as well, I feel like abled people do not understand my situation and tend to dismiss my inability to do certain things and is a bit frustrating lol. I’m curious if anyone has any advice or if I should just let things be and see if anything happens someday in the future? I’m not desperate for a relationship since I’m still healing from the last, but i would love to get myself back out there in a couple months. I’m young and i have time but I’m itching for some kind of interactions uhg!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ot7amr/how_to_datemeet_people_while_disabled_post/
96,ot7ekm,1627469100,No chemistry after first kiss. Sigh,"Some of you won’t want to read all of this but here’s the deets.

32M haven’t dated in 7-8 years.  Been focusing on myself.  Girl messages me on bumble - we start a good conversation.  Tell her to text me because I’m not on bumble much, she does.   Ask her a question and she doesn’t reply for a week - no worries figure she is busy/forgot to reply.  Message her back.  She says “sorry for ghosting you!  But I’m in a long distance relationship and I’m not the cheating type”.  I reply: all good take care.  Four days later she replies “oooph I shouldn’t have mentioned that relationship it isn’t a thing anymore”. 

Okay yeah I missed the obvious red flags there.  Wish I hadn’t.  We meet up for drinks and then go play pool, great date.  She grabs my hand in car ride home and we hold hands - love how she did this.  

Two days later we have a 2nd date - take her out for sushi.  Good date not as good as the first, too much like an interview... but after she says let me go home and do some dishes go get something to drink and come over.  Show up at her place with wine, she gives me a tour, we sit down and drink and listen to music and cuddle.  Start rubbing her shoulders and neck (she liked it) ... told me to sit on the floor and gave me a massage as well - when she was done she kissed the side of my head.  I sat back up on the couch with her and couldn’t help myself, went for the first kiss.... felt right.  I thought it was great but ... it was getting late and she said it was time for me to go.  Didn’t think much of that.   Two days later I hit her up to see if she wants to go hiking like we had discussed and she says sorry this isn’t going to work for me.  

I say cool, mind telling me what I could have done differently?  She says no you did nothing wrong I think you’re very sweet .... I just felt no chemistry when we kissed ... “I know it’s silly but it’s a thing I get”.

Tell her I really liked her and maybe I’m a little rusty on my kissing ha (me trying to be funny and humble - trust me the kiss was not technically bad)... and say if you have a change of heart and want to see me again you can get ahold of me - if not I understand not trying to be awkward!

So advice: 

how did something go south so fast after a first kiss? That had been going great?



Trust me I did not have bad breathe lol.

My theory is she’s basically either still with her long distance guy or still trying to get over him.  Hence no chemistry with me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ot7ekm/no_chemistry_after_first_kiss_sigh/
97,ot81ff,1627471859,A girl asked me out to coffee how should I know if it’s date,"Hey, so basically I went to a college orientation a while ago and I talked to this girl for a really long time every time we saw each other. Right when we were both leaving she asked me out to coffee whenever college starts up, I really have no expectations either way but then she mentioned it again via text right after we both left. I’ve definitely thought about this a little too much feel free to ask questions I wasn’t really sure what else you need to know.
