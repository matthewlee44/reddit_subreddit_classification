Does anyone know of a good format to ask tough questions? I’m talking to a girl and sometimes we’re both hesitant to be the first person to answer a tough question, afraid our answers will shape the other persons answer. I know one of the dating apps out there has the ability to submit an answer to a question that can only be viewed once the other person answers also. I’m searching for an alternative like this. I’m probably not thinking of an easy solution. Thanks.

4,qbkmgb,1634676590,Ghosted after one date.,"Prior to our first date, we talked for weeks.
Went on one date together, It went very well. We talked the whole time about a wide array of topics both personal and also very random ones we both enjoyed. We had so many similarities and shared interests it was borderline scary to the both of us.
Only thing we did was drink wine and hold hands walking around the whole time, we were being respectful of each other and wanting to take things slow and do things properly rather than jumping into bed together the first time meeting. 

Messaged back and fourth for a few days after and just ghosted me out of the blue with no explanation on Sunday.

They got up and left before us and we smiled at one another and then his mom came to chat one last time to us after her son and husband left. She mentioned that he was a player for a local baseball team. I feel like she said that in front of me on purpose. I searched the team online and saw his picture and name and knew that was the same guy. 

I don’t have any social media accounts but I searched him on Poshmark and know it’s his account from his picture. And he’s pretty active on it. Would it be immensely creepy to message him on there something flirty or would that seem stalkerish. He has a very unique name so he wasn’t hard to find.

7,qbksv6,1634677102,Tips for verifying a date’s age?,"
I am 18 so my age range is 18-21 but many of the guys look significantly older. Some actually state their real age (usually 30s) in their profiles, but most don’t. Then there are guys who use super old pics but usually give themselves away by bragging about being a senior engineer at a top firm or running multiple successful businesses at 20. They get very angry and defensive when called out because oh, age is just a number, they look much younger than their anyway, girls mature faster and some really disgusting pedo stuff.  


And then there are also many underaged boys who claim to be older and some do look older. Still I don’t want want to date a 15 year old. It feels especially gross when they send unsolicited dick pics, plus it is child porn. 


Is it offensive to ask to see someone’s driver’s license (censored is fine) or get their last name so I can google them before meeting up? 


Not everyone has social media, and phone numbers don’t always work though I have found a few old married creeps this way.

9,qbl2z7,1634677882,Dating problems don't break down along gender lines like you think.,"People seem to believe that the problems they're having are unique to them or their gender. All over the internet it's, ""The bar is low for men"" or ""Women don't have to put in any effort."" Why do men cheat, why aren't women loyal anymore. Why don't men want good girls, why do women only want assholes. All the same things in different phrasings.

I'm bi and have dated cis and trans women, men, and nonbinary people, so trust me, these behaviors are fucking universal. People of all genders will ghost, slow fade, cut off relationships out of nowhere, lead you on for sex, take you home to a neckbeard nest, only make time for you once a season, or just try to date when their lives are such a mess the only app they should be on is Betterhelp.

The bar is low for everyone. No, wishing you were the opposite gender, or that you were attracted to your own gender, won't fix shit.

BTW: The fact that women get more DM's doesn't mean as much as you think. As someone who also gets a fair few, most of them ghost, suck at conversation, or are just creepy or uncomfortable. The actual number who make it through to the first-date stage is low, and second-date stage way lower. Women might have an easier time finding hookups, but that means nothing if you want anything more.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbl2z7/dating_problems_dont_break_down_along_gender/
10,qbl370,1634677898,i want to move on too,"I'm writing on this subreddit to get some weight off my shoulders.

It's 2012, I was 16 years old and she was 13 years old. The typical innocent love story. Well, that concept in respect to the demographics could differ from culture to culture but we were pretty innocent at this time. Things grew organically and love materialized. I don't want to make anybody sick to their stomach by my love mumbo-jumbo, it's not the point. I guess it would be enough to say that she became the ideal woman in my eyes, the figure I'd compare other females to, an average girl in the eyes of others and a goddess in mine. She knew everything about me, all my secrets, insecurities, fantasies, ambitions. It wasn't a one-sided love, I'm just describing how I perceive her. I believe she always felt the sane towards me. 

It's 2016 and I had to flee my home country to pursue my education abroad because my home country could poetically resemble a nuclear waste for how inhabitable it is becoming. I figured it would be ideal for both parties to break things up. Amicable decision. I get a girlfriend abroad and she gets a boyfriend back home. I hated it but what can I do? People move on. We break up with our partners after around a year, around the same time. I leave my ex-girlfriend and after a bit, she breaks up with her partner. Unsurprisingly, we were in contact during that period. We obviously used excuses for the departures we caused but I guess it's clear why we did what we did.

We were in contact during 2018. I could always see her when I go back home. I visit home like twice a year - the summer included. Feasible, right? Wrong. We would go back and forth. We stop talking for a while, we miss each other. We go back and we're in on a romantic roller-coaster. Thus, we stop because it's impractical. That things keeps on going for 2019 and 2020. She would try to see other guys since we were never officially together and I would do the same thing (with girls). Nothing of substance really materialized. Maybe I had my prejudices. Maybe I didn't meet another girl that felt like home. When you're stripped away from all the people you love - your family and the friends that care about you unconditionally, the girl you were happy with - the least you could want from the girl you want to happily share a part of your life with to feel that way. It's personal and that's how I feel about it. She went through the same struggle, she confessed. I'm laying peacefully one evening and she calls me and she tells how much she hates me because she's turning every man down because he doesn't live up to me. I'm a degenerate, mind you. It's just that thing that I can't put into words that I was trying to unsuccessfully explain. It's something we have, some toxic chemistry we live by, a dreadful dream we want to desperately refuse.

The course of 2020 and 2021 has been stagnant. It feels like we're seriously moving on. I talked to her a couple of times and we were keeping things a bit formal. I always have her in my thoughts. I want her to be successful in everything she does. I want her to be happy and healthy. I regretfully wish she is happy without a man in her life. I have to move on but I can't help it, I want her to be mine.

This morning, I wake up frightened. I had some difficulties breathing. I dreamed that she was dead. I was at her funeral crying my heart out for her. The sadness I woke up with was unreal. And why her? I didn't think about her for a long time. I googled if that dream could have any meaning. Maybe psychology has an answer. Apparently it means that this dream means that some change in my life is going to happen. I can't say I believe in these things but hey, new things happen everyday so I'll take it. It's true, new things will inevitably happen. I open my Instagram in the class. I was feeling already down. The dream, I have no friends in the class, I'm trying to figure out how to improve my financial struggles. You see, those things will end up being insignificant to what I saw on IG. She had a story published and she rarely puts stories on IG. I gueee a change did end up occurring in life, not my life though. She posted a picture with her new boyfriend. She never posts stories with guys so you know what that's serious. Her family has her on IG. It was so hard to hold my frustration in that moment. I wish I could cry over it but I find it very difficult to cry.

Whatever, I'm currently walking alone in that cold evening. The streets are empty, I have my headphones on and I'm playing A Dónde Vas Amor by Octavio López repeatedly. Over and over. The volume is at maximum. Music does the trick especially during these nocturnal walks. I'm writing this while tearing up. A bit arguably but that's a lot for an individual with a bad habit of oppressing his emotions like myself.

I want to move on. I feel like I don't know what to do now. I want to feel the same way to another girl but it's not something I can feel towards the next girl I meet. It's not like girls are lining up having a crush on me. Making a girl like me is a struggle to begin with. I don't have a low self-esteem, I just feel that I have some characteristics that I like about myself that not everybody can appreciate. My sense of humor can turn a lot of people off. I can be very aggressive in certain situations and a bit psychopathic. I like myself, I wish I can meet a female version of myself. Sometimes I feel like the girl I was talking about is the closest I met of that female version of myself anyway.

I feel better after writing things down. I wonder if somebody is going to read this. If you did, I'd be happy to know if you can relate or you have any inputs.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbl370/i_want_to_move_on_too/

And is it reliable? I personally have never heard of it (until now). But it was an interesting read. The four steps are: health, status, emotion, and logic.

The health one is common sense. Look attractive. Look physically fit. Get a haircut. Upgrade your wardrobe. Cut your nails. Pretty straightforward, right? 

Then there is status and this is the next step. This is the resume phase. This is about asking questions like: are they below me? are they worth my time? do they check all the boxes I'm looking for? 

Then there is emotion. This is about emotional chemistry. And last but not least is logic. Logic has to do with finding a mate who share similar lifestyle choices, life goals, values, and the same worldview. It's about finding out whether or not you could tolerate vs. accept a potential mate's flaws.

So yes. It was a good read. Is this something that everybody could universally agree with?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qblhbr/wondering_if_anyone_else_is_on_the_same_page_with/

36,qbn14u,1634683622,How do you look on recreational drug use? Would you even consider relationship with someone who does it? What would you do if you would find out your partner does drugs recreationally?,"Apparently telling you do rdu is a big turn off for some, how unexpected. If only I could explain it to them but they ghosted me right after I said it.

I think telling it later is best. If person knows me a bit ill tell them if they hate me and leave because it so be it.

&amp;#x200B;

You can ignore text below and just answer my question its just my point of view on drugs.

First off here are drugs I hate: caffeine, sugar, alcohol, nicotine

Drugs I dont do: meth, opioids, some dyi drugs

Drugs I do: LSD, cocaine, ketamine, too big list

Drugs can be bad. I dont tell anyone that they should use it especially psychedelics.

My ex wasnt happy or angry about it she tolerated it.

I would love to be with someone who does rdu too. Sex on them or deep talks will bond you even more.

Would I be with someone who abuses them or is addicted? Yes. Would I be with them after they would refuse to get any help? No.

Drugs saved my life and I met lot of nice people because of them.

Drugs almost killed me few times, ultra dosage or mixing with alcohol.

I care about my health now, at least I do my best. Most people dont know that drugs can be useful, better than some prescribed pills (no hate on pharma but they sell poisons sometimes) or alcohol, ect.

Some of us (rds) feel sober when we take them because we have fucked up brains and this is only way to have fun, the fucked up brain isnt caused by drugs, sometimes life wasnt easy and sometimes you are born with it. I wouldnt take a drug second time if it didnt had any positive result on me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbn14u/how_do_you_look_on_recreational_drug_use_would/

Men treat me well and I get approached but that’s where it ends. Not that I’d date anyone from my workplace but there’s some cute single men there. Sometimes we talk and they’re really nice. Even thought it’s not appropriate to date people you work with, I’m not someone they flirt with. I’m the one they talk to and smile at. 

I’m really shy so maybe that adds to it but I don’t know what to change. I’m 27, I would like to meet someone and start thinking about a future. I can’t do this if nothing lasts.

The last guy I dated used to joke about not liking skinny women. He used to say he prefers short and curly hair (yes you’ve guessed it my hair is long and straight). I stopped seeing him after a while but he came back asking for a second chance. 

He apologised and explained how literally all his friends found me beautiful so he realised maybe there’s something he couldn’t see. Things ended shortly after and it took me a few years to get over it all. Probably still haunts me at the back of my head.

(Demisexual???)","I’m a 20 y/o female who has been actively talking to guys and trying to find the right person. I am not a virgin and have had sex with about 5 people in my life, so I’m not completely inexperienced with physical intimacy. However, i always end up cutting things off with these men I’ve been talking to recently because im shy and uncomfortable with kissing and sex with a new person.

I always make it clear from the beginning that I’m really shy about that type of stuff and that i want to get to know someone before i make that step. I’m even uncomfortable with kissing because my last boyfriend was not able to make out with me (he had a pretty severe underbite and making out just wouldn’t work). I find this has really made dating difficult because in my experience, almost every guy wants to kiss by atleast the second date and i just can’t guarantee that I’ll be comfortable enough for that yet. I think my shyness comes from the fact that my last boyfriend wouldn’t make out with me so i lost all of my kissing skills. AND my last two boyfriends cheated on me which has resulted in some self esteem issues regarding my body/appearance.

It seems like all people want from me is nudes and sex and i just am too afraid to do that. I have sent nudes in the past, but once i send those nudes then the chances of me meeting that person go to pretty much 0% because now I’m worried i won’t live up to my pictures/videos.

So far i have only dated cis straight men even though i am pansexual. I’ve been considering opening up to trying things with another gender but i don’t really know if that’ll make things any easier because i have NO experience pleasing someone with female sex organs.

52,qbolbc,1634688769,Did I (31F) ruin those situation or was he (33M) not into me?,"I (31F) decided to get on online dating out of curiosity. Within a few days I met a man (33M) and was started chatting consistently. After about a week he gave me his number (I wasn’t comfortable giving mine out quite yet) from there we started talking on the phone and hit it off sometimes talking upwards to 5 hours (once even 7 - all night- yes, we both had jobs) 

I figured the consistent talking was a good indicator of chemistry. He made it very clear he was looking for a relationship and we both expressed a connection we felt, even making plans for me to join him on a getaway he had planned for himself. Throughout all our talks we constantly made plans to which I would end up canceling because of my anxiety. He was very patient with me. After rescheduling about 4 dates, we finally met him. 

Our date was ok but I was very shy, quiet and nervous. He invited me back to his place for an “after hike” snack we’re we watched a movie. He insinuated a 2nd date. I stayed over that night and he went to work (no sex) and I went home when the sun came up. 

Over the next few days his texting had dropped off (this was happening about a week before our date too but I figured it was due to his impatience with me canceling on meeting him) I had told him previously that I had a problem with it and how it made me feel. 

We ended up on the phone were I was at my wits end with the contact. He proudly and insensitively admitted to being “consistently inconsistent”. And that I was being unreasonable, he’s busy (when he had all the time in the world before) and that we had a date planned for that Friday and it’s ok that we’re not in consistent contact. His general attitude was “this is how it’s going to be, take it or leave it”. After listing off reasons why I felt he wasn’t interested he said “yes, this looks like I’m uncommitted”. I was confused because on one hand I felt I was being too demanding and the loss of interest was in my head and on the other, it felt like he was giving me a bunch of excuses. Regrettably I ended up screaming at him and hanging up. 

I few days later, he texted me saying he had reflected and realized he wasn’t ready to date and that I deserve someone who is 100% committed. I know this is bs because it the complete opposite of what he had communicated to me before - that he is looking for a long term relationship and companion and building roots for that.

55,qbot60,1634689571,"In an effort to be as unbiased as possible and learn from my mistakes, I am asking y'all for a perspective on a' situationship' I just went through","Sorry for the long post-

&amp;#x200B;

In an effort to be as unbiased as possible and learn from my mistakes, I am asking y'all for a perspective on a' situationship' I just went through over the past few weeks with a girl.

I've been mostly single for all of my adult life so far. I was never really outgoing and extroverted growing up. So I've always just been a little awkward with girls. But recently I've been really working on myself and trying to get out of my 'shell'. I've been exercising, working on my hygiene, my clothing, my over all appearance as well as my personality and social skills.

Well, apparently working on myself really worked. I have been getting hit up by girls left and right... flirting with me and telling me they're interested in me. It's been a nice change of pace!

So anyways, a few weeks ago I was at a pool party with some friends. There were a bunch of girls there who I had not met yet at the time. Initially I was super nervous and didn't approach any of them. Overall I was pretty receded during that party. 

But one girl in particular, we'll call her Allie, kept engaging with me. The first time Allie came up to me, she asked me to get in the pool with her and another girl. They were a little drunk and the pool was cold so I refused. Later on Allie was sitting near me and talking about how she was single and could never get a guy, and she had kind of jokingly said that she thought I was hot. I didn't really think much of it at the time, I was just listening and being a quiet introvert. Later that night we sat next to each other and she was being pretty flirty with me, telling me to get closer to her and just being goofy.

A few days later I go to another 'party'/gathering, and Allie was there. I could definitely feel a small tension between us, and we kept exchanging looks and being flirty with one another. It was at this point I really started to get interested in her, but I was being cautious because I wasn't trying to get into dating anybody quite yet. As the night went on she ended up telling one of the guys in our group that she was interested in me. I was pretty hesitant about the whole thing, I even went out of the building we were all in to get some advice from the guy. But I went with it. We ended up holding hands and hugging, and at the end of the night she kissed me.

The very next day I ask her out on a date, she accepts and we go. We're both super shy and awkward, but we have a good time talking about our lives. I ask if she wanted to spend the night with me, and she said she had work in the morning, which I didn't really question much.

A day or so later I try setting up another date with her. She accepted. On the day of the date she said she wasn't really feeling like going out in public but that she still wanted to see me. So she invites me over to a mutual friend's house and we hang out. We kissed and she was cuddling with me, and that night we slept in the same bed. I tried to initiate something more sexual, but she said not yet. That whole experience, of cuddling and kissing, really make me develop feelings for her. That morning we woke up, and she had plans of going out and doing stuff with her friends. So I said goodbye and left, not leaving without kissing her of course!

The next day I felt a feeling I had never really felt before. I was IMMENSELY stressed. Like literally every  second of the day I was just extremely stressed out about not being with this person, Allie. I didn't want to be clingy or anything so I tried to distract myself, but I couldn't help it. I was getting super nervous about whether or not she felt the same way so I messaged her about whether or not she thought we were compatible. She told me we are different but that doesn't mean we aren't compatible. 

The following week we talk back and forth a little through text.  I had been really worried about whether or not she was interested in me. I felt like she wasn't showing the same enthusiasm as she did when we met the first couple of times, but I was anticipating seeing her again at a group meet up that weekend. 

So that weekend I decided to gauge how interested she REALLY was, so I decided to not acknowledge her when I saw her that day. She barely even looked at me, let alone greet me. But it was pretty early in the morning so I didn't consider it too much. As the day goes on we don't really talk much, until I got drunk and started engaging her. I tried to flirt with her but she didn't really flirt back. I began to get really upset because I kind of developed some feelings for her and felt like she didn't feel the same way. We ended up talking about it and I told her how I felt, and she told me she really wanted to take things slow with me, and only ever wanted to be with someone who she saw as a good friend first.

At that point I was really confused and felt a little embarrassed that I had developed feelings for someone who was not on the same page as I was. For the past couple of days the one thing that I haven't been able to get over is how I don't see the same enthusiasm from her. 

So I decided to tell her I think we should just be friends and that she really confused me by kissing me/cuddling with me and then telling me she wants to take things slow. 

She went on to say that it was pretty normal for that to happen. Which really pissed me off. Maybe I'm wrong?

I’ve been ghosted or cancelled day-of 3 times recently - I’m getting pretty sick of it and trying to value my own time more. My gut instinct was to say no to rescheduling but rationally it seems like it may be a reasonable excuse. After all, it is just a first date. She’s very apologetic and from what I can tell a very nice girl, so maybe I should give her another chance.

60,qbpa36,1634691271,Someone PLEASE talk me out of texting this guy that I know is not into me!,"He took FOUR days to respond to my last text. I know deep down that if someone takes 4 days to respond to a text (unless they fell into a coma, were kidnapped, or experienced some other life crisis) they are not into you and whatever you had going is dead. In the ground. Decomposed. 

Every day, I go through this internal battle where I tell myself this, but then this little voice creeps into my head saying that maybe if I text him one more time suggesting that we hang out, he’ll respond more promptly and things can get started again. That maybe he’s just not texting again because he thinks I’m mad at him, or because he’s a shy person like he said. That it’s okay that he’s “not looking for anything serious”, as long as he’s attracted to me in some capacity, as long as he likes me even a little bit. That I’m fairly certain that if I asked him to hang out again, he would. But no. He knows that I’m interested. After every date I made sure to follow up and tell him how much fun I’d had. I was the one who planned the last one. He should have no qualms about asking me out again if that is what he wants. And why am I even messing with someone who says they’re not looking for anything serious? That’s literally code for “I’m not into you”. That means that it’s not going to go anywhere. 

I can’t stop thinking about the texting conversations we had. The way that he looked at me. The way that he said he was nervous around me, and made me feel like I was pretty. He was the first guy I liked that even entertained the thought of going out with me, let alone paid for dates, planned things with me, and kissed me. It was the first time in my life where I felt wanted by someone. I just want to feel that again, even if I only get to feel it one more time. 

Please help, or I might abandon what’s left of my dignity and text him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbpa36/someone_please_talk_me_out_of_texting_this_guy/
61,qbpaoz,1634691323,I hate socializing.,"I know I know. Social skills and socializing are apart of the dating scene but I can’t help it. When I try to narrow down where my dating issues are arising from then it only comes down to how much I feel uncomfortable socializing with other people. 

I’ve always done things by self. Never did too many r hints in groups. I have a small group of friends who also are just homebodies and that’s it. The difference between them and me is that I do enjoy going out, I just don’t enjoy socializing because I’m unfortunately bad at it. The only reason I’m bad at it is because it seems honestly fake, or it just seems like the things people talk about just aren’t that interesting but in order to come off as friendly, I have to seem interested in what they are saying. This makes me feel even faker and it sucks. 

I know that I have to get better at socializing in order to expand my circle but I also know that I need to get better if I ever want to date or meet women. I don’t want to be alone forever and I definitely don’t want to have a dead sex life either. So the only way is to somehow find socializing enjoyable and interesting. But how do I do that? How do I find others interesting and how do I find their topics of conversation relatable?

Advice?,"I’m a 35-year-old woman making $100k in a male dominated field. I work out, am kinda obsessed with fashion and design, climb mountains, read a lot, drive fast, and love my friends. I know dating a man who is ambitious or successful probably isn’t an option for me.

My mom was a homemaker who was mentally ill, addicted to prescription tranquilizers and expected my dad to take care of her. My dad spent years running his failing business and taking equity out of my parents home and money from me and my grandfather to pay for it. And then he would call me and complain about how horrible and useless my mom was. The only reason he stopped was my mom refused to extend the line of credit on the house anymore - after 10 years.

As the daughter of a man who was a failure and was willing to bankrupt his family rather than compromise his pride, I don’t ever want to get involved with a man who isn’t successful. When these artist/musician types message me I’m like “no, no, no”. I don’t really want to take  care of another man again. My cousin is an artist in Toronto; he’s 40, single, dead broke all the time and doesn’t really care about improving his station.

I never dated gen I was younger because I felt I shouldn’t be dating until I had a permanent, full-time job that made at least $60 k a year, which happened when I was 29, since I expected any man I dated to be at the same level.

(I want expecting a text back) she text me back almost immediately but I was the other room and I didn’t realize till the next morning. I reply to her “hey how are you” with “sorry I didn’t see this last night yada yada etc” we than message each other back like 2 more times (she’s asking what I have been up to and where I’m living now) after I reply she doesn’t reply for like 3 hours and now hasn’t replied in a day.

When we had our first date, I was pretty confident during the entire conversation and was very happy afterwards because he was really polite and respectful. We have been talking ever since. It would mostly be about our day or him trying to improve his English. The other day he asked to meet up again. We decided to watch Venom. He picked me up but this time around I was a bit nervous because I think I have started to like him a bit more but he was not as talkative as he was last time. On one hand I’m really proud that I could understand the entire movie in Spanish but as we were saying goodbye, I think I leaned in for a kiss but he went for two kisses on the cheeks and because I was already on the path of ruining my date, I went for a hug which unintentionally resulted in my lips kissing his neck. I quickly pulled myself back and because it was already very awkward I was just looking at him and he was like “two kisses no? “ and then we went for the two kisses again. He texted me afterwards that he reached home and how he wishes he could have the same level of English language and I wrote “Yes, pretty soon”. No further texts. I feeling very awkward right now.

It definitely put me in a spot where I was outmatched which Im totally fine with, but I could tell she wasnt feeling a connection.   


Im finding that a lot of women Im going on dates with are more confident right off the bat and dont show a hint of nervousness. I have to warm up to people and Im not an in your face confident person. Im more of a kind person and a little goofy. Real laid back with some things. I have confidence, but Im not a ""take charge"" type person.   


Im bummed out. Its becoming a pattern. I think women just find me unintimadating as a man. Im not a really a ""manly"" person. Im a social introvert and sometimes just want to be with people and dont have much energy to talk. Sometimes Im super talkative. Tonight I wasnt. I lose steam in the afternoon.   


Im trying to figure out what I need to change and what I need to accept as just who I am.

70,qbqfq3,1634695191,How bad did I mess up?,"Okay, so last night was my second time hanging out with this girl I’ve been talking to. Originally we planned on hooking up, but it was that time of the month for her and I said that I’d love to hangout with her anyway. 

The part that bugs me most about the situation I’m in is that I thought the date went great! We watched Netflix and made out…a lot. Plus, she gave me oral and even complimented my appendage. At the end of the night, she gave me a goodnight kiss and agreed to get coffee with me sometime this week. But here’s when things get confusing..

So after dropping her off, I get back to my place and flirtatiously send her a snap of the hickie she gave me. She thought it was hot and even saved the snap in the chat. After flirting a little more (she said that she’d suck my d*** even better next time), I said that I had a  great time with her and asked when’s the next time I can see her. She said that she doesn’t know yet because her week is busy and I replied with “No big deal! I didn’t mean to come off as pushy. I totally understand :)”. After that, I noticed the messages from her got drier and today she hasn’t responded back at all. Usually she would respond promptly to me, so I don’t know what to think of this.

74,qbqn4h,1634695858,It would be easier if you looked up not down…,"I see a lot of people online being really down on themselves and saying they don’t deserve a relationship. They’re always focused on these things: 

-how much money is in their wallet
-how big their dick/chest is
-how often they see a therapist 
-how tall they are 

Being successful in relationships (or at least in meeting people/getting intimate) is about looking up at other people, not about looking down at yourself. 

I’ve seen all kinds of people dating all kinds of people. Me included. The only thing guys I date seem to have in common is their body temperature. I get cold, and dating a (literally 😂) hot guy helps me stay warm in winter. My dating preferences might shift in a warmer climate. 

I also need to date people who are strong-willed and organized, because they help me remember my appointments and make the world less scary. It’s good to know who you are and what you want. 

My unsuccessful relationships have been with people who know who they are … a little too much? They talked about themselves a LOT and didn’t really care about me. Or, alternatively they would ask me a bunch of questions that were more about them. I felt like I was being interviewed or assessed, not courted and dated. 

To say nothing of guys who sit there swiping on tinder while girls are right there trying to talk to them. I stood there once for five entire minutes waiting for a hottie to stop swiping and notice me. Or anyone. A bird in the hand is worth two in the photoshop and Snapchat filter. 

You probably do fill a need for someone. I don’t understand a lot of relationships I see. They get explained to me though. 

Like my friend who is 7’2” has a 5’2” girlfriend. You wouldn’t expect that to happen. But he doesn’t want his kids to be massive and she doesn’t want hers to be short. 

One of our friends always dates super fat guys because she likes how soft and squishy they are. I can see it. 

The couple down the street from me are avid gamers, D&amp;D enthusiasts, and they both weigh over 500 lbs and smell like rotten cheese. God bless them, they found eachother. 

I would absolutely date zero of these people. I also wouldn’t date anyone walking around in a grill. But for some people that’s high fashion. I wouldn’t date anyone who hates dogs, royal decree of my dog. I won’t even date a Trudeau voter, the greatest offender of all. 

Wouldn’t date them. And I don’t have to. Because for every purple haired emo music blasting gamer who loves ADHD kpop stans with crooked teeth, there’s a kpop stan just waiting for braces who loves purple hair and emo music. 

I think rich guys are pompous dicks, dicks should stay in your pants until I love you, and two people should be able to have a conversation that isn’t about You or what You want from Me.

78,qbqthr,1634696489,Deeply confusing - but hallmark signs she isn't over me,"Ok, I've posted a few times before but I just want some fresh insight and perspectives:

Around three weeks ago with no catalyst, my gf of 9 years broke up with me. She was nauseous, probably due to anxiety. No huge fight, no cheating, she just woke up and said it was what she wanted, it would make her happier and she didn't want to talk about it.

A few days passed and both of us descended into being as cold and vile to each other as possible. She would give me one word answers, no closure, leave a lot up in the air. On the Saturday I cooked myself a big breakfast (don't know why, I had no appetite) and did the same for her.

I then left for work as she was in bed nauseous for 2/3 hours. At work, I messaged her calmly and said seeing as she's taking it so badly, maybe some time apart would help and advised her to stay at her mum's, she agreed and said ""I'll stay at my mum's for a bit"".

I cut off contact for the first two days. She then messaged me, near enough constantly, for the next few days. She came over on the Monday and said lots of things to try and get a reaction, I kept my cool and said if she wanted to just hang out together the following day, we could, she said maybe. The same messages over and over again ""we aren't getting back together"", ""I don't want to be with you"" etc which almost felt like her trying to justify her own decision to herself, especially considering I rarely felt the need to respond.

The first Friday came around and she was at the house getting ready to go out, she has done this more in recent months but her social anxiety and generally scatty mental state at the moment makes this look a terrible idea. For context, she was out with friends and or drinking for at least ten of the first twelve nights after we first broke up.

I had said on the Thursday she could stay at the house if she wanted to and she replied ""depends how pissed I am"".

When I arrived home after work, she said maybe she'd regret this someday which made me see red, I'd seen her on her lunch break with a male colleague and told her to go and be with him if he makes her happy and to get the fuck out of the house. She said it hadn't even crossed her mind. Lowe and behold, a few hours pass, her Instagram story is full of him.

The next day I saw her friend, completely by chance and asked if she spent the night there. She didn't - according to her friend she spent the night at the male colleagues house. For context, her and this colleague have a very very hot and cold relationship, she's told me on numerous occasions he can be nasty and stand offish - however her friend only has a child's bed in the spare room - and could have been lying to evoke a reaction.

I questioned my ex when I saw her about it a few days later and she flipped when she realized I knew, ""well I'm single and I didn't fuck him anyway"". 

A week passes, regular contact via messages, to which I infrequently reply. She'll try ""I'm really sorry, I didn't want to hurt you, you don't deserve all of this"" to ""I want to sell the house now, that's the right thing to do"".

She comes around on Saturday and cries for hours, I've never seen her cry like that. She's distraught she has nobody to talk to like she can to me, she's hurting, I said we could try to make it work she says no. She hates living at her parents so I offer to cohabit but actively avoid her, she says she may want to bring people back to the house - which contradicts her statement of not being able to imagine herself with anybody else because of the guilt. She said she loves me but doesn't want to be with me, I'm handsome and fit but she doesn't want to have sex with me. She leaves, amicably, to go back to her parents. 

On Sunday I wake up to messages with kisses on the end.. she has to come over to collect washing, odd considering it's still damp when she arrives and the house will be listed on the Monday, so an unnecessary trip. When here, we laugh together, flirt a little, she asked to pull a hair out of my face, drops me off at my parents as it's en route, etc. I said I don't want her to feel I'm rushing her into bad decisions and if she'd like time, we can delay the house going on to the market, she says ""well we can always just not sell it if that's what we want to do down the line"" - not the same tone as ""I don't ever want to be with you again"".

She concedes the point about bringing people back as she also can't do that at her mum's. I explained I didn't believe this, she said simply if she moved back in we'd just end up back together. She said if we wanted to come back and missed me she wouldn't tell me or let herself, I said if the gut feeling was as strong as the day she left, she'd have no choice. She concedes the point.

Monday I wake up to a lot of mixed messages around the house going onto the market. I tried to reach out and ask what she wanted me to do, so I delayed the appointment. Minutes later I get dozens of texts ""you're so controlling"", ""all this weekend did was show me we can't ever get back together"" etc. I then attempt to reschedule to find out she doesn't have the correct forms of ID anyway. She says seeing me was too stressful, I told her to keep her distance and take her time with this, she told me she'd do what she wants. I get a phone call minutes after I arrive home from work asking if she can use the toilet I essentially asked if this was necessary, her grandmother lives across the road and she'd just come from there.

She tells me she doesn't need to ask, I said fine. She told me I was acting weird, asked if I had somebody here, etc. I told her at this point I think the only way to proceed is no contact. She flipped and said if I blocked her on Messenger, she wouldn't pay the mortgage and both of us would go bankrupt. I said I really hope the rest of her mental breakdown isn't so intense, stupid and hurtful, but at this point I'm running out of patience. She tells me to kill myself, goes to slam the door, runs back in and shouts ""don't do that, if you did, I'd feel so guilty, I'd do it too, I don't know why I said that, it just came out"" I said she overstepped a mark. I followed through with blocking her on everything, I messaged her mother to explain why I thought no contact was positive, that her mum could communicate with me if necessary and I wanted no bad blood, but just wanted nothing to do with her daughter anymore - and went to bed.

20 days after the breakup and I felt myself let go in a second. I still love her but I felt the weight of responsibility trying to make it work vanish.

The following morning she came to the house again to collect a parcel, I was in my underwear. She rang the doorbell, I just forced the parcel through the window. She was jittery, stuttery, apologetic, a different person to the day before.

An hour later I get an email saying ""this is why we will never work, all we are good at doing together is arguing"" despite my best efforts to remain reasonable. She then delayed on selling the house as it was too expensive and she wants to negotiate, I told her the price is reasonable, she just hasn't realized how big the consequences of her decisions are yet. I said I hope she feels better soon, she sent me another email saying she won't have time to do that today (further stalling on a good price) but will tomorrow.

I said ""he will be expecting your call tomorrow"" and got on with my day. My birthday is two weeks away and she had presents delivered to the house last week. 

What in the fuck is going on? She came over 5 days in 7 the week she left. She can't go a few hours without messaging (now emailing me), she is constantly externally justifying her decision but my patience is wearing so thin. It feels like she wants her options open, hence the birthday presents, not sleeping with anyone, regular contact, conceding points, seeing me a lot unnecessarily and getting so angry about no contact.

She has spent a few nights at her male colleagues house, he is not her type whatsoever. At the moment it feels like she's using him as she hates being at home with her family too - and I know a lot of her friends are more supportive of me than her in this decision as I've remained relatively cool, calm and collected.

I also feel like if she had slept with him, she would have told me when she's lost control of her emotions. I saw them on my lunch break yesterday, his face dropped and he looked at the floor, I flashed them both my biggest grin and she smiled back, we both kept walking. 

Why is she telling me she loves me but doesn't want to be with me one day and to kill myself two days later?

Why is she crying so aggressively over a relationship ""she mourned for months"" and ""doesn't want to be in anymore""?

Why is she buying birthday presents for me nearly a month in advance?

None of it makes any sense. Despite coming to terms more with the fact I just don't know her anymore every day, a huge part of me still feels like she'll walk back in looking for reconciliation at some point. I just fear it may be too late. Aren't these all the Hallmark signs she doesn't know what she wants? If she wanted out, she could block me on everything, use solicitors to get in touch, have the house on the market, etc.

My hopes are not pinned on her return. I want her to be happy and healthy, if that's with me or without me, both clearly have their perks. I have her blocked on everything and she has now resorted to emailing me telling she doesn't ever want to be with me. I've tried hard to be amicable, I just don't think she's coping well with the consequences of her actions. 

I start therapy today. I recommended she does too. 

I know I'm an asshole and reactionary but emotions, especially this new to me, are impossible to deal with rationally all of the time. I said yesterday I wouldn't take her back and am excited for this new chapter. Despite her losing her mind, she's the love of my life and I want to make up for being a lousy and sometimes neglectful boyfriend. She does deserve that.

79,qbqvks,1634696680,Someone asked me if I wanted a boyfriend,"I have a hard time understanding social cues, so I could really use some thoughts and opinions on this.

Today, someone I met tried to include me in the conversation by asking me if I was married. I missed the first part so I don't know why they were talking about this. He then went on to ask me if I had a boyfriend, and if I wanted a boyfriend. Prior to this conversation I knew that 1. This guy is happily married. 2. He seems genuinely nice. 3. He doesn't give of creep vibes. Then again, I've been wrong before. The questions he asked me didn't seem to match those three things so my brain panicked and I said no, I wasn't really interested in dating anyone.

Hours later, I'm thinking about this and now I'm wondering if this was his attempt to set me up on a date with someone else. Does this sound plausible?

If so, how do I bring this up again?

And finally, I keep thinking about he question ""Do I want a boyfriend?"" At first I thought yes, that's why I'm on this sub. In the moment I panicked and said no. But now I have no idea if I even really want a boyfriend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbqvks/someone_asked_me_if_i_wanted_a_boyfriend/

82,qbr2dn,1634697339,feeling pathetic right now,"for about 2.5 months, this beautiful guy at my job has been saying good morning to me every morning (not coworkers, we just work at the same place) and at first i didnt see it as anything until i realized he never said it to anyone else (i think).

there was also a time he shyly smiled at me when he said good morning so i thought ""oh, maybe he likes me"" so then i developed a GIGANTIC crush.

i dont see him everyday so i look forward to his good mornings (yes, pathetic i know). however the last time i saw him, he saw me twice w/o saying anything. the first time, i thought it was because he was actively doing something but the 2nd time he walked by me a couple of feet away. maybe its because he thinks im not that into it (i get shy so my voice doesnt sound off as well, esp with the mask)? idk.

now im sitting here like, ok maybe i was reading into this too much. he probably just sees me as another person who works there and was just being friendly.

92,qbrypa,1634700616,UPDATE: need advice (the saga takes another turn),"Hi, so earlier I (18m) had posted about asking a girl (19) out.

I figure if I start with something that i can play off as just being friendly then I can make my move if it goes well.

 I'm now stuck on whether or not to actually make the move though. Whenever we hangout she is super nice and I feel like there is a connection, but then she never really texts me at all. So is this just a case of her being polite and hanging out with me? 

I can provide more info if needed such as what signals I think she's given. Also, for context not texting isn't a huge deal for me in a relationship since I'm more of an in person kind of guy anyways.

Pls help!!!!! I'll do your calc hw in exchange for advice. (Jk I'm a C student)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbrypa/update_need_advice_the_saga_takes_another_turn/

He's a senior in a state next to me and has driven basically an hour the past 3 saturdays to be with me. He's paid for my food and alcohol. My concern is that he told me early on that he just got out of a long term relationship and he's not really looking right now. But he said, if it happens, it happens. We've hooked up and the first time he forgot a condom and did not want to fuck me without one bc i was not on BC. The second time, we actually had sex but the condom slipped and he paid for my plan b. Furthermore, he said that he actually enjoys spending time with me and that sex has just been a bonus. He's said a couple times that he missed me and that he had to wait another week to come and cuddle with me. He's been texting me good morning and good night for the past week. He's told me he cared about me and that he wouldn't bother me while studying so I would do well or like I shouldn't sacrifice my club parties just to be with him bc he wants me to make friends. We text/snap every day. He's also ss many of my snaps because he thinks I look good in them. Also, his mom has been curious about me bc he's been seen me 3 times already. He's shown her a photo of me. And he's asked what my parents would think if I dated a white boy. Also note: my parents don't know about this bc ""i'm not allowed to date until med school"". While before I just thought he was a hookup/fwb, I'm now catching feelings and starting to get a lil confused.

so yeah, that's the situation.

99,qbs8h8,1634701666,Does it mean anything or is he just continuing the joke?,"Okay. So. I have a close male friend that I am quite in love with, and I met him about a year ago at work, where it was pretty much love at first sight for me. 

The thing about overnights is that it's usually a crew of three, and one is always a manager. Our manager for the first several months of working overnights together was ~20yo girl, and she dubbed me the mom of our little group, and she dubbed my friend the dad, which made us married. Well, my friend and I started calling each other ""husband"" and ""wife"", and at first I just knew he was rolling with the joke our manager had started, as we also called her ""daughter"", but here's the thing...

She left the job a few months ago. We still call each other ""husband"" and ""wife"", and he even started saying things like ""my dear wife"" and even a few times ""my dear, kind, beautiful wife"" (when he wanted something but still...) And we also say things like ""this is why I married you"" and ""we've known each other for 20+ years we should know this by now"" etc. He even opened a discussion of whether I'm Mrs (his surname) or if ours was a modern marriage, and I'm Mrs (my surname). There was even a period where I made more of an effort to call him by his name, not because I wanted him to stop but because I was seeing if he would still call me that, and he still called me ""wife"". 

He even said once ""if/when I get a wife, I hope she understands my sarcasm"" after an instant that made it apparent once again that not only do I understand, but I can dish it right back. 

Am I overthinking this?? Or is there something there? (Or is this too little information to tell??)

Also I am planning on asking him out this weekend, but I was hoping to have a little more cause for confidence going in.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbs8h8/does_it_mean_anything_or_is_he_just_continuing/
