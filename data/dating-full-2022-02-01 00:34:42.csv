A brief rundown of our fling would be that we went on 4 dates over the course of a week. The first 3 dates were all amazing, we hooked up at the end of each one and couldn't get enough of each other. However, on the fourth date we both overshared while high, I panicked and began to overthink it, and I made a super insecure and unnecessary apology a couple days later which caused a clear major drop in her interest level.  That drop in interest caused me to become a bit clingy, which caused her to pull away more, and ended with me removing and blocking her on everything a week later because it was stressing me out too much.

It's been almost a full month since I cut her off, but it's like everything we did together is burned into my memory. I remember it all like it happened a few days ago. I blocked all her social media accounts a month ago too, but the pictures she had on there are also still completely fresh in my head. I can't stop thinking about how I shot myself in the foot several times in a row which resulted in me being in the position I'm in now.

I also have this thing in the back of my head that's telling me that I won't be able to find someone more attractive than her, since she was conventionally hot. I know that this probably isn't true since I'm only 20 and quite attractive myself, but I still have been obsessing about what felt like a huge opportunity fell extremely conveniently into my lap, and I still blew it. 

I think the reason that it's hitting me so hard is that I have never been in a relationship before due to extreme social anxiety issues that I had until recently. When I was with her I felt like I was in one, or at least the starting stages of one, but then as abruptly as it started it ended.

The silver lining is that I recognize that I learned a lot from the experience. There were a lot of things that I did that I'm never going to do again.

Hopefully it can help some guys who are struggling with porn.

I’ve been posting advice on various subs for a while. When you post advice frequently—whether intentional or not—you sometimes project an image that you have everything figured out, and others should follow your lead.

This is utter bullshit. I’ve made a lot of mistakes, had success, made more mistakes, and will continue to do so until I’m in the grave. You’re never fully ‘there’ when you improve yourself. Even if you improve the general course of your life, you will go through periods of failure, face setbacks, and not be at your best.

I was extremely disciplined when it came to eliminating porn and limiting masturbation over the past year and a half—except for the past several months. I haven’t fallen into addiction, but I went from not having watched porn in over a year, to watching a times a week. I went from only masturbating every seven or more days to almost every other day.  

This may not sound like a big deal, but porn is like cyanide for your confidence, masculine energy, and high value frame. Even a minor regular porn habit can be disruptive.

Despite being in a relationship and having a good sex life, I began to get greedy and rationalize why I could start watching again. This mindset leads to any path in addiction, not just with porn.

I realized recently that if with you’ve struggled porn in the past, like I did throughout most of my 20’s, that it’s not something you can eliminate from your life without being vigilant. It’s not a battle that you ‘win’. I learned this recently.

This isn’t a NoFap diatribe; the sole secret to happiness isn’t abstaining from masturbation. However, based on recent observation in how I was feeling while watching porn, versus how I’ve felt recently as I’ve been trying to work back to where I was.  Here are some observations:

1. Don’t beat yourself up or shame yourself if you watch porn. It’s not productive, but you aren’t a bad person or immoral. We all have a sex drive, and these falsified representations of sexuality are tempting. Shaming yourself won’t motivate you to change; in fact, it can inhibit progress.

2. The ‘I haven’t done it in a while’ rationalization is dangerous. As with any addiction, if you feel like you have something under control, and believe that this ‘one time’ won’t make a difference, then you don’t have it under control. Escape this mindset at all costs.

3. Likewise, the ‘I deserve this’ rationalization is equally as dangerous. You aren’t entitled to destructive behavior because you’ve had a bad day, or have abstained for a long time. You will have to deal with the same consequences, regardless of your self bargaining. My rationalization was, “I have a high sex drive, I’m a loyal boyfriend, I need this release.” It sounds ridiculous reading it back, but it’s an example of how I rationalized.

3. Focus on the bad. If you feel like you’re about to watch porn, your brain is craving the Dopamine rush and you will begin to rationalize. Try to get in touch with how you feel after the high—the social awkwardness, the depleted energy, anything else that you feel.

4. Embrace the horniness. Being horny is an energetic state. Don’t sit around and let this type of energy shift you in a negative direction. Get out of the house, let the energy motivate you to talk to actual women, to exercise, be creative. Fall in love with the discomfort to a degree.

5. Recognize and anticipate your triggers. After I workout and come home and shower, and if I’m watching TV or browsing the Internet, that’s my danger zone. I have to either be busy with something else, or take myself out of the position. 

6. Personal observation. I am convinced that porn is unnatural, and inhibits social interactions. Our brains have not evolved to process porn in an optimal manner. It is extremely difficult to put yourself in a high-value frame of energy with consistent porn use, because it is a low-value activity. That might sound harsh or unfair, but it’s true. High-value men pursue women in real life and don’t rely on porn to satisfy urges. If they have these urges, they don’t deal with those urges by glaring at movies with a dick in their hand. 

Masturbation isn’t harmful occasionally, but porn is. Even using porn on occasion is like cyanide for your brain and social frame. Make as much effort as you can to eliminate it from your life.

8. Abstinence from masturbation and porn won’t solve all your problems. NoFap places misguided emphasize on ‘steaks’ and superpowers that don’t exist. The ‘superpowers’ are simply subtle changes in body language and micro expressions in the eyes due to increased confidence. You will still feel down, sometimes lack confidence, and have bad days if you don’t masturbate and watch porn.

This post isn’t meant to preach, it’s meant to draw attention to the negative consequences of porn, and bring attention to how tempting and difficult can be. It’s fucking hard.

I am a bit tipsy at the moment and that gives me the courage to post this, but I hope it is understandable in some way.

So I come from a rather broken family and have suffered through numerous issues in my lifetime. One of these issues was the traumatic experience of seeing my mom break down from a psychotic episode at age 14, after which I was forced to decide to move to my dad with my brother (12). This environment was safer in some ways, but was in other ways very abusive. The most influential effects my dad and stepmom has were saying that my mother did not love us, and even though it is not true, it has affected me for a while. 

I don't trust people. At the moment I can surely say I just trust 2 people in my life. Partly because I grew up in this situation, partly because I met people who have abused this trust, and partly because I suffer from anxiety and Bipolar disorder (which I inhereted from my mom). On the other hand I really want to connect with people, especially romantically. So I overshare, and when I feel that I can tell another person stuff about my life I end up developing feelings because I am so unfamiliar to the feeling of trust. 

It causes me to only fall for people that consider me as a friend. I don't mean this in a ""friendzone"" way, but more in a sense of that they see me as a friend, but because I trust them I feel for them more. I have had several crushes in this way, and it never went anywhere because 1., they did not see me this way (which is very fair) and 2. I understood the relationship we were in and I accepted it. 

The issue that I am facing with is trust and honesty. Most of the time I just go for one-night stand because it does not involve me creating connections/trust. The second to last person with whom I was with for a longer time abused this to an intense level. The last person I was with for multiple times ended it because of her own valid reasons, but it did show me I wanted something different. 

I want a connection, I want to give and receive affection. But I am honestly scared. To be rejected. To be ignored. But mostly to open up, truly open up, and then being put down or taken advantage off again. Or (which frightens me the most) is to scare the other person away because I am too much, like so many people said in my life. I know it is not true, but my brain does not comply. 

The last person I was with made me realize that a good experience can happen, and I do believe in that, at the moment. But every new person scares me again to open up to, because it can mean another heartbreak. And I don't want to be like that, but life has caused me to be cautious.

I don't expect anyone to have an awnser, I just wanted to share/rant at this moment if anyone felt the same. Lots of love.

I'm starting to get depressed about this. I’ve never been hit on by anyone.

When I go out by myself, men still don’t notice me. When I go dating apps, no one messages me, when I do message them I get ignored or unmatched. I’ve tried being the initiator but it has never worked in my favor. I’m an ambivert, I do really well with social groups. I get along with people of all walks of life and ages. I’ve tried changing my physical appearance. New wardrobe, hair, nails, etc. I workout regularly at the gym. I look presentable. I don’t get it. I’m fully independent (career in the #1 financial institution in the country, I live on my own). I’m either invisible or I’m being asked if my friends are single, or I become one of the homie.

We have known each other for 30 years.  We started sending songs back and forth to each other (he started it) that made us think of each other.  Mainly romantic songs.  It’s cute.  I adore it.  I have created a playlist and add songs when we send one along.  

We have not said we are bf and gf.  We see each other maybe once a week.  I have a son.  He is crazy with work.  Fits us well.  

So, the other night he says goodnight and sends “be my baby” Ronettes.  Adorable.  But HOW DO YOU READ THAT? My over-analyzing head is like wow, what is he trying to insinuate?

So the next night, we see each other.  Fucking amazing time.  He built a fire, had some drinks and great convo.  Our chemistry is off the charts.  He sleeps over.  He leaves in the AM.  We txt a little because he is working.  I say “I cant stop thinking about you.  I want you all the time.  I feel like I’m falling for you.”  (We can’t see each other more because of above reasons… it was more the desire)

He reads it and never responds.  I say “yikes, I better pull myself up and dust off my feelings” he then responds “I don’t know what to say.  I show more than say how i feels”. 

I’m thinking… “what am I missing?  I feel like I have egg on my face because that reaction seemed cold”.   Previous convos have been filled with plenty of feels from him.  He had even said “I love you” during sex two different times.  Look I know people say stupid stuff during sex but you aren’t saying I love you to any and every girl.

I am almost positive that my parents would like the person I have been talking to. theyre a really good person and I can tell they they sre sbout me if that makes sense. weve already talked about it and we want to wait until weve been together a while and we are more serious-- so not anytime soon. he also supports me in everything that i do 

my parents other excuse to being super strict about dating is school. they want me to focus on my studies-- which makes sense. ever since ive been talking to this oerson my grades havent slipped and i literally have no life outside of school so i feel like the person ive been talking to wouldnt be too much of a distraction. and clearly i would also be prioritizing them and school. 

its also bogus because all of my siblings have had high school relationships without one peep from my parents about pregnancy or school or anything like that. i think my parents trust me-- but as i type this out I’m thinking otherwise

i can feel the person im talking to starting to slip away because ive been hesitant to tell my parents (becuase we cant really do anything together). i judt dont want to lose hI’m and i think if they got to know  him they would like him. the only hiccup i could forsee is that he is not the best student…. it should not be a big deal but i think it would be to my parents.

I never asked to be Demi.. but yet here I am all the same. I was with an ex for four years, I loved her deeply. However, it wasn’t a healthy relationship. She was raised in a extremely emotionally suppressed and passive aggressive household. Unfortunately that carried over into our relationship. Because I know how she was raised I don’t hate her, and because I actually did love her I still care for her. She was emotionally abusive to me, making me feel guilty for ever being sad or upset in our relationship. Basically made it so I could not allow my emotions to happen naturally or to happen at all. For someone like me, Demi, it was soul crushing. There was aspects of my sexuality that were often insulted upon as well as made to feel guilty or less than for being curious about topics of sexuality. She never spent time with me, I worked 50 hours a week to pay 90% of the bills because she worked maybe ten hours a week and still never wanted to do anything around the house. It was like pulling nails to get her to ever clean or anything. On my days off I’d clean the whole house, laundry, dishes, grocery shop. She never really did any of that. She would stay up all night and sleep during the day do I never really got to see her. She wasn’t big into physical affection so I was always feeling touched starved as well (recently discovering a part of my love language is physical touch and I was unaware of that then). Ultimately it ended on bad terms, I tried to talk to her about our relationship and she okayed the victim like I was the bad guy and do we ended it. No closure just she left. I had bills and so many responsibilities to do I had no time to work through my problems. Just this last summer I started trying to dig up the emotions I buried to work through them. I’m not perfect, I still get lonely and depressed but I’m working on it. Therapy, gym, adopted two kitties to care for. Trying to get my life in order, even went back to school.
Out of the blue my ex messaged me on a social media app just to casually talk like nothing happened between us. We broke up two years ago. Now she will message me casual conversations here And there and idk how to handle. Sure I should block her.. that’s the logical thing to do. But I haven’t had any connection to anyone in my life since her and now I feel myself drawn to her. Not necessarily romantic or sexual.. just that connection.

My last relationship lasted 3 years… I’ve had a couple  romantic interests since then, that obviously didn’t work out, one lasted for 6 months and the other for 4 months. I’ve really appreciated what I learned about myself in terms of my boundaries, likes, dislikes, and dating style across these experiences so far. I don’t casually or multi-date, but honestly get suitors pretty easily so I’ve never felt like there’s been a lack of options. Been told I’m decent looking and easy to get along with.

When I do decide to go for someone, I’ve learned I can get pretty hyper fixated on them quickly (diagnosed with ADHD). When I like someone, I invest a lot of time and energy into them. I end up getting disappointed by this idealized version of them that doesn’t end up being true, but will be the last one to call it quits usually. When it ends, I go through a couple weeks of being super sad, but then someone else shows up that I get interested in. 

Lately it’s been overwhelming with work, with the last 6 months making me feel pretty burnt out. I take my career goals seriously, and am already pretty occupied with work as it is. I put in 60+hours a week. During regular times I would be travelling for my job too, which I will be starting again soon. I still manage to have a decent social life though and see my friends at least a couple times a week. 

Its been easier to decompress with someone that I am seeing or dating, I get totally interested in getting to know them more and going on dates. But because I haven’t really been alone for 4 years, I started to question if I am leaning on male distractions too much for emotional support especially when I get so bummed when it’s over.

At the same time, I’ve just entered the talking stage with someone who checks a lot of boxes on my list, like in a way that I haven’t ever found in someone before. I am really excited about the potential of this, but haven’t shared how burnt out I am feeling from work with them. I beat myself up a bit with the instantaneous replying and how my mind fixates on them when I need to get shit done. It’s only been a month so we are early days and I can cut it off without feeling too invested but don’t want to miss out on this opportunity. 

How do you know when you should just focus on yourself? I genuinely want to build healthy habits for myself and don’t want to keep getting caught in this cycle.

It’s difficult for me to keep a conversation going with him because he doesn’t really ask me stuff and keeps his answers short, so I’m assuming he’s shy or I’m really weird. 

Anyway, it was my birthday a little while back and my girlfriends in the class knew about it so they told everyone (ofc). Dave seemed pretty excited cause it was his birthday a few days later, so we talked about that for a while. He said we should do something for our birthdays, maybe with friends from another class we share. Then class started and he said we could talk about it after. 

I stayed after a little longer than normal in case he wanted to but didn’t bring it up cause it felt kinda weird, and he didn’t try to talk to me or anything.

I was in a two year relationship with my (30M) ex (24F) and things were not so great. We fought a lot of the time, but the fights were always about the same, she felt insecure that I didn't love her and I struggled to love her because she was always in a victimized defensive position. 

The bad thing that make me doubt are these:

Whenever I tried to engage in conversation she thought I was criticizing her and would most of the time think my intentions were bad (and most of the time they were not). I like playing games when having conversations, like making  questions like: what would you do if your life was like XX? or what would you prefer between XXX lifestyle or XXX lifestyle? And most of the time she thought it was a test and was going to be judged. And it is true that I did judge her when the relationship was in an early stage, I wanted her to be receptive to jokes and not get so angry at any comment, good or bad. Even when we were around my family, I also wanted her to follow some of the etiquette rules that my parents taught me when we were around them, specifically one thing: not staking up the dishes while picking them from the table. I tried saying it in the best of terms, and didn't care at all if she did stack them while my parents were not around. She took it really bad, like I was saying she was low class or something. 

She rarely mentioned anything that she didn't like from me. To her, I supposedly was perfect, but I think people should communicate when something is bothering them, it seems healthy. She didn´t communicate, she would just get mad and expect me to figure out what was going on or just start crying and locking herself in the bathroom. She would sometimes get mad at things that had happened months before, things like me liking other girls on Instagram. I was absolutely faithful with her for the two years, first time I did this in my relationship life. 

Many nights she would question me to inquire if I did love her. I would always say I loved her, I would try to make her feel safe for the first 15-100 mins of the conversation depending on my patience. She would continue to question my love, very few times was I able to appease her. She would continue asking, then crying, then screaming, then out of desperation I would just say: ok then, I don´t love you then, is the questioning over if I say I don't love you? I would not like to play this game with her, it was terrible, she would constantly attack me until I threatened with breaking up and then she would just cry next to me all night, none of us would get any sleep. I feel awful, I became a monster some nights I don´t like conflict, specially when we were tired and just wanted to watch a movie and cuddle. I would offer to speak about her worries next day at lunch-time or at some hour we both were coherent and patient, this offer would never be truly accepted by her. 

The good things: 

She can be very sweet and smart, she is an engineer and understands concepts in a deep level. I love science and she does too, although we rarely had a deep conversation about science because she would always feel tested when I tried to engage, I like asking questions and bounce ideas when talking about science or philosophy and I feel totally open to changing my mind, sometimes too much and change my mind too soon. 

Sex is insanely good, she is exactly my type, we both have a lot of fun in bed, I had never met anyone like her. 

She is absolutely gorgeous, she is a model and has appeared in several top model magazines, internationally and nationally. I am not a bad looking guy but she is definitely out of my league. 

She can be funny in a very deep level. She likes to watch similar shows as me, she liked readying science books with me out loud, she had similar music taste, she likes to play tennis with me and she is really good too, she was also learning golf with me and she was enjoying it and I was enjoying it so much too, she even likes anime like me and would even play videogames with me, she would always like to spend time with me, go to the country side and smoke weed in the mountains. She likes sporadic hard drugs, we would every few months do LSD, MDMA or Cocaine with friends and have fun while being as cautious as possible with the substances. My friends also liked her, and she would be very fun to be with people around, never showed any drama in public. 

She told me she wants to get back with me and will not doubt my love anymore, she says she wants to grow up and be mature with me. She says I'm not only her love but her best friend. 

She has also spoken terrible about me to her family and they hate me now.

I will also refer to the lady in this post as ""Allie"". TL;DR is at the bottom.

I first met Allie several months back at the gym. From what I could tell, she would appear semi-regularly, enough for me to see her maybe once or twice a week on average. I briefly introduced myself to her one day, we exchanged pleasantries, and became acquaintances. Most of our interactions were fairly brief, but always friendly. If we were close enough to talk, we'd usually just ask how the other one was doing, make a brief comment about our workouts, chuckle, and then continue on. If we saw each other from a distance, we'd either nod at each other or wave. There was definitely a bit of what I'd call ""eye flirting"" -  times when I'd catch her glancing at me; I'd take a peek at her through the mirror if she was within range. I never really made a more explicit move then mainly due to 1) my own reserved nature and 2) my assumption that she might have been seeing someone, as I noticed her with a guy during some of her workouts. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. It had been a few months since I'd seen Allie at the gym, but she happened to show up during one of my sessions. We didn't say much the first day I saw her back. The next day, as I was stretching prior to my actual exercises, she stopped by the section of the gym I was in. She asked how I was doing, and we engaged in our typically brief back-and-forth. Just as I was about to move on, I asked myself what would it hurt to try engaging with her a bit more. So I turned around (as naturally as possible) and continued talking to her. We talked (no more than four/five minutes) about a couple more personal things, when Allie mentions to me that she's going to be opening her own nutrition club in the area. I expressed my congratulations, and then Allie said, ""Thanks! I know you come here pretty regularly, and maybe if I had your info I could let you know when I'm opening; you could stop by if you'd like."" In my experience, women (in the dating/flirting game) tend to operate on subtleties, more often than not. I took this as her, short of just asking me point blank for my number, making it as easy for me as possible to give her my number. I then proceeded to give her my number, and she text her number and name to my phone. We talked for another minute or so and then moved on.

The interaction I mentioned above happened on a Wednesday night. I didn't see her the rest of the week, and did not immediately text her afterwards. On Saturday, I figured that I might try setting a date up with her, given the frequent eye-flirting and our recent info exchange. Below I will post exactly what she and I said via text and the approximate times of the responses:

*Around 3:30PM* \- **ME -** Hey, Allie. How's your Saturday been going?

*Around 8:40PM -* **ALLIE -** Hey! It's been alright how about yours?

*Around 10:40PM -* **ME -** That's good to hear. And same with me, cannot complain. If you happen to have some free next week, I was wondering if you'd want to grab something to eat.

And...that's it. That's where the conversation stopped. I never received a response back. Additionally, I haven't seen her back at the gym, either, haha. Or at least she hasn't been during the times when I would usually see her. Me being the over-thinker that I am, so many thoughts were racing through my mind in the immediate days. I was (and still am) a bit confused regarding the response (or lack thereof) from Allie. Everything up to that point had been very cordial and slightly flirty. I'm not expecting her to owe me anything, as we technically don't really know each other. But our interactions were as I described them above, nothing more and nothing less. 

As I stated, a number of thoughts have gone through my head. In my mind, however, the two most plausible explanations seem to be:

1. She truly only ""asked"" for my number to contact me whenever her nutrition club opened up, nothing more.
2. She's in a relationship and I badly misinterpreted our previous interactions.

The other explanations I have are all a bit silly and far-fetched, haha. And I suppose it's possible that to avoid any perceived awkwardness she just ignored my text and completely changed her routine schedule. Though yikes, I hope I wasn't that bad, haha.

But I am very curious to hear what you all think. Even with the context I provided, I know it'll be impossible for you or I to fully grasp the entire picture. What do men with a bit more dating experience think? Women, how does this look from your perspectives? Did I rush things? I feel like we'd been acquainted long enough that asking to grab a bite seemed fairly harmless. My biggest issue in the past has been playing the long-game. Girls would initially be very interested, but would slowly fade away because I took too long to build a rapport with them before making any sort of move, such as asking for a date/meet-up. I tried to avoid that here.

Any and all responses and words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time!

I've been trying to take a look at my track record to find patterns of why I fail at dating and I noticed something interesting today. I ruin every potential relationship I could have before it can start by causing myself huge stress. In my head, I have a rigid timeline/idea of how dating should happen.

I should go on a first date. We should have fun texts between the first and second date. The second date should happen the next week. After, I should know more about him and deepen my feelings. I should want to see him ASAP. He should be texting me more at this point. Etc, etc. 

The funny thing is...if it *doesn't* happen this way, I'm like ""well, guess this is doomed, I better just move on, we have no connection"" and ruin it. And if it *does* actually play out how I plan, I feel a crazy amount of pressure trying to keep everything on track. I don't actually like texting--so forcing myself to do it because it's part of the plan is suffocating. I might not actually want to see him again within a week--maybe I want more time to debrief from the first meeting. But by forcing myself to do all of these things, I end up feeling sooooo stressed that I don't feel excited about dating at all...then I ruin it.

I'm not sure what the moral of the story is, but I'm guessing it's that there's no ""right way"" to date or timeline that you have to follow.

Turned into fwb. We stayed that way until about 3 months ago. Originally I did not want more, she asked a few times about being more when we were fwb and I’d always tell her I didn’t feel that way about her (to the degree of being in a relationship, I take them pretty seriously). She was never pushy about it

We got serious a few months back. Couldn’t tell you what happened but my feelings grew for her and I started want more with her. And I asked her if she was still open for the same, she said she was. So lately we’ve been hanging out more (like 2-3x/week as opposed 2-3x/month), going on dates, cuddling and talking about our thoughts, emotions etc. we’ve even said ‘I love you’, I met not only her parents but her whole extended family, we’ve made plans to visit my parents in Seattle. We’ve talked about our future together too. 

IMO that would be considered something serious, right?

However, it’s been 3 months and she’s scared to commit. Doesn’t wanna be in a ‘relationship’ even though we’re in one  for all intents and purposes. Every time I bring up making it official so to speak she says either that she’s scared, she’s afraid she will fuck it up, she’s afraid it’ll lead to us never talking again (if it doesn’t work out), I deserve someone better. I try to be as patient with her as I can. I understand her fears but there’s only so long I can wait. Everything about her is great, she has no other red flags,or insanely toxic traits. We always have the greatest time together. Our sex is amazing and has been since day 1. We have this connection when we look each other in the eyes. And we can be so comfortable laying around and not needing to say a single word to each other.   So it’s not like she has all of these other negative things, it just boils down to her not being able to commit 

We just spoke on the phone earlier and she said she’s getting kind of sick of me bringing this up to her. She’s feels I’m being kinda pushy and accusatory of things. I admittedly have accused her of not feeling the same way about me as I do her and not being honest. I feel she’s not being honest bc part of me feels she doesn’t want a relationship but is too afraid to say otherwise. She has this fear of me leaving her or just her being alone and I get the sense that she wants to keep things in the ‘safe zone’ where we’re in between a relationship. It just seems as if she wants her cake and to eat it too. I find it very odd that she’s never brought up being exclusive either during these few months. I’ve never met a woman that isn’t quick to wanna have that talk but she hasn’t. 

So I know she has a justifiable side to things as do I but for one, am I being too pushy? And secondly, what should I do from here? Break it off completely, try to go back to friends or be patient with and trust her that we will become more",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1156244,public,self,"29M should I cut things off completely, go back to friends or try to make it work?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/shknp5/29m_should_i_cut_things_off_completely_go_back_to/,no_ads,0,,,

We continued texting in this way, and he just generally seemed very interested. Once I was free from quarantine, we met up, I cooked him dinner, we hung out, talked, kissed, things seemed to go well.

After we met the texts dried up a little bit. We would still text everyday but the exchanges were less intense, less updates about his day, one day we went most of the day without texting. He asked to hang out Saturday, so about 5 days after our first date. Got dinner, went stargazing, saw shooting stars. He texted me Sunday morning (triple texted in fact) and we ended up hanging out Sunday night once again, watched a movie, went to my bed, did everything you can with underwear still on. I ended up asking him about his sexual/dating history and he seemed to be a bit uncomfy but explained he hasn't dated anyone before so he isn't sure what he likes in a romantic context. Whatever.

TLDR: Matched with a girl on OLD and it got sexual really quickl. We met, we had hot, passionate, vocal sex, and then she rejects me kindly. Why, though? Not knowing why is kind of bugging me. 

Hi all, 

So, basically, I’m feeling a bit weird after a date I had recently with a girl. To start off, we met on OLD where she messaged a flower and kiss emoji. Immediately, after I responded the back and forth banter got heated (sexually) super fast and we just started talking about how much we wanted to meet each other to basically have sex. 

We did also talk and converse about each other and our backgrounds, interests, etc. but it all would turn sexual super fast, initiated and continued by both of us. 

She even would occasionally mention how she couldn’t wait to go on even more dates (before we even met physically) and travel, and hang out, and meet her family, etc. I was a bit more reserved with statements like that because, well, we hadn’t even met!

It didn’t really bother me. I just thought we were both getting along well and she was interested in me and I in her. 

We immediately exchanged numbers and set up a date for the next day (because she was busy that night. Wow, I can’t believe she was expecting to meet that night!). 

This was in the middle of the week. I didn’t mind. She was hot. And the convo was hot. 

We finally meet and we start talking. She is a fast talker and talks a lot and was a really cool person with a lot of interesting things to say and share. I usually tend to be shyer/more reserved/nervous when meeting people but I can carry myself in a convo too. We agreed on a lot of things, especially politics and spirituality, which I thought was really cool. 

Not much later, we start making out at the bar we went to, heavily petting each other until we finally agree to go to my place. She had offered to get a hotel room, but I didn’t want her to pay that. Why? But, I also mentioned that my place was dirty as hell because I didn’t have time to clean since we initially matched online and set up the date. I also even warned her that I had a Japanese floor bed! I consider myself basically unfuckable bc of that! 

Anyways, we drove to my place, making out in my car on the way there, and she claims there’s nothing wrong with my place. That it’s a typical bachelor dude pad. 

We continue making out and proceed to have what I consider was some of the hottest sex I’ve ever had. Ate her out to my heart's delight and her vibrating and moaning…”do what you want with me”, she says. 

Anyways, she stayed over and we even had morning sex!

The next day, I went to work…again….and she went home, she had the day off. And we chat about how much fun we had the night before. 

Then, her communication on the second day after that was much, much less….and then, she wrote a long text about how she meditated on our connection and stated “our paths weren't aligned.” She thanked me for the experience and basically said bye. She didn’t mention why our paths weren’t aligned, though. 

I was kind of thrown off by this considering how much she mentioned how she wanted to go on future dates, had all these ideas about future sex sessions, travel plans, her friends, etc. 

And, yes, I was more reserved about those things, because I barely know her….but, was also open to continue seeing each other. 

Why would she reject me outright like that? Was it my dirty apartment? Was it that I didn’t have ideas about future dates and sex sessions like she did? Was it the Shiva poster in my apt? Was it my snoring? Was my dick not good enough? Was it the cultural/racial difference? 

I know I shouldn’t dwell on it and that it doesn’t really matter, in the end. But, I’m not gonna lie. It kind of hurt me a little bit. She met me, fucked me, then rejected me kindly. Lol. But, why? What threw her off? It’s bugging me a little bit and kinda hit my confidence a bit. 

What am I not seeing here? What is my lesson?

I'm not in a very positive headspace right now, I really like this girl, and I think she likes me back based on all the signals I've been given (I'm not gonna go into them for the sake of brevity, but if asked I'll tell about them.) I've been feeling a whole host of feelings around this girl though. The gist of it is that I basically don't feel good enough, I feel like I don't match up to what she brings, which is how amazingly beautiful, smart, and entertaining she is. the main thing that made me feel this way is I recently got her instagram to talk to her on, which we have been doing for over a week daily, however I came to notice from her page that she is in fact a model, which if you saw her in real life, you wouldn't expect it, not to say she's bad looking or anything, quite the opposite, she just has a very particular style of clothing that one would assume a model to not have. This revalation threw me for a real loop, I started to question her motivations, and if she really wanted to actually date me, or was just being friendly, after all she's an all AP/ honor roll student with a modelling career, while I'm kind of this tall nerdy asian guy that probably spends too much time doing random useless shit. I don't have the world's best self esteem to be honest, and these thoughts don't help. I want to move forward with this, but I can't help but feel intimidated and scared, I don't want to self sabatoge, but I can't help but feel like it'd be so much easier to just not take the risk and stay in my bubble. And before anyone tells me to just ask her out, I've already asked her on a date once, and while she said yes, she had to cancel day before because of family plans.

M/25 in college. We have a best friends group of two guys and two girls. One guy left so now in classes it's just me and the two girls. 

This one girl started crushing on me madly, and we both felt attached to each other. We've been friends for six months now, hung out at restaurants, movies, ect. It was that feeling like we instantly knew how the other was feeling and what we wanted out of life. Pure connection. Never felt closer to a woman in my life. 

Problem is I didn't make a move because I didn't want to destroy the friendship we had between the other girl in our group. I didn't want to put her into a position of being the third wheel so to speak and make her feel bad about herself. 

Now the girl who's given me so many hints she wanted me to ask her out feels rejected and is beginning to move on (feels insulted), and the second girl in our group thinks because I rejected her I have an attraction to her now. (even though we really don't click or get along).

We have 6 more months together in another semester in classes, and the girl I have a great connection with wants to go on more dates. How would you approach this without screwing this up and making it awkward for everyone?

So I met this girl in a video game online 33F and I'm 29M. Our friendship spiked to fast to being so close. Fast forward few months and she told me that she likes me, my body type and she loves me. *we talked before that this is friendship ONLY. Anyway, I stood to my words of saying we are just friends. However, with time... I decided to try being more than friends but it didn't work. We barely completed 3 weeks before she breaking up with me. At that time I begged her to not give up too fast, she did. We stopped talking for a while and then we started to talk again. At this point we became best friends and very close to each other and then, the same happened. She told me she have feelings for me, this time I made myself very clear that this will never happen again. At this point we knew each other for over a year, and we stayed best friends and happy. She used to not have many people in her life, now she does and she started to fade me away. Starting with reduced texting, no more care or asking about me, treating everyone nicely but me cold shoulder. Spending too much time with everyone but she is busy when it comes to me. It feels like I'm begging for text, talk, or any activity together. Now she comes and say we are no longer best friends and we are just friends and whatever happen between us doesn't affect me anymore. We barely talk now and I'm lost... I do care about her or this ""friendship"" but it feels one sided now. I'm seriously lost on what to do right now.

I don't know if this would fit another one.

So this relationship has since ended, but I'm still not fully over the feelings surrounding an incident towards the end. It isn't that I hold a grudge, but rather that I haven't worked through them.

During that part of the relationship, they (18nb) had started to become distant. We rarely talked aside from the calls we had to sleep (LDR) and some moments of talk about our day. The only other time was mostly when they wanted to sext, so we did (erp and some video stuff). Well, I was starting to get into a put since I felt that being in this relationship was better than not being in one. 

Then the new fnaf came out (I know, this was a dumb situation) and they began making art of them with glamrock freddy and such. Mix of romance and erotic. This was something they had not even done of us together and it was a lot more emotion than they had showed towards me in months. I spoke up and told them this. In turn, they said how it was just an infatuation and that they had had a hard time showing emotions due to being tired emotionally. 

I felt bad and just went silent. They still sent the art work since they liked to show what they made until I eventually let them know. Ultimately they felt worse and I felt worse for speaking up. Was I in the wrong about this or should I have spoken up? I don't know if I was over thinking it or not. We both have autism, so maybe they just had a hard time with showing their feelings?

I guess some context is that they prefer to have control and stuff (both in and out of the bedroom) due to feeling like they have none and I quickly fell into total submission. We had several breakups before the final one and when I broke up, things were messy and they would constantly beg for me to come back (at one point sticking onto a poly I was in because we felt awkward to have them just begging) and when they broke up things weren't. That is pretty much all I can think of for possible context that might help, but I dunno.

* I then messaged her Saturday asking if she wanted to hang at 12am, didn’t work out in the end.

I’m confused since she responds to my messages instantly, kept praising the sex after and said I was a “rare” find, kept complimenting me ect ect.

Then my close friend from college which is our classmate too told me that she was looking for me and wants me to join. So i thought it was signal that maybe i should try courting her again. So i decided to chat her and we had this great conversation. But after 2 days she just seened my morning greeting. I didnt sent him a message again because i know she is busy due to her work deadlines which she told me. Then the next day her fb account is deactivated.

I had a few hook-ups after that, with both boys and girls, but I couldn't really be into anyone. During this time, I also tried to improve myself a lot, got several major achievements, made a living, had a better living lifestyle, etc. I realized and learned the hard way how immature I was at the time, that my behaviors sucked, I got the wrong mindset of how to love since it was my first relationship, etc. I, therefore, utilized the span to reinvent a better version of myself full of confidence, all for the moment I could come back, apologize and claim my feelings for her, that how much she meant to me. 

At first, she bashed me heavily for what I'd done. But then she slowly accepted me, tho still with a lot of doubts. I tried to start everything from scratch and we were indeed making great progress, but not long before the same old problems, which were unsolved from the last time, emerged and screwed things up. Although I really wanted to talk and figure out a solution to put an end to it this time, she got mad, broke up, and disappeared in an instant. 

For the record, I think she does love me, however, our love language is quite different, which has led to the previous breakup. Moreover, we are about to take responsibility for our own life, college admissions, study abroad, and such. Our relationship is not supported much, since we live in a quite conservative country and she is a Christian. 

I am really sad, bewildered, and disappointed rn. I love her, but I don't know why such efforts still cannot work things out, whether I should be more persistent in chasing after her or just give up, I am torn between self-dignity and the afraid of wasting all my previous effort to win her attention back.

She asked why i OK'ed here because i never do that.

To my surprise, it got some responses (I was expecting it to fade into the aether, so I was pleasantly surprised)! Most of the people weren't what I was really looking for, but there was one girl, we'll call Lasombra (after her favourite clan from Vampire the Masquerade, 27F), who made a very good first impression when she included her favourite LOTR and Star Wars quote in her first message (as I'd requested in my post). 

After a little back-and-forth, we moved over to Discord and it sorta went a bit downhill. I was carrying the conversation, and she'd kinda ignore me asking for her to talk for a bit, along with her replies being relatively sparse and rather short (but not one-word or anything).

At least that was until I asked about something that had been bugging me for a while. I asked her about of Reddit post she made with a title like: ""Domme Girl looking to discuss kinks"" or something to that effect. I stressed that my curiosity wasn't judgemental or anything, I was just wondering what it was all about. Lasombra explained that she's a domme or whatever... and then asked me what *I ""like""*, if you get what I mean, to which my response was basically ""IDK, never done 'the sex' before lol"". She teased me about being a virgin, and then, for some reason, asked me if I was attracted to her.

I, being the pathetic, lonely autistic nerd I am, said ""Yes"" and that ""it's not every day you meet a nice, nerdy goth girl, so who wouldn't be?!"" I asked her if she felt the same and she said that she only likes me as a friend (which is totally fine!), and I asked her why she asked me that if she doesn't like me that way. She said that she'd tease me about me liking her, and I asked her not to because I couldn't tell if she was joking or not (I have Asperger's, and thus, horrendous at picking up on stuff like that) and didn't want her potentially toy with my emotions.

It's been almost a week and she hasn't responded. IDK if she's mad at me for saying that or what? I really like Lasombra, but her behaviour is annoying and I wish she'd be more involved in our conversation. However, the thought that I may've made her hate is eating me up because I really like her, and I feel really guilty.

I have her number as a result of gathering all the workers for said group dinners.

She's not a big social media person, but I recently saw her make her rare Facebook post and all the romantic thoughts from the summer came back into my head after being dormant for a university quarter. I took the advice that is often given - focus on yourself - and she was the first girl I've met since focusing on myself during remote learning and I've been really happy with myself. I really do picture myself with her pretty well based on our interactions this summer. Not sure how to handle it - a text out of the blue may be random and the realistic probability that we'd see each other again is probably low, but I do think about her a lot.

I’m gonna try &amp; keep this as short as possible but I ( 27M) met a girl (23) via social media, we hit it off pretty good, had a lot in common it turns out and she said she was moving to my current city later this year and was coming up to check out places to work/find an apartment in a couple weeks. I was pretty rational and asked to face time ( not looking to get catfish) and my surprise it was actually the person I thought I was talking to! So we made plans to meet up.  Flash forward to the supposed day and I texted her and the address to the hotel she was staying at.

I’ve seen friends evolve after going to therapy sessions and I’m all for it.

I started seeing this girl and she has told me that she’s in therapy because of things that happened in her past relationship. That’s fair and I want to give her as much time and space she needs before she’s comfortable to tell me what happened.

But a part of me is burned by my past relationship where I get paranoid when someone is hiding something from me. My ex cheated on me so many times which is why I’m feeling exceptionally uncomfortable. 

I have never forced her to tell me what happened. Every time she brings up small things like “I’m scared of heights now because of what happened before”, I’ll ask her why and when she says she’ll tell me eventually, I let it go and move on. 

But I can’t help that I feel really shitty inside.

After going on a few dates with this guy, we were messaging and hanging out lots and it seemed like things were going pretty well. 

Then, he goes away on vacation for 3 weeks - we keep loosely in touch through messenger during this time, chatting and sending pics of our days.

He gets back into town, and he's still texting me but not asking to hang out. So a couple days later I message him (admittedly at 10pm at night) to ask him if he wants to hang out. I end up going to his house and staying the night. In the morning he's acting weird and distant, so I leave, and tell him to let me know when he wants to hang out again.

I spend the next couple of days angsting about what to do. Should I text him fun stuff? Should I ignore him completely? It feels like something has changed and he's not interested anymore, or is going off me. I feel shaky and sweaty and have a nauseous knot in my stomach... it feels awful. I don't want him to think I'm needy, or clingy, or desperate.....

So tonight I shoot him a chill message in one final attempt to gauge how he is feeling without actually asking outright. He replies, but without any actual effort to contribute to the conversation like he used to— it seems like he's responding out of obligation rather than any actual genuine desire to talk with me.

At this point I'm sick of my own thoughts are going round and round, and how I'm rationalising and derationalising every message of his like it's fricken game of thrones.... So I finally just cut through all the bullshit and the overthinking and send him a message saying ""Hey, I'm sort of getting the vibe that you're not super interested in whatever this is anymore - allgood if so, just let me know.""

And folks, I'm writing to tell you it feels like a great weight has been lifted off my chest and i feel **really fucking powerful** **💪💪💪**. I have said my piece now and he can do what he will with that information, and honestly, I will continue to live my life either way.
