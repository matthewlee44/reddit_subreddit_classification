I'm seeing a lot more stories lately on Tik Tok and even around reddit subs where both women and men are going to meet their Hinge dates, and they go to the place only for the person to unmatch them as soon as they get there or receive a rude message saying they're not going to meet them because of some insulting physical characteristic. In some cases, it's catfishers doing it to men, but in other instances, it's usually oddly attractive men who who will facetime ahead of time with these women, lead them on, and then ditch them once the women get to the place, probably because they are carrying out revenge for the fact other women rejected them.

It's always been a problem, but it seems like it's becoming a growing problem, perhaps because people are seeing these stories spread on social media and thinking to themselves, ""I'm going to try that just to fuck with someone."" It also seems to be happening more on Hinge as well, which usually use to be a safer place, but now has more and more fake problems on it as it's grown in popularity.

Just a fair warning. If it feels too good to be true, it probably is.

27F, been on and off the dating apps for years. I’ve complained to my mother enough and she has always reassured me that I just haven’t found the right one, been hearing this since I was 21. I feel like I could have been in a relationship or at least “dated” if I went for the guys that have pursued me. However, I got tired of the ones I didn’t like back approaching me and have decided to use bumble. I’ve met up with two guys and didn’t feel them either. It’s only been twice BUT like I said I tried the other apps for years. My life has always been the ones I want don’t want me back/aren’t serious and the ones that like me I don’t want back. My mom says that she really loved my dad and she’s been with her current boyfriend for years but I just don’t get the appeal of either of them (seeing them as if I don’t know them or aren’t related to them). She says she didn’t settle but I just don’t get how you aren’t settling if you aren’t physically attracted to the person. I do feel I will genuinely end up alone, rather be alone vs being taken and miserable. Not that this matters but I don’t really have an active sex drive, I don’t enjoy masturbating and haven’t had sex in years. I saw someone very briefly 3 years ago and while he had a decent personality, I wasn’t physically attracted to him. That was my closest to a relationship, you’re seriously telling me I haven’t been able to find anyone since? It’s like the universe is telling me I can’t do any better, I have never even introduced anyone to my family going on 30. Social anxiety is something I deal with but not that much of a contributing factor.

We were pretty much happy the entire time at least from my point of view and from what she said. We were exclusive. Now we had this 3 day argument over me not replying to her fast enough. Now you need to understand I have college 3 days a week not to mention the time I have to spend on college work outside of my classes. I also have a part time job. As soon as I'm free basically the first thing I do is reply to her. I try to reply to her as much as possible but when I don't and its been a couple hours she always replies something sarcastic and passive aggressive such as ""4 hour reply....."" etc etc.

Regardless of that I care about her a lot and it really hurt when she ended things but I understood and respected her decision.

She made it clear we were over so I thought I may as well block her just to move on. Its been almost a month since that happened and she constantly tries to contact me on things she's not blocked on instagram, tiktok etc . She'll randomly just message me ""hey"" or tell me what she's doing.

I am trying to move on yet every single time she texts me I feel myself upset because I did really care about her and do miss her. I don't know her intentions in why she keeps doing this. I've told her that I don't want to be friends with her and she doesn't seem interested in getting back together from what I can tell at least.

so I just began to talk to this other girl and we got along very well. We were only talking for a couple days when my ex texts me and when she found out I was starting to talk to someone else she told me how sorry she was for ending it and she thinks about me a lot. Now I interpreted this in her wanting to try the relationship again (tell me if I interpreted it wrong) so we start having normal conversations and I stopped talking to the other girl. after a couple days I say If we are we should do things differently and she acts like she did not mean get back together. So now I'm confused the other girl I was getting along with is now gone because I basically dropped her and ghosted her thinking my ex was talking about getting back together after saying that.

I really enjoyed talking to the other girl but now I've left her on delivered for almost 10 days. She triple texted me to see what happened to me but now I just feel like shit for ghosting her and feel embarrassed to reply after this amount of time but it sucks because we really got along. Yet I still miss my ex a lot and she even texted me today a picture of her and her friend (female friend) at the restaurant we always went too saying ""our place :("" why is she doing this.

We are in the same social group and hang out regularly. I have had a crush on her since I met her, but the timing was never right to ask her out (I wasn’t in the best version of myself, she had a crush on my friend for a while who is not interested in her, I had been getting over a bad break up, was concerned about awkwardness in our friend group… lots of excuses blah blah blah). In the last couple years I started working out, got a good job, bought a house, and traveled. Only occasionally seeing this girl. In the last 6 months or so we have texted more frequently, flirted some and grew a little closer. She would sit on my lap or next to me in group settings, share drinks/food, and put her arms around me. After getting some liquid courage one night I pulled her aside and asked her if she would like to go out just the two of us the following weekend, making it clear it was a date. She seemed surprised at my ask(which I didn’t understand?) and politely told me our relationship has always been about friendship for her and hoped their were no hard feelings. I was heartbroken(but didn’t let that show), but mustered up a smile and said no worries.  That was 3 months ago, and I’ve distanced myself from her. We no longer text and only see each other in group settings, though I still have feelings for her. We were both invited to a mutual friends cabin(about 15 people) and this girl wants to bring a guy she has been seeing recently(apparently everyone else in the group knew about this guy, but it was kept from me). Undoubtedly I will have to watch this girl flirt/kiss this guy all weekend and be miserable. How should I handle it? 

If I were not to go, my friends would be disappointed. If I go, I would probably want to be anywhere else.

One trend I’ve noticed with particularly the white men I’ve encountered, is that they are not so open minded. 

This one white man that I met who I decided to give a try is 27, and I’m about to turn 21. Typically, I stay within the ages of 21-25, but he was very attractive and had a lot going for him, so of course I’m going to be interested. He was also pretty good at communicating and our conversations flowed well. 

Last night, I arrived to his apartment and he said the restaurant he chose was a surprise. It was an upscale “Mexican” restaurant. 

I didn’t complain, although I started to feel a weird feeling in my stomach of uncertainty. The familiar feeling of “oh my goodness, it’s happening again”. I ignored it and put a smile on my face. 

As we waited on our food to arrive, he started talking about how much he loves Bad Bunny. I laughed, wondering if he said it to spike my interest. But no, he genuinely knows all of Bad Bunny’s songs. 

He knows more bad bunny songs than I do. And even went to his concert. And has his t shirts. 

He starts asking me what some of the words mean since he assumes I know Spanish. Which I do, but I wasn’t going to dinner to be a translator. I still translate some anyway. 

I sit back and analyze what he orders. He made a good choice. I stick to the seafood portion of the menu since I’m so used to eating Mexican food already and prefer to get out of my comfort zone. 

The food wasn’t that great. At least I tried it. 

As awkward as I felt, I kept the conversation flowing with him. We start telling stories of bad dating experiences and all. And then i noticed the trend of dating he was pursuing.

He only has gone out with Latinas.

I look at his blonde hair and then back down at his blue eyes, and I stay silent for a moment. 

I ask him why he hasn’t tried any other “flavors” in dating and he says “ I really like Latinas”. 

He grew up in an area with mostly only white people and ever since he moved to Florida, and then Texas, he “knew” what he liked. 

He then mentioned to me that he wanted to take dancing classes and learn bachata. I like to dance so I like that he was making the effort to try and dance also. 

But, overall, I don’t know if I should take his preferences as a compliment or as a red flag.

I’m here for holiday and he’s doing his master degree. We came from different country, I’m Indonesian and he’s from Nepal.
We met just for 4 hours and i was drunk at that time so we had sex, but he didn’t back off after that. We talked through text and decided to go on a date in the weekend. We spend lots of fun since afternoon until midnight and then i spent a night in his place. We did that again.
Everything went so smooth. We met 4 times. I can feel that this relationship could be serious or something like that, so i confessed to him. I told him that i like him and would fight for us, and he said.. he just see me as a friend.
The reason why i confessed to him because i don’t do kind of relationship like friends with benefit or stuffs like that. I hate the feeling when i have to figure out which steps that i should take to make things clear. I like him and i feel like we could be a great couple.
He told me that this relationship is making him confused with himself. He told me that this is the first time for him, to get involved with someone without feelings, and that’s a thing that he never felt before. Like, he needs sometimes for himself to think and maybe he’s a bit overwhelmed due to lots of projects that he has to do.
I feel really sad. So i told him, if that’s what he wants, then i’ll make a boundary between us.
I’m going back to Indonesia this weekend and today we met. I tried to control myself. Not touching him like how i used to. I became a bit careless of him. But I’m faking it.
I feel so confused when we’re going back home. He hugged me multiple times, grabbed my hands, embraced me, he even said “you looks so pretty”, and i was like “..okay.. thanks” cuz i just didn’t understand..

He will drop me off to the airport this weekend. He also said that he will find free time so he can see me the day before I’m going home.

I just don’t know what to do. I like him. Why is he being like that? I mean, why, after 4 dates, he told me that he can’t have a relationship with me and also just seeing me as a friend. AND WHY he treated me like that after the confession.. i don’t understand.

Well, he just broke up a while ago. Same cases. Different religion and race, also.. Different country as well.

You never know how simple life was before you start crushing on people, worrying if someone is taken, or worry about multiple people wanting to go out with you. The dating game is seriously not worth it, and you will not be able to get out of it so easily once your in it. Even if people think you are lonely just because your single, just think about all the peace and simplicity that comes with living as if dating didn’t exist. It’s seriously not worth the trouble that comes with having a crush, or ex partner. If you find yourself flirting with someone, remember to hang out with someone else to forget it even happened. Remember that cheating doesn’t exist if you don’t want a relationship with someone in the first place. People will more likely listen to you if you say that you wanted to stay single instead of saying you wanted anyone else. This is why you will never be able to enjoy how peaceful life is before you start getting into dating and sex after you decide to play life that way. If you enjoy dating then that’s fine, just please do not ruin the peace that the single people or people that have never dated are trying to keep.

I have been in two major relationships in my life - the first with a friend of mine from high school who I have been on and off with since junior year, and the second (lasted about a year) with a guy I met off of Tinder during one of my “off” periods with my high school ex. Needless to say, both of these relationships were unhealthy in their own ways; the first lacking any sort of commitment or stability and the second rife with mistrust due to the fact that my high school ex is in my friend group. In all honesty, I can’t even say for sure if I’ve ever been in love. As of about a month ago, I decided that if I want to be successful in dating I need to change my situation. So, even though my ex has always been a good friend of mine and remains in my friend group, I needed to cut him out of my life for good. I blocked him (after breaking things off in person) and left the friend group chat. I have hung out with some of my friends in this group since then and they are aware of the situation, and for now I only plan to hang with them as long as my ex is not there. 

Fast forward to today. I still have days where I miss my ex, mainly because we really were just such good friends and he encompassed so much of my life, but also partly because I think I enjoy being with someone in general to stave off loneliness/boredom. I initially had the goal of remaining single for a while - I’ve been focusing on school, working out, and spending time doing activities I enjoy. In general I would say I’ve been happy. So then here comes the confusing part. I recently reconnected with a guy who, funnily enough, went to my middle school. I didn’t really know him back then and the only reason we found each other now is because I happened to see him at a local event in our hometown (actually prior to ending things with my FWB). I had always found him attractive, and the brief interaction was so lovely I ended up asking for his number through a friend of a friend later that week. I didn’t really have any intention behind it, I just enjoyed talking to him and wanted to see where the conversation would lead. In retrospect, I suppose this was not the smartest idea.

We’ve hung out four times now and at this point I just don’t know what to do. They were phrased as hangouts, not dates specifically, although from the beginning they had the undertones of a date (i.e. him paying for me). From the beginning, I made it clear I don’t really know if I’m looking to be in a relationship and he was okay with that; I even told him about my high school ex still being in my current friend group and he didn’t appear phased, he just asked if I planned on going back to my ex again and after I said no he told me he wasn’t worried. I am assuming the reason for his quick-to-trust nature is that he has never been in a relationship, and hasn’t really had much experience with women in general from what he’s disclosed to me. It’s really shocking to me that he hasn’t pursued anyone seriously yet as I would say he is definitely conventionally attractive. He has even told me stories of girls blatantly trying to flirt with him in public, but he just wasn’t into them. And to top it off, he is probably one of the sweetest guys I’ve met - he’s just gone above and beyond to make me feel special in the short time we’ve been talking. Our dates have been fun and pretty easy going; we talk and laugh the whole time, although he does make me really nervous - moreso than I’ve ever been with a guy before. I find myself thinking about him randomly throughout the day. And I already feel so secure in knowing that he’s interested in me, so there is no guessing. Our last hangout was an official date and he kissed me goodbye and it left me feeling giddy. I haven’t had a crush this bad on anyone in years, not even at the start of my second relationship.

But, even though I may feel this way right now, I also recognize that I may not be mentally ready to jump into another relationship, let alone with someone like him. I am afraid his naivety to dating is blinding him from seeing the baggage I would be bringing into a potential relationship. Part of me is also afraid I only feel this way as a coping mechanism to stay away from my ex. My past dating experience in general has sort of cultivated a mindset in which I really struggle to open up, both romantically and intimately. I am not really used to receiving or giving sweet things, and cutesy gestures, even in private, have always been hard for me, even if I picture these things in my “dream” relationship. Basically, I just don’t want to fuck up this guy’s first dating experience as he seems like such a good, kind-hearted person. I honestly don’t feel good enough for him. I also don’t want to depend on being in a relationship to be happy, and I am afraid not taking some time to just be single will prevent me from growing as a person.  Finally, since I have cut things off with my longterm FWB so recently, I feel extremely guilty pursuing anything with this new guy. Should I end things before it gets more serious? 

TLDR; I have really struggled in past relationships and I don’t know if I’m ready to be in a new one. I really like this guy, but he’s new to dating and I feel like I’m gonna ruin this if I pursue it further.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162945,public,self,I feel so guilty,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t876tb/i_feel_so_guilty/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

If you don't know what gynecomastia is, it's essentially man breasts that are a result of your hormones getting out of control when you're going through puberty. Sometimes they go away on their own, or in my case, they're permanent until you get surgery to fix them. 

I told myself I wouldn't date anyone until I got the surgery, and that was like 7 years ago now. I've never dated and I've intentionally shot down any potential dating opportunities because I'm afraid of taking my shirt off in front of anybody. I haven't been swimming since I was maybe 16 years old. I wear an uncomfortable compression vest every day to hide it, which actually works quite well, but I know what's going on under my shirt and vest and I feel disgustingly ugly and unworthy of pursuing any women I find attractive. In the summer I sweat profusely all day because I'm typically wearing a shirt under the compression vest, and then another shirt on top of both of those. If I wear a polo shirt over top of the vest, it's actually pretty much impossible to tell that I have man-breasts underneath. 

I'm hopefully getting the surgery either this year or the next, but I just needed somewhere to vent because it's been so lonely and frustrating not being able to date anybody, especially being in my early-to-mid-20s.

English is not my main language and im currently using a phone.

Im pretty shy and introverted guy, and i dont have really that much confidence in myself since im bigger guy (190cm tall, 125kg). You might say that ""go to the gym and lose weight"". I would do it, but that means that i would have to go the army. You probably think that ""Hey, thats great, you lose weight and make some friends"". Yeah true, but that also would mean that i would lose my job, which means there is no possible way to pay my car loan. This year should be my last time at the army health checkup thing, after that i should be free from it.

I(20M) used to have and still have a crush on my old classmate(20F), we havent talked since 4 years or something like that. We used to go out with our group of friends or chill at my place pretty much every evening (the girl i have crush on was mostly the one who asked if we could go to my place etc). We finished high school in 2017 summer.

 I stopped going out with them because of my injury (broken shoulder-arm joint or whatever it is), and after some time passed and i still didnt go out with them, they kicked me from that group, including a few others who stopped going out. I havent spoken to some of them for the last 4 years (I still talk with some of the boys, including the one who kicked me. He told me pretty much that since i didnt go out with them, then why am i in the group, he told me there was no hate, and it didnt really matter also that much for me, since everyone went their own path, who went to study something else and who got a job).

Im kind of shy, i never post any pics or info of myself anywhere, i just feel really awkward. I recently downloaded tinder (with fake name, just to see who are using tinder near me etc), there was that same girl in tinder, and i dont know what to do. It just feels weird for me to make real tinder profile and swipe her right because tinder is pretty much ""hey, wanna date?"" kind of thing. Ofcourse i would like to date her, but i would like to start talking with her first etc, but it also feels really awkward to just message her on messenger or something since we havent spoken in so long.

I have seen her sometimes around the city, when driving past her or something, and i cannot get her out of my head. I literally keep thinking about her. Ofcourse ive had thoughts of her before, but now they have gone pretty crazy. Thinking about her got literally so bad that its difficult for me to even fall asleep, doesnt matter what time i go to bed, i still fall sleep around 3am, and i need to wake up around 5.30 am, so im really messed up at work.

I met a guy on bumble, he was persistent in talking to me even though I had doubts I was ready to date and expressed that. We ended up hanging out about 7 times, very affectionate, sleepovers, flowers on Valentine’s Day. Then he got into a depressive episode and I didn’t see him for 2.5 weeks. Even when he started feeling better he saw his friends instead and didn’t try to see me. I missed him , he claimed he missed me but didn’t seem to care. We texted every single day, he always initiated good morning texts. When he didn’t say anything about seeing me by the weekend when we had talked about having a date then, and instead saw family and friends it hurt. I finally decided to end it and say it’s not working. He very easily agreed and said he understands and we are in two different places. That confirmed my suspicions that he didn’t really care to see me again as he was getting more distant. I asked what he means by that and he gave me a explanation that he felt obligated to keep talking to me to keep me happy even though he mentioned he isolates during his sad times and I deserve someone that doesn’t make empty promises etc. 
I responded to say I had no idea he felt that way because I had even told him during that time I hope you don’t feel obligated to keep texting and just let me know when you need a break. And he was the one that kept initiating texting. It just didn’t make sense. 
It’s been almost 2 days now and he hasn’t opened that message even though he is talking to other people on Snapchat. It is really painful that it’s clear I’m forgotten and so easily done with when I liked him and was developing feelings, the conversation wasn’t over but he seems to have made it over by ignoring me. 
I keep going back and forth if I should just delete that message or just delete him completely off my Snapchat. I admit there’s a part of me that hopes he will talk to me again, maybe even just as friends which makes me feel pathetic.

I've gone on a few dates in the past few months, and talked a to a few girls I find I really liked. I find that these experiences all end in the same tragic way... with zero closure.

I am a simple man, and I enjoy talking about anything in the open. I'm sure that guys are just as bad with this, but all of the girls I have talked to / dated in the past month either ghost me, put in zero effort, or avoid talking about complex feelings (and issues) all together. 

I give... I give... and I give some more. Yet, no one wants to give back. I have not found a single person who matches my standard of resolve, or is able to address feelings and complex issues in open air. 

Story with a recent experience: 

|I guess what really broke me inside is my most recent dating experience I had with a nice girl (19f). We hit it off on Bumble, and hit it off on the first date (I picked her up after work, we smoked, and made good conversation). I even took her on a second date, which went pretty well. We talked about going on a third; She wanted to come over, cuddle, movies, sushi, blah blah blah. Cute stuff.  For whatever reason, she never texted me to pick her up and stood me up completely that night. A few days later I told her I wanted to see her again so we could talk about things -- *So that I could get closure on the situation!* Now listen... she even AGREED and LIKED the idea that we should meet up once more. Then, she never responded to my text on the day of, and I haven't seen her since. I've been so delusional up until this point (its been a week or so), that just now I finally forced myself to remove her contact.|

I guess my question is... is anyone else out there dealing with the same thing? Male or female? 

I just want to find a respectable human being out there... but dating is just such a terrible grind...

I’m 20 now and pretty social and talk to a lot of people and meet a lot of women but none have ever liked me in that way. I don’t seem to have a problem getting people to like my personality platonically, so I’m pretty dead set on it being my physical appearance.
I have been bullied and mocked by friends, bullies, and family for the way I look all my life. So I know that’s been a roadblock.

I’ve done a lot of self improvement since I first started trying my luck with women but I really feel like most of it is overlooked because of the way I look.

I’m at a crossroads now where I’m unsure if it’s even logically sound to continue trying. In the last 20 years not one girl has taken an interest in me. So why would one all of the sudden do it now? It’s like I’ve been playing the same game for 20 years and I haven’t gotten one measly point.

He's extremely handsome, blue eyes and nice hair and teeth, he has the best body shape ever, he's also tall. Anyways, I saw him a lot in the gym (and I liked him since then) but we started talking two weeks ago, and he initiated it. 

He began by placing his phone and jacket next to the machine I work out on, without saying a word. Then slowly by days, he on purpose starting working out next to me and tell me (I will work out on this too so we can do it together) with a big smile. And then we say Hi and bye without anything further. 

Last week, he started to interfere more in my work out, he started asking me what will I work out today and how's my diet and these stuff, briefly, he started making conversations.

Next thing I know, he started teasing me in a playful way, he once saw me by chance after me not going for the gym for 5 days because I was busy and he literally smiled from ear to ear and asked me (with excitement) where have you been? You didn't come for 5 days, are you calling this a work out? I laughed, and then again we kept on talking, and he kept asking me personal stuff about my life, like where did I graduate from and what do I do in my life and bla bla bla, and I told him sometimes I don't come because I take german course, he was very impressed, and when we finished, I knew his name and he knew mine. And we promised each other to come on time every 3 days so we could meet and work out together. 

Today, something very strange happened. First of all, the very first thing he told me was how are you in german, and he introduced himself in german, and then he grabbed his phone telling me ""I am still studying and I will beat you off""... I kept on laughing, it was so cute.. and when we talk, he directly looks to me in the eye. The strange thing was, when I was about to finish my workout, he told me, you know what.... you remind me alot of my friend, I haven't seen ""him"" in 7 years. I told him I remind you of your ""guy"" friend? He laughed and said, ""believe me i don't mean it in that way, but the way you talk and laugh and your jokes and even the way you look"" (???) I was really turned off and I told him ""wow okay"" with a semi smile and I walked away, I haven't say goodbye to him this time and I went home.

What's his deal? Does he even like me?
