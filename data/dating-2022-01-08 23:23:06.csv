0,rzkcvi,1641705946,Ever feel torn about someone you like because of their age?,"   I (29F) met and developed a big crush on someone (now 21M) last year. We coincidentally share similar friends, have been to the same MMA training years back (I barely remember) and our family knows each other pretty well. I assumed he was older based off appearance and conversations. I was such an idiot for not to even thinking about his age at the time, so I found out months into getting to know him. For background on him: he is an athlete (fighter) who also hits the weights at my gym. We both have the same interest in MMA apparently. He followed me by accident to 2 different gyms, basically. We didn't know or speak before at the previous MMA gym. 
    

   Problem is.. I still like him. I just recently saw him again after a long time and cannot stop thinking of him. I just can't unlike him. I have simply avoided him after discovering he was too young for me. I was shamed when I asked my friends about this, so the feeling of being a creep was enough for me. I know he likes me because it has been plain obvious. He has told someone, everyone else noticed how he looks at me, has flirted with me, gets shy, shows body language and has been protective over me. 

  When I found out he was only 20, all I could do was sit with my head down and laugh at myself. I had given up on dating/love for a long time. Then I gave it another try ONE TIME and it ended up being the worst mistake. I was sexually assaulted, stalked, and robbed by the last person I was seeing. He then murdered his gf after me and is in jail currently. So this young crush was the first person I found a sense of connection, respect and safety from after that incident. He does not know of the incident and how happy he made me. I met him a month after that incident. I know I don't know him 100%, but I felt so weirdly connected to him. I'm always thinking the worst about people, but not him. I never had a bad vibe from him, which is unusual. Of course I have felt strong connections with people before, but never this perfect. It's hard to explain. It felt like a movie romance about to happen. I don't believe in the whole soul mates thing. Maybe I have lost my mind and created a fantasy that there is someone right for me? I don't know. 

   We talked for a little bit when i saw him. We were both super nervous, but I approached him. I am still very happy thinking back to that day and also very ashamed that I cannot stop thinking of him.

  Anyway during our last conversation, he was so shocked to see me that he lost his train of thought when talking. After saying our akward goodbyes, he kept moving to where I could see him. So I looked one last time before leaving. He had the saddest, heartbroken, wounded puppy face I had ever seen while looking directly at me. Looked like he wanted to talk more and didn't want me to go. I had to take my mom to the super market before closing, so I wasn't leaving on spite. She was getting cranky and rushing me to drive her. 

    Anyone have a similar situation? I feel wrong no matter which direction I take. Date him? I feel like a creep. Don't date him? I could be missing out on a really good thing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzkcvi/ever_feel_torn_about_someone_you_like_because_of/
1,rzkeip,1641706111,Do no try to dance with someone without talking to them,"This has happened to me and other women I've been out with several times and I just think it's weird lol.

I'll be dancing and all of the sudden a guy will slowly inch closer to me and/or my friend and try to act inconspicuous about it. We see you making very small steps getting closer and closer... If you look their way sometimes they will try to not make eye contact to act like they aren't noticing you, but we already caught them looking at us several times!

The weirdest one was last night I was alone in a crowd dancing to a band and was shoulder to shoulder with a guy. I took my jacket off and he all of the sudden turned his body to face me and just stared at me taking it off. I kept taking it off and just stared directly into his eyes for like 30+ seconds and he said nothing then just started dancing facing me and kept looking at me. I just kept facing forward after that and he eventually left.

Just greet me or say something before invading my space. Don't stare at me blankly or try to act all coy. It's not.

2,rzkeuk,1641706141,I constantly feel neglected,"Long story short: I‚Äôve had problems with my boyfriend about him not listening to what i my problems are and that ended up me being less vulnerable and lead to some level of trust issues. 

My bf (22m) and i(19f) have been in a relationship for 7 months and since we started dating I‚Äôve felt that he doesn‚Äôt consider my problems seriously, long story short I still feel like this but now even worse to a point where even in a conversation I don‚Äôt feel like my voice is heard, this has developed into a trauma and each time he cuts me out while talking i lash out. Examples that I‚Äôve him, don‚Äôt do it because it hurts me and he doesn‚Äôt listen
1. Don‚Äôt tell me to go find someone else
2. Don‚Äôt interrupt me while I‚Äôm talking 
3. Listen to what problems i have and resolve them! 
4. If i talk about my past be supportive and not say something like no details 
5. Don‚Äôt leave in between of a fight instead say you‚Äôll take some time off rather than blatantly hanging up. 

So these are the problems I have which I know he doesn‚Äôt consider something big but it ended up being so traumatic for me and due to all of this its like im resenting him and im not completely vulnerable with him. Ended up having some trust issues. 

Edit: i spoke to him he said he‚Äôll listen to me. He said he can fail sometimes since he‚Äôs not perfect and i end up telling him he doesn‚Äôt do anything, i told him I‚Äôm not crazy to feel like way for atleast a week now and even after repeatedly telling him not to do it then i guess I‚Äôm not expecting something really big. By the end of this conversation he said he‚Äôll try and if that still is a problem then I should leave. 

What the fuck should i do if telling him something ended up in me being the bad guy? As if i have no say in this relationship!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzkeuk/i_constantly_feel_neglected/
3,rzklmw,1641706834,Wasn‚Äôt confident on the first date.,"Hi I‚Äôm 32F. I just had a date with a guy I was talking to for a couple weeks online (and had FaceTimed once before meeting). I think the date went pretty well ‚Äî laughter from both, some deep conversation, some interests and goals in common ‚Äî but I was so damn nervous and self-conscious. I felt pretty out of my element at times. 

Normally I‚Äôm a pretty confident person, witty, funny. But in a dating scenario when I feel like when I‚Äôm opening up or allowing myself to be a bit vulnerable I just get very timid. And, ngl, some of the deep convo was maybe bringing up anxiety because my past (and only) relationship was one in which I was criticized/ignored for just sharing my thoughts. I was also criticized heavily for not having much dating/relationship experience (I was 27-30 when we were together. He was 11 years older. I‚Äôm now 32). 

I don‚Äôt know it if the nerves were because I‚Äôm actually interested in this guy, I‚Äôm on my period, I have baggage, or just my lack of dating experience‚Ä¶. But how do y‚Äôall feel when you sense self-consciousness or nervousness on a first date? Is it a complete turnoff or understandable? He was generally empathetic but that just seemed like his personality (üëçüèæ) and I couldn‚Äôt gauge his interest. 

I ask because it‚Äôs been a couple days and there hasn‚Äôt been any communication from either of us (which I think is fine? because I don‚Äôt want to communicate with anxiety) but I would like to see him again. I am in therapy, but my therapist doesn‚Äôt give advice so I‚Äôm asking here. Should I re-connect, wait for him to say something , or forget the dating and keep ‚Äúworking on myself‚Äù? It seems like all my self-work falls apart when it comes to dating. 

I would just appreciate some other perspectives. My only reference point is an unhealthy relationship/rejection from the emotionally unavailable.  I would really like to be in a healthy one, but I don‚Äôt know how those go in the initial stages.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzklmw/wasnt_confident_on_the_first_date/

We hit it off, went on a date, and I asked him what drew him to me, since he's constantly surrounded by beautiful girls. He said my appeal to him was that unlike the other girls at the club, I wasn't sloppy or throwing myself at him. We hung out a couple times since then. However, last night I went to the club with him where he works and I had a little bit too much to drink. I'm a very affectionate drunk and started getting very touchy and he was like, I'm working. Then he texted me today that he felt ""annoyed, overwhelmed and agitated"" from ""being touched all night."" I apologized and said I didn't intend to make him feel that way, and he just never responded. I think I just turned him off completely but I can't change what happened?

And I‚Äôm single again. 

He‚Äôs a guy from high school. He told me he‚Äôs always had a crush on me, and thanks I‚Äôm so beautiful. We talked for three weeks and he texted me all day every day about things he wanted to do in the future and that how he thinks we would make a great couple and lots of lovey-dovey stuff like that. I kept turning him down to actually meet up because I was out of town but finally when I got back I agreed because he has been very nice to me and I‚Äôm finally single again and I thought what the heck. Well, turns out he‚Äôs actually a super sweet guy and I kind of like him back. A lot. We went out again two days after that and also had a great time. I asked if he was seeing anybody else and he told me he wasn‚Äôt and that he likes to focus on one person at the same time and he‚Äôs very interested in me and where this is going. So we ended on a good note. But now it‚Äôs been two days and radio silence. 

What gives? Is it because his fantasy finally came true that I liked him back that now he‚Äôs just bored and uninterested? He even brought a gift to our first date and bought a bottle of wine. It‚Äôs just so crazy to me that he can love bomb me for the past few years basically tell me how beautiful I am and text me nonstop and then I show a little bit of interest back and he‚Äôs cold and quiet. 

I‚Äôve tried texting him today twice casually and no response. Is it OK to call his bluff? He did tell me after all that I was the only person he was talking to and that this is going somewhere. So why would he do this? Please any advice would be appreciated. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to connect with him so well and I would‚Äôve definitely gave him a chance earlier if I hadn‚Äôt been in a relationship or getting over a relationship the past few times he had asked me out. But now I am confused on the way he is acting. What should I do? It‚Äôs literally like a 360¬∞ shift between how he was last week and how he is now. It makes absolutely no sense.

14,rzlh6n,1641710224,Am I over thinking this? What does his text mean? Good or bad? Help!,"Am I over thinking this? What does he mean by this text? Opinions needed.

I have been dating a guy for about one month now. He is super sweet, genuine and I really enjoy my time with him. I feel a natural connection with him and I have the feeling AND he is giving me the impression that this is more than something casual. 

He has been very busy at work and he has had to bail on me twice now for good reasons. He is always very apologetic and wants to re-plan a day to get together immediately to which he follows through. He has always drove to my town to see me and he always initiates the next hang out. He is very sweet to me even in text with lots of hearts and very thoughtful messages with none of them being half assed. 

The last couple times we were together it was very passionate and he was very affectionate with me. We have been kinda dancing around saying that we are seeing each other/not seeing anyone else. 

He is off work right now due to the new shutdowns in Ontario. I was looking forward to having solid time to hangout some because our schedules kinda clash. 

We had plans to hang out tonight and one hour before he bailed. He texted me explaining that, long story short, he was at his cottage that his dad and stepmother live at and they are pretty concerned about Covid right now. They don‚Äôt want him doing a lot of back and fourth during his time off without doing rapid tests which are hard to find right now. He said he was so sorry to hit me up with this last minute and that he didn‚Äôt get to do half the stuff he wanted to do there over the weekend and would love the opportunity to stay until Thursday but will come back if I want. With a couple heart emojis in the text. 

I gotta be honest I was kinda annoyed because I felt kind of sad that he would rather be at his cottage than spending time with me because we are new and it‚Äôs still really exciting. I replied back that it was clear he wanted to spend the time at the cottage so no worries and maybe we weren‚Äôt on the same page but that I really hope he enjoys his time and gets some woodworking done. I realized pretty soon after that my message came across cold, compared to how we normally text, so I texted him saying I apologize if that came across cold with a heart. He replied:

you have NOTHING to be sorry about, cold or not its totally justified, I deserve it. Me chosing to stay at the cottage was helllllllaa selfish and I'm really sorry about thatüòî you deserve better honesty... you might be right about that, maybe we can figure it out in person when I'm home?‚ù§ thanks for saying that, your Hella selfless and I don't deserve that! 

I did end up replying:

Honestly, I don't think choosing to stay at the cottage is selfish of you. I want you to do what makes you happy and for you to stay true to yourself üòå I certainly don't think I deserve better, that's silly! I really really enjoy spending time with you! ‚ù§Ô∏èYeah I think when you are home it will be good to figure that out in person but no stress or anything. I have been wondering how you've been feeling about everything. 


This is what this post is about. Can you guys help me dissect the last Text from him? Do you think this is good or bad news he wants to talk in person about being on the same page. He did say ‚Äúyou might be right about that‚Äù to being not on the same page? But at the same time why would he want to meet in person to talk about that and include a heart. 

I have my head in a mess because I truly think him and I have something good going on. He has really shown me that he is interested and I don‚Äôt know what to make of this message. I have to wait an entire week to have this conversation with him so I‚Äôm posting on here to put myself at ease.

For the past year and a half, I‚Äôve built myself back up and improved myself to be the best man possible. I‚Äôve excelled in life these past 2 years, academically, personally, and professionally. I‚Äôm so happy with my life right now and where I‚Äôm at.

I tried to flirt with one but it end up ugly coz I didn't filter what I say and feel. So the girl gets uncomfortable when I'm around and when she left, all of her friends hated me. Now one girl hates me whenever I'm around and it's inevitable (we're living in the same apartment). I  initiate to start a convo but I only get two or three words for an answer. I always greet her every time but no responses most of the time and it feels like I wasn't there. It hurts a lot thou. I asked her why is she so mean and she told me she hates my presence. Her reason is so shallow and I know it's not the main reason. I do like her especially when she smiles but when I'm with her all I feel is pure sour. I'm chasing pavements right now. I'd like to drink with her to understand how she really feels. Also, asked her to give me a second chance where I can date her. I NEED YOUR ANSWERS ON WHAT TO DO.

27,rzm9aa,1641713320,date again?,"Hi Reddit! So I (23M) started dating a girl (22F) early 2021. We lived in the same town, met through a mutual friend and started dating during Covid (no dinners, party's or activities). We hit it off in the beginning and it went well!

Unfortunately we started dating too serious too soon. The effect of that was that I wasn't able to be my energetic and funny self (I was too serious and not my funny self).

After dating for a while, she really wanted to fall in love with me (her words were: I really want to fall in love with you, you are such a good person, you look so good and you really stand for all the values that I stand for as well!). But she also told me that she wasn't feeling the true spark after 6 or 7 dates and normally she would feel that spark after that time. She was thinking so much about why she wasn't falling in love with me that it stressed her out a lot. We agreed that it wasn't our time and we ended the dating. (After that, we had little contact and two weeks later she was texting me very drunk and asked her friends to call me because she needed my help when she was drunk, which was kinda cute and a good sign I guess).

So that was in the beginning of 2021. Beginning of september 2021 we went for a drink again and it was lots of fun. I decided to take it super slow because I didn't want to hurry it. We agreed to go for another drink. Due to circumstances (both new studies which was super busy) we didn't speak for a while and it took some time to schedule our new date. After a while (1,5/2 months) we had contact again and she told me that after that drink in August she also wanted to explore it more because she also felt that it was more than just friends but she met someone new and started talking to that guy and it was against her values to also go on a date with me at the same time (which I wouldn't do myself either). 

Now, a few months later, what do I do?....hahahaha. To be honest, I really want this to work out! I'm not a native English speaker so It's hard to tell the story correctly here but she really is a person with a heart of gold, has no bad intentions and I fully believe and trust everything she said! I don't want to waste this oppurtunity. I don't know if she is still dating that guy but is it the time to send here a message or not, and if so, what shall I send her?

I want start dating her again and show here my energetic, crazy and funny side! I'm an attractive guy with enough attention from other girls but I want to explore this opportunity further.

29,rzmevo,1641713950,Ayyye I got asked out for like the first time,"Okay so let me start by saying that I started working at a small food store in my town about a year or so ago. At the time I had just broken up with my boyfriend, and was just figuring things out again on my own. My coworker has a friend that would stop by every so often, and honestly the second I saw him, I was like yep he‚Äôs definitely attractive. But I kept that shit in check because 1. He‚Äôs my coworkers friend and 2. I just got out of a relationship that left me emotionally recked. 
 
As I said, it‚Äôs been about a year now and I feel pretty secure in myself. One day my coworker told me that this friend of his, thought I was cute. At the time I mostly just brushed it off and didn‚Äôt say much in response, although I was admittedly flattered. It was nice to have the upper hand of knowing that he likes me. The last few relationships I‚Äôve been through were mostly one sided and I‚Äôve always been the one pursing the other person. So it was really nice to know that he liked me too, because that meant I could at least flirt with him and know I‚Äôm not making myself look stupid. 
Anyway, this guy started coming by more frequently and staying for longer to talk to me. I knew it was to talk to me because he would order a pizza and just let it get cold while he talked to me and watched me clean. I can tell he gets flustered by me, and its the same for me. Tonight, he stuck around for like the last hour of my shift, waited for me to scrape all the ice off my windows, and then asked me to dinner. It was so cute, and I felt so bad because I realized that he was trying to work up the courage to do it a while ago. I realized that because  a while before today, he asked if I‚Äôve had a drink since I‚Äôve turned 21, and I said no because I‚Äôm a recovering alcoholic, and I think he was trying to ask me out for drinks but I totally didn‚Äôt register that at all, until tonight when he said ‚ÄúI know you dont drink, but do you want to come to dinner with me sometime‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI totally accidentally shut him tf down the first timeüòÖüíÄ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzmevo/ayyye_i_got_asked_out_for_like_the_first_time/

We‚Äôve take things at a slow pace (for a few different reasons) and he‚Äôs been very respectful and nice to me. He pays for all our dates (even when I ask to help pay), and we are exclusive. We are both very happy where things are going and it‚Äôll probably turn into a relationship soon. So the issue is between my insomnia/severe light sleeping issue and his bulldog/TV‚Ä¶ I love animals very much but there is a problem. I‚Äôm pretty much cursed that if I don‚Äôt get sleep I literally get sick. I can‚Äôt sleep with any noises, I‚Äôve been this way since I was a kid. His dog honestly sounds like a pig combined with a gremlin, I‚Äôve never ever heard a dog that‚Äôs this loud and constantly making noises all the time. 

So we had sex for the first time tonight, and he has his dog sleeps in his room and it snores really loud. He also sleeps with the TV on. I was trying to not sound dramatic and tried to explain that I have a serious issue with sleep in a light hearted way, but since he‚Äôs a very heavy sleeper (basically knocks out) I don‚Äôt think he understood my perspective at all‚Ä¶ Well, it was getting late and we were both getting tired, he wasn‚Äôt letting up on the idea, so I ended up not saying the night. Driving home I felt frustrated because he wanted me to stay and I wanted to, but he wasn‚Äôt willing to at least try putting his dog outside his room for me. I understand people love their animals like children, but I felt dismissed that he wouldn‚Äôt even try my idea. I‚Äôm not sure how to handle this‚Ä¶ Advice please? I really like this guy and want it to turn into a relationship. We get along very well and I see it definitely developing. But idk what to do about this. Ps.

31,rzmj2q,1641714445,Girl I went out with once ranted about guys she's dating and our date to her friends on Instagram live,"After one really good date ending with sex and a sleepover, I haven't seen this girl I met from a dating app since she left town for the holidays. I thought it was a very good date, we complimented each other a lot, and were talking like we were gonna see each other again. On her way out, I told her to text me when she's back in town. That was December 28.

Last night, she went on Instagram live for over an hour. I didn't connect to the Live because I know she would see that I was watching but I managed to catch the recording on her Instagram page before she deleted it 10 minutes later. I listened to this hour of her speaking with some of her girlfriends about the different guys she went out with from dating apps and then she started describing me and our date (without directly naming me). She said how I called her a nickname she didn't like and stopped herself short before sharing more negative things because ""no that'd be bad."" The rest of the hour she talks about past boyfriends, other icky guys from dating apps, and how she went out with another guy a week after our date.

Now I'm confused and not sure what to do. I romanticized her in my mind and was looking forward to taking her out again when she's back in town, but it feels weird that she would broadcast our date to all her friends on her public Instagram account. I know girls will talk about dates with their girlfriends, but this gave me a weird feeling, especially since she shared things that I didn't realize were negative to her and that she went out with another guy shortly after we had a successful date and some passionate sex.

He said he was now looking for a long term relationship, but was honest and said he went on ‚Äúhookup spree‚Äù when he first started college. Then, he said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really thankful no one has ever accused me of sexual assault, especially in today‚Äôs climate.‚Äù I paused and was speechless for a second. I then said, ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs terrible when false accusations are made because all it does is discredit those who are telling the truth.‚Äù He agreed. Then I changed the topic. 

I regret not digging a little deeper when he made the comment and asking why he would think he would be accused. It sounds like he was implying being falsely accused, but I felt the comment was strange. However, is this a genuine concern men have?

The only similar thing I can think of is being falsely accused of racism, which has happened to me while working in customer service when I don‚Äôt give the customer what they want. I‚Äôm lucky no one has ever tried to get me fired because of it.

35,rzn1vv,1641716625,Reaching my mid-30s and seriously wondering if my ship has sailed,"Long  story short I'm rapidly approaching middle age with no real romantic  experience and wondering if I'm shit out of luck for finding anybody.  Gonna be a long one, I'm old and can't tl;dr this well.

I'm  an autistic, grew up in a pretty broken home in the inner city so was  always terrified of repeating the cycle and becoming someone's baby  daddy if I slept around (girls started getting knocked up in middle  school where I'm from), I didn't even drink until my mid-20s because  when I was younger the smell of alcohol gave me panic attacks.  I wasted my teenage and college years trying to do things the good Christian way  since there were no clean and sober male role models to emulate in my  own neighborhood otherwise (I'm functionally an atheist since my  mid-20s), so I missed all the romantic and intimate milestones normal  folks have in their teens and early adult years.

Only  real date I had was with a girl my friends were trying to hook me up  with thinking ""She's 'special', he's 'special', it'll work,"" except she  was a super-introvert and wasn't interested in keeping in touch.  Had  some crushes in school that never went anywhere, or in one case didn't  catch a crush on until they had already lost interest.  My first and  only kiss was a kiss goodbye from a friend I had caught feelings for,  when she was dating and asked if she wanted to hook up I said no, when  she was single again and I suggested we should date she said she only  thought of me a a friend.  Had another friend that was definitely DTF but even drunk me wasn't willing to follow through to it because she was  very much not single.

I have had random drunk chicks try to flirt with me twice over the past decade, first one was pretty hot but I didn't flirt back because I wasn't sure  if that was taking advantage of a drunk chick and I didn't want to be a creep, second time a different girl gave me what she said was her  number, didn't even get a good look at her but was interested to see  what someone who found me attractive would be like, tried texting her  the next weekend but never got a response.

Last  stupid crush was on a girl in my area running an IG book club, tried to  DM slide talking about books, she was polite but when I tried to follow  up she kind of ignored me so I tried to be respectful and keep my  distance.  Stumbled into her on Hinge (finally!), sent her a message  saying I thought she was really cool and I'd love to meet up sometime,  apparently creeped her out enough for her to take the time to look up my  IG and block me on both main and the book club IG, which was literally  the absolute worst nightmare scenario.

One  of my war buddies told me it was a bad idea to DM slide, but he also  says I should try coke for self-confidence and pay to finally have sex so I dismissed his advice.  I was also working seven  days a week alone on a site during a pandemic so no real way to meet  people IRL and she's attractive enough I figured she'd get snatched up  by some hot guy once the pandemic subsided before I could even get  rejected for some closure.  I was hoping at the very best she would tell  me she's not interested or doesn't find me attractive, but knowing that  trying my very best all I could achieve with a stranger I was  interested in was creep them the fuck out kind of broke me.

I  know I'm probably a 5/10 at best, though realistically more like a 3/10  if I consider the total lack of responses I get whenever I try online  dating, it's a great way to ensure my self-esteem doesn't get too high.

I'm  rapidly approaching my mid-30s, I'm seeing folks six, seven years  younger than me that call me ""sir"" when they see me getting married,  having careers, having kids and such, meanwhile my life story already  reads more like that of some inc\*l mass sh\*\*ter than a normal  human being.

Assuming I was able  to find someone that was normal in any sense, pretty certain they'd find  it weird that I had no real experience and wouldn't want to deal with  me playing catch-up with the kind of young love experiences they got  bored with in high school.  When I read about dating online or see stuff  on places like [r/niceguys](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/)  I realize even further that my chances of not coming off like a total  weirdo are basically nil with all the goofballs out there.  Also  doesn't help all work in my city is low-status jobs unless you have a  degree or work for the government, and I'm competing against the tons of  wealthy hipster college grads from nice families that have gentrified  half the city while I ran out of money before I could finish my degree.

Might delete this sooner rather than later because there's enough personal  details someone could ID me with this but want some advice from normal  people on if it's possible to turn things around in my dire straits  before I give up on ever experiencing normal human romantic  relationships.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzn1vv/reaching_my_mid30s_and_seriously_wondering_if_my/

I am crying everyday . I would really appreciate if anyone can give me cold / real advice for me to move on my life. 

i started dating this guy and he ended up rejecting me at the end so it gave me depression and feeling like worthless. He was my very first for everything (including sex) so even tho we were not together officially and in fact he treated me as fwb it was very hard for me to get through. While i was spending time with this person, i started to hate myself for everything about my self like my financial situation and my english accent. 

Currently i am struggling with low self-confidence and am insecure about myself. I just feel like guys only like me physically (and only want to sleep with me) i feel like i won‚Äôt find someone who will like who i am really as a person. 

Before this guy, i had thing with my friend and basically i did not like him back and was really cold to him. I still don‚Äôt understand why he liked me. i was boring and not fun to talk with. i FEEL LIKE the main reason he hangout with me and wanted me to be his gf was due to my physical appearance. (i am not super pretty but i like the way i look, decent lol) 

It‚Äôs been about 3 months not contacting this guy who gave me heartbroken, and i have slept with two other guys and i feel disgusted about myself. maybe it‚Äôs because  i am pretty religious and never saw myself sleeping around like this. i tried alcohol for the first time spending time with these guys. i just feel like i will never have someone who will genuinely care about me as a bf or gf.

He lived an hour away from me so we were trying to plan our first date. We spent a lot of time talking on the phone, had some FaceTime dates &amp; I was really feeling him. He was handsome &amp; fit with a good job and no kids, that was rare enough as is. 

Eventually he asks me to go to this botanical garden to look at Christmas lights at night, which was another hour from me but two hours away from him. When he showed up to pick me up. He had two babies in the car. He tells me he lied to me &amp; that he is a father. I got so mad. But I felt obligated to proceed with the date since he had just driven an hour out to see me with these kids.

So we go the whole extra hour out, I‚Äôm still mad so I‚Äôm not talking much. The babies are f(6) &amp; m(4). We get there &amp; when everyone got out of the car I noticed his daughter wasn‚Äôt dressed at all for this occasion. It was cold that night &amp; he had her in a t-shirt &amp; biker shorts with mismatched socks on &amp; mismatched ballerina slippers &amp; her curly mixed-girl hair was not done at all it looked like she rolled out of bed &amp; he just brought her out there. I was like wtf. I felt embarrassed because I know ppl would look at us thinking I‚Äôm her mother &amp; wonder how tf I have her out here looking a hot mess like that, while I‚Äôm looking cute, rocking Gucci but this child doesn‚Äôt even have a jacket. 

So we go into the garden and his kids start throwing the biggest tantrums over normal basic child care. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hungry dad we haven‚Äôt eaten in hours‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre thirsty‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cold‚Äù I was like wtf. He didn‚Äôt have any supplies for them for this two hour road trip he brought them on.

And the whole time they‚Äôre suffering he wants to be all up on me &amp; ignoring them. I also noticed when he was close to me he reeked of tequila. Now they‚Äôre yelling ‚ÄúI hate u dad‚Äù &amp; telling me they don‚Äôt like me. I‚Äôm sitting there like look I‚Äôm with y‚Äôall I‚Äôm starting to hate y‚Äôall daddy too. That place had no food for them, nowhere to buy drinks, no little store to buy them jackets. I was like look I‚Äôm ready to go.

So we‚Äôre leaving it‚Äôs late like 10pm. We drive off and pass all this city driving for like 20 mins, didn‚Äôt stop once to feed these kids. oh and he can‚Äôt drive he‚Äôs swerving all over the road most likely drunk &amp; he runs out of gas. On a bridge.

I just couldn‚Äôt believe it I thought running out of gas was something u did  when you‚Äôre between 16-19 years old. We sat there, kids whining, him throwing an anger fit at himself me texting my sister to come get me‚Ä¶we sat there for 45 mins and eventually a nice person stopped and gave him some gas. 

We drive to the nearest gas station the kids are asleep I run into the gas station because I also hungry and buy me some snacks while I think he‚Äôs filling up the car. The line was long and I was probably in the store for 10 minutes. When I came out he was standing by the pump &amp; got mad when he saw me I said what‚Äôs wrong and he began walking into the store &amp; said ‚ÄúI need to pay for gas‚Äù so I was like wtf did he expect me to fill his tank? 

He pays gets gas we go on our way he‚Äôs swerving like crazy now. We get to my house at like midnight &amp; he‚Äôs saying his phone is dead. I didn‚Äôt give a fuck but I felt bad for them kids so I said okay y‚Äôall can come in to use a charger. This man came inside &amp; fell straight to sleep on the couch. I had to put his kids back to sleep in my guest room. I went into my room &amp; stayed up just because I didn‚Äôt want him in my house. 

Once 6am hit I woke his ass up and told him to go. Those poor kids were still trying to eat they were asking me if I had cereal. I gave them some granola bars and said bye.

48,rzof9p,1641722366,Stopping to date a soft spoken person for this reason?,"I don't know how to get my head around this question. Would you stop dating someone who speaks quietly all the time? For instance, I understand maybe a word in a sentence. Maybe none. If we are at a restaurant, the waitresses almost never get a grasp of her order and give up after asking a few times. Then she gets mad because the food is a different one from the ordered one. Also, no communication beyond topics that can be hinted by objects or processes, so there is no sharing of thoughts or feelings because of a lack of exchange. It isn't just like talking to a wall, she responds but I have no clue what.

Over the years I noticed that many women are just like that. In the work environment or among friends I often observe such people who just speak at their chosen volume and try to intimidate other people when they ask for a repetition or don't even give a fuck anymore. Yes, that is quite often that colleagues don't even listen anymore because of the volume of someone speaking. I can totally get it, they don't benefit from the effort because it is just a peer and not the CEO talking in this way.

68,rzqte7,1641731882,What sure signs to look out for if a women is looking for more than friendship? (Advice for 22 M pls)," Hey guys/gals, I met this girl (20) at work a couple of months ago and there seemed to be a mutal attraction to one another (well according to what google says, prolonged eye contact, dilated pupils, always smiling at each other, asking me what I was doing after work, getting physically closer to me than other coworkers etc..) but I'm second guessing myself as there are other signals to suggest she isn't interested.

We met after work (11pm) a couple of weeks after we first introduced and we talked and eat in the car together for around 2 hours and she opened up about some of the problems in her life, there was a long hug at the end and thought it went well. However the next 2-3 times I asked her if she's doing anything after work I got all sorts of excuses so backed off and waited to see if she would reach out to me for once, sure enough 3 days later she texted me asking if I wanted to 'hang out' (I feel like this is another word for dating these days) and we did for about the same length of time. Only this time I kissed her forehead when saying good bye and she lightly kissed me back so I thought things were moving at a decent pace that both of us felt comfortable with.

We meet each other a couple more times when we were scheduled on together, I was always looking for signals to see if she wanted to take things further when we were talking but was scared of ruining our friendship that we had built and maybe she didn't want to flat out reject me so there wouldn't be awkardness at the workplace. She laughed at my jokes and exposed her neck while laughing but are these really signs that a girl wants you more than a friend?

A couple of weeks have past since we last seen each other due to one of us leaving the job but I do try and text her every couple of days, one of our last face to face conversations at work was her asking me about my future plans. The problem is sometimes she will take a day to reply to my messages even though shes seen them, or sometimes she won't respond to them at all. I feel like she is playing some sort of game and I can only take so much of someone being unresponsive, everyone has problems in their life but taking 10 seconds out your day to reply to someone can't be that hard- expecially when they are still posting on social media. I have asked her if she wanted to do something together within the next week which she said yes to about a minute after I sent the text, I replied back a couple of minutes later and she didn't get back in touch until I messaged her 2 days later.......

Some things I left out-

She brought up her ex the first time we 'hung out' asking if I knew him, and hasn't mentioned him and I haven't mentioned any girls either because she hasn't asked. She did say she has has a couple of other guy friends.

When texting each other there are always love hearts being used by both of us, for me personally I don't throw them about with my friends but I'm sure women use them all the time.

Everytime we were hanging out it was in the back of the car (her suggestion) late at night for around 2-3 hours, she isn't scared to be seen in public with me while getting food. She takes pictures of being with me on snapchat so either she is happy being with me or trying to make someone jealous.

We've yet to meet outside of workdays given the distance between us, however she is planning to travel 50 minutes by car to see me next week- would a women travel 50 minutes just to see a friend they barely met 2 months ago? I'm sure she has plenty of friends that live locally.

Now that we aren't working together I do feel much more confident that I can make a move to take things further but still don't want to make her uncomfortable as maybe I've read the signs wrong. Are there any CLEAR signs that she wants something more?

76,rzrvr1,1641735469,How dumb am I?," 

I always thought I was kinda low on social skills when it comes to interpret signals, but this weekend got me seriously wondering if an oyster would perform better than me.  
To add a little context, I just got out from a 10+ years relationship just over a month ago.  
Friday night, I got out with a buddy of mine for his birthday, and got completely wasted. In a bar we met up with a couple girls, one being a friend of his.  
We ended moving at the other girl's place - let's call her Beth - for a few more drinks, and before leaving, at 9am, I just mention to my friend I hope I'm gonna be able to rest enough to go to the ice hockey match in the evening, as we discussed earlier (I had planned to go there alone).

Beth hears me and says ""If you go, I'll join"".

I just said yeah why not, you can join if you please, so we exchange numbers, and I tell her I'll text her in the afternoon to see if she's still up for it.

Went back home, slep a few hours, woke up with a terrible hangover, but I elected to go at the match anyways, and vegetate there, then go back to sleep.

I wasn't so sure about texting Beth since I wasn't in a brilliant mood, and thought she might have changed her mind anyways.

I ended texting her, thinking she was probably not even gonna answer, and probably be sleeping for the night.

About 1 hours before game time, Beth texts me back. She says she put an alarm to wake up and join me to the match. Fair enough, I let her know I'm not in a great state but we settle a meeting.

Then as I went to take a shower, I started wondering: ""What's happening? Is this girl just enthusiastic about going to a hockey game with a guy she met last night and willing to share a platonic evening, or am I missing something? ..Should I maybe.. groom?"" I really couldn't figure it out, but I eventually elected to be prepared, you know, just in case, to avoid feeling dumb as fuck if things get frisky..

Moment later she texts me and she's early at the venue. I tell her I'm gettin' on my way, to which she answers with ""I'm waiting for you""..Again, as I'm heading there, I'm questioning myself like are these clear signals and I'm blind AF or are these completely casual events and I'm being creepy..?

Long story short, I meet Beth, we assist the game (was a great show), she clearly wasn't too fresh either, and once the game ends and we're heading out, I asked her if she'd like to have an extra drink before parting ways, and she told me ""Would you come at my place and sleep with me?""  
At this point, I am proud to announce to you, fellow redditors, that I eventually got the signal.

Bless her.

But that doesn't change the fact that people with disabilities have the need and want to be loved and in a relationship just as much as someone who doesn't have a disability. 

I don't really see why people think those who have a disability should only be limited to dating other people with disabilities. I know that is may be a little scary to think how someone's life may need to change to accommodate someone's special needs when it comes to dating someone with a disability. But at the end of the day they are human as well and they have the right to not want to date another person with a disability.  I know for myself I don't require 24/7 care. I live by myself, I work and I also have a car that I drive. So I don't see myself as a burden on someone who doesn't have disability when it comes to dating. 

Why is society so closed minded when it comes to those living with a disabilities as if they aren't worthy of dating someone without a disability?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzsc5j/why_do_people_feel_the_need_to_be_so_closed/

I mostly use dating apps because of my job(military) it‚Äôs hard to just go out because I‚Äôm so worn out by the end of the week, plus I‚Äôm a lot older than a lot of my peers. Every girl I match with never seems to want to meet up, they are always too busy or something has came up. If they do agree to a date I just get ghosted. 

Reddit is about the same also, I met an awesome woman but then when it came time to meet up which I expressed I don‚Äôt mind buying a ticket to see her, she just ghosts me for a couple weeks till my leave is over then texts me back saying sorry with an excuse. This has happened before with another woman where I traveled to her and she just left me at the airport. Learned a lesson about traveling but not about just giving people second chances. 

I don‚Äôt understand I have an awesome job, am financially stable, decently attractive and really try to get to know someone and want a genuine relationship.

86,rzswyf,1641738747,I don't get why she wasn't feeling it,"I [23M] met this girl [19F] on bumble. Went on a long 4 hour walk through a nature reserve for the first date, halfway through we had a passionate kiss for about half an hour, after which we held hands for the rest of the walk. Honestly the best first date experience I've had. 

We planned a second date. But because of lockdowns, our only option was to watch a movie at home. So she came to my house, met my family and we went upstairs.
Now I wasn't gonna force anything, but I really liked this girl. After the movie was done we locked eyes and started having sex. I was still a virgin, so it was quite awkward from my side and I had some problems, but fun nonetheless. 
We cuddled afterwards, had dinner and went upstairs again to watch a second movie. We only made it through 10 mins before having sex again. She wasn't able to stay the night, so I drove her to the trainstation, kissed goodbye and said we'd arrange something again for a third date.

Fast forward to last week, she initiated goodmorning texts and all seemed well. I asked if she wanted to go ice skating as a third date, she said she'd love to, but wasn't sure she was available this weekend. The texts started getting slower and slower, she mentioned she was busy with school.

Then on saturday she hit me with a text saying she really enjoyed our time together, but that she didn't feel a romantic 'click', but she'd love to still stay friends and go ice skating sometime.

Now I'm genuinly confused, because everything she did led me to believe she was actually into me romantically. The sex was 'good' (barring some of my first time awkwardness) and passionate.
Everytime she looked me in the eyes she seemed almost in love already. 
Ofcourse I can't know what she feels, but the only time I started worrying was past wednesday when she started ignoring some of my texts and answering late. It's as if something suddenly flipped.

I've been coming to peace with it, but it still hurts a lot when I think back, and I'm still super confused.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzswyf/i_dont_get_why_she_wasnt_feeling_it/

Me &amp; this girl started as ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù.. Over time I helped her with everything. Car Note, Help pay for her surgery. Help her move, be there for her emotionally help her with her problems etc. she constantly flaked on me. She flaked Atleast 7 times &amp; would take hours &amp; days to reply back to my messages.

She came over last night and we hung out while watching a movie. Eventually she came closer to lay down/cuddle and it was great. After the movie we went downstairs to my room, cuddled a little more, then she asked if I wanted to have sex, so we did.

I came while she was giving me head, and then I went to give her head after. A little while later we went for round 2. She eventually had me grab a condom so I put it on but went soft shortly after. She didn't really mind so we made out and teased some more before trying again. Same thing. I decided that maybe I had to pee, but it didn't help. We tried 1 or 2 more times before saying fuck it and I just gave her head. She obviously seemed a little bummed but was super nice about it. I'm just so embarrassed and feel like she's not gonna wanna hang out again.

I had a similar problem with my ex when I was a virgin about a year and a half ago. After a few times the nerves went away and I had no problem. So maybe this was just nerves again, even though I felt less nervous (I kept shaking when I was with my ex at first, so I was pretty nervous/anxious). I'm also on Finasteride which apparently can cause ED, so I'm considering stopping that to see if it helps, even though I've never had this issue on my own and only last night.

We met at a club &amp; started having sex and hanging out with each other. I saw her around 6 times before winter break (also exam season so less during that time). We always had a more than casual sex vibe together but we would text irregularly around this time and she took longer to answer texts etc. Nonetheless on dates/hangouts she had already given me a nickname we had a good vibe and I even cooked for her etc so we definitely liked each other more than just sex. I told her the last time I saw her before winter break that I'd take her out in January and she was excited, we had only texted on phone and IG since and we added each other on snapchat for the break to send pics etc.

Ever since I said I wanted to take her out and got her on snapchat we've been talking everyday for 18 days straight now pretty frequently during the day flirting/talking/planning things. Over the break we've planned more potential food dates we wanna go on, shes talked about forcing me to watch certain shows, asking me questions about my day everyday and she started sending hearts saying shes excited to do x and x with me. Also responding way way quicker than she would over text. She was supposed to be back in a couple days but her friend and her family invited her to go to Fort Lauderdale for a week. So I won't see her for another week.

We haven't had a DTR talk yet I was planning on having it pretty soon after she gets back and I take her on a proper date. I want her to have a lot of fun on holiday but I kept thinking about her going out and maybe hooking up with other people. Ik I can't claim her now or be technically ""mad"" but was curious as to peoples opinion on whether it would be normal for her to hook up on holiday with someone now or if its likely she would not do something like that given the direction we're going.
