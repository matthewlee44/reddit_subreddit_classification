Didn‚Äôt want anything serious at first just went on dates and hung out a ton with this guy. Things have been progressing over time and I really like him. Last year was the first time I truly started dating since my high school/college bf (I‚Äôm almost 26). I met this guy summer 2020 (he was a couple years older than me) and wasn‚Äôt interested at first. Then he reached out towards the end of 2020. Went on a date again, then started hanging out. Decided to just give him a chance. We hung out for 2 months saw him maybe once every other week. It just turned out to be what felt like a ‚Äúfwb‚Äù as I tried talking to him about wanting more like actual dates and hanging out.  Not just late night talks and sex. After the 2 months of hanging/trying to figure things out with this guy, someone else started to show actual interest in me (cut it off with the other guy as soon as the other guy started talking to me) well it never worked out with the 2nd guy either but that‚Äôs okay. I was still thankful as it helped push me to get out of that situation and realize I‚Äôm worth more than what I was getting out of the first guy. I have finally met someone who treats me really good and like I deserve to be treated. Recently I have been feeling so ashamed and embarrassed of myself about the situation with the first guy. Like I guess scared that I may get judged by the guy I‚Äôm currently seeing if he ever ask about past things. That is not me as a person :( and I‚Äôm so ashamed. The guy I‚Äôm seeing now is two years older than me and his relationship before me he was going to ask her to marry him but she cheated on him. My relationships just didn‚Äôt work out or were used for sex. Sometimes I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve him. I know it just me overthinking and my anxiety getting to me. 

*** the guy I‚Äôm seeing and I had a conversation last night about our sex life. He was talking about trying new things (sorry if TMI) as he doesn‚Äôt want to me to get bored. I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel bored‚Ä¶ plus it‚Äôs not all about sex :) I love just hanging out with you ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞‚Äù
He said ‚ÄúYes I know :) remember I told you that too lol‚Äù
I said ‚ÄúYes you did :) honestly if we didn‚Äôt have sex, I really wouldn‚Äôt be upset or anything (don‚Äôt take that as a bad thing) ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôve been with guys where that‚Äôs all that matters to them. So it won‚Äôt make it or break for me‚Äù 
That‚Äôs when I really thought about the time I let a guy just use me for sex and I felt ashamed and scared he would judge me if he ever found out 

tl;dr- Ashamed of myself for hanging out with a guy the year before for 2 months who was just in it for sex.

Getting into a LTR at 19 I feel like I just don't know what I am doing now. Plus, I feel like I have been tainted by the ideals of falling love quickly and getting swept off of my feet from all of the movies and books i've ever read. So this time around I want to go slow. But is this too slow to keep pursuing? Am I just not picking up the signs? 

6 months ago I met this really nice guy (25M) off of Tinder and he was surprisingly not a total creep. We instantly set up a few dates in the first month or so of speaking and they went pretty well. A dinner date, an adventure in our favorite city, and then a chill day at his place. After hanging out at his place he specifically told me that he needs time to build and grow an emotional connection before pursuing a relationship (and he's also demisexual). Which is understandable! Can't expect it to be like the movies right?  But after that day, his life has been consumed with work and his projects and we've only seen each other a couple more times after that though we talk everyday through text. 

There are so many aspects about him that I really like and he's different from any guy i've ever dated. He's got passion for his hobbies and career. He's someone who understands that I will reply when I can (usually 4-5 hrs in between). Our interests and taste in music is so similar it is kind of scary. Lastly, on our dates he will be the one to decide where to go or where to eat and I appreciate that level of dominance and forward thinking. 

Our texts have slowed because of his schedule but we still reply with paragraphs. But I want that lovey dovey type stuff. Tell me i'm pretty and that you're thinking about me. When I send a selfie, tell me that you've been wowed and shower me with heart emojis. But would I take that over our conversations with real sustenance about the paranormal or military strategies? I don't know... I want both! 

Obviously, I should communicate my feelings with him to see where he is at and if he wants to pursue it any further but i'm scared that I might be jumping the gun and asking too soon. When do I give up? Or is this just normal?

Went on a third date with a girl I like, we had great two dates before. It seems like she likes me too.
Went to dinner, and she invited me to her flat to watch a movie.
We watched a movie a date before, she's a film student,
And I also like it.
We watched it on her laptop on her bed.
Nothing sexual, and we talked for hours.
Still didn't kiss her back then or flirt much,
Nor seen hints from her.

Maybe she's not sexually attracted to men? (Has a LGBT flag, nothing wrong with)

2. The older party seeks out the younger party as the younger is typically more immature, naive, inexperienced, and easier to control and manipulate.

3.

We've been seeing each other about 6 months and both feel pretty strongly about each other.

For Christmas I got her one of those big 10 by 10 blankets because she loves cuddling and is always cold. She loved the gift when i gave it to her. 


Now, she has a roommate in her house. Not because she needs the money, as the roommate doesn't pay rent or anything. The roomie is a recovering drug addict. But of course she has no money or anything so this girl took her in ""temporarily"".

Of course it's now been over a year with no end in sight as the roomie still has no money or prospects and I doubt this girl will put her out with nowhere to go. 

Anyways, the roomie has a dog. Sweet enough but chews things up all the time and such. 

Well the girl I'm dating put the blanket in her room to keep the dog from chewing it. She always keeps her door shut. 

The roomie though, of course, never shuts the door and doesn't have the sense to pay attention to such things despite the girl telling her repeatedly to keep the door shut to keep the dog out. 

Well, went over there Friday and the blanket was chewed up. I was so annoyed. Of course the girl was too, but I told her she had to know the roomie wouldn't keep the dog out and that the blanket would get chewed up there sooner or later.

I'm legitimately frustrated. It was expensive (not the main point, but still). And it was meant to be something she and I could use together for a long time to come. I know she didn't intend for this to happen and technically took a step to prevent it, but it was a step she knew would not be effective and she acknowledged as much when I asked her if she really thought the roomie would keep the dog out of her room. 

I don't know what kind of resolution I can hope for. What's done is done. But I guess I'd like to see her take a stand with the roomie? Stop letting her just have free reign and let her dog cause destruction? Stick up and set boundaries for our relationship? We're both in our 30s and financially great, we don't need this shit IMO.

I'm an international exchange student and I'm abroad for a semester. This girl, Valerie, and I got along super well. We have incredible sex, talk about everything from politics to dreams to passions, she tells me that she really likes me, I reciprocate, and overall I return home beaming! We start talking a lot more and we have another date set up. The day comes around and she cancels, saying she can't anymore. I'm bummed but I figure whatever, another time then. 

She starts taking longer and longer to respond, and so I give her some space. Eventually, she sends me a three-minute voice message saying that she's in an open relationship with a girl in another city, but it's super open so we can keep talking (?) and that she really likes me a lot and would love to see me again, but also she doesn't know how she feels (?) and that she has commitment issues. Now this made my jaw drop. I say I'm down to be friends with benefits, she says she doesn't know, I say well thanks for letting me know, and she doesn't respond. 

Later that day I run into her on the metro (what are the odds lmao) but we don't talk. It's been a few days and it's pretty obvious to me that she's uninterested.

I know it's obvious that I should move on. I know that. But for some reason I just feel stuck on her. I know I deserve someone who actively makes an effort but I don't know, I just can't shake what's happened.

I so badly want to shoot my shot one more time and ask her to hang out, but I know I shouldn't. I just feel completely unloveable and lame right now, and I guess I just want another chance to prove that I am worth it, even though logically I know I shouldn't have to prove my worth to anyone.

I started dating this a guy a couple of months ago. I really like him and he likes me too. We even say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to eachother. Before we started dating (maybe like 2 weeks before) we all went to a club and his friend came and my friend came. (At this time we were only friends) we all kind of got drunk and it was me, him, his friend and my friend in the car. Guy I dated falls asleep with my friend in the back, while me in his friend are in the front seat. He‚Äôs friend said wanna go to my job nearby? I said sure why not (it was late and I was a little tipsy and the night was still young ) and the others were in the back seat asleep.. he works in a laboratory so we went in and me and him was just talking .. I then asked to go to the bathroom and he showed me .. and waited outside .. then we was talking again and I sat on his lap .. he tells me (my friend really likes you) and I said oh yeah, But we are just friends .. and we continued on talking and holding hands .. I felt like he was easy going and we had a Interesting conversation and then he tells me he has a game the next day and if I wanted to come and see him play .. I said sure but he never messaged me after that (we have each others number) so I just never spoke to him after that ‚Ä¶ fast forward to now .. guy I‚Äôm dating tells me his friend told him that night we made out in the bathroom and I have my nipples pierced (which I do) but I honestly don‚Äôt know how he knew that .. he then tells guy I‚Äôm dating that he doesn‚Äôt like me and we shouldn‚Äôt be dating because I‚Äôm no good for him and says you can talk to anyone else but just not her she‚Äôs not a good person .. like dude I just met you one day and he says he doesn‚Äôt like me and tells guy I‚Äôm dating not to date me ? I just don‚Äôt know why he would lie and say we made out when  I know for sure we didn‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt understand why he doesn‚Äôt like me?? Why would he lie??

I'm dealing with lots of insecurities from past relationships. Every relationship that I have been in I was cheated on and it was always with a guy who was tall, fit, and good looking. I did all the right things and I was still wasn't good enough. 

That's where my mindset of ""women only go for good looking guys"" comes from. It's why I have been going to the gym and dieting for the past year. I feel like who I am as a person will never be good enough and that I have to be muscular and fit for someone to want me and to stay faithful to me. Even if someone falls for my personality I'm going to be skeptical. How will I know that the moment some fit guy shows up with a personality just as good, that I won't be left behind? 

That's why I have such a cynical view on dating. It's all manipulation and deception because that all that I have ever known.

This weekend I (f,19) got wasted and drunk called a guy (m,20) who I've been talking to for almost 4/5 months. Some background information: during those months we've only talked to each other irl 2/3? times. We attend the same college and would pass each other between classes but we both would always pretend that we didn't see each other or have the excuse that we were ""talking to a friend/professor, etc and didn't see each other"". We exclusively talked on snap, iMessage, and insta, and would have lengthy conversations and all relatively different conversations on each platform. This made me think that ok, maybe we're both shy (because this is my first big experience with a guy) but seems like things are going well because we've been having great conversations for the past 4/5 months. And every time I  wouldn't respond for a day, leave him on read for a day, or never responded, he would always ask me if everything was alright or at least message me again. This made me think, ""Gee, this guy really cares. Maybe I'll try harder to be more upfront"". So just recently I asked if he wanted to hangout irl at his place. We watched a movie, cuddled, and I think he wanted a kiss before I left but I was nervous and didn't know what to do, and he also didn't say anything. 
Fast forward to last Friday, I got drunk by myself and called him. He invited me over because we've always talked about drinking together and I kept telling him I missed him (smh, but I always do and am I gonna say that sober? No.) Towards the end of the night, I get into his bed and told him that it's bedtime and that we should cuddle. By this point, we've been very touchy and have been making out so the cuddling led to more of that and then to us sleeping. No sex. I woke up maybe an hour after us sleeping needing to use the bathroom and noticed that his roommate was home and in the bathroom. Mind you there are no locks on their bathroom doors, and the bathroom is connected to both of their rooms. I made the decision (probably still tipsy) to go back to my apartment and use the bathroom there while he was sleeping. I sent him a message before I left that I basically didn't regret last night and that I had a great time. He never replied to it the next day other than my message of when I should give him his clothes back. When I gave him his clothes back it was awkward and we never mentioned last night. He didn't say much, then I got nervous and told him I had to go. Sunday comes and I tell him I need to talk to him because things felt off. Basically he told me that he needs time to figure things out and I left about to cry. Now I'm giving him time and space but I feel like I'm in the wrong and everything was my fault.

Yes I know it's a long time but we haven't been able to meet because of covid restrictions etc.

We are from the same country but she went back to her home country from Christmas in 2020 and hasn't been back since. We agreed to date other people but she told after a while that she had no interest in dating other people only me.

We spoke everyday and even video called whenever we had a chance. However, in December 2021 she completely disappeared didn't read my messages or anything. Around the end of December she messaged back and claimed that she didn't respond because she was busy with a friends wedding. I was a bit suspicious of what was happening but ignored it.

Anyway around new year 2022 she messaged me asking how I spent my new years I told her and then asked her what she did. She didn't respond until 4 weeks later after I messaged her saying that I was getting annoyed by her.

As soon as I sent that message she responded straight away saying she's been busy working and partying and didn't have time to look at her phone and message people. 

I don't buy that at all because I believe that everyone is clearly on there phones all the time and it doesn't take that long to respond to a message. 

It's honestly getting annoying I've been talking for ages and I was excited to meet up with her but now I honestly don't think I'm interested anymore. That kind of behaviour is just weird and I don't know feels odd. She still claims she is interested but I'm not sure. It makes me feel unwanted idk.

Personality wise.....you guessed it, I'm pretty introverted, shy/quiet person,anxeity, low confidence and I rarely put myself out there. Hobbies are usually indoor stuff like watching movies,anime/manga,games etc. Before winter I was getting into running though. Body wise I'm 6FT tall, skinnyish kind of built. I don't think I'm ugly but obviously lack of actual compliments are rare so I'm not sure were exactly I stand lookwise.   


My current situation is I'm currently attending a CC in NYC, so its heard to actually make friends as people just come to class then go home/about their day. Even signed up for a language class cause I knew cute girls would probably be there(and they are) but i cant even bring myself to say anything to them. I've thought about online dating and not against it but due to lack of good/presentable pictures of myself I never made any accounts yet( i want to put my best effort forward when i make one.)

He seems pretty reluctant to spend money on me and generally makes it clear that if he's buying me something, that I'll be buying him something to make it even. Which, obviously I want to do anyway, but he seems to want to be verbal about it instead of understanding that of course I'm gonna pay for dinner or drinks too, which I feel like is just implied, especially at this point as we see each other almost every day. 

He's also constantly trying to get his money back for things that he buys, for example if he orders from Uber Eats he pretty much always tries to find something to complain about so he can get his money back. When we go to restaurants he has also taken the ketchup sachets or salts so that he doesn't have to buy them at the store. Yesterday we went for dinner which was only ¬£20 for 3 plates of food &amp; 3 drinks, and he was not happy about it.

I was raised by parents who have a decent amount of money and are also very generous with it. They refuse to let me purchase anything in their presence, tell me I shouldn't buy them presents for Christmas/birthdays/etc., give me money if I ever need to buy anything ""practical"", won't let my friends buy anything if they're with us, etc. 

They're definitely not the kinda people who seek out ways to save money a lot or are wary of purchasing new products to replace old ones. They can be a bit wasteful of things in that sense, so I recognise that I'm kind of on the opposite side of the spectrum to this guy, as he tries to save everything and not throw anything out and all that (which I don't think is bad at all).

I take after my parents a lot, but I'm also just a student who isn't rich so I also like deals and saving money and all that, but I am the kinda person who also likes to not worry about money so much and spend money on myself and other people without making them pay me back. Whereas as I've mentioned, he seems to be quite the opposite. He was telling me the other day that (of course) that is how he was raised to be.

The thing is, it doesn't really bother me that much on it's own, it's more when it directly affects me. I personally like a guy who wants to spend money on me and isn't particularly stingy. I don't really care if it seems materialistic, I like to spend money on the person I'm seeing too so it's not like I want a sugar daddy or something, I think it's just that because I was raised the way I w as, to me I associate spending money on someone with love/care.

At first we were fuck buddies. Then we cut things off and reconnected with the idea of wanting more. He wasn't ready for a relationship at the time so we stopped talking. Then we recently reconnected again. He apologized for taking me for granted and expressed interest in hanging out, going out on dates, and getting to know each other better. We're going on two months of talking every single day. He doesn't usually like talking on the phone but he's made the effort to do so with me because he knows I enjoy talking on the phone. 

The problem though is that he's not vaccinated and the city we live in has a vaccination mandate for indoor activities/entertainment. So almost two months in and we have not gone on any dates. Almost two months in he has not invited me over to his place to hang out. To be fair, he said he hasn't invited me over because it would be hard for him to NOT have sex with me. (We both have high sex drives.)

I just don't know what to do? It feels like I'm in a long distance relationship with someone who lives in the exact same city as me. Only I can't even call it that because we're not officially a couple. So I guess Long Distance ""Situationship"" would be more appropriate. 

I really like him and he's told me he likes me a lot as well. Is this going nowhere? I understand everyone moves at their own pace but do people really move THIS slowly?

I made another post about these issues. One thing I did not think of Is the fact that I am not open to having children and the guy I‚Äôm dating is. When we met I told him that I had a connective tissue disorder that was genetic, and that I did not want children because of this. My geneticist says that there is a 50% chance that I could pass on my disability to a child. While I am able to walk, I live with daily pain and fatigue that make me unable to work. This would make caring for a child very difficult. There is also the possibility that if I do pass it onto a child that the child could be much more disabled than I am and unable to walk.

I have noticed that the guy I am dating makes little comments about how his friends are married and have children and how he has always wanted that for himself. He is now saying things to me, like ‚Äúhaving a child is a blessing even if that child is born with a disability like Down syndrome"". I am starting to realize that maybe these little things he is saying is because he‚Äôs trying to get me to change my mind about having children. I decided to ask him about it, and he says that is what he is trying to do. However he also says that he is OK with not having children, and he has realized as he‚Äôs gotten older that she should date people And give them a chance even if some things they are not compatible on, because his perfect idea of a meet and what would make him happy might not be what actually would make him happy. These are his words. Is this a red flag? Dealbreaker? Did he truly sounding like he is open to having children, but is OK if he doesn‚Äôt? I was trying to look up evidence of our reasons why I should not have children to give to this guy. I read that carrying a pregnancy to term to also be a risk for me. But I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to give  someone explanations of why I don‚Äôt want children. He doesn‚Äôt talk about this stuff a lot, so he probably doesn‚Äôt see it as a big deal. However, I don‚Äôt like wasting time with someone well I‚Äôm not compatible with and something like this could easily become an issue in the future if we are not on the same page. Thoughts?

Tldr: I do not want children because I have a genetic disease, boyfriend says he‚Äôs open to it. I have discussed with boyfriend why I do not ever want children, and he says he understands.

1st date: (30 m) we met up at a coffee shop. It went surprisingly well. He kept complimenting on my looks and told me I was everything he expected and more. He is super attracted however little bit too thin but his face....carved by angels. 

2nd date: (44 m) we met up at one of my favorite sushi places. He is older and hot. Very well put together, I believe he knows how hot he is but humbles himself in front of me because he knows I don't tolerate bullshit (we've texted past dates before &amp; how I hated boastful men). now the date went well. I was pretty calm. He seemed kinda nervous. We order drinks and we started to warm up little bit more. He also told me I was everything he expected and was grateful that I didn't put filters on my photos.

in the end of our dinner, he started to grab my hand or touch my thigh during us laughing about a comment one of us had made. which I wasn't mad about...I sorta liked it.

Before we decided to leave, we both got up and hugged. He wouldn't let go. I can tell he loved it. He made a comment that I smelled so good

When we went outside (in the snow &amp; cold) he kept wanting to hug me and kissed my cheeks. 

so whatever, we said our goodbyes and right before I was leaving the parking lot, he texted me 

""your hugs \*heart emojis, so nice. I smell like you. its nice. Text when you get home plz""

He then calls me telling me ""hey, I know this is crazy but would you like to go to the movies right now, I would like to spend more time together""

Well, I couldn't because it was getting late and I still had things to do...

so I get home, he texts me how great it was, and how he is attracted to me and would like to see me again.

now.... I feel like he is a F-boy... even though he says he's not.... our text got sorta dry over the weekend. because he knew I thought he was...

he texted me today asking if I want to see him again. I replied yes.

He then replies with ""I would like to se you again. What if we picked a night to grab a drink then see a movie? Super casual and laid back""

So recently I messaged a girl who I went to high school with whom I used to have a crush on. We talked quite a bit in high school but I never had the guts to say how I feel. Then we just went our separate ways.

It‚Äôs been about 5 years since then and I messaged her and told her ‚Äúif she was ever in town and wanted to catch up that my door is open‚Äù. She said she‚Äôd be in town for most of February and that she was definitely down to do something. I suggested three places, two were bars and one was just a chill place to eat. She said she loves both of the bars I mentioned.

Now comes the tricky part, about 2 or 3 years ago I mentioned something similar and she said she was in a relationship but was still down to hang out. This time she didn‚Äôt say that but on her Instagram she has pictures with a guy who at least was her boyfriend. It‚Äôs been about 3 months since she‚Äôs posted a picture with him.

I‚Äôm just kind of confused about how I should operate in this situation? And how everyone else perceives it?

I have too much stacked against me. First off, I'm trans and I don't have my correct body. Why would anyone choose me over a cis guy? Even if I fully transitioned (I plan on it) I doubt it would be enough. I just see happy couples and wish I could be in the guy‚Äôs shoes. It hurts so much.

I tell those few people what I'm uncomfortable with and they immediately ghost me. I'm 27 and still a virgin for that reason.

I worry all the time that I might be ugly. Most people tend to swipe left on me. People in real life are never nice to me. I cringe at every picture of myself. Most days I don't even want to be seen from the shame of it all. No amount of grooming or exercise ever seems to help. I'm just doomed to be ugly and undesirable I guess.

Lastly, I'm an uninteresting, talentless loser who brings nothing to the table. I fail at everything I try. There's nothing remarkable about me that would make anyone think I'm such a catch.

I don't check my dating apps anymore. I've given up. I'm tired of matching with someone and having to carry the conversation while they put no effort in. It just makes me think I'm like their second or third pick of the people they're talking to. Why bother.

there was another time more recently that someone got mildly upset with me cause i didnt compliment them after they posted a picture. but we weren't dating and i wasn't sure if they liked me or not so it felt kinda weird to tell them that i liked how they looked

another time i was talking to a friend about how i thought one if his friends was cute. he told me i should dm her and say hi but i didn't know anything about her and i didn't want to make her uncomfortable. he seemed to think that was a stupid answer.
