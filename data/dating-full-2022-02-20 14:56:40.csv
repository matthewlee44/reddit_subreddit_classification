Me and me ex  have just now recently got back on normal speaking terms after a pretty messy break up 4 years ago. 
I honestly cant say i ever fully got over her, and after hanging out with her after 4 years the other day, its like I know logically its not what i want but i realized as of late she has subconsciously started entering my mind and effecting my decisions A LOT more, and i don’t want that. 

The only form of social media we keep in contact with is on Instagram and that’s pretty much the only form of social media i use other than Reddit. After years of having each other blocked we now follow each other, and  now i hope she looks at my stories, i look at her page daily, and i post certain things she likes in hopes to impress her, but i hate that i do it.

Do other women encounter fixations from past partners/love interests on you, especially in the case of it not working out (and usually because of them i.e being non-committal, or messing up) and they don't want you or screw things over but still seem to have this need to keep tabs, and have some sort of insight into your life?

This is a pattern I notice. Not with every single partner, mind you, but with a lot of them, and as I am bi, this has happened with both men and women.

To better explain.

I dated a guy in July of 2020 and we broke up in December of that same year because he overreacted and dumped me via text over nothing. He ended up coming to his senses, realised he loved and missed me and was into what I was and represented, apologised, turned things around, improved some areas of his life such as kicking alcohol, and then after this big song and dance and making changes ended up reverting back to the same shitty ass behaviour and this time I walked because I could see he hadn't changed and it was all lies.

Guy has issues, I need to state this.. a LOT and is undoubtedly BPD (a doctor told him as much and I've seen it on the papers) and I did used to feel for him being that I could tell he was struggling, but after a time I saw through that, and regardless of his PD he is actually just a piece of shit dude.

Anyway, after the second go around, I blocked him over everything. That was in about April last year.

Again, he is blocked on everything.. Gmail, all socials, and phone.

I have a separate artist account for my paintings and process, and yesterday afternoon in complete surprise I noticed he was snooping all my stories. This account is not linked to my original personal account and my artist account is not my name or in any way resembling it. So, I was a little ""huh"" and also it's been months, but he was watching all stories.

Because I know how he operates, I sent him a ""eff off"" and blocked him this morning from that artist account. I noted he's got a new partner, and it seems after seeing my posts (I checked his account yesterday to see if it was him as I could only just tell from the small icon in my stories) and he has gone and posted a bunch of his own art, clearly spurned by my paintings and I guess feeling some kind of competitiveness or something, I don't know, or hoping I'll see his page and want to connect. Who bloody knows! All I do know is I had to block him as I'm sure he was going to reach out with a sob story or something to get me to forgive him (not because he actually feels remorse) and/or try and weasel into my life.

Thing is, this kind of thing isn't new, and with most partners (not all, but certainly most) or love interests been a thing. Where they screw up and then have this habit of popping up to check in or observe my life from a far, and usually checking in, which is obviously to gauge something.

It tends to be a recurrent thing from those that have done me wrong, and I wonder why this is? Like, if you want a good thing (say, a really nice car you've always wanted) you wouldn't save up and then crash it into a telephone pole on purpose. So why is this a thing with people and me? And I can generally sense when they're about to or that they will, which is bizarre but I can.

It's happened with this idiot, with a girl who messed around with my feelings and has many years later had to keep some thread connecting us, ostensibly through friendship, and others who've done wrong in some way. I get this behaviour must stem from guilt or fascination, but why then conscientiously hurt me or lead me on or abuse me in some form, only to then create this kind of sentence for themselves where they only get me from afar, if at all.

I just find it strange and figured I cannot be alone in this phenomenon.

I used to be shit with my boundaries but am a lot better at it (like this dude to rack off as I did this morning and blocking him from yet another account) but like... why is it a thing?

Sometimes I wonder if I give off a vibe like manic pixie dream girl.. where I'm not quite ""relationship material"" or something, but there's something they can't let go of?

I'm not walking around upset by this, it's more this observation over time that is so obvious and given it's come from a range of people, I wonder why that is.

The girl who broke my heart (basically asked me to come stay with her while I was traveling in her country after we met up in person after being mates online for years and feeling a connection) only to end up being emotionally/romantically stony towards me, and then, over a period of four or 5 years go back and forwards on what she felt and thought (total headf\*\*k of a situation) but one that still stings a little because I really fell for her out of the blue, and we had an undeniable pull and sexual attraction that she blocked (and is also a massive wtf.. I'm cool as painful as it is to accept rejection) but her neither here nor there over the years that followed (I didn't want to come across as a f\*\*kboy, our chemistry was and is there, I feel some kinda way about my life so wanted to reach out) tells me she's still and may always be a little strung up by what did/didn't eventuate (on her though!).

I'm an offbeat kind of person, so I imagine it's my free spirited individualism that is what compels them, but it's this kind of annoying pattern and I don't really want to be some novelty or fancy, especially when with some of these people there has been substance and I believe genuine feeling and gravitational pull. I know some of it is about boundaries for sure (if someone keeps popping up shooting them down) but some of it is this confusing territory because like ""clearly I'm in your mind so why are you like this"".

I don't get wanting someone but keeping that at a distance.

I (20M), met this girl (17) while I was working. She is my boss's niece, and she was there when her niece was flirting with me, but I didn't notice. So she(boss) sat down with me later and told me the niece was interested in me, and I was really surprised with this lol. I talked to my boss about it and in the end she gave me her niece's number.

I texted her later that day, and we were talking for these days, and we instantly clicked, as we have a lot in commom, we like the same things, we speak the same language and all. It's important to say that I recently moved to this city that I'm now, so everthing here is new for me. A good problem that I noticed here, is that people here commit too soon, so it's really, really hard to date here compared to my old city. This girl I'm talking about is single and very beautiful, I felt lucky for having her interested in me, especially because I almost don't have experience with women. I have a history of rejection with women, on several occasions I was dumped for a better guy or cheated on, so I have a few traumas and that me become a little more quiet and shy person.

For my surprise, she went through the same things, our stories are very similar, and I guess that's why we are getting along so well.

But yesterday something weird happened, we were planing to hang out in a date, we were both agreeing on everything, until we got in a subject about love, and I said that I believe we can live a real and warm love, even on these days, but she said that she doesn't believe in that anymore. I tryed to understand why, and then she told me everything she lived with other guys, and how bad was all the things she went through. I understood how she felt, because I faced the same thing with women, and that I felt we could make this work, as everything is going very well, and I told her that she is the first person I'm really excited to meet after a long time before my last failure in love, I was trying to be cute, as we were in tune.

And now the bad part happened, she always called me gorgeous or cute, but now she just called me ""boy"", as she didn't even know my name, and said that she's not ready for that because her last bad experience was very recently. Suddenly, all the plans we were making to dating disappeared and she is acting like nothing romantically happened between us, like we were friends. This was so confused to me, but she said we could keep getting to know each other, but I don't if I want it anymore.

This made me come here and ask for advice, because I'm afraid that she's justing lying to me like other girls did to me in the past, as the same time I understand how she felt, because as I said, I lived the same things. I don't want to be a callous idiot unable to understand hurting people, but at the same time I don't want to be fooled again, I want to spare myself another disappointment.

But what if she really likes me but it's just not ready to meet someone yet? I that case, I would understand, I would support here and make her believe that she can trust me, that I won't betray her trust like many people did with us.

I definitely don't see her as a friend, and I guess I never will.

This is a long story but I’m gunna try to keep it as short as possible.  I developed a crush on my friend of 3 years around October/November but never said anything because he’s my friend and I didn’t want to risk our friendship for something that might not last. But New Years came we ditched his friends to hang out drink and play a card game. That night I told him how I felt but he didn’t remember the next day cause of how much we drank so I decided that was a sign and that I should keep it to myself. 

Fast forward 2 weeks we got a hotel to do shrooms because we both live with people. That night while we were sleep he cuddled me really close but when we woke up we didn’t acknowledge it and just went about our day. The next day we ended up getting another hotel just cause and again he cuddled up to me really close again but this time he kissed me and we had sex. 

Cut to valentines week we had sex the 12th and early on the 13th like 1:45am he calls just to say hi. And after that I haven’t heard from him since. 

(A little background he’s the only person I’ve had sex with since I got out of a really toxic long term relationship and as my best friend he’s asked in that time why I don’t have hookups or anything and I told him it’s cause I know I’d get attached and I wasn’t looking for that since it’s only been a year that I’ve been single.) 

then on the 17th he responded to my snap chat saying if he didn’t like me he could have told me and he went on to say he didn’t have me blocked but that his phone was broken and had to get it fixed and getting it fixed made him lose his contacts then he called me but I declined because I was upset (and that didn’t add up cause he’s got an Apple Watch and could have easily gotten my multiple texts and calls plus his friend said he spoke to him Valentine’s Day) I told him his excuse didn’t make sense and he reassured me that’s what happened but I still haven’t heard from him since he said that. 

I text him the other night asking if he wanted to come over and drink because I wanted to talk to him in person but he didn’t respond. Part of me wants to call him and confront him because this makes no sense and my feelings are beyond hurt. I don’t understand what’s going on or why he would do this but also part of me knows men are just sadistic and I thought he was different but maybe not? I feel so stupid

Ok now that I read what I wrote all the detail is kind of cringey but oh well whatever.

So I (22M) messaged this girl (21F) on tinder last week. And things went well and I asked her out pretty quick and she was enthusiastic about it and even offered me her number. She almost always took a couple hours to respond to every message but, you know, that's tinder, no big deal. When I got her number I texted her within a few minutes with the intent of having like a 10-15 minute conversation before leaving her alone for a day or two (since our date was scheduled for 5 days from then). But then she always took anywhere from 2 to 12 hours to respond. Anyway we had this short conversation that just kept going with both of our responses having several hours in between. The only time I got quick responses was a couple hours before the actual date, talking about logistics and what not since I was picking her up. But our texts were pretty flirty (mostly or entirely from my side, but she was playing along). And they were pretty all sarcastic jokes and whatnot, very little ""getting to know you"". But I did in a joking matter ask her for a kiss, and she said I just might get one.

Anyway we went on the date yesterday and it was ok. I'd rate it 6.5-7/10. I think her personality is just kind of dry but I like it because I'm also naturally like that. I can rarely tell if girls like me on the first date tbh because they are all a tad cold (when I get to know them better, they all say it was because they were nervous). So we're leaving the place and I'm almost at her apartment and I tell her that my roommates are hosting a pregame (to sort of explain why I didn't offer going there in the first place). I ask her where I should park, so she asks me if I want to come upstairs. Like the idiot I am I say ""Yeah, if you want"". Should've just said omitted the last part...Then she says ""actually I think my roommate has her boyfriend over and they're annoying blah blah blah"". It sounds like an excuse to me but idk. So I pull up in front of the entrance and she thanks me for the conversation and the drinks. She then leans over real quick to kiss me, but it's by far the worst fucking kiss I've had in my 22 years. She did not even open her lips a bit, it's like she didn't really want to do it. If she wanted just a peck, that's cool, but just pull away instead of continuing to stay leaned in. Then she said ""I'll see you again... maybe"". I don't remember exactly but the there may or may not have been a pause before the ""maybe"". I'm definitely just projecting shit into my memory now but oh well.

I texted her like 30 minutes after saying ""you forgot to slap me :( "" because it was a joke we made earlier. She texted ""oh shit. Sorry :("" I then texted her that I enjoyed talking to her, and I've not heard from her since. She definitely saw the text. I guess she was just not into me. Unfortunately, I'm really into her. Shooting one last shot couldn't hurt I guess. What should I say exactly without sounding too desperate? (I am though, she's hot af).

Anyway, thanks, none of my friends are being helpful right now...

27F, been on and off the dating apps for years. I’ve complained to my mother enough and she has always reassured me that I just haven’t found the right one, been hearing this since I was 21.

This is a topic I've seen mentioned a lot lately on Reddit and IRL and I wanted to impart my thoughts...

I believe the friendzone isn't real. For most cases, what we consider the ""friendzone"" is just the enlightenment that the partner was never into us to begin with, especially if this happens early on after meeting and that's okay, the attraction is just not there. I feel the fear of the""friendzone"" is killing a fundamental part of romantic relationships and that's having a genuine friendship as a foundation with your partner so that ""as looks fade"" with age, the bond remains. If we fear seeking that friendship we tend to over think our actions, do things that may not be natural, or slowly become someone else trying to impress someone because we""don't want to enter the friendzone"" when in essence, you just weren't meant to be from the beginning and that's okay.

Some of my best relationships stimmed from people I met whilst being myself and we naturally clicked as we transitioned into a romantic relationship. A lot of the fundamentals of a friendship are pillars that we hold dear in partners as well! I have also met people who I've found attractive yet they didn't return the same interest. And that's okay. They were never interested. The spark was never there for them. We acknowledge and we move on. Whether or not you continue after meeting into just a friendship is up to you two but remember moving forward there is no interest there.

NOW, I do understand that there are people who will act attracted and display a wanting to be in a relationship just for sex or to keep someone around or pinning after them when the other party truly wants a romantic relationship. This is NOT what I'm talking about in this post, this is abuse and you should get out of it.

PS: Although there's a slim chance your best partner may be one of your friends and you don't know it yet, I am NOT saying to try and start dating through your friends. Not at all what I'm trying to convey at all.😂",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160189,public,self,The Friendzone Does Not Exist,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sx59p4/the_friendzone_does_not_exist/,no_ads,0.0,,

A few months pass, and we become really good friends. We hung out almost everyday studying and so forth. I still just wanted to be her friend, since I really liked her as a friend at this point. Then she starts flirting with me. Casually.  


I flirt back. And we start dating - about three months ago. Then a month later, it felt like everything changed. She became distant. We stop hanging out like we did as friends. She only asks to hangout whenever she needs help on her homework. She always tells me she hanging out with a friend of hers.  I barely if ever talk to her unless its via text.   


Then last month, she stops talking to me for about half a week. Finally calls me when I messaged her saying I was really worried about her. Tells me she thought our dating was a joke. But tells me she can't talk to me or hangout with me anymore, since she's seeing someone else who told her not to. I'm shocked.   


Later that day, she texts saying she wants to talk again. I'm confused but I agree. She calls me that night says she wants to be friends still, but we have to be friends in secret.   


At this point I'm not just hurt, I feel like an object of hers. I get angry, probably the first time ever to her. After that, she hasn't spoken to me again.

I'm confused. What the hell was this? And if we weren't dating, we were friends though. So that makes me wonder, was I ever a friend to her as well? I never have felt so used.

However, I feel like I am in a place where I can not commit to her as much as I would like. I am finishing up my senior year of university and am In the process of applying to jobs and grad schools. I wish I had the time to see her as much as I could but very often I end up feeling too drained to meet up and I need to cancel our dates.

It has become stressful for me trying to maintain our relationship and sometimes I feel like it would be better for both of us to break up.

One thing that keeps me from doing so is that this has become a pattern for me. The past few relationships I've had I really liked the person but thought I was too ""busy"" to have a serious relationship.

She did apologize for being ""bad with snaps"" and gave me her phone number, but the average response time is still about the same. I originally chalked it to her being busy, but I noticed her texting other people frequently during class, and she posts on her story a few times a day.

A while back roughly 2 years ago when I came back home from my deployment I started using Online Dating as one of my only means of meeting woman. Most of my friends back home sorta drifted apart and did not really want to ""go out"" like we used too. Most of the people I hang out right now are really only interested in going to our shooting range trips and hitting a small bar afterwards. Finding people to hang out with at work in my range bracket can be somewhat difficult as most are significantly older and have their own families.

Fast forward, most of meet ups with woman off these sites never really went anywhere. They typically turned into hook ups, friends with benefits, or just either myself or the other wasn't that interested. I actually did find some success and wound up in a short term realtionship that lasted roughly 4 to 5 months however I ended it as I found my feelings weren't really developing for the individual. I don't find it too difficult to find woman to meet up with on the site however the more difficult feat is trying to find woman that I'm attracted too. It's not necessarily looks but I find most to be bland and lack a personality.

Anyways, recently I matched with a girl that seemed to be pretty interested in me(23F). Constantly messaging and was the one to initiate meeting up (1 maybe 2 days of talking online). Typically, I try to talk to people for a bit before meeting however did not really think this time all the way through.  Anyways I kind of made the sorta bonehead decision to invite this girl to my house as I was just coming home from a military drill weekend and recently canceled my plans with one of the girls that I am FWB with. The plan was to meet at my house and go out somewhere however we ended up just staying at my house the whole night til 2am. To my Suprise, I actually found myself to be quite attracted to this girl looks wise and personality (Super rare for me, maybe like 2 girls over last 2 years) . The convo between us two seemed to flow fairly well. Its rare to find a girl that can be quite as talkative to me and be able to talk about literally anything (Working out, Movies, Fucked up stuff, Politics, etc). 

Without going into too much detail about this person, I did find some red flags in this girl. Such as bad family background, Mental health issues, arrested but never convicted at one point in time for assault battery, and spilling quite a bit of information to someone she doesn't really know at all. I had all this in the back of my head. Either way as were talking things got heated up and led to my bedroom. She initiated coming on to me and I went with. We head up to my bedroom and she whispered something something under her breath like "" This all you dudes do"". So I was like hold up what is going on. She started talking to me about how she hates hook up culture and such. I preceded to say how we dont have to do this and how I just thought that's where you were going with this. Anyways after talking in my bed. She put herself onto to me and started trying to initiate again. I went with and afterwards we continued talking normally. Overall, this left me super confused. 

When she left my house later on that night, she was saying how she would snap a picture of the office(She was telling me about a new job she started) and to talk to her tomorrow. Even with all the potential issues I planned to continue to talk to this girl and did not really think any of this through. Over the course of the week she would snap me for short periods of time than go into silence. Mid way through the week we made plans to actually go out to a place. Eventually she stopped snapping me. I would try to start a convo and she would leave it on ""read"". So wasn't to bothered by it I thought maybe shes not that interested or that because of her family life she might just have issues going on. 

Valentines day comes and I get a message out of the blue from her asking if I am free. Knowing very well that probably not the best of ideas. I stupidly offered because of her family issues that if she needed anyone to talk too or wanted to talk to in person that she could. So she ends up showing up to my house. Instantly regretted offering that anyways she comes to my house. It was super awkward. I go on to ask what happened she goes on to say reason she stopped messaging me was because she got into her own head that it would only turn into a friends with benefits type of deal because she thought I was just wanting to talk to her to hook up. She precedes to say that the only reason she deiced to hit me up again was that she needed a place to go(Sorta figured this). I went on to say that I actually kind of liked you and was genulily interested in getting to know you more to see if anything would transpire out of this.  I tell her it is what it is and that I apologize that I gave you the impression that I was some sort of ""F boy"".

She started to walk back persay from her original thoughts of not really wanting to have anything to do with. Like she started to try to cuddle with me, asking me to go to a bar with her sometime. After she leaves Im in a whole bunch of confusion and just on quite a emotional ride. Next day I try to snap her ignores me walks back again saying she sorry for using me says she wont hit me up again then within in the hour goes back to saying lets hangout. Then precedes to ignore.

So I stepped back to actually think all this through and asked myself WTF I was doing. I think intially because of being actually attracted to her I wasn't thinking so cleary. So after clearly thinking best decision was to block and not look back. This person was very charmastic and it seemed like she was trying screw with my head after I said I was Interested in her and not just her body. This whole short train of events left me wicked confused and extremely bothered. Not sure how I let my guard down and let any of that transpire. Whole thing made me not very interested in continue to meet up with any girls. Ended up killing the convo with the two other girls I was talking too. 

To be honest I have no clue if any of the stuff that I was told was true or not. I have no clue what her intentions were at all. I just feel really really dumb with all that happened.

Of the weight of it beside him that he may look over and see its skin texture and hair that he might think, this is what it looks like to have a woman beside me?

A man may be lonely because he might have social issues like shyness, or might feel pathetic, and it is a real woman's job to show him he can be loved, a real woman's love can overtake and replace the doll, but don't let a doll frighten away the love needed to replace it. A man may have a doll but will never forget, a dolls embrace is like a gentle spill compared to the feeling of the title way felt by a real woman's embrace, he will never forget this.

&amp;#x200B;

I can tell you that women who think this need to get with the reality that sex dolls are part of the future and women need to get over it, because judging people is a very evil and cold hearted thing to do.

 If you say no just because a man has one, don't be evil and say no, actually talk to the guy and idk maybe find out who he has it. 

If you love a person, it shouldn't matter what kind of toy or device he has, you are loving him for him, not what he has.

&amp;#x200B;

JUDGMENTAL AND IMMATURE TOWARDS MEN ON LOVE

American women in particular are raised with they belief that they deserve the best, yet they have no reason why they deserve it. Why because your attractive, because your special in some way, magic power, because of who you were born from? Are you some kind of royal or noble?

Women always want the best yet they never once say why they deserve the best, they think their entitled just by existing. This is the thinking of a very broken minded girl/women.

Love is not about getting the best, it isn't about having the best house and kids and car and so on.

REAL LOVE DOES, EXIST! BUT MOST WOMEN HATE IT AND DONT BELIEVE IN IT!

Love, love is a girl who finds a boy and without a care in the world about his defects or his negatives.  Her love will lift him and caress him like pebble within a river. 

Love is a wind that carries you like a petal through the wind, it is the feeling of the flutter of your heart and its embrace upon your mind and body that fills you with joy. 

A joy that cannot be described in any language except a language only spoken and understood by the heart itself.

Love is the feeling of a quake from within every time you see him, your heart will tremble as if it was freezing. A heart filled with love cannot see the flesh of the other, only the heart of the other can it see and embrace.

Someone once told me humans used to have two heads and two hearts and 4 legs and hands, and that their creator thought it was an ugly design and separated them thinking they would be better off only to realize 1000 years later, it was a mistake. And that each one separated will spend their lives looking for their other half.

&amp;#x200B;

Love doesn't care about what you look like, it doesn't care about your stupid house, your dumb super car, your ugly wallet filled with millions. Trash it, all of it, if a material object or anything of the earth influences your decision to love him, than that, is not true love, it is artificial love that was crafted from the lust of that which he has.

Love will make you cry over HIM, long for HIM, desire to embrace HIM. Love is like a song, when your with the one you love, love will flow through you and your heard will dance the world away with him and together they will become one and will live forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

  Its a shame, it's truly sad, women judge me because of a fetish, or object, because of a situation financial or otherwise the lords biggest tears come from the sight of a child turning away another because of the troubles he may have picked up from living in a society that is purely satanic in nature.

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT IS TRUE LOVE?

You have financial trouble, then I shall lay what is mine with that which is yours, and together they shall lie in balance, you have a fetish, then we shall do it together, you have a sex doll, then rejoice, for you are mine and she is ours. You are democrat and I am republican, worry not, my love cares not for the belief of the mind but the flutter and warmth of thy heart only. You have no job and live off ssi, Then like water, I shall surround you and comfort you for my love knows no bounds. you are disabled, then I shall become your cane and aid you to stand and if that possibility never wakens, then my love shall carry you, my love for you is like water, no matter how ugly or broken you the stone, I will always flow around and surround you with my love no matter your appearance or defects, I would flow around a stone covered in damage and dirt in same, as I would a stone filled with gold and diamond, to reject you is to reject the creator.  

&amp;#x200B;

In truth I who post this as is all original, had a horrific childhood, and was never given opportunity to feel loved from another other than family, from being cursed with mental disorders like Tourette syndrome, manic depression, schizophrenia, bi polar all at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

 I was never able to get an education, and cannot now as I cannot hold the knowledge and freeze upon basic levels of sophistication, stayed in assisted living from age 20 to 29 hospitals from age 16 to 20, and currently live wholly off disability due to asperger's syndrome and lack of ability to work and live in an area where no store is in reach because of a bad knees that will give out before they are reached.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 36 and love the outdoors, and am active when possible art poetry and the lore of love, love stories, because love is the only one thing left that is pure.

If I die alone, I die knowing that love still lives on and as long as love exist, there is still good, and that alone makes me smile. I ask not for sympathy but only for understanding as to why, why in a world where true loves kiss actually does exist, so many choose to see only what a man has or how he appears and not who his is at his core, why do women choose to live, rather than to love. I have reached the age when men like me die, 36, and I have never been healthy so I know my time is soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask you, I ask you all, Judge not a man by what he has nor by what he is going through and see him for who he is, see him through your heart, not your eyes, not from your mind, because your mind can be influenced, do not ever trust it, only through your heart will you find true loves kiss, and if your love fills your heart from analyzation done by the mind, then the love is not real.

I’m working on myself in therapy though, and I’m more conscious of my actions and my feelings. Anyways, that’s why I’m asking this question.

I (21F) went on a date with a girl named Rachel (20F) this past Thursday. We’d been chatting for a couple weeks prior to then.

The date was only a couple hours long, which was nice because I felt like we were going at a normal slow pace of getting to know each other. At the end of the date, she kissed me and told me she’d love to see me again. I offered sometime later this week (about a week from our first date), to which she accepted!

A day later I texted her saying I had a great time and that it’d be fun to get together again soon. She asked my availability this week. I named a couple days. And then no response.

It’s been about a day and a half, and I know logically I could be overthinking. I haven’t texted her since to give some space. 

My question is, at what point in not hearing from someone should I accept that I’ve been ghosted? I’ve been ghosted before, so I’m kind of wary honestly.

This question being how on earth are men and women dating and meeting folks these days, especially single men? 

I’m currently 30 years old and never been in a relationship before. I can’t for the life of me attract women to date. Now don’t get me wrong, you’ll often here advice given to men that they need to put in the work to meet someone…well I have. 

For the last 5 years I have been busting my ass to turn my life around and be a valuable and desirable man. I landed a good paying job, live on my own with no roommates, brand new 2022 car, I hit the gym 3-5 days a week, I cook, travel, I’m sociable, know how to hold a conversation, smile, flirt and overall consider myself a confident and desirable guy you’d be proud to introduce to your friends or family; despite all this however I literally remain invisible to women. 

I put myself out there on the stupid apps, I’ve gone to local meetups, joined hiking groups and even picked up brand new hobbies like indoor rock climbing. I visit coffee shops, go to exhibits etc and to date, I have never in my life had a single woman agree to a date after asking her out in real life. 

Being a man, it just feels like an impossible task to try and date. You have to jump through so many hoops and play so many games: Don’t be desperate, don’t try to hard, play it cool, don’t show too much interest, don’t ask her out at work, build a rapport, be tall, be attractive, read the room, focus on yourself, look for signals and hints…etc etc like OMG! 

When, where and how exactly does anyone meet anyone these days that isn’t a superficial bloody online app!!?!? I’m a person of color and below average height for a guy at 5’7. Apps are complete waste of time for someone like me. I know am an attractive guy, but I really need someone to appreciate my fun sense of humor and personality and that isn’t going to happen on an app. 

I’m not saying I’m am the greatest guy in the world and I know I won’t be everyone’s type…but for goodness sake, I honestly feel like a guy such as myself should not be having this hard a time landing one single bloody date with a decent women. Also no, all my friends are married or in long-term relationships and don’t have any single friends to set me up with, trust me I’ve tried. Something I’ve learned quickly in my 30s is that people in relationships only ever have friends who are also in relationships.

Is anyone else struggling to date in 2022? For those in relationships where did you meet your person; how long did you have to wait? 

This is me, you be the judge

In between dates we talk casually through social media or text (I gave him my number, he said he didn't want to ask cos worried it would make me uncomfortable). 

He's made no moves. I've chickened out. I like for a guy to make a move at first to show me he's interested but I'm not against making the first move. Problem is it never seems to be an opportunity? 

At this point, I don't know if we're dating? Or more hanging out as a friends?

I don't want to put too much pressure because I was love bombed before and that hasn't worked. But I also feel somewhat insecure that he's not attracted or something and that's why no move has been made and no flirting has been done. Just good conversations each date. 

we also don't talk much in between dates. Or saying anything flirty to eachother which makes gauging interest very hard.

I'm not here for advice, I'm okay, I just want to chat about it :)Basically, my (first) boyfriend of 3 years has always made it clear that he doesn't like things like surprise kisses, long hugs, etc (he loves cuddling at night but during the day he really doesn't), At first, I thought that was a problem and that there was something wrong in the relationship, but the more I got to know him the more I noticed it's not about me or the relationship, he really just doesn't like being touched out of the blue by anyone. When I want to kiss him I always ask for permission first, and I have learned to not take it personally when he doesn't want it. He knows I do like touch, so he does shower me with kisses a couple of times a day. It's a good balance and I feel like we are very understanding of each other in that regard.

He is a quiet person and rarely talks about his past, but we were having one of these rare conversations the other day and I think I finally put two and two together about why he doesn't like too much skinship. I've realized from day 1 that his mother is very unaffectionate and is angry all the time, but only now do I realize how much that shaped him. He told me his mom worked long hours and basically neglected both her children. His dad took care of them and was more loving but he also had work, so my boyfriend basically spent his childhood alone at home. No touch, affection, or ""I love you""s from the parents. He even cooked for himself as a kid.

Now I see why he is so independent but also hesitant of touch. Also a great cook haha.

Modern dating, or the methods of modern dating are just not working. Sure, they work for a very small group of people. Mainly for the ridiculously attractive men. Those dudes wouldn't want to change a thing. But for the rest of us. We need a change. 

Now, I don't know how many of you have seen the ""Hang The DJ"" episode of Black Mirror. But I really think this could be a potential solution. A much more pragmatic solution to actually putting some rubber to the road.  And it starts with what love actually is. Sure, I still believe in the spiritual element of it, there is a component of it. That can just not be explained away. But, I also think there are much more tangible factors in love, or falling in love. And I think they are fairly obvious. The first is proximity, and the second is time. And with dating apps. Those very two important components are nullified.   


Hang The DJ's concept of dating, matches you at random with people, who on paper present as a strong probability of a match. And you are set to spend a pre-determined amount of time with them. You basically live with them. Which positions you to really get to know that person, experience them at both their best and their worst. If you haven't seen the episode, definitely watch it. But keep in mind the show is about dystopian/authoritarian worlds and systems, so there is a sinister element that presents itself in this concept. But once you remove that. You could make an argument that it could work, and it might even be interesting and fun.

I've been exclusively dating a girl I met at work for over 5 months now, and she is amazing--but I feel really disrespected by a couple of things she has done. I have worked in my industry for some time (about 5 years) and I always told myself I would never sleep with a coworker. This girl showed up to work one day to work with me and there was an instant attraction that changed everything. I set a date and we ended up hooking up the first night. Slowly over time, while I was expecting things to maintain casual--she started hinting on wanting something more and in short she ended up becoming my girlfriend. 

When we first started hooking up, she had mentioned this other guy at work, we'll name him ""John."" She always talked about him in a positive light, and because he has the same position as me--she worked with him very often before we met. I know him as a guy who hooked up with alot of women at work, had his own girlfriend there too at one point. Then I started hearing rumors that him and my now girlfriend were hooking up for a while. She had him on every social media platform and told me he was constantly asking if we would break up or making flirty comments to her, talking shit about my height. I confronted her about it, and she was upset, angry, and this was the first time I saw her pattern of lack of communication. She got very upset at only the people who told me, denied that they ever did anything beyond a platonic friendship and explained the story doesn't make sense. She had ignored me for some time after confronting her. I let it go, she eventually blocked him on all social media and we didn't bring it up beyond that.


Months later, she starts acting weird only the past couple of days. Valentine's day was great. Lately she has brought up that I have liked one of my exes photos on instagram and I still do it. She was upset with me over that, but I told her I wouldn't do it anymore. Then more recently, I discovered she hates my female coworker who I worked with for almost two years in my position. We're good friends, and while she is one of the people who told me my girlfriend was sleeping with this John guy, she has never showed animosity towards my girlfriend. When my girlfriend and I were hanging out, this coworker called me to talk about an incident at work--which after we talked on the phone my girlfriend was upset and shut me out. I tried talking to her about it, and she refused to talk about it. 

Then we didn't talk for several hours because she ignored me, and boom...I check her Instagram and all of a sudden this guy and her follow each other again. I was stunned, because after defending her to my coworkers she goes and does what in my opinion is not only immature but disrespectful as fuck. We had each other's location on snapchat, and all of a sudden she stopped sharing. So I confronted her about it over the phone with a calm voice (while I was angry inside) that I don't like this behavior and I'm thinking I'm done with our relationship. She said she didn't wanna talk in person. I told her if she really wants to salvage this relationship, she would meet me. She drove to my house and we talked, she cried. I feel like nothing got accomplished, but I basically apologized, reassured her that I only love her and no one else, but what she did to me really hurt and I'd like her to communicate with me instead of purposely trying to hurt me. She said the only reason she followed the guy was to piss me off. I told her if she wanted to stay with me she'd work on communication, and she agreed. I did basically give her an ultimatum and say that if she continues to dodge talking about conflict I can't continue seeing her forever. 

She drove home and is acting distant since last night but started sharing her location. She usually texts very lovingly but it's clear she's still not interested in talking right now. 

I'm seeking advice because I feel like I'm losing my mind over this, filled with anxiety.

Was dating a 23F recently. I'm 28M. Met of Hinge. We weren't exclusive.

Hit it off great. 3 great dates over 3 weeks - 1 a week is how I like to do it in the early stages. We both stopped round each others', real intimate and affectionate, great sex, cuddling all night, she told me how pretty she thought I was... held my hand on the 3rd date.

We'd planned to go to the cinema for the 4th date. A few days after the 3rd date she messaged to see if I wanted to go to some galleries or hang out. I was busy all day with my best mate and had a house viewing, so said we could get food on the evening. She said she'd love that, but then had to cancel later to get some work done. I don't know whether that was true or not but I believed it.

I said no worries, let's stick with the cinema date, which she said was still all good, then asked me how the house viewing was.

I sent her a voice note about the house viewing and suggested I download the film, cook us dinner and watch it at mine because it was no longer showing at the cinema we said we'd go to, or that we could just go to a different cinema. Wasn't even a minute long. I hadn't sent a voice note before this. We'd just been messaging, somewhat intermittently throughout the 3 weeks.

Then the next day she messages to say she's been really confused and doesn't think this is right for her atm.

I was so surprised! It was such a u-turn and I'm still really confused about it.

Obviously so much can happen in the early stages of dating, maybe she woke up the next morning and decided she wasn't feeling it, maybe there was someone else, but a huge u-turn like this when she seemed so keen has really left me baffling.

So do you think it was the voice note suggesting the film round mine, or do you think there was someone else in the picture? To cancel the ad-hoc date then call things off the day after makes me think that she went out with someone else the evening she cancelled.

I feel lonely at most nights. I don't feel comfortable talking to women anymore.   
I got bullied basically my whole childhood because I was too nice and naive. Then at some point I put on some weight because of that and because I was on medication and the bullying got worse. Because of the bullying I didn't have any self esteem. The medication was because I got (have) 2 chronic deseases that hindered me to live my life for about 2 years. It was the age of about 13-15 with intense pain. So because of all that I lost my will to live and questioned myself (at 13-15 years old) ""why do I have to stay alive?"", I fell into deep depression caused by physical pain and the bullying. T some point I had such extreme that I was unable to walk.   
So because of the pain I stayed at home lying in bed and was suffering with the pain. The only thing I did was play video games and listen to music to distract myself from the pain.

I was also often thinking about that even if the physical pain ends, the bullying and the mental pain wont stop. But when these physical pained days ended, I put a stop to the bullying I received. I got a little physical with the ones bullying me and because I was always always the biggest and strongest and stood up for myself and . I gained a huge amount of self esteem, because I also got insanely good grades the first year without pain.   
I always had a good  mood, because I was happy to be alive and with only little pain that still remained that was nothing compared to earlier. Then a little delayed because of these hardships, started my serious interest and curiousity to the opposite gender. I started to talk more to girls eventually got my first girlfriend that broke up almost immidietly and broke my heart, because i was head over heels for her. I got dumped or put into the friendzone a few more times and with each time my hard earned self esteem and confidence reduced until there was almost none left. Now I have no courage left to talk to girls I am interested on the street. I don't even believe in any compliments I am given because I think of myself lacking in every aspect, looks, skills .... Now I just spend my free time playing video games, because that was always my escape from the reality and pain, that helped me especially in the time I suffered because of those chronic deseases. But now even playing video games, watching series, movies, anime and listening to music doesn't fill the hole in my heart that I have been feeling lately. I don't feel comfortable telling this to someone I know personally, even to my best friend, that is basically my brother because of how long we know each other. I am on the verge of tears even thinking of telling this to somebody personally because of how much this pains me. I just feel the need to find ""the one"" and give my love unconditionally. The problem is, she won't find me, I need to find her and I won't be able to find her if I just stay cooped up at home and play video games in my entire free time. I know the problems I have, but I don't have the courage and motivation anymre to do something about it. I actually lost my motivation to do anything at all and everytime I go to sleep I hope I don't wake up because of how exhausted I am of everything.  
I just need someone to pet my head, brush their fingers through my hair, and just give me a hug.  
How do I get the motivation, the courage, and confidence to find somebody like that?

As the title says, last night I went on a date with a girl from one of my classes. I started talking to her about a week ago. Leading up to the date last night, we texted about once a day. It feels like the date went well. We went to a fun bar near both of us, I walked her home, and we kissed goodnight. At the end, I was feeling nervous whether or not she viewed it as a date so I told her I saw this as a date, she said she did too, and we both agreed we wanted to see each other again. She also asked me to text her when I got home ( I did). 

I haven't gotten a text back yet which has me feeling a bit nervous/in my head so now Im questioning if it really was a good date, whether she actually wanted to kiss, etc. I ""logically"" know she's most likely busy because she has two essays due for different classes this week she said she was planning on working on today.

She wants to end it but financially she can’t get out on her own yet with her kids who are the most important thing in her life. Her current boyfriend who I’ve met is a total idiot to her and treats her badly and spends little to no time with the kids.

Anyhow we’ve spoken about our relationship, we’ve slept together multiple times and it’s absolutely amazing in every respect. She says she can be ready to move out in September/ October financially and then needs a few months to live alone with the kids before we get serious so they get used to not having their dad around.

It was embarrassing to say the least. She got her orgasm at least, which I'm thrilled about. I just hate that I couldn't perform for her, but she also seemed very supportive of me.
