8,mzn4bt,1619525741,How to attract better men on dating apps: a guide," 

First thing first, you need to optimize your profile. Most women post pictures with the same facial expressions and do nothing special. You need a picture of you where you clearly see your face. You need to smile with your eyes in that picture and not just with your lips. It will make you look 100x more attractive. I have never met a woman that was happy and not attractive. Men are attracted to joy, not just physical beauty. I remember hanging out with a friend that I find more attractive than me. I received great news when I was with her and had the biggest smile on my face. When I started to smile two men who were together stopped what they were doing and looked at me as if I was the most precious thing. My friend looked at me and said “they’ve just fallen in love with you”. When a dude looks at you like this, it’s random. But when it’s two men at the same time, it means you are doing something right. From now on, stop worrying about being pretty enough. Worry about having enough joy in your life. When you are truly happy, you shine from within. 

You need another picture of you being playful. Post a picture of you in your halloween costume. Post another picture of you working out and one where we see your body shape. It doesn’t matter what it looks like, we are all someone else’s baddie. It’s true that looking like an Instagram model helps attract more men, but being attractive is not what makes men fall in love. We all have hot friends that have an amazing personality that get ghosted by men. Why? They don’t act like the prize and don’t do what I teach here. Doing what I teach here is what makes men fall in love. You don’t need all men to like you. You can only date one guy at a time. You will notice that just by practicing this, more men will want to date you. Femininity is truly powerful.

In your description, avoid sentences like “no hookups please”. It makes you sound very negative. I totally understand why you are sick of men who just want to sleep with you. Remember that you have all kinds of fish in the ocean. If a guy just wants to hookup, block him and move on to the next one.

Stay playful in your bio and say something like “my ideal date would be a leg day session followed by pizza”.

When you get a match, let him initiate contact with you. Men are very visual, if they find you attractive, they will message you. If he doesn’t initiate contact with you, all it means is that you were a “why not”. It’s not all black and white. Even for you. Some men are a “why not” others are “OMG! I want his kids”. Your first task when you meet any man is to figure out how interested he is in you. 0% interest means “she can die”, 100% interest means “I am madly in love”. You want a man whose interest in you is already at 80% when they look at you. Below that, you will have to work for his love, he will expect 50/50 in effort, money, and energy or worse, expect you to give him everything while he gives you bread crumbs.

When he messages you, say something playful like “Help me choose my nail polish color”. Men who are just looking for a hookup don’t like playful things like this. They want to go straight to the sex talk. This tip will help you weed them out.

After talking with them for a while, say “I am sick of texting, give me a quick call. I want to know if your voice is sexier than mine ;)”. Let him ask you for your number.

Once he messages you on WhatsApp, block him on the dating app. He should not see if you’re still on there talking to other men.

9,mzr6ef,1619537785,Do men lie about wanting kids on dating apps?,"Hi men! I’m a 38f who doesn’t has kids and doesn’t want to have kids (okay if partner already does).

It seems like MOST men, even those over 40, have the preference “want kids.” Sometimes they match with me and I mention it as a dealbreaker. Some say, “I don’t want them in the near future” or “it’s too soon to be talking about that.” These response seem like they’re just looking to hook up (like, don’t date a 38yo woman who wants a relationship), but my real question is...

Are men 38+ putting they WANT kids to get more matches? Because it’s messing with my algorithm because I weed them out. And although I have no desire to be dishonest, it makes me feel like I should just put “open to kids” and let men bring it up if it’s a dealbreaker.

16,mzugtd,1619546337,Playing on sympathies?,"Oof, I’ve been having a rough time of it lately, and thought I might re-enable my profile to meet someone to hang out with. Met someone who sounded chill, but I ignored a couple of, frankly, orange flags. He was overly familiar and complimentary before meeting, and would veer into preemptive rejection territory (you’re so successful/pretty/blah, blah, blah, you would never want me). I’m not a particularly socially skilled person, so I would just say preemptive rejection makes me unable to tell if you’re interested, because I have no interest in some weird cycle of having to talk someone off the ledge all the time.

So...met, hung out for a couple of days, and it was pretty good, although he pushed a couple of boundaries that made me uncomfortable. Monday I got a text to have a heavy conversation. He claimed to be a Jeckyll and Hyde, and actually depressed and negative. Also said he’s not my man, and went more negative, to the point of insinuating he was suicidal. It didn’t sound genuine. I’ve struggled with depression, I’m sensitive to mental health struggles, it sounded like throwing the kitchen sink at a failed manipulation tactic. I immediately knew how this was going to go, because I’ve heard a variation of this on this forum, and DOT, a million times.

&gt;Person 1: comes on really strong. Makes big promises trying to get someone on board
&gt;Person 1: I just don’t have the capacity to love and give you what you need because I’m so broken inside, I always hurt everything I touch 
&gt;Person 2: I can help heal you, so you can love again
&gt;Person 1: I guess that would be ok
—-six months and a lot of bullshit later——
&gt;Person 2: Why do you always hurt me and bang other people? 
&gt;Person 1: I told you I was broken and hurt everything I touch. It’s your fault, I warned you!

So yeah, I wished him the best of luck and blocked him. Proud of myself for blocking immediately, but wish I’d blocked him after the orange flags. A variation of playing on my sympathies has happened to me before, and I’ve spent longer feeling obligated to be a nice person, or worried they were going to hurt themselves. 

Does this happen to everyone, am I attracting them with my profile? I feel like I want to stay open and vulnerable to the right person.

17,mzvfhw,1619548902,She ended it,"I’m confused and could do with some advice. I’ve been dating an amazing woman I met online for the last 8 months which has been difficult during lockdown. She has children and I have a daughter which she was keen to meet and it’s sometimes difficult to meet each other due to work and child care so there is a week when she has her kids where we don’t see each other. 

I’ve been divorced for 2 years and this was my first serious relationship since dating a few women. I realised a few weekends ago that I have been hesitant in arranging her to meet my daughter because I was self protecting myself due to nerves about taking the next step. Scars from my divorce I guess. She thought I had doubts about her and was concerned about the future of the relationship. Anyway I thought about my feelings for her and not being with her anymore and realised that I really do love her. So I told her last week. 

I wasn’t expecting her to say it back but she was pleased and we had a nice evening together and she still needed to think about how she felt so I gave her the space she needed. I got a text from her 2 days ago saying she missed me and we were planning to meet on Sunday to talk more.

I received a text from her today saying that she thinks we shouldn’t meet and she’s sorry and doesn’t want to hurt me and I mean a lot to her but it’s over. I’m devastated. She said she text me because she didn’t want me to wait until Sunday.

I matched with a gal on Bumble, we texted a bit, decided to meet up for a walk in the woods, it went well. She's really busy with school, work, and kids. But she kept making time for us and basically asking me out. I have a more flexible schedule so it worked out. 

I was a little indifferent with my feelings towards her, but I felt there was something there I couldn't put my finger on. So fast forward \~7 weeks, we've seen each other about 10x. We've hiked, ice skated, biked, grabbed drinks, snuggled by a fire, had dinner out, she invited me to her place and made me dinner, I invited her to my place and made her dinner. We've had conversations about boundaries and expectations. I've been watching for green, orange, and red flags, so far so good. The more time I spend with her the more I like her. She made it clear fairly early that she is romantically interested in me, we both agreed that we want to take it slow, have clear communication, and don't want to lead anyone on or hurt each other. We've been open and honest with our dating history since our marriages were over. 

Things have progressed to the physical level and it was awesome for both of us! We're making plans to spend a couple of nights at my cabin on the ocean 2 hours away this week. We're both really looking forward to it. 

I picked up the bad habit of using tobacco during my divorce. She doesn't know I smoke...but I've decided this is the exact catalyst I needed to push me over to the side of ""it's time to quit"". I feel it would probably be a deal breaker for her. She's very active and healthy. I'm active too, but could be more healthy. I have the tools, the motivation and the drive to stop this nasty habit that no longer serves me. There's nothing good about it, so I'm done and moving on to a happier, healthier, better me!

She had a FWB in the past. They saw each other occasionally and sounds like it typically resulted with sex. Just found out they are still in contact. Only once (texting and messages but never talked)  since we became exclusive but did not meet up. He was ""passing through"" and asked if she wanted to grab a bite to eat. She didn't really try because she was not sure what I would think is what she told me. She never told him yes but never told him no. They played phone tag. She did not tell me for a week. It came up because a female friend, who is attracted to me, but we have never dated, held hands, kissed, nothing romantic or intimate had texted me and she saw it. I don't even find this female friend to be GF material for me and my GF knows I talk to her.

I am uncomfortable with her being in contact with someone she has been intimate with. He is 22 years younger than her and while drunk she described as ""fucking hot"" I told her it bothers me but she would not budge on their ""friendship.""

She says they have been friends and helped each other through hard times and never hooked up while she was seeing someone. 

She keeps saying I have a female friend so she can have a male friend. I don't disagree but not a male she has had as FWB.

24,mzxm69,1619554794,"Dating during the Pandemic went wrong, for lack of Trust and privacy BS.","Hello everyone, I hope you can help me to understand this a bit better. I am (40M) my future ex GF is (35F) we met on CMB app and we started dating on October 2019. When the Pandemic began, we decided to move together on March and try to see what happens. We had Couple fights, adjusting to live together, normal issues, nothing big. Also we went into survival mode With the lockdown and the quarantine.For a few months we were in honeymoon state, didn’t last long, everything started to fall a part on June last year. Bc unmasked a perv which it was following her for a while (apparently her “friend” for about 7 years). I found out her password and decided to access to her phone, to find out info about it and she lie on my face about her perv/friend. This individual was asking for naked pics, used underwear, videos and also webcam sex (including after couple months in our dating) for her, doing all this stuff was “normal”, but not for me. So when I found out I was shocked, I told her to stop this sick relationship and focus on us. She decided to start a WAR on trust, very angry at me bc I broke into her privacy (which I would never have found it out otherwise). She said, she felt violated, bc I searched her text. Also my therapist couldn’t believe it, she decided to protect him instead of our relationship.
Personally I am very transparent in relationships, they will have my phone password, access to my laptop, etc. I don’t have nothing to hide from my past or my current present, so I am very trusted man.

Since that day, everything went down the hill, sex, talking, weird moments, so it went vanilla really quick. Lockdown didn’t help with her mental health, she takes prescription meds like a drug cocktail, for anxiety, depression, you name it is in there.
On my end, I did special dinners, games, walks, hikes, do fun stuff during quarantine to keep our relationship interesting and afloat. None of that was enough or make her happy, she already has decided I am not the one and it felt she was tolerating me for all this time, bc she didn’t want it to feel alone during the Pandemic. She started to listening to these third parties (Mostly her big bulk of male friends for advisers)  they gave her advices how to get rid of me or saying things against me or help her how to end it. She mentioned to one of them; that she was stuck in a “Shitty relationship” with this Pandemic.

I might have some jealousy issues (which I am working on). But with her history of a very promiscuous past, never married, few stable relationships which only last 1 year max + the combo with the perv/sick “friend”, it wasn’t helping with my trust issues. 
Now we are both vaccinated, things are getting back to normal. After she cut on sex almost completely, she decided to start seeing friends. She came to tell me she needs some time to be alone (or going back on the dating world and do sausage fest IDK). 
Well definitely she is not ready for a serious relationship/commitment or she doesn’t want a family or get marry (which she keeps saying “she deserve to get a ring, a wedding and a husband”) I feel very betrayed, used, it feels I wasted my time with her. Bc I am 40 and I don’t like to play games, when I go, I go all in. I am very disappointed, I know I need to start over, I guess and move forward, but still some BS using me as a COVID/convenience: for safety bubble, safety sex, comfort, emotional support, etc.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mzxm69/dating_during_the_pandemic_went_wrong_for_lack_of/

Things that make me think scam:

- professed love quickly
- used a fake location on their profile (Miami, FL - I am in upstate NY)
- found my profile and messaged me first
- highly attractive (not like out of my league supermodel, but definitely a gorgeous woman)
- refused to video chat
- eventually asked me for money for her business (clothes making)
- when I refused to send money she immediately got offended that I didn’t trust her and tried to make me feel guilty about it

Things that make me think she was real:

- she sent me tons of pictures, including pictures of family
- she revealed many personal details, including names of family members
- she had Instagram and TikTok accounts that looked legitimate
- we talked every day.  She used a translator for texts.  She would send voice texts, but couldn’t speak English well at all, so they would be basic phrases, but they would be in line with the conversation.
- She gave me an address to send her a Christmas gift (running shoes, it was my idea to send something).  The address was in the city she claimed to live in, and when they arrived she sent a pic of her feet wearing them.

I was convinced for most of the time that she was legit, although I quickly realized that she was broke, and that any meeting was going to come completely at my cost.   But when she asked for money ($100)  I got pretty weirded out.  It’s a basic rule that you don’t send money to people you meet online that you haven’t met in person.  But her reaction was what pretty much made me lose interest.  I’m pretty much over it, but what bugs me most is I can’t decide whether this really was a scammer or not.  A lot of the typical scammer signs are there, but I just get this weird feeling she was legit, even though the odds of some gorgeous Colombian woman hitting up a gringo from NY on a dating app seems pretty slim.    

What do you think, scammer or real?  And how could I have handled it differently?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n01ypb/do_you_think_this_woman_was_a_scammer_or_not/

30,n02odx,1619569699,"OLD, The New Normal?","Maybe I'm totally off base, but I've never really been a fan of OLD.  I've always have a lot of fun meeting people out at concerts, pregaming sporting events, BBQs, wineries/breweries, etc.  I'm a big fan of the random conversation that turns into a friendship or even something more.  Some of the best interactions I've had were neither anticipated nor foreseeable.  The two people I've dated the longest since 2015 were both people I met while out being social.

OLD seems like all the worst bits of meeting people all rolled into one.  Fake profiles, scammers, suspicion levels amped up, and not least of all it seems very... ehh...  superficial. 

Maybe that's just the way it is in 2021.  I have my fingers crossed hoping for a less locked-down summer where people actually go out and meet each other randomly in public places.

Our breakup was rough (he had an emotional affair with a female colleague, swore there was nothing more than friendship between them, shacked up with her almost immediately, and used my settlement money to buy a house with her a year ago) so emotionally it has been hard. Especially since I can't easily get him out of my life.

I've done the work to deal with the heartbreak, learn from what happened, and move on. I've been dating a wonderful man who I met on Tinder in January, but I still keep dreaming about my ex and the so-called friend he took up with. Mostly those dreams are of him being with her and me feeling sad or hurt, and there is a lot of ""falling to my death from a height"" type stuff.

Last night I dreamt that I was talking to him, it was sad and awful, I fell from a height, and I landed on soft mattresses. It didn't hurt. I was safe.

Healing and moving on? Yes, I think so. And thanks to the posters on this subreddit for giving me hope.

40,n0g4iz,1619620348,I’m learning (when to walk away),"So I haven’t done online dating since I met my wife in 2007 and divorced in 2018. Frankly, before covid, I didn’t find I needed to. I don’t have a problem striking up conversations with people I find attractive and I have done well without apps and sites. But a couple weeks ago I decided it was time to generate some more dates and I had four dates in the last two weeks. One of them went exceptionally well. We talked for over three hours and had a phenomenal goodnight kiss. We both found a lot of common ground, had great chemistry, and I decided after the date to put other conversations on the app on hold. 

Perhaps I overshared when we were setting up the next date and I told her I put my dating app on hold, perhaps her discovering my housemate was a friend of hers and she’s very concerned about her reputation in the community, but for whatever reason, she’s giving me the slow fade. 

I used to try to fix things at this point. I used to want to make it clear I was acting out of respect when putting other dates on hold and not moving too fast and I used to try to make her try to understand that discretion was as important to me as it was to her. Hell, I still think about those things, but I’m not acting on it anymore. Fuck it. I have a half dozen other conversations going and I just set up an alternative date for the weekend. If I don’t hear from her again by tonight, I’ll book the rest of my weekend. 

I think I’m done chasing red flags.  This early part, the communication needs to be there. If she has concerns or fears or misunderstandings, if she cant address them now, this isn’t going to get any easier.

41,n0jug1,1619630320,Should I give up dating sites to find a solid connection in LA?,"I’m in my early 40’s, look younger than my age, aware that I’m attractive, an open book, adventurous, charismatic, social, ambitious, and speak multiple languages. But unfortunately I am emphatic and give people the benefit of the doubt so its burnt me in dating &amp; relationships.

I decided to end my failed 9yr marriage in the summer of 2018. Took some time to myself and last year the yearning for a true connection and chemistry with one man began to brew in me. I jumped into dating sites. I was hesitant but open to try. Times have changed and COVID made it impossible to meet new people in person. I decided to try CMB, then Hinge, Match and so on... The League, MM, JDate, JSwipe, Chispa, Eharmony, Bumble, DateMyAge, and Elite. Till I finally gave up last week. I never had more than 2 apps at a time but I kept thinking that I should try a different one with no success.

I always got hundreds or more of potential matches. I matched back with a fair amount but though their profiles claimed they were looking for love or a connection. They quickly wanted to take the chat out of the apps and meet up. Very little to no effort in chatting or talking before a meet up. Immediately rude once I declined after 2-3 messages. With the same “hru, wyd, hot, send pics, come over” messages. It’s like they are just into hookups or wanted nudes. I’m not one of those so no one got any. But it turned me off. I still tried to come back with some humor, a question to start a convo. Just wasted my time. 

I’m very clear that I’m not looking for hookups. There was a handful that communicated so I went out on dates but were insistent that I go to their place afterwards. Nope. Pass. Some had real outdated pics. Another let down. But I was still polite and stayed for the date.

Physical attraction is equally important to me as mental attraction with an empathetic, understanding, adventurous, ambitious, and youthful spirit. I know it’s not to much to ask for. Their definitely are single individuals out here in Los Angeles that are like this. Funny, accomplished, or working on becoming accomplished. But where?

How much more clear do I have to be that I’m not online for hookups but rather seeking a connection with tons of chemistry?? Or is online just not the way?

47,n0o6l7,1619642187,48M - Noob questions - How does this all work?," 

Hello all. I am 48M and am in the final stages of separating. My wife and I are finalizing our separation agreement, have worked out the joint parenting arrangement for of our 3 boys, and I am in process of purchasing a new home nearby. I will be closing on the house in mid-July and move in by the end of July / early August.  

The process leading to my divorce has been collegial and deliberate over 7 years, including various stints in couple’s therapy and plenty of personal therapy and introspection. Not to get too woo-woo, but, during that time, I have had the opportunity to do a lot of work on myself. I have a sense of gratitude for where I am, an understanding of my wounds, an appreciation and acceptance of the positive and challenging traits in my ex, and a sense of clarity of what I hope to build going forward. I am still working through my process, but feel ready to start to move on.  

My plan is to start dating again once I transition to my new house. My long-term goal is to find a new partner. However, I am not ready to dive into something super serious and monogamous at the moment. I know myself well enough to know that, while I do want to have sex, I am not looking for anonymous hook ups. It strikes me that the middle ground is the sort of casual dating / FWB. I’m attracted to smart women and specifically am now seeking warmth and fun. I’m a strong extrovert and look forward to meeting new, interesting people, even if it does not always result in sexy time. I’m also totally fine if a FWB transitions back to simply an F with no B as their situation evolves.  

That said, it has been a long time since I was single and it is new, very different world. I would appreciate it if people would give me advice or point me to resources to help me learn what I will need to do.

Specifically, what dating app should I use? It is geography dependent? What is an appropriate way to express what I am looking for without coming across as a sleazy old man? Are there appropriate OLD code words that I need to learn? How long does it take to meet someone?

My top priority is my kids; my availability for dating will be constrained by my time with them. Can I assume that is a given for people in our age range, or do I need to be explicit about that priority? I have my kids and don’t want more. I assume I need to be clear about that. Do the apps have appropriate categories to signal that?

From some of the posts that I’ve seen about OLD, it looks like much of that process involves ridiculous pick-up lines and a ludicrous amount of time texting on apps. Is that accurate or will there be people that respond to proper punctuation and normal discussions? What is the appropriate amount of in app texting before moving things to text / phone / in person? Are there things that I can do to make the women that I am meeting feel safe, given that they are meeting someone random from the internet?

Apologies if these are noob questions or answered elsewhere. I appreciate any help you may offer.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n0o6l7/48m_noob_questions_how_does_this_all_work/
48,n0pt7r,1619646825,No Self Worth,"
I was severely neglected as a child and raised by a narcissitic parent and then spent a good chunk of my adult life living with that parent who emotionally and verbally abused me. I had to keep staying at home due to mental health reasons, which, you guessed it, were caused by my childhood. 

I escaped. And until I got away, I did not understand how badly I was abused. I did not know that I had a right to take carenof myself, look nice, have a few nice things...It took me several months on my own not to he scared of people as I always thought they would yell at me like my parent would. I was jumpy. 

A few years later, I am better. I started dating at 38. It is late in life to do this I know. So this is embarrassing when dating because I do not have relationship history.

I still have not fully recovered. 

 I am finding that I have a hard time knowing if a guy is treating me right. I still have the tendency to think it is ok to let them walk over me and that I somehow owe them a free pass to do so.

The last guy I dated said he needed take a long break and be alone and then he ghosted me. Before that, he was hard to connect with him. He was moody. He would half listen to me and not take interestnin things i liked so I eventually would not discuss anything I likes. I tried to get back with him, why? No sense of self worth. No idea of what it is even.  

That guy also had a bad attitude toward women. I do not think he liked them other for sex and it showed. I always felt he thought I was spoiled and entitled. He thought that about his ex wife too and about his female relatives. When in fact I have worked my ass off for everything I have with no help from anyone. 

He would only be affectionate if he wanted sex. He would push for sex at times but then would not want to have it when ever I wanted it. We would only go places when he wanted to go and never on my time. He was over too much and eating to much of my food at my place. He was a dirty house guest. He would promise me one thing but then do something different and when confronted, it was my problem.

So stuff like this is not ok. 

I still do not have a full sense of self worth and I put up with this stuff far too long in relationships. 

I am getting better. But I still need help. Is there anyone out there who can relate?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n0pt7r/no_self_worth/

She still texted most days but after visiting recently I haven't heard from her in 3 days. I might be being ghosted :(","I \[41M\] was recently seeing a lady \[44F\] for a few months.  We met on a dating app.  Early on, she said she was looking for a friend who might lead to a long-term relationship.  She said at the time that she has depression &amp; anxiety and was bad at relationships.  I wondered how bad it was, because as we hung out, we really enjoyed each other's company and conversations.  Things were going slow, but I was developing feelings for her.  In time, we told each other we really like each other (and even were falling for each other). She seemed to be giving some signals too (kissed my cheek goodbye a few times, cuddled up a bit while watching TV a few times, held my hand once while out shopping).  We hung out almost once a week (a bit less) and were texting almost every day.

After a few months, just before she went home, I asked her if I could kiss her.  She said she wasn't ready for that - she said she enjoys my friendship but wasn't ready to take it further.  She also became more distant, texting me much less and not always replying to my texts.  She wouldn't text good morning or good night anymore (or reply to my good morning/night texts) like she used to.  We met for dinner and she talked about what she said, saying she has a lot of emotional trauma and has trouble with love, and although she has feelings for me and I'm the nicest guy she has met, she said she can't reciprocate and doesn't want to lead me on and feels it's best to be friends.  I don't argue.  She said she'd still want to hang out.

At that meeting, she had mentioned hanging out the upcoming weekend (which was this past weekend).  She said she wanted to play it by ear.  Saturday came and she said she had been sleeping much of the day (as she has issues with sleeping).  I asked if she was hungry, and she said she had ordered some food but I'd be welcome to come over and join her.  So I went over, we ate and hung out and watched some TV.  It was similar to how we had been hanging out before, and she was nice.  I asked a bit about what she had said, and that I remember her saying she was looking for a friend that might lead to something.  She said yes but not this soon.  I started to ask if she'd be open to anything in the future - she said ""what do you mean?"" and I said ""oh I dunno"" and dropped it.  We watched some more TV for a bit.  I asked if she'd want to hang out the next day (Sunday), and she said she'd text me.  She texted Sunday mid-day and said she had a bad headache (she gets those) and had to rest.  I said I hope she feels better.

That was the last I've heard from her now.  I texted to check in Sunday evening, and again to check in yesterday (Tuesday) evening but have still not heard anything from her.

It seemed we both liked each other and were developing a connection.  She said she'd still want to be a friend, but now I feel like she is ghosting me.  I feel like I've lost a friend, and it hurts.  I've been very heartbroken and feeling down over this, at least over the last several weeks since I asked if I could kiss her and she told me she isn't ready for a relationship.

But now that I've crossed this decade I have 10x more anxiety because of the man I'm looking for. I want to try for kids. I got divorced at 35 and spent 3 years getting over the abuse. At 38 I met the man of my dreams--never knew I could love a man so much, especially after my very painful divorce. Well this man had too much trauma of his own, including the death of a child 4 years earlier. I've been grieving all of this and freezing my eggs for the past year. I'm ready to try a 3rd time yet I fear my chances. It seems to me that some men in their 40s who have kids dont want more and some men who dont have kids want a woman in her 30s. Am I doomed? Not to mention 100% of the men \*I\* have dated, all in their 40s, are looking for chemistry and connection but not commitment--mostly because of trauma, which I get, but I want commitment. And that was when I was in my 30s.

Please can anyone give me hope? I tell myself that when the right person shows up, everything will fall into place.

66,n181o5,1619713364,"Heartbroken: Was seeing her for about 3 months, and she said she isn't ready for a relationship (can only offer friendship), and now no contact for ~4 days. I feel like I'm being ghosted now. :(","I was seeing a lady I met on a dating app for about 3 months.  Early on, she said she was looking for a friend who might lead to a long-term relationship, and that she has depression &amp; anxiety and has had problems with relationships (though now when I think back, I thought her dating profile sounded like she was looking for a relationship).  Over the 3 months, we really enjoyed each other's company.  Things were going slow; I felt like I was getting some mixed signals, but I fell for her anyway.  Several weeks ago I asked if I could kiss her, and she said she isn't ready for a relationship, and she started to back off and get more distant, not texting as much.  She said she realized she needs to work on herself (she has some bad emotional trauma) and although she really likes me (she said she was developing feelings), she can't reciprocate.  She has trouble dealing with love.  She said she doesn't want to lead me on and doesn't want to hurt me and thought it would be best to just be friends.  She said she'd still hang out though.  She explained that due to her past emotional trauma, she tends to build a wall and when good guys like me come along, it can be hard to let them in.

This past Saturday, I went over to her place to hang out.  At one point I asked her a little more about what she had said.  I said I remember her saying she was looking for a friend who might lead to something, and she said not this fast.  I started to ask if she might be open to something in the future, and she said ""what do you mean?""  I said I dunno, and I left it at that.  We continued hanging out and watching TV.  I had asked about hanging out the next day (Sunday), and she said she'd text me.  She did text me Sunday and said it was ""a no go"" as she had one of her headaches and needed to rest.  I texted back it's okay.

One thing to note is that we had been texting almost every day.  However, now I haven't heard back from her since Sunday (it has been about 4 days now).  I had texted Sunday evening to check in, and also texted Tuesday evening to check in, and she hasn't responded.

I've been feeling heartbroken and down about this - actually at least for several weeks now, since she said she can only offer friendship.  I've been feeling unmotivated and haven't felt like doing the things I'd usually enjoy doing.  I feel like I may have made her uncomfortable now to the point where she doesn't want to talk to me.  I feel like she has ghosted me, and it hurts.

Basically I feel like I'm grieving unrequited love, and now possibly losing a friend and having been ghosted.  After the mixed signals, feeling like we had a connection, and then her saying she can't reciprocate and now this, I feel like this is the hardest rejection I've felt.  How can I get out of this funk?

Also, I still have a book that she loaned me a little while ago.  I'd like to return it, but if she isn't talking to me, I'm wondering how best to go about that.  I thought about sending it back to her via mail, though she lives in an apartment and has said carriers sometimes deliver to the wrong apartment (it's a confusing apartment complex).  I thought about delivering it to her apartment myself (she's about a 15 minute drive away from me) and just leaving it at her door - I thought about writing a note with it too, saying I'm really sorry if I made her uncomfortable.

68,n19y9m,1619718601,Anxious Attachment or Slow Fade,"I’m just looking for opinions (I know that the only person who will actually be able to answer this is the guy I’m seeing). I’ll start with I (43/F) have a super anxious attachment style (I’m aware and working on it) have been seeing a guy (48/M) for about 2.5 months, it’s pretty casual but he knows I have feelings. We’ve been talking in some way every day (text, call or FaceTime) and usually see each other about 3 times a month (maybe a lunch and I’ve been sleeping at his place every other Saturday). He’s never been married, no kids and not much in terms of LTRs. We met on Bumble but knew who each other were IRL when we matched. 

Last week we had lunch Thursday and I spent the night Saturday. We went out to eat at a causal place (I had my lunch 2nd shot that morning so we were just going to do take out but I felt pretty good). Rented a movie On Demand, cuddled, talked and had a good time. We’ve had sex before and we did again this week (although it wasn’t great. I think he was having a hard time staying hard - I get it we’re getting older, no judgement - but he didn’t acknowledge it and I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to embarrass him). 

After that we cuddled some more and put something on Netflix to fall asleep too. He didn’t sleep good and I know he didn’t. When we got up in the morning we just hung out for a little bit and talked. He said something about my BFF (he’s met her on video chat before) and so said something to the effect of she wants us all to go to dinner together (meaning her and her fiancé and me and him). His first reaction was “we’ll get there” and he quickly changed it to “we will”. When I left he walked me to my car, gave me a nice kiss, told me he had a blast and to text when I got home. 

I’m wondering if maybe I freaked him out? He hasn’t initiated a text with me at all since then (and he was probably initiating 60% of the time before that). He does still respond immediately so it’s not like he’s blowing me off. I’m wondering if I freaked him out? If he’s just not into me at all anymore? I do want to address it with him, but I’m wondering other peoples thoughts too. (For the record I’m a single Mom of 2 high schoolers and have been divorced for about 5 years. I’m in no way shape or form looking to blow up either of our lives. I’d eventually like to get to a place where our lives can include each other at bbqs and stuff like that, potentially him meeting my kids, but I’m not looking to cohabitate or marry him - at least not until my kids are grown)",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n19y9m/anxious_attachment_or_slow_fade/

43M with career and 50/50 custody of an 8 year old so I don't have a lot of free time to just wander aimlessly through Whole Foods. I'm so busy I feel boxed into using OLD but as many here will testify, it's just.. well... awful. I'm hoping to find something I enjoy doing that people of the opposite sex also enjoy doing. Activities I do:

1. Scuba diving (\~75% male) -  My passion, but it's mostly male. And at age 43 I'm usually one of the youngest people in the group on outings. I think the price tag appeals more to the financially independent crowd.
2. Softball (\~80% male) - In high school, softball was a girls sport. Turns out, at my age, its a guy thing. There are female minimums that must be met in order to register in a co-ed league. The reverse of being short on guys has never come up. We only have 2 women on the team.
3. Gym (\~75% male) - I went to two gyms (Planet Fitness and LA Fitness), sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes, and counted all the men and women entering. At both places it was 3 men for every 1 woman.
4. AA (\~80% male) - I no longer drink (beer gut turned 4-pack) so I've gone to these meetings before. However, it's a complete sausage fest. Even if the odds were good, the goods are odd. So maybe not the best place.
5. Jogging (\~0%) - I jog 2 miles every morning through my neighborhood and sometimes at night. I think I'm the only one. I pass this lady sometimes but it's not exactly conducive to a conversation. I'm quite positive that doing a 180 and following her is not the right move either.

It would be great to hear from both men and women. I would love to meet someone through a shared experience that is enjoyable for both of us. Also, since I don't drink, bars aren't going to have the type of people I'm looking for. I would love to know what real, post-40 people do, and not what an internet author says on some generic ""hang at a coffee-shop"" article for an all-age audience.

My boyfriend of about 5 months is tagged on Instagram in several cutesy couple photos with his ex GF (he broke up with her about 6 months before we met, they dated off and on for about a year but were not serious).  I discovered this by clicking the photo icon on his IG page (I don’t use IG much and had not realized what it shows—it shows posts where someone is tagged by someone else).  He otherwise has nothing of that sort on his on page.  I also do not post pics of me with other people on my IG. 

I have never said anything to him.  And I assume I should not.  I realize my best option is to block his ex so I won’t see these pics and hence cannot even be tempted to look. 

I’m just curious — who else would be a little weirded out by this? 

I suspect, based on conversations with him, that he would not like seeing me in cutesy couple pics with any of my exes (and I hide such photos from public view on FB).   But that doesn’t mean I should or would ask him to untag himself.

He would not acknowledge me in any way but would sometimes look around as if thinking “I thought I heard something, or a disembodied voice speaking”. I’m a chubby, white, unattractive, middle aged woman so I presumed it was that I was invisible to this man. (Not knocking being invisible to men, I freaking love it. I can do whatever I want, no one notices. I can travel safely and hike solo and no one ever bothers me).

80,n1qk13,1619776376,Update to previous post,"After some contemplation I decided that there was no way I could NOT tell her that I decided to quit smoking. Within the first 30 minutes of our 2 hour drive I told her. I framed it as a positive thing because that’s what it is. I explained that I hadn’t smoked for long and I picked it up as a coping mechanism during what was (she knows) the most challenging time of my life. I apologized for not bringing it up sooner. And that I had not hid it from her with any nefarious intent. 

She was shocked to hear it. And said she never would have guessed, that she didn’t know any smokers or that really anyone still smoked. She wasn’t mad or disappointed, mostly in disbelief. She did clearly state that if I lie to her about it down the road that would be an issue and I completely agreed.  She thanked me for being honest and letting her know. 

We spent the night at my ocean front cabin, sat by a fire in a chair together. We sipped on drinks and stayed very close. Never for a second did I have any cravings for a cigarette. I didn’t even chew one piece of nicotine gum the whole trip. Sparks flew from the fire and many more sparks flew from our intimacy and our unspoken love for each other, it was amazing!

After coffee at the beach on a flat calm ocean we went on a 6 mile hike to a breath taking beach and back. 

On the drive home she shared with me how she’s trying to convey to another guy she broke up with in January that she’s over him. She is having a hard time confronting him to tell him about us, not my deal, but not cool moving forward if she doesn’t take care of it. 

There’s no doubt that she only told me about this bump in the road because I told her about my thing. It’s all good by me, I like her, she likes me, things are on fire between us in so many ways. Lots of jokes, laughs, and memories are being made. 

Now it’s a matter of who is going to say something to bring it to the next level. There have been traveling invites, epic adventure ideas floated, the most healthy, mature relationship conversations, shared pet peeves, shared parenting techniques, and the list goes on.

86,n1vvp8,1619795382,Anybody try the George Constanza opposite approach?,"For those who don’t know it was a Seinfeld episode where George- a perpetual loser decides to do the opposite of what he would always do as he theorized every instinct he had is wrong and to do the opposite would mean success. 

The bit for dating is when he sees a gorgeous woman and his first instinct is to just admire afar as he thinks she’s out of his league. Then he goes against that thought and approaches her confidently and says he’s unemployed and living with his parents and she is interested.   

A lot of threads here are about how people make bad decisions in a relationship or choosing a wrong mate.  Anybody try this approach? Like i would normally swipe right on this woman that I typically would find attractive but somehow always ends up in tears, but now I’m gonna swipe on the woman who i wouldn’t normally pick?

The funny thing is that I read somewhere that the actor has gotten comments from fans that they tried this and it made a real difference in their lives.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n1vvp8/anybody_try_the_george_constanza_opposite_approach/

90,n1ziyk,1619805592,"What if unrequited love, mixed signals, ghosting, etc. starts to cause emotional trauma?","Recently, I met someone on a dating app and was hanging out with her (less than once a week on average) and we really enjoyed each other's company and conversations.  She's guarded, and things were going slow; I felt like I was getting mixed signals from her and had a hard time with it.  It seemed we both started to develop feelings, though perhaps me more so than her; once she realized that, she backed off, and due to her past emotional trauma (and having a hard time trusting &amp; loving), she said she wasn't ready for a relationship.  She said she'd still be friends and hang out.  Now she hasn't texted in about 5 days, which is unusual, and I feel like I'm being ghosted and that she isn't interested in me at all anymore.

That experience has left me feeling heartbroken, down, unmotivated, and lonely.  I also went through a divorce last year, which has probably contributed to it.  I've started talking to a therapist.  The idea of dating feels a bit scary to me now, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to continue meeting new people for dating.  I'm also an introvert, and it can be hard for me to get out and go to meetup groups &amp; such.

In dating experiences that cause confusion and heartbreak and such, is it really possible for such experiences to mess you up emotionally?

As you scroll down or up on someone's profile pictures, you most likely find one picture that even if you were on the fence about swiping right, it pushes you to swipe left?

92,n21c9w,1619810619,Crowd-Sourced Advice,"Hi People of Reddit!

I'm here to ask for a little crowd-sourced advice, from anyone who feels like being extra-generous today. 🙉

I'm a dating coach, and I'm re-working my dating profile makeover offer.

As my offer currently stands, the package includes:


Bio writing

Photo selection

30-minute consult


I'm reworking the offer to include a ""standard"" option (the above), and a new ""add-on"" option that allows people to add on, a la carte, additional services that they want, but that not everyone necessarily wants.

If you were, theoretically, getting your dating profile re-done (pretend I was the dating god-fairy and had a magic wand to wave 🧚♀️) - what kinds of changes over and above photos and bio-writing would you like to see?

I decided to get some work done in the sunshine since afternoon meetings were cancelled and was approached by a seemingly dignified, intelligent man. (Second outing this week, second approach this week — this does NOT happen to me people). Maybe guys have post-vaccine fever. Anyway, the brief chat was super benign and we were both on our laptops, so I was surprised when he asked if I’m seeing anyone. I automatically glanced at the ring on his finger.  He said, “oh! I’m separated. Don’t worry, I’m not THAT guy.”  Not completely convinced I said I’m very recently out of a relationship. He said, totally understand, how about we just connect on linked in it’s always nice to network. I said okay to that. All our chatting was professionally-related so when I say I was surprised, I was SURPRISED.

97,n278pf,1619829068,Guy in my late 30s feeling very low about dating,"Im feeling very low about dating. I haven’t been in a relationship for ages I am in My late 30s. I have always wanted to be in a loving committed marriage and I don’t do anything meaningless at all I’m not interested in that at all. I work from home for myself so that’s not an issue and I’m very passionate about my interests hobbies. 

I also go to the gym work out and keep as active as possible and I also regularly enjoy swimming too. I am 6ft 4 1.94m I have taken care of myself no smoking no drugs no heavy drinking I also don’t look my age I look younger which I think is a good thing I often get complimented on this. 

My goals are marriage and family I really want my own children. But I’m not into OLD it’s not for me I would like everyone to respect the fact I don’t like it and don’t agree with it and it’s not for me I can’t pick someone from a photo online. 

Im not interested in multiple relationships with different women either I just want someone with things in common we get on really well and enjoining spending time together and are supportive and encouraging of each other also. 

I guess being in lockdown is making me feel even worse about it all can’t wait till Covid Is all over and we are back to normal Im keen on meeting women IRL i Just feel very lonely and fed up with it all it would be nice to have some to talk to as I feel really lonely at the moment and have done for some time",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n278pf/guy_in_my_late_30s_feeling_very_low_about_dating/
98,n28iie,1619833594,I just have to vent. I am so tired of guys who play games and don't communicate,"I matched with a guy on a dating app. We met last week for some drinks and had a great time. The date lasted for over 3 hours and we ended the date with a little kissing. He has texted me daily since and has said that he really wants to see me again and asked to see me this weekend. I said yes and told him to just let me know what his schedule is like and we can make it happen. His response was that he would get back to me as he needs to find out what his kid's sport schedule was for the the weekend. This was 3 days ago. He has continued to text me but has mentioned nothing about this weekend. I am annoyed. He has not said anything about the weekend so I am at the point where I am just going to make other plans. I am not going to chase after him. I know I can just ask him but I feel like if he really wanted to see me that he would at the very least communicate with me about his availability by now, even if he is not available. 

This annoys me so much as it reminds me of an ex that I dated that pulled the same shit.....always saying lets get together but nada..no communication and no date...just empty promises. That guy broke my heart. The one lesson I learned is that if a guy wants to see you he will make the effort to do so or at the very least communicate with you to reschedule.

I also realize when you have kids that sometimes schedules can change and be unpredictable but his kids play in a league so they have a set schedule so he should definitely know by now. 

I just had to vent my frustrations. Sometimes dating sucks. ;(",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n28iie/i_just_have_to_vent_i_am_so_tired_of_guys_who/
