I'm 25 and I've never had a relationship. When it comes to dating, I'm probably one of the worst lmao. I have a condition called Neurofibromatosis type 1. While I have a mild form, my face is still disfigured. I have a tumor at the left side of my face.  

In elementary any time I had a crush girls would be repulsed at the idea of me liking them. In grade 4 or 5, a friend told me girls don't like me because of my face/eye. Another guy said that if girls reject you you're not a real man.  I know all of that is fucking ridiculous but still in my preteen and teen years I grew up thinking like that and now it's stuck in my subconscious. 

In grade 8, my classmates would play this game called MASH. It's basically a game to see who you would end up with, what job you'd have, what type of house. Whenever it land on me most if not all girls would be disappointed that they got me. 

Also online dating has sorta ruin my confidence even worse. I barely get any matches. Granted, I know for a lot of people it's a lot to take in and it's a split second decision so I'm not bitter about that. I know other traits are hard to showcase. 

I have a few chances here and there but I am also a dumbass lol.

I know I have the confidence with in me to get over my issues and anxiety. I have several public speaking events, I have done live radio twice. I was elected the president of my student body at my university.  I've done canvasing, door to door campaigning. The point is while I sometimes fear doing those things, nothing and I mean nothing compares to how much anxiety I get to approach a random girl.  

Other than maybe therapy, which I probably do need, what can I do build up my confidence and what sources are good. 

I've heard she's six steps away is good but I am wary of PUA it's all off putting for me.

So my gf once came to see one of my matches and after the match she asked me to train her too. So I asked her does she want to just do it for fun or seriously train?

She said she wanted to train seriously.

So I started her training seriously and within like 45 minutes she gave up and ran away saying I am too harsh. 

But I really wasn't, it was just basic punching and kicking excercises, basic pushups on knuckles, some sprinting and core workout. Also a little punishment like they do in literally any dojo. Like I put 8 year olds through more rigorous training than I put her through.

This guy sat down next to me. He was alone, and so I started talking to him. ""What brings you out tonight?"" Right off the bat, he's like, ""I'm looking for this girl."" 

He hangs out with us for a couple of hours, and I just really liked him. He's funny, he's kind of dorky. He seems honest and kind. He's cuuute. So I take him home. And it's pretty amazing.

The next morning, he's driving me back to my car. I'm hungover and really just generally confused in the morning. He's asking me personal stuff, and so I ask him about the girl. He tells me this heartbreaking tale, he made a mistake, he wants her back. This story ends right as we pull up to my car. 

So I say, ""Good luck."" And get out of his car. As I do this, I'm thinking, he's got a lot going on obviously. This is a nice tidy little ending to a lovely evening, and I will just walk away.

But the moment I see his car in my rear view mirror, I am just filled with regret. Like deep instant regret. And I have been thinking of him so much since.

There are a few factors: I've been really isolated during lockdown and this was my first time out out in quite a while. I'm not a one night stand/hookup person generally. My reluctance to let this go could be stemming from these things.

There's this girl(21or 20F) whom I've met multiple times 2 years ago, she has even sat behind me in my bike, she enjoys talking to me &amp; it's obvious with the uncontrollable smile she has whenever she speaks to me. We even went to a trek together with group of people. This group involved a guy who's my aquintence(say X) whom i play football &amp; cricket with, he's her classmate and her old friend too. So now me and this girl on the way back home were having a conversation for maybe an hour, it was as if she didn't want to end this conversation and she seemed so happy, even i was surprised to see us get along so well. Then midway we went for dinner &amp;  X sat next to her. I even saw him touching her and getting sensual, i looked away as i believe it's her battle and must not interfere unless she's vocal about her security. We got back on our journey and this girl looks sad &amp; doesn't even try to look in my direction. I wanted to ask her out on a date, but because of this it never happened. Two days later i asked her on text that why she looked upset... she said she was sleepy.

Then i tried contacting her once more and within 2 mins she gave reason that she's busy with studies. We continued streaking on snapchat for 2 more years.

Later i came to know that these both were dating, but since a year I've seen him in multiple occasions with other girls out.

Yesterday, i spoke to her on text just on a casual topic and later i asked her out on a date, she said that she isn't interested in dating anyone right now. I said we would just meet up once &amp; it's alright if she doesn't want to. She replied that she isn't comfortable meeting me. I replied that i respect her decision... End of conversation.

I never got this reply before from any girl because i always maintain my physical boundries, but right now I'm feeling as if I'm being a threat to her safety. And it's badly eating up my head.

Is it creepy to ask a girl out i know for a date on text? I mentioned date because I wanted to be clear about my romantic intentions. FYI We still snap on snapchat, My mom knows her mom too. And we have many more mutual connections, but she's uncomfortable meeting me!!!

Hi everyone. We all know I go for “bad boys” or people with mental health problems. I just want one real chance with him, idk why.

We met around the 2nd week of September as friends in the psych ward together but it developed into something more. For the most part, we have the same sense of humor but ever since I got out of the psych ward mid September my life has been a mess.

I’m currently living out of hotels because I have an extremely dysfunctional family. My only safe places are at hotels so I can complete my partial mental health day programs, on top of waiting to see if my application is approved for a mid October move in date, as well as doing many interviews for technology companies after my day program is over. I have unreliable help to for my physical needs. 

I’m quadriplegic and this is the first time I’ve been mostly independent since I’ve been injured in May 2019. I’m in a very sensitive state right now and usually I can take dark humor jokes but not right now, as I am very manic and don’t really have a clear path, everything things in limbo, and I really don’t have a support system. I just got diagnosed with BPD, bipolar I, along with my other mental illnesses which are complex ptsd, depression and anxiety.

The guy who I met at the psych ward is an alcoholic yet is very kind and I know he cares about me since he’s done a lot for me after the psych ward, but I think I’m just too much for him to handle right now due to my mental state. He’s telling me it’s not me it’s him and he doesn’t think he can be here for me since he’s on the road working a lot but I really don’t need that much attention. I don’t care about how often people text me, if I’m able to see you once or twice a week, I’m good. Just text me once in a while. 

Oh I’ve talked to numerous mental health professionals and they say I’m fine from a self harm stand point, I just have a lot going on. He was telling me all these things that we could do together when I was stable in the psych ward. I think I’m just too much for him to handle right now and he criticizes me for so many things, I just feel like I’m not good enough for him.

My ex-boyfriend with a heroin and drug addict, I told myself I’d never date someone with addiction issues, but the guy the psych ward dude did so many good things for me regarding my physical health and mental health, it’s hard to let him go despite him being very insensitive to my situation right now and making tasteless jokes about my part and self harm tendencies.

For example, I have CPTSD and right now since I’m very sensitive everything is triggering and I tried to explain to him that. He’s a very aggressive driver and I told him to slow down I’m having a panic attack yet he didn’t listen. (I have ptsd from a motor cycle hitting my car in a large city and watching him die).

And then at the hospital, (after psych ward for urology reasons), I needed emergency surgery and he brought me there and stayed for as long as he could. Something happened where I became really sad and he started making tasteless jokes about my attempts last summer. He put a plastic bag over his head like I did last year as an attempt which put me in a darker mood. My anxiety and cptsd were so bad I lost all strength in my body including my arms which I have normal arm movement.

He mentioned to me that he thinks that I’m using him, but I paid him the other day when he helped me, I paid for his gas and parking tickets multiple times, I even bought us food. He tells me over criticize what he wears, his taste isn’t really my style but I really don’t care what he wears because I like him more as a person rather than what he looks like. I just like to joke around with him and be like I “pimp your ride” and he got offended so I respected him telling me that and won’t bring it up.

He came over to my hotel last night for about two hours, I bought us dinner, I’m smoking weed like a chimney right now because my doctor won’t adjust my anxiety meds. He says he doesn’t want to be a stoner which I am a stoner but I’m not addicted, if he really was interested in me then I would cut back on the smoking. Yesterday he told me he wanted me to/agreed with me to do s*x work to make extra money, so I did check my phone a few times when I was with him but I know was rude but I’m literally homeless and am blowing throw the money I took out from my 401k and stock market. If he really wanted me to not do it, I wouldn’t.

I texted him telling him I’ll stop trying to do s*x work to make extra money…still waiting for him to respond back. I haven’t seen him in maybe a week or so, I was very touchy-feely yesterday, we cuddled and nothing else. 

He gets very uncomfortable when he comes to sex even though he’s really good when he is comfortable. He gets performance anxiety, which has never really happened to me except for one time with another guy, so I felt like I’m the problem why he can’t get hard. And I mentioned that to him and before he left the hotel he just told me he doesn’t think things are going to work out with between us which I wasn’t really expecting that.

Should I just accept it, focus on my self and move on? He has done so many things for me that I can’t explain on Reddit. And I told myself I’d never give an addict a chance but he told me to put my walls down and to give him one. I feel like a fool. I literally was talking to at least 5-7 guys waiting for me but I ghosted and dropped them all because I wanted to get to know him and he told me he wouldn’t talk to other girls.

I’ve only had one girl I’ve dated long term, but things were toxic and I had to break it off. Since then I’ve struggled a bit. A problem I’ve noticed is that I tend to ‘put all of my eggs in one basket’ in the sense that, when I start dating a new girl, I become a little attached and don’t even give other girls the time of day. 

I’m wondering if it might be better for me to keep my options open with multiple people and see which one I like? Obviously I don’t mean that I’m going to engage in serious relationships with multiple people, but just through the dating phase. Is that the worst thing in the world? I feel like, if I were to do that, I’d be able to let go of that attachment to one person and be a little less afraid of things not working out.

He bought me a drink and we went back to his place to make out and stay the night. I know sex on a first date is a bit much, and I promised myself I wouldn’t have sex with him - but he was so sweet it just felt right in the moment.

The morning after, he tells me it was the best he’s ever had and asked for my number, suggesting to meet up again next week. We have so much in common and just clicked so well on the date, and the chemistry was nothing like I’ve had with any other guy. I’m down for something casual with him but also open for it to become more serious if the opportunity were ever to come up.

The only issue is that he takes so long to reply. Normally I’m fine with slow repliers, because I am one myself. And I’m used to his slow replies because when we were talking on Bumble we usually took hours to respond to each other - but the conversation was always worth the wait. But after the first date and meeting irl I was half expecting him to be a little faster with replies but it seems to be going the same pace as before. Usually I reply slow on dating apps (because talking to multiple people at once is exhausting for me sometimes) and when I make a connection with someone I start to reply much faster to that person. I thought maybe it would be the same for him but it’s just starting to make me feel as though maybe he’s not into me as I thought he was?

It got to the point where I almost gave up on him and went back to talking to my other matches when he suddenly made me a personalised music playlist with all my favourite artists I mentioned to him on our date. Obviously I found this incredibly cute - music is literally my love language and the fact he remembered what I told him on our date just seemed so sweet to me.

So am I just reading into the slow replies too much? I’m not sure whether I want something serious or casual yet (just seeing where things go) so I don’t mind about the fact we had sex on the first date and also the prospect of him potentially talking to other girls at this stage doesn’t bother me much (as we’re certainly not exclusive after just one date). I just want to know whether he’s actually interested in me or not and whether it’s worth pursuing him. Our time together, conversations and the fact he took the time to make me a playlist suggests that he could be into me but the fact that he takes so long to reply just tells me that he’s probably not as invested as I think he is.

For reference: it would sometimes take 6-12 hours to receive a reply from him but he would always reply with multiple messages/paragraphs (not dead chat)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1039632,public,self,Can’t Tell If He’s Actually Into Me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzvzms/cant_tell_if_hes_actually_into_me/,all_ads,6,,,

I have been speaking to a guy \[34/M\] on Bumble for a little while, and we are organising a date. I have a bunch of health problems, which I have disclosed, aside from my severe hand (and sometimes body) tremor. It will be evident as soon as he meets me.

I have essential tremor, which is a benign, non-degenerative condition. I am currently investigating surgery and hoping it will be gone by sometime next year, but I'm still likely to experience a tremor sometimes. For the record, I'm otherwise cognitively fine and ironically a health professional who works with people who have serious illnesses.

How much would this tremor bother you, when you consider that it would be present when eating meals? I find eating the most difficult, which is why I'm seeking treatment.

My body tends to shake a lot during sex/when aroused. Needless to say, it does not impact my sex drive. What are your thoughts around this? Feel free to be explicit - interested in how you would feel about hand jobs with a girl who had a tremor as well.

I’ll just paint a quick picture of who I am and get in to this. So I’m a 29 year old male I work in trades which I’ve been fairly successful I don’t take myself to seriously and I love to have a good time. I don’t feel like I’m a “nice guy” but Im confident and I am someone looking for relationship not just a hook up. So I have been going on dates with a couple girls and I’ve been noticing a common theme that I wanted to share and get advice on. So I was dating this first girl I thought we had a good connection and we would have a lot of fun together go on dates and we did end up sleeping together a few times however, it seemed like I was the only one let initiating contact or setting up dates. So the last date I set up with this girl I got a hotel in a near by city and we went on a brewery tour and had a nice dinner and we’re just enjoying each other’s company and I brought up the fact that I didn’t feel like she wanted to hang out with me because I always contact her first and that it makes me feel insecure so if she wants to hang out again she will have to contact me and after I dropped her off that day I never heard from her again. Fast forward a couple months I’m dating another girl we seem to be really hitting it off and I think things are going good our conversation flies I really enjoy her company and this time we haven’t slept together which I think is good to feel each other out. (We have made out a few times) But I experiencing similar traits where I find I have initiate all contact and set up all the dates. Which I understand which is fine like two or three dates in in my mind. However once I get like 5 dates in I feel that other person would know what they want. And I feel as though maybe I’m setting my expectations too high so early on maybe or they just aren’t that into it?

So I directly messaged the girl on facebook asking her out for dinner.

She told that she recently went through a difficult break up and wasn't interested in getting into another relationship.

We spoke on the phone  where despite my best efforts to flirt, she repeatedly expressed her desire to only be friends - She started telling me about how she met my sister and about her ex.

She wants to have a platonic relationship and become friends - I even mentioned I was happy to wait for her to get over her ex and then give me a chance. This ended with a resounding no.

I feel like I've been immediately friendzoned. She quicky clamped down on all my attempts to flirt.

I don't want to be that guy she speaks to about other guys she's interested in as frankly speaking that's just not what I want.

Should I try and be friends with her and slowly flirt with her or should I just move on?

Does anyone actually manage to become friends with someone they want to be in a relationship with?

I am asking on behalf of my (29F) ex boyfriend (M30). I've been with him for nearly 3 years and met him during the worst part of his life. His dad died a little over a year ago, he recently had to put his mother in a nursing home due to health issues, and on top of all that his dog passed away suddenly. He watched his dad slowly die and had to quit his job to take care of both with no help from anyone. He developed a drinking problem because of all of this. 

I have tried to be there as much as he let me. I was even there when we had to call the ambulance for his dad 2 days before he died. He often would get angry at me and push me away but would always come back. 

2 months ago, he said he was done with the roller-coaster of our relationship and only wanted to be with me. We talked about living together, getting married, and kids. Everything was going so good. This was prior to his dog dying. His dog died 3 weeks ago, the same time he put his mom in the nursing home. This weekend is his father's celebration of life (the funeral was postponed due to covid). He initially leaned on me for support. 2 weeks ago he was still spending the weekend with me and saying he loved me. Sunday night of that weekend he told me he needed a break from a relationship because he was bitter about everything and didn't want to take anything out on me. Last weekend I found out he went out on a date with someone he had known for a few years but wasn't close to. He never talked to her or had any interaction up until that point because he gave me complete access to his phone. He is now seeming to want to be with her. I confronted him and he got angry which is a typical response for him. 

I just don't understand what happened. There was no fight, no warning. I gave him the space he requested and sincerely thought we'd be fine. He introduced me to everyone and all his friends seemed to like me and wanted him to marry me at some point. I really think this all has to do with his world being completely thrown upside down and a combination of substance abuse and severe depression. 

I'd like a perspective from someone who is actively going through depression and if this sounds plausible.

For the longest time I’ve had a hard time approaching women and having conversations with them. I’ve always wondered why and I’ve always traced it back to me being essentially afraid of them. 

While my other guy friends will look at an attractive and hot woman and approach them because they want to get laid. I, on the other hand will look at them, think their hot and tell myself all the reasons why I shouldn’t approach them. Yes I’m still turned on by them and yes I’d love to get laid but my friends seem to driven more to get laid and seeing positive outcomes while I wanna get laid and just find reasons why they would be weirded out by me or why I’m probably out of their league or how I’m probably too ugly for them. 

Idk why I am this way but I just have horrible approach anxiety and can think of a thousand things to go wrong before even approaching. While my friends see it as an opportunity to get laid. 

I’d love to get into the mindset of just going for it but every time I see an attractive woman I just freeze and just can’t get unstuck. I never end up approaching and feel like I’m losing out on possibly meeting someone or hooking up. 

I’m in my 30s and at this point I feel like I shouldn’t be this terrified of hot women but yet, here I am.

They say that they don't like dating shorter men not because they are shorter, or the height difference bothers them but because they want to feel safe and protected. To me that seems to imply that shorter guys can't make a women feel those things. Now I am a natural bodybuilder, so I have plenty of muscle. I am only 5'9 however and prefer women taller than me. When I hear a comment like this it tends to confuse me. I would definitely defend anybody that was being bullied or talked about especially if I was in a relationship with this person. Plus my muscular frame does tend to make people back down or at least think twice before speaking to me. 

So what is the real reason tall 6'+ women wont date shorter guys? Do you really want to feel safe and protected? 

Let me say I would jump of a bridge, mountain, or literally do anything to be with a taller women. In fact I have a friend she is 6'5 I am incredibly comfortable around her and when I am enjoying her company, which is all the time because we get on so well, I don't notice or even care that I have to look up at her plus I think it makes her look all the more attractive when she wears heels.

So I went on a date with an old co-worker because I figured it wouldn't hurt anything.

He seemed caught off guard when I mentioned this and it was like he completely lost interest in me the second he heard that. A little while later, he made an excuse to cut the night short and wished me well. Didn't hug or kiss me goodbye. Just said he hoped things go well for me and that was it.

So, 2 years ago I was living in the US with my boyfriend. I only moved there from London for him. We were together for about 3 years. I don't want to go too deep into that but he was a very troubled person. He had a heart of gold but his life didn't treat him well, he was suffering from a lot of trauma. And he would turn to destroying coping mechanism like heroin. I did my absolute best to help him. I spent all my money on his therapy, rehab, meds, things that would make him happy. I didn't leave his side. I don't know what else I could've done but apparently that wasn't enough. He hanged himself in the bathroom when I was asleep in the next room.

Fast forward 2 very difficult, very sad years of living with my mother, I'm back in London. Got a job I've been studying for my whole life, I'm back with my friends. And here's the deal with one of my friends. I like him a lot. We hang out very often and he's so so kind to me. He's been there for me when I really needed him. Not only after my boyfriend's death. 

He's already admitted that he has a thing for me. Even though he's not generally into guys. And I think I'd like to give this a shot. But I'm afraid that guilt would eat me up alive. I wouldn't stand being judged by other people over how quickly I moved on (I haven't). And there are my huge abandonment issues. I'm not sure I'd be a very good partner right now. And I don't want my friend to feel like he's a consolation prize.

I’m in grad school (30 m) and a fellow grad student (21 F) had been watching the really late and talking till 3 o clock in the morning.  We also climb and workout together. Eventually one of those nights, we were both drinking. First we started playing footsies then I asked if I could sit next to hurt and massage her legs. She said yes to this so for the next hour we are next to each other as I’m madsaging her and holding hands with her. She mention she was gonna head to bed and I asked I ask if she would mind if I kissed her. She said she wouldn’t mind so we end up making out. I end leaving because we were both drunk and I didn’t want to regret anything. As I’m walking home she texts me how she is wet between the legs so we start sexting.

Next morning I ask when we can leave where we left off. She says she thinks last night was a big mistake. I tell her I disagree but I wanna respect her boundaries but I’m into her and let me know if those boundaries change. We keep texting and 5 days later we are texting about a music artists and she says I should list 2 sexually explicit songs that have lyrics like “I’m a freak” and “I wanna fuck you like a dog”. I mention another artist and she sends me more songs like this. I point this out and she just says she’s continuing the conversation. I start sending her similar songs and we go back and forth for 6 more songs. The next day her and a bunch of fellow grad students are getting tacos and I ask “mind if come?” She says it’s up to you. I show up and things seem different but I offer her a ride back to her place but she wants to go with a friend. I take this as a sign that I’ve creeped her out.

Unfortunately at this point, I have a group project with her, and she hasn’t gotten back to be about the adjustments that need to be made to her part. I try to setup a meeting. Radio silence for 24 hrs. I say “I need some communication if you need me to take over your part I can” She says “she can meet but she doesn’t wanting me to force anything”
We meet and get the project done.

I’m now back all the way off and don’t talk to her at all. Because I’m super confused and this seems like a one-sided relationship. I stop talking or see her at run ins for a week. I make a dumb mistake and invite her and her friend over for out weekly show. She says can she bring a friend over, I say “yeah?” She ends up bringing a guy over she met in the past week at climbing. He sits with his arm wrapped around her the entire show. This is a gut punch to me so I pull back even further.

2 weeks after this; We text every other day about work stuff but I am avoiding seeing her outside of work. She texts me “Its pretty clear you dont actually want to be friends and were only trying to get into my pants so I'll stop reaching out about climbing etc” I told her I’m just following her directions and not try to force anything. She then says I hurt her and took advantage of her when we were drunk by kissing her. I then ask how come she is texting somebody she doesn’t trust and that she feels took advantage of her? She says she’s just trying to set the terms of the friendship and that she just wants to see me when I’m around others. I say cool I’m fine with that and we stop texting conversation

So the question is why did she text me yesterday and what is the best way of maintain work relationship? I’m trying to continue to avoid her because it literally hurts me in the heart to be around her. Also just need support because we were good friends before this

 I've been talking to this guy that I met on tinder for a few weeks. We went on a first date and it went well. He lives an hour away from me and he told me that he usually doesn't drive an hour to meet someone, and that he didn't think that he'd want to date someone so soon after getting out of a relationship a few months ago, but that there was just something about me.

He told me that he's falling for me and obsessed with me and that he could see himself spending his life with me, and that he might be my perfect match, and that the reason that other dates I went on didn't lead anywhere was that no one else is as smart as me except for him.

I'm just a normal 25 yr old single guy who's content being single when I had just spent the last 24 years chasing after women and finally having my heart broken to itty bitty pieces by one who physically and mentally abused me. 

I'm sick of dating if this is all that is left. 

For one, I'm meek and reserved, and I barely have an angry or abusive bone in my body. Secondly, I'm a short shit, and my abusive ex overpowered me multiple times when she didnt get her way. I've had mental health issues to the point of self harm that are somewhat under control and yet I'm the one who gets treated like shit, like the dirt under their shoes. 

I've dated 12 women in my life, 8 of them in my adult life, and after the 11th I just decided I wasn't going to make it so easy to kill me anymore. Anyone who came into my life was going to have to show effort and not make me question everything. All i want to do is marry and have children and be right with god in my relationship. That's all I want. Sweet and simple. 

This twelfth individual seemed to have fit those categories. She was very pleasing on the eyes, very intelligent and animated, wanted to settle down eventually and was a christian like me. I told myself I would put in effort if she was reciprocating. 

Now there's a wildcard about her. We haven't just met. We talked before when I was nineteen, which was nearly seven years ago for me, and people tend to change a lot overtime. She was much more mature this time around, didn't give me so much trouble and didn't start any drama like she did when we were younger. Our ""relationship"" if you could call it that, lasted less than a month, because we were both young and stupid and knew nothing about relationships. I made a mistake which forced us apart and it ultimately cost me any sort of friendship with her. 

Recently she messaged me and we started chatting and she told me she forgave me for doing what I did. I was touched by that because I had truly felt terrible for what I did and vowed never to ever again. It wasn't violent or abusive, just stupid. A man is horny and makes stupid mistakes. 

We met up and she was just super happy to see me and wanted to make out and do stuff and all that other jazz but I was being careful and didnt want to do anything right away. I wanted to go on more dates to kind of feel out the situation, see if she was being honest or not in forgiving me supposedly. 

Well, three months later and no new dates, barely communicating, and I didnt press the issue. I asked if things were okay and if we could just hang out eventually and she said maybe. So at this point I'm thinking, 'well, probably a lost cause at this point', and I wasn't really feeling it anymore. 

So i did the polite thing and just talked to her about it. I thought she would be understanding since we hadn't worked well in the past, but man was I wrong. 

I came under her fire on all her social media, messages, and she's blocked me on all of them as I share this here.

I wanted to ask for everyone’s advice / experience with living together BEFORE marriage. 

PREFACE: we do NOT have children.

Here’s my current dilemma: I (21 M) am currently living at home with my parents, I work full-time and go to school part-time at a local community college.

My girlfriend (20 F) lives with her parents and is currently working full-time as well and attends the same local community college full-time.

I have received a significant job promotion to live and work in Arizona. I have been working with this company for over two years and it is a very prominent company in itself (Amazon). I currently reside in Illinois. I will take this job offer as I will be earning a minimum of $52k/year w/o factoring in any OT hours worked.

I wouldn’t under any circumstances pursue a long-term relationship with my current girlfriend (have been dating for 1.5 years to date). Having said this, I am NOT forcing her to tag along with me to move since I feel that that in itself is a lot to ask from of a girlfriend.

If she were to not tag along however, I’d end the relationship. I’d love for her to tag along and she has already expressed her high interest in wanting to tag along as well.

I do plan on marrying this girl in the near future but feel as though, I am not ready for such a commitment this early in both my life and career.

I tend to always think worst case scenario and we have spoken about it already before (the possibility of break-up) as with any relationship could experience.

I tried to give as much background info as possible, if more is needed to form an opinion/suggestion on the situation then feel free to ask away!

My genetics, bone structure, my hair line, my height, my race, and my face shape are a combination that leaves me in a miserable state.

How can I meet people? Dating apps are useless to me and I’ve tried meeting girls through clubs and study groups and friends but they’re never interested. Girls barely talk to me as friends anyways.

I also told him another reason I didn’t want to date him was because one time he asked me out on a date through DM and I said yes. 3 days later, I asked him why he deleted the message and he said “sorry I got back together with my ex girlfriend” (a new person). He told me that I should enjoy competition when I brought this back up with him.  

He told me all these horrible stories about his “ex wife” (before I knew he lied) and said she was a narcissist. Now I’m sure he’s the narcissist.
