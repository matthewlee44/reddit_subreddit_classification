Now that I’m getting older (23F), dating is harder. My ex and I decided to officially separate and even though I’m still young, I’m finding it hard not to be insecure. Things were so much easier in high school which is the last time I had an open dating pool... I never thought of the things I do now. 

I am in college but my classes usually consist of white and Asian males (engineering major)... I think I’m overthinking because of the last Asian male I dated telling me that he was worried about bringing me to meet his parents as since I am mixed (black and white) female, he’ll probably get disowned. This has happened to me a few times before during my high school/early adult age. 

I want to start dating again but I can’t seem to shake this feeling of just being undesirable due to my race. I know part of this obsession is due to trauma from my childhood from being a darker mixed race female but I was never *nervous* about it with dating.

I'm a 22M and I'm honestly frustrated with finding a partner. I've never had anyone interested in me enough to seriously pursue ANYTHING with.

It's not even that I haven't tried. I've shot my shot at girls that I was really interested in getting to know, and they've all never liked me back (which is not a problem, I just moved on. no hostility). And don't get me wrong, I've always been polite and respectful in ""shooting my shot"" too. I've tried instagram and in real life. All I say is ""hey I think you're cool, I'd love to get to know you more"". It never works out. I by no means feel entitled to any girl saying yes, but getting just one time to work out would be nice.

I just started a PhD program, I go to the gym, I play sports, I'm close w family. I even get told that I am good looking... by girls. I don't understand why things have never worked out.

Been dating a girl for 3 months. Basically BF/GF. Slept with each other multiple times. See each other twice a week basically. Met friends. Do something new everytime we see each other almost. 

I thought it was a lock for when I asked her to be my GF. I really didn’t want to as I thought a label might ruin things. I didn’t want to drag my feet any longer though so I asked. She said she wasn’t sure and needed time to think, but said she wanted to see me next week.

We never really texted before as we don’t like being on our phones and conversing all day. We prefer face to face time over texts. We only really text when we need something. We do Snapchat though but we have been sending basically 1 or 2 a day. Lost the best friends for 2 months logo thingy. 

So basically what I am asking is do I just keep this no contact going until she initiates something? Or do I ask to see her? I don’t want to be needy but also don’t want her to feel I’m

So I'll start off by saying I'm not the best with women. I'm 21 and haven't been in a relationship since I was 19. I've changed a lot since then mainly my appearance (went from fat to pretty lean and muscular). I've noticed since then that I've attracted a lot more girls who are out of my league, but I never go for it. I once even had a really cute girl who I was eyeing approach me to say hi, but, like a dumbass, I walked away. I'm not the worst at social situations, I can usually hold a conversation and things like that, but I can struggle starting them. Mainly with girls I find attractive. I've always been pretty shy, but I'm constantly improving with small talk to the point where I'm pretty comfortable even when it's awkward. However, approaching a cute girl is still difficult for me because I overthink the hell out of it.

Anyway enough rambling I have a question and forgive me for this being super long I really want to detail this situation:

So there's this girl at my work who I think is really attractive and is definitely into me. I know this because she works with my mom and she tells my mom she thinks I'm cute (odd but whatever). I usually only see her at work maybe a handful of times because we're in different departments, but sometimes our paths cross. Once we said hi to each other but both got shy and walked away. Bunch of times we saw each other but just looked away.

I've been telling myself for awhile that I should just man up and talk to her, but then I think about things I've heard about her. 

One thing is she somewhat recently totalled her car because of drunk driving though I think she stopped drinking after that. Another is that she's friends with this one dude who works at the same place as us who's her sister's ex, and they've had sex. Not sure if it was like a one night stand kinda thing (I really don't care if a girl I'm into has had sex before or anything as long as it's nothing crazy). They're still close, but I know they'll never date.

I constantly think about that stuff whenever I think about going after her and don't know if it's because of low self esteem or that it's something that means I should just not even try.

So yeah my question is should I go for it or should I just wait for another girl? Also I would like some tips on how to approach either her or anyone else because I suck at these kinds of things.

This is something that's been really on my mind as of late and just wanted some advice.

My intentions where 
1. Put the ball in her court so she knows it’s on her to say that she wants to get together
2. Gauge interest off this because I had asked her to hang out twice (3 times, but the first time was under far less intentional circumstances). 

Just so I don’t go crazy I’ve shown some of my friends (more female than male because their opinions matter in this scenario)
some of the texts we had exchanged. They were all certain that this girl was into me. Or at least conveyed mutual interest and attraction. Then the first cancellation and the second hang being postponed. So I was a bit lost but my friends were confused too because it all seemed positive up to this last week. But then She went radio silent.

The answer is glaringly obvious and right under our noses but nobody wants to admit it. We have ignored our evolutionary drives. 

Women, do you wonder why men your own age are perpetually attracted to young, feminine 20-somethings? You may have a career, a good education, social standing and you want a man who is on that same level. Until you find him and realize he more attracted to the young, hot Starbucks barista than a woman like yourself. 

Men, do you wonder why being a nice guy or getting in touch with your feminine side might get you approval from women but not much attraction or sexual fulfillment? Do you wonder why assholes and jerks seem to do much better by doing everything wrong?

In a nutshell...

Men are attracted to youth, beauty and femininity, they are attracted to a woman who can give them healthy babies whether they want children or not. It's hardwired subconsciously. 

Women are attracted to strength, high status and masculinity. They are attracted to men who can protect them and their offspring whether they want children or not. It's hardwired subconsciously. 

The problem is that we have convinced ourselves that we are beyond this. We have convinced ourselves that a few decades of ""wokeness"" can erase millions of years of hardwired evolutionary drives.

I'm not here to pass judgement either way although I do believe masculinity and femininity complement each other wonderfully and are immediate and powerful means of attraction. That does not mean that there cannot be masculine women or feminine men and they deserve every bit of happiness and respect as anyone else. What I am saying is, in our drive to be ""enlightened"" we somehow have decided that men acting masculine and women acting feminine is bad or regressive but the reverse should always be celebrated!

As a result of this, the vast majority of people feel that something is wrong or ""off"" but they can't put their finger on what! Society tries to tell them who they should be attracted to and shames them for who society feels they shouldn't be attracted to... they follow this, never question it and become frustrated and confused why dating and relationships are sooo difficult! 

They never look at the obvious reason why, so they blame the other gender! ""Men are afraid to commit"" or ""too shallow"". ""Women are only after money"" or ""nice guys become friendzoned""

Again.. this is an observation. There is no agenda here. I personally believe that our evolutionary, instinctual drives have much more of an influence on our behavior than we'd like to admit. 

I see post after post of people who seen frustrated so all I ask is that you at least consider that this may be why because it plays out the same ways time and time again in so many different ways if you care to only look.

I don’t really know how my situation got the way it was but it went like this. So I’m a guy who typically deals with women only for sex like FWB kinda and avoid any type of relationship and I am upfront about this to all the girls I talk to. I also let them know Im talking to other girls too and most often girls are cool with it. 

But one girl after fooling around for two weeks told me to cut off ties with any other girls and claim her as my girlfriend. I said no and broke things because if you don’t like the situation I don’t want to upset anyone and that’s when she went crazy and started stalking me and attempted to run me over.

The thing is people always say be honest to girls and be upfront with them  but when I am they always try to change the situation or try and start a relationship. And I I always tell them that we agreed from the start that’s not the plan.

We both met in the same university class through a formed study group. So we see each other in class as well. Mostly, the trip was supposed to be going to the city with the whole group, but most of the people in the group cancelled last minute. We still were able to meet up with some friends but mostly it was to ourselves.

We definitely had our great moments, we both loved going out exploring the city and stuffing ourselves with food. We also had a great time shopping together and making the occasionally joke with each other. We did have rough patches though. While we were walking in the city (its pretty fucking loud), She would speak softly and I would reiterate what she said and she would get annoyed questioning me if I was listening to her. It happened a few times, and I was starting to get a little flustered as well. I apologized and told her it was loud. She said I was making excuses. I guess I'm deaf lmao. Luckily we sorted that out. Then later on, We were discussing why songs used the n-word, and I accidently used the word as in example and she flipped out. I knew I messed up, she got pretty heated over it. But we were able to sort that out as well after we sat down and talked it out. Held hands, walked it off. 

I also haven't been saying ""I love you,"" since the last time I said it, she said I think I loved you and later came clean that she was still confused and she said she didn't want to hurt me later down the road because she wasn't sure if she loved me. I've been holding that back ever since then. She also told me that she wasn't used to be the receiving end of the relationship, as I had took care of her when she was sick (Which is normal in relationships, no?).  She told me that in her last relationship, she did most of the work... said that I was too nice. I wasn't too happy about that. But I said that I'm willing to change and to not worry because you can get my back when I'm not feeling well.

We still are able to talk a lot, and get really intimate. But I still have this unsteady feeling of whether or not she loves me. I just recently made a post of the trip, but I suspected she wouldn't post or comment about it, which is what exactly happened. I don't really care about this though, since she did post us on her story. I don't want to force the issue and seem needy at all.  I get doubts in my head a lot about whether it'll work out, even then, I'm willing to stick it out since I want to gain more experience with relationships. Part of me hurts in the inside sometimes. It's like an emotional rollercoaster. I feel good with her, then at times I'm left with feeling of hurt in my insides, like right now. Is it just me overthinking things?

I tend to remember things she said in our past convo during our past dates to imply in our new date to let her know I'm listening and care.  However, she doesn't say stuff like ""Aww, you remember my favorite ____"" or something to show some kind of affection... When I try to talk about something personal, she gives very short answers or feels like she doesn't want to give that much detail.  What's weird is that when we first met online and chatted for a month or two, she would seem to talk a good bit.  When we met, it's like I'm pushing to make a convo start and she responds with short replies.  I'm not great or good at banter, sexual innuendos, teasing, so those things hardly show up.  I might be able to do one per date.  The rest of the time I'm just being a gentleman and showing her I'm doing my best to have a fun time and not after sex/creep.  (I really am not after sex, more for a relationship) 

She does smile and we do have fun playing our activities, but I'm finding she's ending the night early when in her text she would say she's free all night with even a kissy emoji.  She's an introvert-type personality and I don't think she really dates a lot.  She's always busy with work and idk.  I like her a lot, but now after the third date, I just don't know where she stands.  Our date ended with her going for a quick hug and leaving without the time for me to attempt to kiss or talk.  It's weird that on our first date, she turned and gave me the cheek when I tried to kiss.  However, later on that night she messaged that she had a great time and wants to see me again.  The second date, she didn't message back until I wrote the next day.  So I'm not sure what's going on. 

Again, I really do like her and want to make things work... but wow, I'm not seeing any girly flirty behavior from her.

Hell I ran a half marathon a few weeks ago. I just haven't had any big opportunities like parties to go to where you meet people and get to talk to them. It's mainly been a daily rush to class with limited club activities (f u covid). There have been a few instances where I've talked to a girl about a common interest but that's just not enough to amount to anything. I don't get how so many people are dating, I guess I just have a weird set of interests? It's disheartening and makes me feel subhuman. It's fall break and I'm thinking about this. Before you say it, Tinder is a joke unless you live in a city of at least 800,000 (mine is 160,000). That app makes my brain want to off itself, I don't want it again. Is being noticed/having opportunities to meet women a matter of timing and being at a good place to talk? I've gotten some likrs and super likes on Tinder before, just nowhere near where I lived. I just don't get the whole game, it's like everyone knew each other before the semester started and there's no way for anyone not from this area to get their foot in the door. I just feel like an awkward 3rd wheel. I think you just have to be friends with a lot of people to meet othrr people. It sucks, and every form of media reminds me of the dating world. The biggest posts on social media are about relationships and sex. That's the definition of being someone with worth. It's so widespread of a hot topic that it's in academia like anthropology.

i moved to the states last month and i guess the culture shock just got to me. i haven’t dated since my last ex (over a year ago), but in my first month here, i went on dates with two guys. i had my first kiss on the first date with one guy, and i had sex for the first time on the second date when i don’t even have feelings for him. i went home feeling so disgusted and confused.

The pressure of having to meet the expectations of one another, of really being like a lovey dovey couple.

so, before we become close, there was one girl that he was talking to. they never meet tho cuz there was lockdown and she was overseas (we are all international students) back then. Their talking phase has ended loonggg time ago but like the girl is my classmate and when it happened, she told me about what happened between them that he cut off the talking phase with her. she was upset and she told me because she knows I fancy him too and we all were in the same classes back then.

I was too shy to approach him as I'm an introvert and she is an extrovert anddddd he is an introvert too. so like I believe she was the one who approached him too back then. I kinda can sense why he cut her off. cuz she's very talkative and kinda clingy? and i believe he wasn't comfortable with it? IDK I can't really say why i don't want to assume okay.

anyway yea, like he cut off the talking stage with her before we really get closed. and idk like everything that she said he told her is nothing like what he told me (cuz i bait him with questions that relate to the things he said to this girl before and back then we were just friends so I don't think there is any reason for him to lie or anything idk).

the problem here is he does not know that I know about them and I don't want to tell cuz I don't want to ruin the things between us u know and IDK maybe i worry if he back to her just because they are following each other on Instagram while it is clear he is not the Instagram person, I mean he doesn't even have Facebook. maybe I'm just insecure? or what? trust issue? hahaha omg ? so am I just overthinking? or what how?

I had to decline because I had other stuff planned but promised to get back to him later.

A couple of weeks later I asked him to play golf with me and he was like sure. We played golf for an hour and so and then he invited me to his friends place to meet his friends. They were friendly.

I had fun etc and time went by when a week later I asked him to go on a walk with me in the evening, it was like 7 pm. And he was yeah, answered very fast and all. We went on a walk for an hour and just talked, it was flowing so good and never felt stale or awkward.

A couple of weeks later we went out for drinks and pool. Before I arrived he sent a snap, a selfie of himself with tons of heart emojis. I just thought it was a joke so I didn't think much about it. 

And then two weeks ago he sent me a text telling me to come to a student bar that he works at. I went there and saw him in the bar and we talked a lot and I held him company for a while before I went to a table and talked to some students rest of the night. He texted me and was like ""where did you go?"" And I answered I was at a table with some students.

When the bar was closing and I was going out, Kind of drunk, I saw him, he approached me and put his arm around me and was like go home you're drunk which was funny.

And then the day after, kind of late, it was 11 PM, he texts me again telling me to come to the bar again. I was sleeping so didn't see the text until the morning after so I couldn't come. The week afterwards I asked him if he wanted to hang with me and a friend at the bar. He was like probably if I'm not busy. However some things came up so I had to decline the whole thing unfortunately.

I am just completely lost, annoyed and sad at this point. I had gotten off dating apps last year after a pretty bad experience with a guy and felt like I was ready to get back on the apps a few weeks ago. I downloaded all the apps and for a bit it was the usual crap, with dry convos, people not responding, harassment by people you aren't interested in etc. This one guy did catch my eye though and his name let's say is Andrew. We began talking back and forth and it became apparent that we both had very similar personalities and senses of humour. I am a very sarcastic guy and I joke around a ton so for him to have a similar sense of humour and get my jokes was a big plus. Anyway, things go well for a bit and he asks for my phone number and I excitingly give it to him. We decide to talk a lot more and we go from there.

 Just to mention, we are both quite busy with our jobs, but we still managed to find time throughout the days to either check in with each other by message or even call. Anyway for the next two weeks it was going great. We talked quite frequently whenever we could and we even called from time to time. Through talking with him, not only did we have similar humour and personalities but we had very similar morals and we talked about ghosting, being a good person etc and we had very similar views about that. So we both initiate and talk back throughout the weeks, each checking in on each other and asking each other how we are. We even had a bit of a sexual moment(which he mainly initiated and I was fine with). We set up a date for the Sunday on the 2nd week of us matching on the app. The time comes around and I'm super excited. Andrew seems pretty excited too and I even mentioned if I could sleep over and he seemed cool with it so I was just over the moon. I really trusted him and for once I thought this could go somewhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the date comes up and I'm super nervous meeting him like most people would be meeting someone for the first time. I'm a bit awkward initially but I soon warm up to him and we're just enjoying our time. He did mention that he didn't really let guys come over to his place on the first date. I was a bit embarrassed about it and wondered why he didn't just let me know but hey I understood it. Anyway, since we went to the shops for our date, after we were done we go to his car and we have a very passionate and great make out session. I had forgotten how good it was to kiss a guy haha. Afterwards, I kinda just lay in his lap and we just stare into each other while talking about how the date went well and how good of a connection we both had. I went home afterwards very happy with the outcome and excited for the future date we had planned. 

&amp;#x200B;

So after the date he started not to reply back to my messages. I was like that's okay, its only been a day or two I'll wait a bit. I started to just double text him a bit if he didn't reply just cause I assumed he might've been busy. He still replied back willingly but the convos started being a bit dry and they'd end pretty quickly. This started being the entire theme of the week and I started getting a bit worried. I was mainly initiating the conversation and was double texting him to keep the convo alive. I offered to call him one night and he seemed really excited and was down. I was super happy but he ended up not following through with it. He apologised the next morning say he fell asleep but I still was a bit sad. I double check with him if we are still down for our date next weekend and he says ""yea sure"" and that's it. I asked if he wanted to call if he wasn't busy and I got no response. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's sorta where I'm at atm. I'm honestly done with initiating the convos cause I hate double texting people cause it makes me feel so insecure and needy. I'm just really annoyed at this point because we had such a great connection and now it's just sorta fizzled out. It went from him being super interested to me having to string out a conversation only for him to just not respond. I am sad if he doesn't like me anymore but I'm just more mad that he's not being straight up and honest with me after he went on about how he wanted us to be honest with each other about how we are feeling at the current moment instead of ghosting the person. Even if he's busy with work, a simple ""sorry I won't be able to respond much today I'm busy"" would be more than efficient instead of just not responding.

I’m a guy (24M) that has been dumped by 2 girls for a very similar reason. They both had been emotionally abused by their past partners and was initially very infatuated with me due to my kinder, gentle personality, looks and common interests,  telling me how lucky they are to have me in their life, before later going cold and telling me... “I’m still overcoming my past/right person wrong time/you’re the loveliest sweetest person ever” etc.

I know this generally just means they’re just not interested, and I feel that’s likely the case with the first girl I dated. The second one was kinda weird though, they told me “I know how cliche this sounds but it’s genuinely not you, it’s me, some bad stuff happened to me a few weeks ago, someone meant to be my friend made me do things I didn’t wanna do” (someone may have raped her?) Either way both girls ended up on Tinder pretty much a week after telling me that.

Now I know there's a multitude of possible reasons this may happen and I'm not attempting to look for a specific answer. But I feel that emotional unavailability has been very poorly explained to me. I’m just genuinely curious: if you were seeing a guy, and you felt you were a good match but went cold and left him because you needed to work on yourself/get over past relationships, did you eventually realise you left him because you just weren’t attracted to him enough? Do you think reasons like “right person wrong time”, as honest as it may seem to the girl, is more of an unconscious way of saying I’m not attracted enough? Or are there genuine, non-attraction related reasons things like this can happen? 

After my first gf left, I fell into a trap of seeing all this dumb alpha male dating advice that “she left you cause you’re low status, boring and effeminate, she wouldn't have left you if you were confident” and all that crap, and I believed for a while if I was some more bad-boy, popular, high status guy (as opposed to my shy, sensitive, INFP type personality) then they would have stuck around. Though I think that advice is pretty stupid now I guess it is rooted in some general truths about attraction. I just wanna get a variety of perspectives on this whole thing with attraction and timing and stuff so I don't go down any more rabbit holes with dating. Also I don’t wanna end up spreading the wrong messages to other guys that might be going through the same thing.

She has consistently showed signs of interest in me. We kissed once but never had sex. We got on really well so I asked her a drink at the end of lockdown but she declined and said she assumed that we are just friends. I’m surprised/confused with her decision and still attracted to her and would like to salvage something. How should I proceed?

From the get-go, this girl (22F) and I (22M) got on really well. I sensed strong interest from her. She followed me on Instagram. We had some good chats on Instagram. We saw each other out a couple times. She expressed signals she was sexually interested. I stupidly didn’t make a move. Unfortunately, we went into a 3month covid lockdown. Throughout lockdown, we flirtatiously messaged each other. Towards end of lockdown, I asked her for a walk and it went really well. 

The following night we were both drinking so she came over for a bit of a party and we kissed. After we kissed, she strangely said she really likes hanging out with me but was worried kissing would ruin everything. I asked if she was friendzoning me and she said no. We went back to her place but were both very drunk so we went to sleep. The next morning, she was indicating she wanted to have sex. Unfortunately, I felt too hungover/anxious to have sex. Even though I told her, I sensed she was a bit confused/disappointed.

That night she asked me to come back to her house as she was anxious from hangover. I was feeling better but unfortunately she was feeling the same as I was in the morning and wasn’t displaying the same sexual signals as she was before. We just hung out and I didn’t stay over. I was frustrated I hadn’t slept with her but happy with how well we were getting on. Over the next week, we went to the park for a drink and to the beach another day. 

I messaged if she wanted to ‘go out for a drink when lockdown lifts next week?’ To my surprise, she said ‘I think it'd be inappropriate to go on a date as we've discussed haha’, 'unless it's as friends'. We never discussed this - she only previously told me a story about kissing a close friend which ruined their friendship. But, as we agreed at the time, our situation was different as we weren't close friends. When asked why she didn't want to go on a date she thought by telling me that story she indicated that we should be friends and thought I was on same page. I’m not sure if she is being dishonest. She was surprised I was confused so we spoke on the phone at length. 

I played it cool and said I hadn’t categorised us yet and was just going with the flow. She explained she didn't want to ruin our friendship and was actively not looking for a boyfriend as she’s had 2 bad breakups and wants to focus on herself. She really wants to continue hanging out. To her surprise, I told her I wasn’t sure if I wanted to. I didn’t want her to think I have feelings and was disappointed so I kept the convo relaxed. However, she could tell I was a bit annoyed which made her anxious. 

She showed signs of sexual interest almost every time I saw her. Maybe it’s because I didn’t take my opportunities and she assumed I was uninterested. When she was drunk (few nights after we kissed) she said I seemed uninterested in her and she couldn’t get a read on me. From my perspective, even though I may not've capitalised on opportunities to be more intimate, by kissing, hanging out and just from how I spoke I thought I was expressing interest. 

It’s been a week, I’ve seen her once in a group and we just had small talk. She messaged me a couple times about random stuff – I felt like she was trying to find an excuse to message me. I still have feelings/attracted to her and would like to salvage something. I also will continue to see her socially which I’m worried about. 

I have a constant urge to contact her and hang out. But I’m thinking this is not a good idea.

I've always been a bit shy and introverted. I have a few good friends, but honestly it's been a while since I've really tried to talk to anyone new. I've never been in a relationship despite a efforts at doing so in the past. It's something that has started to bother me more as time as went on.

Since we're back in person this semester, I decided I'd try my hand at dating again. People are eager to talk to each other face-to-face again so I thought it might be easier than before. 

I met a girl who was in most of my classes who I thought was pretty cute. I started trying to talk to her a bit between classes here and there. Normally, I find it hard to just start conversations with people, but I honestly found her very approachable/easy to talk to. We mostly just talked about school stuff (engineering is hard ok), but I at least got the impression that she didn't mind talking to me. 

After a couple of weeks, I worked up the courage to ask for her number. And I got it. Still, I tried to temper my expectations. She was a nice enough person that there was probably no way she would have said no to my face. But she at least didn't seem hesitant or reluctant in anyway.

On the coming weekend, I decided to text her (it had been a couple of days). 

I asked her how her weekend was going over text and we had a brief conversation before I invited her to study with me at the library for an upcoming exam. Maybe this was stupid in hindsight, but I thought it was a reasonable and not particularly committal request. After all, worst that could happens is I go alone and just study like I intended to anyway.

She says that she would see how she felt and would let me know the next day. I kind of suspected that she was just too nice to straight up say ""no"", but somehow I was still surprised to hear a maybe. 

The next day I spend a few hours studying alone in the library and leave feeling a little disappointed. In a lot of ways, that's what I should have expected, but it still didn't feel great. 

For all I know, she was genuinely really busy or just preferred to study alone (it's a pretty serious exam coming up). But deep down, I think I might just be deluding myself. She would have texted \*something\* if that were the case. Maybe she didn't initially realize I was interested in her when she gave me her number and I texted her. She was just being polite to a classmate. 

Now it's early Monday morning and I slept terribly. I think it's set in overnight that she's almost certainly not interested in me. I woke up feeling nothing but a dull ache. You know that feeling after you bomb a test and you wake up the next morning still feeling bad about it? It reminds me of that.

It's going to be a little weird this morning since I'll be seeing her again in class (we sit next to each other), but I really don't think I should bring it up again. If I'm right that she's not interested, there's no point in bringing it up. If she had some other reason, she'll probably tell me herself. So at this point, there's nothing for me to do except get over it. 

Honestly I would have preferred it if she just said ""hey, I don't like you"" or something more direct. I feel like then it would be more obvious to me that I should just leave this person alone. But instead I got my hopes up despite my best efforts to prevent it. 

It just hurts a lot more than I expected. I haven't even known this girl that long, why does it feel this way? I don't understand how I can know that I'm being ridiculous about this, but it still feels so viscerally awful.

It's getting to a point where I'm just asking myself ""Is there something wrong with me?"" I don't think I'm a particularly bad-looking guy. I don't think I'm a terrible person to have a conversation with either.  It's not so hard to brush off one or two rejections as just flukes.

We clicked and the rest is history lol. Didn’t take me long to realize I liked him, he’s handsome as hell, accomplished, smart, and  he made me happy. There was something about him, to this day I couldn’t say for sure what it was. I was and still am mesmerized by him, like he had me under some sort of spell. When he around me, I couldn’t help myself, end when he’s gone Id miss him like crazy. We kinda developed a short of relationship over the years, not actually putting labels on anything but he was mine and I was his. I like the idea of “belonging” to him in a sense. He was everything I’ve ever wanted. At least that’s what I thought, I had come to care about him , and I truly believe that he cares about me too. We have both expressed how much we want to be together, like to actually be in a serious relationship. He says all these things but doesn’t back it up. Like we see each other every couple of months, we can go without talking for days sometimes weeks at a time. He says that when he figures things out, abs that maybe things between us will be different when he had settled everything. 

I got restless, and I was tired of waiting. My mentality was that we’ve known each other for years what are you waiting for? He says that he cares about me and I can imagine a life with me but why hasn’t he tried. When I expressed my feelings he tells me that he doesn’t want me to wait around for him, but also he doesn’t want me to walk away. I hate the fact that he seems so comfortable with letting me go but if he actually cared about me why doesn’t he show me that. It’s been a tough road between me and him. Even still I can’t stop caring about him him, I still think about him all the time, I still want him. But I know I can’t continue to wait around on a maybe. I want more, and he’s not giving me that, there’s so many times I try to tell myself to walk away but I just couldn’t.

The last time we talked, he told me that he was going to call me and I waited up all night for a phone call that never came. I’m heartbroken because I really wanted it to be him. Although I know that he might not be good for me I can’t leave him alone. I fight the urge all the time not to text him or reach out. It’s been weeks  since we last talked. If I wasn’t the one who would say something I’m sure weeks could turn into months. I don’t understand why I still have these feelings for him and they are so strong, it’s like In a way  he has this power over me. I don’t know if it’s love or what. This last time I tried  to delete every trace of him,  I think about him and I’d give anything to talk to him again. I don’t understand why I still feel this way, I’m writing this so that maybe someone can shed some light. A part of me knows I should just walk away but for some reason I can’t.

She never smoked while I was there, but I guess I never thought to even ask prior to meeting. For me, that was the dealbreaker, but I still went through with enjoying the company.

The turning point of this story comes at the end, though. I said it was late and I should get going, and she said she should use the bathroom before I did so, and when she came back, she said she wanted to show me the rest of her house. She tours all the basics, but then she said she wanted to show me her basement, at which point, I got a little hesitant because you can't help but think about all the stories about dates gone wrong where people are lured into basements and then down there, they're jumped or something. I didn't feel like this woman -- who works as a program director for special needs people -- would be wanting to do harm, but you just never know.

I hesitantly go down, and she shows me one room, but then at that point, it was like there was room after room around each corner growing darker and darker that she wanted me to walk with her through. In reality, she just wanted to show me how she had thousands of books down there, but I was honestly feeling skittish at that point, and I guess it must have shown in the way I left, because she called me when I got home to ask if she had scared me, and I half-joked about how I grew anxious about when she led me down to the basement. She was kind of offended that I'd think she'd murder me, but can you really blame anyone this day in age? We both agreed the meetup didn't really result in romantic chemistry, but she offered to continue being friends and hang out again (not that I'm expecting to.)

Moral of the story: If you're going to ask someone to come over, maybe don't put them in situations where they might think the worst is about to happen. From my end, the only reason I felt comfortable going over is because our phone call seemed normal, she was older than me, her info and career checked out on Google, and I didn't have reason to believe I was meeting anyone shady.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1059242,public,self,She led me further and further into her dark basement at the end of our date.
