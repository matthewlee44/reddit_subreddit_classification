2,p6wbkl,1629309003,Am I just unlucky? 7 months of OLD and not even one second date. I don't get what I am doing wrong.,"I am 26 [M] and I have been doing OLD for 7 months. I usually have a date a week. I make sure I am not on my phone, that I don't treat it like a job interview, and that we both have fun. 

I just find it really frustrating putting all this time and effort into someone just to say ""I don't see this going anywhere"" but then they spend the whole date laughing, flirting and touching me. I just don't see how anybody can say stuff like that after showing me with their actions that they into me but their words say otherwise. 

Not every date has been amazing (some have been bad but majority of them have been good) but it's just at this point I either get ghosted or they tell me straight up (so far only 8 have responded and said ""no"" out of all my dates) that they don't feel like it'll go anyway. 

It just makes me wonder is it me that is the problem or is it them? My brain wants to think it's me and that I am doing everything wrong. I just don't know what to do anymore. I try to be positive all the time but it's hard when every date I go on won't lead to a second date so it's like why try to date? Why put myself through all of this? Why even put in any effort if I am just gonna get told that we aren't capatible?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p6wbkl/am_i_just_unlucky_7_months_of_old_and_not_even/

Due to time constraints on both of our ends we can rarely meet up so staying rooted together is our best option until we can make time to see each other.

This is something she has mentioned to me she is quite upset about and hasn't taken the time or energy to plan out when or how we will meet, and that she is leaving this decision to me. I told her I am ready when she is, as I already have everything in place. 

She has mentioned to me looking to break away from her routine to come over and unwind and relax. This has been something she has had concern for before until now she feels completely pent up and unable for us to make time to see each other. Saying her work is more important.

I completely resonate with these feelings and have mentioned if she wanted a quick afternoon escape we could make this happen. 

Her friend has mentioned wanting to get together, saying that she is also feeling unwell and under the weather, and to make time to visit would be something we both have an interest in doing.

Given our history she has shown a distinct interest in our relationship, and I personally would be open to exploring things. Whether that means online in an emotional aspect or in person (what I would lean towards).

How do I speak to her about inviting to my place? Considering the situation this is going to be an ongoing topic and I only want her to come if she plans on enjoying herself, any other reason would not be sufficient. 

How can I find a time suitable for her to visit, or should we wait and talk about things when we are both open to discussion? Thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p6y0nj/approaching_gf_with_idea_of_coming_to_my_place/

Sometimes it's better to have this conversation early to see if both parties are on the same page and then you can then cut your losses (if you guys are not on the same page) and move on.

39,p70d7u,1629321120,Why does she keep sending me messages?," 

After knowing (and having a crush on) her for a year, we went on a date. It was shortly after a breakup and she said that it was a bad time. I was mostly fine with it, but she ignored anything I sent her for a few weeks until I ran into her again. Ever since, she has been periodically sending me videos of her dog or other low-effort messages. I've been getting less and less responsive to this and have been trying to get over it, as I was very into her, but I just don't know what to make out of this.

Also, since the date, she's been pretty quiet and acting different around me in-person until I saw her last week, where she seemed a lot more normal and like herself. Also, a mutual friend asked her flat-out if she was interested in me (which I didn't really want, but whatever), and he said she felt emotionally unavailable.

Been actively focusing on enjoying myself with hobbies and trying new things and been considering making a dating profile to put myself out there more, so not looking for advice on dealing with it or even winning her over because that's out of my control. Just looking for some extra context because it's hard to ignore and I'm pretty much guaranteed to keep running into her because of mutual friends, whether I want to or not.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p70d7u/why_does_she_keep_sending_me_messages/

42,p70swa,1629322518,Anyone know why some people lose interest when someone likes them back ?,"The ideal situation would be to be excited when someone likes you back but for some that’s not the case. Me included, and I’m 21 now and it’s gotten to a point I’m tired of this avoidant nonsense, I’m tryna get to the root of it so I can work on not losing interest when someone reciprocates. 

Because I always go through a cycle 
1. I like someone 
2. They like me back and I lose interest 
3. I stick around and hope the feelings come back 
4. Feelings don’t come back and cut ties  or I regain the interest and I end up falling hard


That stage when someone likes me back is always the hardest for me, I currently like someone and he likes me too but now I’m in a state of panic, I think my issue is feeling unworthy, so I keep tryna look for excuses as to why we shouldn’t work, but this time I’m catching those thoughts before hand and it’s this back and forth in my mind. It’s actually so hard but I wanna take accountability because this cycle has inflicted pain on others so I can’t keep doing this it’s also not making me myself happy

44,p70vh3,1629322754,He's like the alpha of all the other alpha males.,"I've (34 mtf) recently started seeing a guy (37 cis) that's pretty much put all of the guys in my past to shame. We met eachother when we both were looking for sex (grindr) so I didn't expect much when we first started talking. He impressed me for being proper because he introduced himself before he came on to me. We didn't hook up, but instead just talked all night. We both felt that this connection is completely different than any other we've ever had. He has really impressed me with where his life is right now and I have the utrer most respect for him becsuse of it. He has goals and dreams of his future that are realistic and obtainable so I like where he's going into the future also. He's an extremely hard worker,  but doesn't let work prevent him from enjoying his life. He has full custody of a daughter (11) who is questioning if she is a trans man or not. He 100% supports whatever she feels is the right path to take, although he is concerned about her living life a trans man because he hates how our culture treats trans people. He's such a good daddy to his daughter, and I respect him so much for how he's raising her. To top it off, he's completely adorable, emotionally available, and 100% the type of guy that I've always imagined I've wanted to be with. Oh, and most importantly he loves 90's music the most.


For our first date I invited him over for dinner and cooked us steaks. It's cheaper than a restaurant, more intimate, and there's no awkwardness when it comes time to pay a check. This genius of a man turned on some Boyz II Men and asked me if I'd dance with him while I cooked. I started crying and he got confused about why, but then I explained to him how I've never been asked to dance by anyone before and I didn't know how. He didn't miss a beat and grabbed my hand with his big roughed up man hands pulled me closer, then proceeded to teach me to slow dance in the kitchen. It felt so good to have him in control with his hands on me leading me around. He told me I was beautiful then asked to kiss me when we were done dancing and I just melted in his arms. He actually asked instead of just doing it and making it feel awkward. It definitely wasn't forced. That meant so much to me because it made me really feel respected by him. The whole ordeal was the most romantic experience I've ever had in my life. The icebreaker of champions, I say. He's like the alpha of all the other alpha males.


We spend a lot of time with eachother, and I feel so wanted We're always as eager to see eachother as if it were the first date every moment we are together. I don't want to get ahead of myself and be let down by false expectations, but I feel that I've met the one that sticks around finally. I've thought about marriage before and I don't want to get married because I'm independent and I generally don't need a man. Surely not for money because I'm retired, and I've got a dog snuggle buddy. Not to mention I own my house. I don't need a man to screw up my life, and I feel that the chances of a trans woman getting married are extremely low anyway since we're so easily taken advantage of in that regard. That said, he said he likes my level of independence because I don't make him feel used like a lot of other women have. I do feel that this man could definitely make me rethink my stance on marriage would he ever ask me to marry him. I know it's cliché and all that jazz, but it really has been love at first sight. I need to learn more about him and only time will tell, but I would absolutely give myself to this man with no questions asked, and that scares me a little bit.


Tldr; I met a man I really like and our first date was extremely romantic because he asked me to dance. After dating for a bit, I'd change my stance of not getting married for this man.

I (17F) just broke it off with a 29M that i'd been seeing for 2 months via text because I've decided to be exclusive with someone else. I tried to write as nice of a breakup text as possible while keeping it brief and to the point.At first I didn't hear from him at all and then this morning he sent me a rude response. Why can't guys ever just say ""I'm disappointed to hear this but wish you the best too"" and leave it at that? That's what I would say back. In all my past experiences where i've been the breakup-er the men have replied negatively or rudely.

This other guys has been traveling and out of town for almost a month and a half of what was our 2 month relationship (6 dates in total). He returned after 4 weeks at the end of July and we hung out twice but then he left again and wasn't due back until the end of August. Does anyone else seem to have this issue? TBH I feel like it's affected my wanting to have serious conversations with those i'm dating because all their responses (except with the guy I'm now exclusive with who seems to be a diamond in the rough) have been so mean.

Long story short we started  flirting and sexing and about week after she told me she broke up with  him. Next couple of days we went on a dates after shift and had sex  every time. Week or so after our last ""date"" she became cold and told me  that this is just too much for her, and she isn't ready for anything  serious and is sorry for jerking me around. I gave her couple of days,  but when I reached out she told me that she needs to give her ex another  chance and went to trip both of them had planned together. We didn't  speak for some 10 days and out of the blue I got message that she is  thinking about me and wants to see me as soon as she get back from a  trip (she has broken up with him again). We flirted over text but then  she started asking ""serious"" question about compatibility and  relationships. I felt that that conversation was a bit heavy so I didnt  text for a day after which she invited me to her place. Once there she  said she doesn't want sex, but that she wants to take it in a ""proper  way"" and that we should just hang out and get to know each other first,  of course hour later we ha sex again. Everything was great for a few  days but then I noticed her getting cold at work, and she told me that  everything is so complicated and she doesn't know what to do and she  doesn't know if we should see each other any more.

Next  Monday she was all all but ignoring me on the work and indirectly told  me that she is back with her bf.

We started as friends getting to know each other but within the first few hang outs realized we liked each other more than friends and things got more flirtatious and physical. Well…. I freaked out thinking about how close we’d come in such a short period of time and when we met up on Monday I told him I didn’t think we could date each other based on an issue I saw in the future of a relationship with him (compatibility based). He was very disappointed because he had been hoping in that same conversation to make things official with me and I just completely caught him off guard. He thought we hadn’t had enough time to get to know each other well and the potential issue I brought up would only be realized after spending more time together. I asked if he had a friend he could talk to about this and he said he did. So I said I was open to hearing what his friend had to say, if he felt like sharing it, and I would leave the situation open-ended, and for now just wanted to meet up with him as friends in groups. We have mutual friends. I texted him this morning at 9am (Wednesday) and asked how he was doing and said I was checking in because I had left our last conversation uncomfortable and probably hurt his feelings and felt a little bad about it. It’s already been most of the day (3pm) and he hasn’t responded, even though he usually responds to my texts within an hour, even during work days. Also, one of our mutual friends texted me around 1pm and asked if he invited me to the beach because he’d invited her and a few other people and she wanted me to join them. I told her he’d mentioned it and I’d sent him a message but I was waiting to hear from him on logistics (he’d told me about this event on Sunday). So now I’m waiting on hearing 2 things. The beach thing and the “how he’s doing” thing. But it seems clear he’s ignored my message or maybe is taking extra time to think about a response for me. Maybe he’s changed his mind about my beach invite?? The suspense is killing me so I’m gonna type it out here. Also, is it reasonable to expect him to respond earlier? Just saying, “Hey I want to respond to you but I need more time to think about it” would be better than no response. When should I expect a response and when is an appropriate time to reach out again? I might just need to give him the benefit of the doubt that he’s having a busy workday. Or should I assume he hasn’t responded to me yet because he still needs to talk to his friend about the issue?

I responded and they didn’t comment (guaranteed I didn’t ask any questions of them). So it’s been a week and I reached out and asked how was their injury. They haven’t responded in 24 hours which is atypical- they are usually slow but respond within several hours. They haven’t unmatched me online either.

72,p73r5e,1629332185,Advice on how to proceed/ need some internet strangers to knock some sense into me,"
Bit of a long read and also on mobile so apologies.
So I (25m) matched with this girl (26f) through OLD about 3 months ago and have been on around 6/7 dates (only 2 in the first 1.5 months as she then moved to my city) and we’ve been talking pretty consistently everyday, sometimes a lot of messages, sometimes only a few but nonetheless we’ve had pretty consistent communication. 
We both agreed after our first date that we were not looking for anything serious right away but we’re open to seeing what would happen and that we would be dating other people as well. So far so good. 
After going on a couple of dates we found that we had a lot in common, we share common music tastes, films, books, the same kind of humour, political views and general outlook on life. We also began to open up emotionally with her telling me about family issues and previous relationship troubles, her singing with me (she said she hates singing infront people), her introducing me to her sister through FaceTime  and troubles with anxiety for both of us. Physically we did progress  however due to several unforeseen events and a bad timing from a certainly monthly event we didn’t seal the deal until about 2 weeks ago. 
And this is where the problems start.

So what happened was we went on a date at the beginning of the week, both of us got trashed and had loads fun, lots kissing laughing and touching. When we finally got back to hers we got into bed cuddling at which point she told me that ‘I make her feel safe’ and just as I’m making a move she passed out. We wake up the next morning cuddling at which point she tells me that she loves spending time with me but isn’t looking for a relationship,I’m still unsure about what I want but tell her I feel the same and bring up our agreement from the first date. I get up to go to work and she’s all over me kissing and a talking about our next date which we agreed would be the following week. 
So then two days later she invites me over to watch a film in the evening before she travels back to her home town for the weekend, and we end up having sex and cuddling afterwards.

However, since then our communication has done a complete 180. She started to take a day or two to reply to me or just leave me on read. Normally with casual dating this would be normal but considering the way we were talking before the shift was noticeable and jarring, however I did organise a date for Monday just gone, which was only two hours as she had prior plans. 

So this is where it gets confusing. We enjoyed ourselves at the beach talking about deep and light subjects and about what we’d been up to since we last saw each other, she even shared with me something that only her sister and counsellor know about (a very grim and traumatic experience). We kissed and were close, sharing beach towels as blankets. When we left I asked her if something was up with her to which she replied that she was fine. However when she got back to hers she messaged asking ‘what did I mean by that’ and when I replied that it seemed like there was ‘something on her mind’ she said it was  interesting that I picked up on it because she thought she was hiding it well. I asked did she want to talk about it and she said ‘it’s not important at the moment’ and that ‘she’ll tell me at some point’. 
Cut to today when she finally replied to a message from yesterday I told her that we should talk about what’s on her mind to which she replies that ‘she really doesn’t want to’ and that it’s nothing to do with me and it’s ‘her own shit and she’s been feeling overwhelmed and talking with her sister about it’ to which I replied that if ‘doesn’t feel comfortable telling me then she shouldn’t.’ She thanked me, and wished her a happy weekend on her family getaway. So what’s a guy to do? 
I’m not going to lie, I feel like maybe something happened when we had sex, and whilst I’m not a sex god by any means I’ve never had any complaints or this happen where I’ve been dating someone and communication drops off after the first time in bed together. Quite a bit of a confidence killer. 

And whilst I’m very aware that I still don’t know her extremely well, I do not think she’s the type to play a game, at least not at this point into dating.
Since my last message I’ve decided to just wait until she gets back to me. My problem here is that I think I’ve caught feelings a little bit and need some advice as to whether to wait it out, or just cut the cord and end things on my terms. And honestly I guess I’m just confused as to what has happened

I am higher-risk and likely to experience significant problems or long-term effects even if vaxxed. 

My date sent me a picture this week of him at a party with 20 people. I think he may have been exposed and am nervous about being around him with how transmissible the delta is. 

He's gone to a lot of trouble to plan a picnic for us tomorrow and put together fancy foods for us to take, and has treated me very well. I don't want to cancel with how much effort he put in. However, we will have masks off to eat and be in fairly close vicinity. 

Would it be fine to ask him to get COVID tested before we meet tomorrow? I feel badly because it's short notice, he might be busy, and it's, well, a swab up your nose. Depending on whether he can get it done at a center, I may also need to bring him an at-home test myself, which means swabbing himself in public which is awkward as all hell. But at the same time, I don't want to put my own health at risk.

I'm working a temporary labor job before trying to find a better paying one in my field. Many of my friends and family express surprisal that I'm not seeing anyone and even encourage me to get out there while I'm young. 

I've never been very inclined to date, in high school I got asked out a couple of times by conventionally attractive girls but just couldn't find the desire to actually engage in an actual relationship with them. I don't think I had depression because I actively spent time with friends and had a good social life which I did feel motivated to maintain. Come college I didn't really pursue anything until my junior year where I had a brief thing with a girl I had become really fond of but that ended really badly.

A year later and I again still can't find the motivation to go out and find dates. I personally feel pretty content just trying to improve myself right now (saving money, investing, and hopefully finding better work) but am becoming a bit worried. I'm a virgin with no real long term dating experience which feels like it will come back to bite me if I ever do feel like trying to date.

I know some people would advise me to just do what I'm comfortable with and if a girl rejects me due to lack of experience that I was probably better off without her, but I'm beginning to think that might be a unrealistic mindset as lack of experience at my age or older may understandably be a red flag for many. Should I just bite the bullet and put myself out there so that it's not an issue later down the road?

82,p752n0,1629336995,I need some advice on my first date!," Hi everyone,

I will go on my first date ever on Saturday. Saying that I'm nervous is quite an understatement.

I'm the good old 22 yo that never kissed a girl. I never went on a date with someone, either.

We are just getting a Coffee to talk a little. 

Now, the thing I'm worried about the most: My whole life I was really overweight (140 kg was my max). Last year, I got my shit together and lost 30 kg. While I feel way better and more confident now, I still have some self-esteem issues. Every time I look in the mirror, I just think ""What girl would like to date such an unfit and fat guy"". That is the hole reason I never went on a date before. I'm just extremely self-aware, in a bad sens.  

There is this one sentence I picked up a couple of years ago, and always have to think about: ""You can't love someone else if you can't love yourself"". Well, I have trouble loving myself. It's really, really hard.

I'm also not a very social guy. I have no problem whatsoever talking to people in a group, but being isolated in a conversation with just one other person that I never really met before freaks me out so much. What if I run out of stuff to talk about? 

&amp;#x200B;

So, does anyone have any advice on going on a date without feeling confident in your looks? And how could I keep up conversations and ask the right questions?

She seems like such a nice and friendly person, I would not want to fuck this up.

To lead and guide them through your thoughts and ideas, kinks and fetishes and follow them into theirs. To share their interests and passions, albeit fun and thrilling one at it or not. Finding fun in something outside of your comfort and immersing yourself.

Incompatibility, I find, is a rather superficial transactional take into relationships. Dating with a purpose.

I went on a date with a colleague (we don’t work in the same function so not conflict of interest). We had this bet of drinking competition. Although I know I cannot match him, I drank so much. When we left the bar, I was very drunk. I cannot remember the details but he accompanied me home. I puked a little bit on bed. And then sometime in the early morning I got up to go to the washroom and noticed he is on my bed. I was definitely not sober and seduced him. Although he enjoyed it but we didn’t do it in the end. He got up to clean up and left.

I spent the next 24h to sober up and feeling extremely embarrassed. The part of puking, the part of seduction and the part I didn’t clean my place so it’s a mess when he was there. 

I texted him the next day saying I enjoyed the time together and apologized for drinking too much. He said it was all good and asked how rest of my weekend going. He said he went drinking the night after us so he was kinda vulnerable. After I replied to him saying let me know what he needs to make his hungover better, he left me on read for 3 days.

I feel like I cannot cope with this. I feel I ruined it because the date before me drunk was great. We still work together so eventually I’ll see him in the future. Should I just leave it now?

I would pick apart my entire existence to justify why so-and-so treated me like crap and/or didn’t want to commit. 
Eventually I hit an all time low, and began going to a counsellor. During a portion of our sessions, we talked about my dating history and mainly my last relationship. I wanted to understand why I allowed people to blatantly disrespect me and use me. Why did I feel extreme guilt when I finally put my foot down, and why hadn’t I done so sooner. Basically, their treatment of me was a direct reflection of how I felt about myself. Only then (did I realize) I was using dating as a way to reinforce the negative beliefs I had about myself. 

Since I’ve seen a million and two posts written by people who are in unsatisfactory situations, I wanted to say this: Admitting you want equal partnership with someone on your level (mentally, emotionally, financially, physically, spiritually etc) is NOT weak. Do not settle for non-committal, selfish, inconsiderate, immature, XYZ, BS. Own who you are and all of the positive qualities you have, do not let someone pull you down to their level. You are NOT asking for too much, trust me. Having standards (that can and will be deemed as too much by the wrong person) will protect YOU from low quality experiences. You cannot fit a square peg into a circle, if someone is incapable of being the person you require them to be then do yourself a favour and move on!

We split for a bit and she had a ONS. she was lonely and no one gave her love, so she got with friends and a guy took advantage of her being lonely and and decieved her.l tried talking with other girls but nothing felt like the love she gave me. She ended no contact and she begged to get back together, note this is a while after that ons. Shee cried and said every other guy tried to use her and one guy deceived her to that point and she was sobbing. she had cut all ties to those people and she has been nothing but loyal and trustworthy ever since. I dont have a problem with what happened, i just think of them as one of her exes. But it means everything to her because i was her first and and that guy was the second, she described herself as feeling whory. Which i dont think that, she made an honest mistake i almost made so many times. basically this doesnt bother me, but it bothers her every night. She would call me every night and she would cry to me about how bad she feels and how it makes her feel whory. Its been months since that incident happened and it keeps her up and distracted alot. Ive comforted her but what ways do u think i should comfort her or what things should i do to make her move on. 

Ps. This doesnt bother me because 
A) i dont want to be hypocritical as i had a past with women
B) Whatever happened made her chnage her mind. she came back to me and she promised and proved that she only wants me
C) I was her first, and now im goint to be her last

I only said that because in some of my previous posts some people encouraged me to break up but i just want to say what i have rn is a strong bond im happy with. We are in love and the only problem we have is this issue.

96,p76hnt,1629341993,Nine dates and still haven’t kissed,"Hey,

So here’s the backstory. I’ve known this girl for a couple of years but we really only started talking a year ago on and off. Anyway she got into a relationship and i got into a different one and it didn’t work out. We reconnected two months ago after she broke up with her boyfriend. The first date i was going to kiss her but didn’t see an opening (wasn’t a ton of physical contact). So i didn’t. She texted me later saying how much fun she had and thanked me for being so patient. I guess her ex and her had a messy breakup. Fast forward it’s been a month and a half. She calls all of these dates every time we hang out and we hit it off every time but there isn’t any physical contact outside of a prolonged hug before saying goodbye. No lingering no eye contact. She flirts with me though and we talk every day. I’m patient because i really like her and I’m cool with continuing because I’m talking to another person I’m just not sure what I’m missing here. Should i text her about it? She always initiated contact. It’s starting to feel like just a friendship which I’m cool with i just need to know that’s what it is. Or should i try to kiss her? Maybe I’m not seeing an opening but there is one and I’m just choosing not to see it. I know it’s not “manly” to text a girl and tell her how you feel but i also am not attached to the outcome. Like if she wants to just be friends or nothing at all it’s all good. I do want it to work but I’ll be okay if it doesn’t. Any advice would be huge. Or how can i introduce more physical contact without it being weird?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p76hnt/nine_dates_and_still_havent_kissed/
97,p76mzh,1629342529,I almost got my first kiss,"First of all, I’m a 19 year old straight guy.  I almost got my first kiss on Saturday July 31st 2021 going into Sunday August 1st 2021.  But, I’m writing this on Wednesday August 18th 2021.

So, I was at my female 3rd cousins college graduation party.  Because it was a college graduation party, it lasted until 5:15 am Sunday morning.  There were also like other 3rd cousins there too.  One of my male 3rd cousins, who is probably important to this story, who is also 3rd cousins with the female 3rd cousins, was there.  So, the almost first kiss happened with one of my female 3rd cousins friends.

This is everything significant that happened between me and her.  Btw, she’s either 21 or 22 (2 or 3 years older then me).

First, my male 3rd cousin, the chick, and I were hanging together early in the evening, like 8:30-ish and he was complaining about how I was on my 8th water bottle and that I wasn’t drinking.  (Side note, I was the only sober person there the whole night.  Everyone else (“kids” (college grads in their very early 20s) and adults) were drunk).  Before I even took a sip of my water, the chick starts taking a video of herself and tells me to give her water, so I start feeding it to her.  And my guy cousin starts complaining that she is now drinking water.

30mins-45mins later it was just her and I.  We were talking and I mentioned that I was going to Boston the next day.  She told me to text her when I was leaving for Boston and she gave me her number.  (I forgot to text her when I left for Boston the next day).  We continue talking and she was saying how much she liked Boston.  After a couple more minutes I asked her if she could text me the video of me giving her water, and she texted it to me.

Like another half hour later, her, my male 3rd cousin, three men in their 50s, and I were hanging out and she showed all of us her boobs 3 times.  Her nipples are pierced.

Later, a bunch of us college kids were in the basement and she told me and some of the guys that I was hanging with that she took some guys virginity their senior year of high school.  And she was proud of it.

A long time later, still in the basement, my male 3rd cousin and I were talking for a while.  He eventually asked how I was doing at college with the ladies.  I told him that I’m a virgin and have never had a girlfriend.  He then starts to give me advice and stuff.  I ask him how he does it and he calls over the girl and tells her that I’m a virgin, I have never had a girlfriend in my life, and that I asked him how he does it.  Btw, I was sitting on a barstool chair with my legs spread.  She says nothing and walks over to me and walks between my legs.  She hugs me and leans against my thing and stays like for 10 seconds.  She then breaks the hug, smiles at the both of us, and walks aways.  My male 3rd cousin was shocked, had his chin dropped, said, “that didn’t go as I thought it would.”  Then chuckled and we continued our conversation.  Also, if I mentioned that I haven’t had my first kiss yet when she was hugging me, she DEFINITELY would have kissed me, but I didn’t think of that until after she left.

A while later, she walked by me and ran both of her hands down my body.  She started at my collarbone and stopped at my waist, then walked away.  Btw, I’m extremely ticklish and people don’t really tickle me, so I forget how ticklish I am.  I kind of get reminded how ticklish I am once a year when I’m at my physical and my pediatrician feels around.  So, when she ran both of her hands down my body, it tickled ALOT, and I couldn’t stop laughing, but it did feel good.

Later during the night, it’s like 1:30 am now, her and I and some other people were up stairs and we went outside because she wanted to do a keg stand with me, but we ended up not doing one.

When I was leaving at 2:40 am (I only left because I was waking up for Boston at 6:00 am) she asked if I was leaving and I told her, “yes”.  So, she walked over to me and hugged me.  At the end of the hug, she back up a little bit, but was still hugging me, didn’t let go, looked up into my eyes and told me to text her when I got home.  She wouldn’t let go until I said I would text her when I got home.  Then she let go and said a final bye.  When I got home, I texted her, “I just got home”.  She then immediately texted me back saying, “okay good glad you’re safe🤍🤍”.  I also said Thanks! after that.  And we haven’t texted or seen each other since then.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p76mzh/i_almost_got_my_first_kiss/

99,p76v6e,1629343405,"1 year online dating : apps, ""results"", tips and vent","Hi everyone,

I have been long time lurking and looked at posts where people were telling their experience with online dating and the apps they used. so much nice advice. That gave me lots of insight.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am ready to share my experience with you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 32M, both a country guy and able to find my way in Miami beach. I like 90s love movies.

&amp;#x200B;

I had not a lot of experience in OLD before. I met 2 girls once from pof so many years ago. I got in a relationship with one.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm putting all my impression and advice like the ones who did that before me.

First advice, don't pay full price for them, register, wait couple of days or week until you get 50 or 70%  discount. I noticed that the experience is different in okc. paying with a % off get you less likes, paying full get you more likes. I used one app at a time when I had some time. not every months because I got in relationship with girls from the apps. Longest was 5 months. Which is not even close to my shorter regular meeting-gf which lasted 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also noticed that the girls who liked me, hinge, okc, did not appear in my stack (where you left or right )...

Also, I had almost 0 matches when I sent the first like to girls in bumble and okc, I was wasting my time in that. 

&amp;#x200B;

In okc, I even finished the close stack once, and out of nowhere, received likes from girls close to me. Okc hides and restrict our profiles.

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts is that the apps hide actually the users who are active.. so we do our stack for nothing. 

Not to mention okc android got rid of search by questions, so it was too much time going to each profile to see compatibility before my swipe. 

&amp;#x200B;

So based on that thought, overall, my behaviour was to do little swipe couple times a day to see my matches and actually wait for the girls to swipe me in first. so I was mostly swiping to see who liked me by liking-matching them.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been on and off the apps to try . As travelling was closed or difficult, I turned to OLD. I can easily talk to people irl and people often talk to me, so I did not need online dating. 

I was looking for a strictly monogamous relationship exclusive everything total 90s movie package. sex was off the chart, as I do not do pre relationship sex. .

&amp;#x200B;

\-Pof : completely full of scammers, not really the nice pof I used long ago. Are the scammers talking to each others until they found out they are scamming scammers ?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Okc : got around 10 likes everyday from girls close.

Some girls did not speak, some spoke once including sending me detailed text introduction and removed their account a day later. some spoke but they did not want to give number to call them/facetime, some were trying getting followers for IG. some were already did involved in casual relationships.

I still have called a few and met some to hang around, some of them went back with their ex. some were looking for distraction or to talk to someone.

they did not really seem like the personality on their profile, or their texting personality was different than irl one.

I have been involved in some exclusive pre relationship with some but later they would tell me something that would make the relationship impossible or too complicated

(I do not work 9 to 5 and I can work from anywhere, sometimes I don't work, I don't have loans, I'm comfortable, and I look for an easy going relationship where someone is actually emotionally and physically/time available, not someone I can only see on weekends. I don't care about my partner financial situation or education, life can be hard and not everyone can pay college).

I recently noticed that girls did not read my profile or had complete different goals.. I'm much more traditional and more into homebody girls.

I also got even more likes from girls abroad on okc (30 per day at least), but most of the time, it is scam. 

I would advise men to look for someone in the same field of work as them if they look girls abroad.

&amp;#x200B;

I would say good experience because I still have some pretty good fun with couple of girls where I feel I connected a lot more. but that connection did not last long or was not regular. I had an incredible experience of fun, laugh with someone a day (which made me be in relationship with her), but the other days, it was completely the opposite.. took me months to know that one time feeling would not happen again. thought I would have that stuff everyday with that girl. It made me tired and I felt exhausted.

&amp;#x200B;

Adding more or less characterics on my profile did not change anything. I had sometimes a long description, sometimes less. I mentionned what I do, sometimes not.

&amp;#x200B;

I spend couple nights sending messages to ones I really really liked, most did not reply (I think they were not even active), and the girls who replied, did not answer my question or went along with conversation. Still I thank them for the reply.

&amp;#x200B;

By the way, do not pay or repay the subscription so quick, okc will show your profile more leaving it not paid, just wait a week or a month. Even better, remove the app, and wait for discount to come in mail to find your likes.

&amp;#x200B;

I also noticed couple of girls were ready to sext fast, or phone sex, like non even in a relationship ? Did anyone notice that ? 

Did okc became a way to get off for few girls ?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-Hinge : my favourite,  got 5 likes per day, less than other apps. but most were talkative and friendly. 

girls were really showing interest (friendship and more) and it felt the more genuine app. I had lots of nice conversations and I met people I would normally talk to irl. It did lead to some friends.

It seems that Hinge did a nice job in matching people. I would use again and recommend to friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Bumble : got 8 to 20 likes a day (meaning right swipe led to match when I opened the app. I did not bother swiping my stack), I don't know why the likes were not regular. Half of the girls sent first message or gif.  same experience as okc. it is overwhelming to have to explain everytime what I want and even more finding what the other really want. the app did not really match me with compatible people.

I made a good friend over the app, we still talk to each other from time to time. 

I would suggest not to pay soon. Like okc, when you don't pay, your profile get shown to more lots people.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Tantan : nice one, but not very practical for distance. some girls were actually in China from China or HK but actively scamming people. bitcoin and stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Tagged : Did not stay long.. I did not understand the app lol.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Luxy : actually very interesting, it is more of a network/dating one rather dating.

wait for the 40 or 70% off to pay.. otherwise it is very expensive and not worth the price.

they don't restrict your profile and it get shown to everyone.

I met people who became friends, very international app,so pretty cool if you can travel. sometimes people are very superficial but there are also friendly educated people around there. academics, finance.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Coffee meets bagel : used a bit , I stayed couple of days , lots of people from finance or IT industry.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Once : I did not pay, stayed a few days, no matches. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Tinder : 0 likes without paying. not going to pay XD. I am pretty sure it is because I don't have abs.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a pretty good run. even if I had matches and girls interested, I don't do casual dating and I will not hang out with someone hanging out with multiple people. As friends yes, for possible love, no.

I focused my attention on one person at a time exclusively, including deactivating apps when getting serious. I treated like I do normally. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will not return to OLD, it is too long to get a feeling of the person I talk to.. sometimes can be weeks before I notice a major stuff... irl I can guess that with body language or the way they talk. especially I can know if I'm interested or the girl is interested.

&amp;#x200B;

Good experience but long and feels complicated. I don't blame the people on there, most are doing something, either busy with their life, meeting other people, getting attention at time",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p76v6e/1_year_online_dating_apps_results_tips_and_vent/
