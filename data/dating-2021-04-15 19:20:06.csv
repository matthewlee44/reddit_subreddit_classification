Since there are little to no consequences to these allegations but massive consequences to even an allegation without any backing it makes me very afraid to date again. One high schooler who had a scholarship to college got it taken away because dozens of girls accused him of SA even though they weren't even from the same country.

1,mrrv57,1618532963,Seeking advice on the best way to handle dating interests,"Hi, folks!

I (32/F) have been out of the dating scene for just over five years and I'm having a rough time getting back into the swing of things. I had been in several long-term relationships before my dating hiatus, and had a pretty devastating fallout with a guy very close to me, to the point it made me want to give up on dating entirely. However, with the passing of time and a lot of kicking my tushy back into gear, I want to try again...but frankly I'm terrified and constantly doubt my judgements. Where I'm hoping you guys might come in is to offer insights on my following situation and what would be the most reasonable way to approach things.

**Guy 1:** I met him via a dating app and we've been corresponding for two weeks (he's two hours away). We get along quite well and I greatly enjoy his kind personality, though I have been having a hard time getting him to send current photos, and our communication is rather spotty. Some of that is due to the fact he's in grad school, and I genuinely understand that free time is a rare commodity...however, I am the one who has to engage any conversations. He's very responsive once I prompt him, but it's nevertheless frustrating. I try to take in to account there's a cultural difference between us, so what's normal or expected from me might not be the same for him, and I do acknowledge men can be shy and need some prompting.

**Guy 2:** This individual (local) is somebody I knew of through mutual acquaintances at work, though he no longer works at my company. I had not personally met him at any point, but I'd often see him pop up as a recommendation on Facebook or LinkedIn, and found him really appealing (and he's single!). By absolute fluke chance, he was referred to me by a mutual acquaintance to assist me on a personal project. He was surprisingly pleasant to speak with on the phone, and we have arrangements to get together to work on said project. For clarify, there is no romantic intent behind our meeting.

With that information at hand, here's where I'm struggling: While I understand Guy 2 is unaware of my plight, would it be unreasonable to see what could develop since I do have an ongoing interest in him? And moreso, would it be reasonable to hold off any sort of commitment, even a date, with Guy 1 until I can feel things out with Guy 2? I have no idea how to juggle things between multiple people, as I'm generally just focused on one individual at any given time, but I truly did not anticipate Guy 2 coming into the picture. Realistically I know nothing may come of Guy 2, but I also don't want to bypass this opportunity I was given, but I also don't know if this pursuit would be at the expense of Guy 1.

6,mrseub,1618534872,Date has had to cancel on me three times now...,"For reference, I'm 21, she's 19, we live about 30 mins from each other. 

Been texting this girl from Bumble for a few weeks now. She's great, we have great conversations, flirt, and facetime a bunch too. For the past three weeks I've been trying to take her out but as the title says, she's cancelled on me not once, not twice, but thrice... 


The first time was because her grandmother's funeral was earlier that day and they ended up staying longer and she was exhausted... okay yeah definitely okay I was dumb to try it that day anyways. Then the second time she forgot that she had a sorority event that night that she had to attend. No big deal, those things are hard to get out of. Then tonight we were supposed to go out and she texted me saying her job called her in to work tonight. She said she tried her best to get out of it but for context she works at a shitty understaffed diner so she had to go in. However she got off about an hour after our date was supposed to happen and is now out with friends... which kind of rubs me the wrong way. Like I was gonna be driving 30 mins to get to where we were gonna go out at and plus it's not like she knew she was going to get off early, so I don't blame her for going out but still.


We rescheduled for Sunday afternoon and she suggested some things we could do since it's going to be nice. I'm excited, but like if she cancels again I don't know what I'm gonna do. Like I really like her and as far as I can tell she likes me, I guess I'm wondering if she's avoiding me or is are we just getting really unlucky with our timing? And if she does cancel again do I say something and how do I approach it? (sorry for the long post)

TL;DR - girl cancelled on me 3 times for all seemingly good reasons, best way to approach it if this keeps happening",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrseub/date_has_had_to_cancel_on_me_three_times_now/

12,mrt813,1618537745,Help. I’m so tired of being used by men because I have a bad radar at picking up on whether a guy is a pos or not. Went on one date with someone I met online and can’t read him. Is he playing games? Is he even genuinely interested in me or am I wasting my time?,"I went on a first date with someone a few days ago. I found him attractive, smart, etc. and he seemed genuinely interested in me too. We had some drinks, and he wanted to prolong the date so went to another bar after that, and then went on a nice 30 minute walk from the bar to his place in dc. Signs he was interested in me included: he brushed his hand on my arm, was playful by trying on my jacket and seeing how tiny and tight it was on him, he took his arm out for me to hold onto, and held my hand. He also got a FaceTime call from his bro and he pointed the camera at me as we walked and told his bro he was out. Towards the end of the date we FaceTimed his friend too. When we talked about how gross guys can be and how they pretty much sleep with anyone he said “I like girls who have a pulse but they have to be hot.” And since he was out with me I guess he thought I was? He compliment my lips, my ass, and called me sexy.

Here is where the red flags come in. I was drunk at some point and asked him about his past and asked him to show me a pic of his last girl. Dumb thing to do, but he showed me and she was cute but I am cuter so I laughed and said “I’m cuter” and flipped my hair. He then said that before we met I reminded him of someone who he dated and when he showed me what she looked like she was hot... but then he said “but when we met in person you don’t look like her at all.” I was like oh okay so you’re calling me a catfish? And he laughed awkwardly and shook his head. He was like “I mean you look similar to your pictures. And I was talking about the facial expression.” He also told me his last girl (the one he showed me a pic of and I said I’m cuter than), that it ended bc she thought he was using her for sex. I mean they did have sex on their first date so that’s expected I guess? And he ended it with her two weeks ago and he said they weren’t exclusive so it’s not a big deal that he’s out meeting people again. I did give him a bj on the first date and he called me sexy etc. and when the night ended he told me to hit him up when I’m back in town since I’m traveling rn for a week or so. I hit him up with a video of my cut arms bc we peed in the bushes and it scraped me up and we have been talking back and forth on snap since.... I just feel confused. He’s never been in a relationship, I feel like he implied I’m a catfish, and he also said today that I’m the only girl who asked about his past on a first date. He said “that’s the first” it came off negative. I made it clear that I only asked him questions bc I don’t want to get played. Another red flag is when we were hanging out at the end/ getting intimate he asked me if I get emotionally attached easily. 

Please tell me what is up with this guy. Should I give him a chance or no?

In my mind this makes the possible gains outweigh the risk since I won’t be stuck in an awkward workplace if it all crashes and burns. Lol

I’ve been trying to talk to him, kind of hoping that something might just naturally blossom. (So cheesy) He seems a little introverted so it’s hard to tell if he sees me as a romantic interest at all. But I do know he’s single. So there’s that. 

There’s a nagging part of me that’s wanting to make a more aggressive move. I just feel like I don’t know how to because I’m so awkward. I’m also a little insecure because I’m a single mom and I know guys can be intimidated by that.

34,mrv8t0,1618545091,Kind over dating at this point,"So my friends have encouraged me to go on more dates with bumble/hinge matches. I match with people but I just don’t have the energy to respond most of the time.

Well 3 weeks ago I started hanging out with this guy I found to be exactly my type. I liked him a lot. I kept my guard up but he love bombed the fuck outta me and I fell for it and ended up sleeping with him. He was pretty much a dick to me at that point and just disappeared then would reappear to ask to fuck. It felt pretty sociopathic how much he love bombed me and the shit he said to me. 

Anyways, I had to stop talking to him to show myself some respect. But I really liked him and felt crushed. Told my friends I was gonna delete the apps. I really don’t sleep around or date multiple people at once anyways.

They encouraged me to stay on the apps and I made date plans with a guy who had been messaging me on Instagram for while. I wasn’t initially interested but he was so nice to me in all of these messages and I thought, “I find him attractive and he seems genuine, so why not?”

He messaged me saying he wished I was with him. Weird since we’ve never met. Said he wanted to snuggle with me and that I would ‘enjoy it’. I said “we still talking about snuggling orrrrr 👀” and he says “probably more at this point. I’m trying to be a gentleman but I’d do some nasty stuff to you”. 

I enjoy sex, I really do. I don’t like my current fwb anyways. But this coming after what just happened kinda makes me feel like everyone just wants to fuck me. And maybe it could be fun but at this point I feel like I need to have some dignity and not hang out with this guy. I feel like had we hung out and he said this I would feel differently.

35,mrvjp7,1618546274,Communication in relationships (Personal),"Okay, so let me start off with a question, and then I will get into the meat of the situation.

Q: How important is communication to you in your relationships? Which aspects of communication are higher than others, or do you view all aspects of communication in relationships as completely equal?

&amp;#x200B;

So my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 7 months. Communication is something that is very important to me as a whole in every aspect of my relationship with anyone but even more so in a romantic relationship.

Up until now, things have been pretty moderate communication-wise because as long as we are able to see each other in person periodically throughout the weeks and months, we are fine and our lack of texting and/or calling hasn't been a cataclysmic problem in our relationship (though that does not mean we have not gone through a couple of rough periods due to communication issues). 

Recently, we had to go through a bit of a change, therefore forcing us to abstain from seeing each other in person for days, if not weeks on end. This has placed, for me, an even greater focus on being able to communicate via text/call. She works very often, and we are both in college, so she is busy often and not always able to text. I understand that, but I believe what has sent me through a loop is the sporadic nature of her texting and how she barely responds to messages, and if she does, it is not for hours and hours on end (i.e. ""good morning"" text at 9/10:00 AM does not get a response until 9/10/11:00 PM). I had a conversation with her today about this and we ended up getting in somewhat of an argument. I asked if she could let me know when she'll be busy or unable to respond, just so I don't have to worry about where she is or why she's not responding, but she feels as though that's not something that she can do and that it isn't necessary. She doesn't like technology and isn't on her phone much, and I know that, but still feel so passionately about this issue. She finds it okay to go an entire day without talking at all really, but I am the complete opposite...

I just don't know what to do because I really like this girl but communication is one of the most important aspects of any relationship I have, in concurrence with religion and respect.

I know that one of the basics of communication is that feelings are feelings and they exist to be recognized and addressed, and so to tell someone their feelings aren't valid defeats the point of feelings in and of themselves, but I TRULY must ask.....

Am I just going absolutely insane???? This dilemma has sent me into a mental hole in our relationship and I don't know how to get out and the mental tunnel I am in right now is not me very many viable options...

How do I go about this? Or am I just being completely immature?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrvjp7/communication_in_relationships_personal/

38,mrvu6t,1618547483,"Me (M22) and (F24) both like eachother, but she isn't down/ready to commit","long story short i told her i was into her and then she said she wasn't looking for anything serious, originally i wasn't super into her so i posed the idea of FWB or something similar, and we kind of sat on that for a while.

we got really close over the last couple of months and she also caught feelings for me but she is 4 months out of a 4 year relationship, and she is also in another state for college. We would facetime nearly every night for hours and hours, I can tell she really cares about me, she's done some things that no one else has for me, like this person cares about me deeply. I really value this person, but she has told me she isn't ready for anything, along with not thinking it would work, not wanting to hurt me, and trying to focus on her future. She is also seeing other people and has some stuff going on with her ex apparently.

I personally have a really hard time with this dynamic as I have fallen for this person very hard and I really enjoy the time we have together, but I can't help but want more from her than she is capable/ willing of giving. I also get a lot of anxiety and stress over like not knowing where we stand or what will happen in the future and I am kind of terrified of wasting time and getting more invested and hurt in the long run. We share similar friends and she is kind of a flirt so it sometimes hurts seeing her interact with other people due to jealousy on my side. I am just kind of lost because this person is one of the most caring people I have ever met but it also really hurts me to be in the position I am in now, and it would hurt even if we cut off FWB or whatever we have going on. 

Things were rocky and we decided to do no contact for 1 month to see how we feel, and we are about half way through it, and I will say I definitely miss her but at the same time my life has been a bit more peaceful and stable, which has been nice.

Any advice here, am I better off cutting ties even though this person cares just because I want exclusivity and to be on the same page?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrvu6t/me_m22_and_f24_both_like_eachother_but_she_isnt/

45,mrwfjc,1618550069,"She stood me up, I guess :(","I’m 25M. I thought I matched with the most incredible woman yesterday on hinge. We spoke all day long on chat and into the night. We planned to FaceTime tonight. She was so wonderful. She and I flirted a bit, and she kept sending me blush, wink and heart emojis. This morning she messaged asking if we could text instead. We talked some but I had a busy day. She moved the time back for our date, which was fine. I couldn’t talk much as I had just gotten my vaccine. I felt dead most of the day from the fatigue and tried to work. All day I was looking forward to meeting her. Tonight when I tried to FaceTime, she didn’t answer. I sent her a text asking if she wanted to still FaceTime. It never sent back the read receipts which were on. I guess she got caught up in something or changed her mind.

I’m so bummed. I was looking forward to this so much. Things have been so dull and depressing during the pandemic. I have matched with a few dozen women over the last few months, but it’s been horrible. Don’t let anyone tell you that more matches makes the difference, it’s not true. More matches just means that there’s more people to hurt you. So much random ghosting, matches who never reply, women who reply like a week later with a lame excuse b/c you’re their backup (“sorry, I was at lunch”), phoniness, materialism, friend-zoning and complete disregard that there is another human being affected by you. 

I’ve never been stood up before, and it just really feels like crap. I have felt more crappy using this app. I thought I finally met someone different, but I don’t think different really exists. This app was a monumental waste of time, money and a false hope.

My advice to other reddit users on it: if you stay, treat others how you want to be treated. That dreamy girl, that great guy... yeah be what you desire in someone else.

But within those little moments theres a lot going on. The way she smiles at me and the way I smile at her. It’s like there’s both an unspoken understanding and desire of one another. And it’s our little secret. I haven’t had a real conversation with this girl in months, and sometimes I feel like these brief moments of interaction are enough. Because in these brief moments it’s easy to keep control of myself, and project the image I intend. 


If she were to get to know me more, then maybe like a lot of other girls, she would learn to not take me seriously. I have ADHD, and I forget a lot of “common sense” stuff. “Oh what time do you get off of work today?” “I don’t know” “oh what did you eat for breakfast this morning?” “Hmmm, I’m not sure”. When I say things like this, I feel like girls begin to not take me seriously and see me as an incompetent. And incompetent is a big turn off. 

Also, I have social anxiety. In these little moments I can overpower it. Because all I have to do is fake confidence for a few seconds. But if we actually conversed, then she’d soon see that sometimes my eyes are not solely full of desire, but panic and fear too. Like I want to run, even when I look at her. I don’t want her to see that part of me.

I met this really beautiful girl on bumble, and it seems like we hit it off well! So we decided to have a date yesterday. First, I ran to the flower shop and I got a bouquet of hot pink roses for her cause I wanted to leave a good first impression for her. After that I drove to her apartment and picked her up cause she said she was fine with it. We talked and introduced ourselves first then we drove to the restaurant. She was really talkative and I actually like that from somebody. I don't like the atmosphere being too quiet. So we continue to chat it up. After we get done eating, we go back to her apartment and she invites me to come over. She shows me around the apartment and then we go to the room. We then continue to talk about more things. After the environment dies down, I lean in for a kiss, we continue to kiss and thats about it. It starts getting late into night like 9pm and she asks me to leave cause she had an assignment to finish. Once I left, and started driving, there was something bothering me in the back of my mind, I noticed that she never asked me any questions (like how are you, your job, hobbies, etc) and I was the one throwing out topics. She never asked me personal questions or anything of that sort. I genuinely hoped to have wrote this in the ""Gushing"" category but I felt like that red flag arised and I just wanted to question the whole situation on why she never asked me anything personal or any questions. I am wondering if I did anything wrong... cause I thought I did well on this first date. And then she blocked me today... Now I am totally lost in my thoughts about the whole situation.

50,mrwq9w,1618551390,Is feeling a “spark” all about physical attraction?,"
I went on a date with a guy on Wednesday, and I drove 100 miles to see him. He mentioned wanting to “chill in bed” all day (which was probably a red flag for a first date) but I didn’t think much of it. Ended up grabbing lunch then hanging out at his house. We watched GOT and cuddled. We had two short kisses, and he later said he didn’t want to get rejected a third time. Basically, it seemed like he really wanted sex and kept touching my thighs all over, complimented my ass and legs, and asked if I preferred “giving or receiving.” It’s hard for me to be sexual or even make out with someone that I just met, so that’s why I really wasn’t into going that far. Another red flag is that he asked me to stay longer to hang with him and his kids. I was even in the car with him when he picked them up. I decided against staying because I didn’t want to drive home in the dark. 

I messaged him today and asked if he still wanted to drive to me on Saturday, but he said he didn’t feel a spark and could see us more as friends, though he wasn’t against hanging out. To be honest, I didn’t really feel a spark either but I wasn’t completely opposed to a second date. I also told him it seemed like he only wanted sex, which he was pretty defensive about. He said he would’ve been fine just making out and chilling but is a really sexual person. He wanted me to stay to see how it would “play out.” I  said I felt I would’ve been intruding on his time with his kids if I’d stayed, which he said he respected. He mentioned that he pretty much says what’s on his mind, but those were overtly sexual comments that he made and it made me uncomfortable. To me, he was judging that “spark” all based on sexual chemistry.

Is spark about more than physical attraction to you? This guy was definitely attracted to me, but he also said he didn’t feel one. I’m not too sad about not having another date, and I’m not looking for just a “friend” let alone a long distance one. So what would have been the point? I last said that I didn’t expect him to want to drive to me if he only wanted to hang as “friends” and understood if he felt nothing and he left me on opened. I think having that chemistry is important, but it’s not really something that can be judged on just a single date?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrwq9w/is_feeling_a_spark_all_about_physical_attraction/

61,mrxycz,1618557151,20F coworker acting questionably when I show some interest in someone else,"Hi.
I will try to make this as short and concise as possible because it is quite long.

I (22M) became good friends with one of my coworkers (20F). When we first met it seemed her first priority was to inform me that she was taken (a lot of people have told me I look like I get a lot of women and that I look like a cheater - absolutely hate hearing this). I didn’t make anything of it and wouldn’t push conversation with her. As we began getting closer to each other over months, she got very comfortable around me - even touching me physically. 

We’d start eating lunch (just us two) during lunch breaks, 15 minute breaks, we’d even leave our stations to talk to one another asking how’s work going (mostly friendly talk but I could feel something else and when I did I’d leave). She’d find ways to text me all the time (I hardly texted her first at the beginning) and she’d ask me for a lot of homework help - I gave her an assignment I had done before and she then kept asking week and week again again. I’d always tell her I’d go check just to tell her I didn’t due to my past of letting others walk over me.

After a few months of knowing each other, she begins bringing up her boyfriend so much during convo it was starting to become noticeable. I was unbothered by it due to lack of interest but would continue to talk about other things to which she’d find ways to bring it back up. I began talking about my dating experience which is very unfortunate lol. When I told her the many times I’ve been rejected she found this so intriguing like I was joking - telling me how could that be true you’re not bad looking, in shape etc. Even after this she continued to find ways to be around me constantly, CONSTANTLY. Even waiting for me outside.. 

After about 6 months of being friends, she told me how excited she is that she’s getting engaged this summer, I congratulated her and was happy for her. Now, i mentioned to her I found a coworker gorgeous and wanted tips on how I could approach and she became FURIOUS. Her whole attitude changed this day, I’ve never seen her like this. She became less communicative, would walk behind me than beside me and aggressively glared at me when I told her to put the files on the other bucket. 

THEN

When we were leaving the parking lot, she tried running me over when exiting! I saw her in my rear mirror accelerating so fast then halting on her breaks being nearly less than an inch away from my trunk. After reflecting, I started realizing what the situation was looking like. I texted her the following week asking if she’d like to get something to eat but she had to take care of her mom who just came out of surgery apparently - even tho when I asked what she was doing she said not sure but had a reason after I asked if she wanted to eat. After telling her all good she texts me back saying ""what will we be eating though?"" I told her I didn’t have much in mind but downtown has some nice places tho, she said ""lol we’re going to dt lol"" I said anyways just let me know and she said okay then nothing. 

I texted her after a week saying this ""Hey XXX. This is hard for me to say to you.. I truly value our friendship and you’re such an amazing friend. I’m going through a lot and it would be best for me that we stopped talking to each other."" To which she says ""Lol like we ever talked 24/7 the most we talk is on Saturdays... but as you wish"" with a follow up ""I wish you get out of your problem soon"". All bs aside, I’m actually kinda sad that she responded this way kinda makes me feel she never cared even as friends. I feel like my vision is cloudy and I’m not thinking right. Am I wrong for communicating this way with her ? She kept giving me mixed signals and I felt pushing away might benefit somehow. 

Sorry for making this long, thank you for reading.

64,mryhus,1618559830,Unsure of his intentions with me,"A guy that I work with recently moved to a new position at the office in the city. After he moved he asked me if I wanted to go for drinks. We got drinks and had a really fun time and at first, I thought it was a friendly gesture but afterwards I had more of an impression it was a date (he made resos to two places and insisted on paying for both). During this evening we talked about our past relationships and I mentioned how I wanted to really grow and focus on myself now. He also mentioned how he left his girlfriend because he felt she was ready to settle down (marriage) and he was not and wanted to experience more in life (she was older than him).  Fast forward we have gone out a few more times together for drinks/dinner etc and he ended up kissing me one night which later on led us to have sex. 

I am confused because in a way he started treating me like a girlfriend. We would text all day, he would bring me a coffee on his day off to my work or my house which is a bit of a drive for him. One time I spent the night and he was super affectionate with cuddling, forehead kisses and made me coffee in the morning and we went for breakfast and did some shopping. During the shopping, he would hold my hand walking around etc. 

This past week he took the week off work and it seemed he was with someone else. I know he has a few female friends but he posted a picture of him making dinner and you could see a woman's purse in the background. As well as a few days later he went to a local getaway spot with a girl and posted a picture with her tagged on his story. I know that he has known her for a while but I don't know if he is seeing her. After seeing this I backed off a bit and he still reaches out and we talk every day but it is a but less. 

 I have had two girls i work with mention that they think he likes me due to how he is when he is around me but that is also subjective. am just unsure if he actually likes me or if he is just out to have fun and keep things casual. I'm not necessarily looking to date anyone but I have developed a bit of a crush on him and I don't know if I should pull back a bit. Also referring to his reasoning for leaving his ex makes me feel he wants to be single and have fun.

69,mrz5xj,1618563170,Would you use an IRL dating app?,"Mods - please delete this post if it’s against the rules. 

I work for an Agency and the founder is planning to launch an IRL Social App this summer. Her motivation for hiring and funding the team to develop this app is because, as a single woman, she is tired of the persistent back and forth texting on dating apps that eventually fizzle away after weeks of texting or investing all that time only to be disappointed at the first date.

She believes from talking to her friends and people in her network that people would prefer to meet around 1:1 social activities as this keeps things more interesting and straight to the point without the heavy romantic overtone that comes from dating apps. 

The way the all would work is that users can create activities they are looking to do with others or browse activities created by others and send requests to join. These will be 1:1 activities not group activities like meetup. 

I am part of the development team for this app, and I’m tasked with doing more ‘market research’ hence the reason I’m posting on here. 

1. Is this an app that would interest you? Why or why not?
2. Would safety concerns around meeting a stranger for 1:1 social activities prevent you from using the app? If yes, what can the app have or do to make you more comfortable?

I appreciate your responses.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrz5xj/would_you_use_an_irl_dating_app/
70,mrz9hd,1618563636,Do you ever feel like you could've done something different during the date to make it better but now it's too late?,"This keeps happening to me (20sM). 

I go on these dates, the conversation is good and we have a good time. I drive them home and that's it. Then I get home, I'm lying in bed, and I can't help but think about stuff like ""I should've put my arm around her at that moment"" ""I should've hugged her when se said she was cold"" ""I should've gotten out of the car and hug her goodbye when I dropped her off"". And I get so fucking frustrated because I didn't do those things and now it is too late. I can't go back and change it. I can't just tell her ""hey I forgot/wasn't brave enough to go for a kiss, let's go on another date so I can chicken out again and loathe myself after"".

Why can't I freaking read when it is the right time to establish physical connection? Is it because I am not confident enough? Wasn't it really the right time to do it? Am I the only one to blame here? I have to tell myself that if she is on a date with me, she is already attracted to me so she is probably receptive to physical touch. But that thought just doesn't pop in my head during the date and I do nothing. Fuck my fucking life man, I'm so frustrated with myself. I hate feeling like I am missing out on something great because of my own fault. ""If I had done this differently, things could be so different"" but I guess I'll never know because I didn't do it differently.

72,mrzafm,1618563765,Man the lack of effort by this girl is almost Insulting,"So I got out of a relationship a few months ago because my ex decided the best birthday present I could receive would be her fucking a coworker. 

ANYWAY... I start getting back into dating after a few months. And luckily for me, the fact that I am 100lbs lighter then I used to be and have grown facial hair has lead to me not really had issues finding women, even Had a girl who I had a low-key crush on actually give me her number at work when she learned I was single, she actually sought me out and was like ""so I hear you're single, and I was wondering if you wanted to talk outside of work, like social media or phone? "" So I'm actually in a good place. My last relationship was abusive but with the help of therapy I came out of it stronger then when I entered. 


But a girl I met in a dating app (before the cute girl at work gave me her number mind you)  just sent me the most lazy replies. I just got irritated.

Me: ""man you weren't kidding you really do make some delicious looking good!"" (She sent me her ig with her baked goods

Me: ""So outside baking what are you in to? Have any books youre reading or shows you're watching?""

*30 mins later* 

Her : ""Yes."" 

Me: ""oh, ok. Cool"" (at this point I assumed this was a show of lack of interest , I was basically packing my bags and moving on)

Her(30 minutes later) : ""You're really handsome"" 


Like.... What? Like if this was a girl who had a bio that said ""looking for a fun night lol"" then I would understand. 

But this girl's bio reads 

""Looking for a soulmate to marry"" 

Like wtf. Am I off the mark? This is a really lazy response is it not? It's basically playing on the idea that the man in the situation should melt at a compliment. And if it isn't it seems like she is uninterested in actually putting effort in to know me back. Or reciprocate anything. 

I also wanna clarify , the one yes wasent her only one word answers. She is basically solely answering in 1-3 words. Nothing indicating she reciprocates interest at all. Nothing forwarding the convo. It's always just literal answers. Just ""yes, no"". 


Then again, I guarantee women deal with these low effort players all the time, and worse (I mean even I've been stalked by a women twice before, but if a women would stalk my ugly overly hyper ass I know damn well the average women has 5 at any point in time)  It's still just kinda irritating. I also feel guilty for being irritated. Cause maybe shes just awkward(no it that I said anything to her about it I just feel guilt over the emotion) . But like, there is literally nothing I can do with this convo, my two choice are to accept the akward out of place compliment I don't believe. Or to try to switch it back on her and compliment her. But it leaves no where to go from there. It feels like I took a turn into a dead end. And when I turned around there was another dead end.

If you don't the frustration, dissapointment and anger  dating brings will just make you even number and more defeated and even if you find someone nice or great for you immediately, your hesitation, and past experiences will either completely break your new relationship or put serious strain on the beginning of the new one possibly leading to later issues.

82,ms0bps,1618568742,is she interested?,"so i (28M) reconnected with a high school friend (28F) 2 years ago, we were both single then - started talking because of some instagram story and met up for dinner and drinks and had a nice time but it was just clear that it was just a catch up session. she was going through a tough time then, with family issues (family member turned very ill) but she opened up quite easily to tell me everything about it. 

she wasn’t very responsive with her texts but the conversation carried on - clear that she wasn’t rly into it. me being blind to the signs that she wasn’t interested, kinda confessed and asked her a couple of days later if she was interested in seeing if this can turn into smth else. needless to say, she turned me down, saying that she wasn’t in the right place/state of mind. 

we both went along with our lives and we both got attached with other people. 

i got together with a girl, and it didn’t work out, and broke up. 

fast forward 2 years later (no contact), she suddenly dropped me a text message asking how i was and we started talking again. 

turns out she also broke up, and we started talking. she was a lot more...responsive. conversation flowed and were longer (unlike the short-and-clearly-not-very-interested kind of replies). so we decided to meet for dinner. 

dinner went great. had a couple of drinks and chatted about all that had happened over the past 2 years, including the exes in between, about life in general and plans for the future. she said she got tgt with her ex too quickly the other time and she wanted to make sure the next one was the right one before jumping into anything, etc etc. time was up and i dropped her home and drove back thereafter. 

dropped her a msg and she replied but she replied it as a ‘catch up’ but was open to going out again the next week. i’m not sure what she thinks of me? like am i a friend? a potential date? help? i’m stuck and don’t really know how to approach this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ms0bps/is_she_interested/

Why make an OLD profile then? Why make all these promises to me? “When you find a new place I can help you move.” “You can have this dresser I don’t use.” “My friend said this summer we can stay at his cabin.” “I’ll be sure to buy the motorcycle with the long seat and I’ll get an extra helmet for you.” “Our dogs should meet and hang out.” Like what the fuck dude?

95,ms2nna,1618578109,I can’t stop comparing everyone to this one guy,"Back in November (election night to be specific). I went on a date with this guy. By date I mean, he came over, we drank, hung out on my balcony, he brought his guitar and sang to me, he danced with me in my kitchen, we opened up about our childhoods and relationships with our family, then we had sex the rest of the night. 

Me and this guy had so much in common it’s ridiculous. It was by far the strongest I’ve ever felt for someone right off the bat. Like a storybook romance. But the next day he sent me a message saying he was really having a hard time because of his mom’s passing. Then I get a message asking if I’m off work but when I respond the message doesn’t go through. Turns out I’m blocked.

I ended up getting back in touch with him the next week and he apologizes and says he’ll be more up front but that he isn’t in the head space to have a relationship right now and we decided to just be friends. (Bad idea to begin with but I went along because I genuinely liked him as a person)

A few weeks later everything blows up. I honestly don’t remember what even started it but there was a long string of text messages at 4am (he was drunk and I had found out he wasn’t being totally honest with me) ending with him saying he was going to move to South Korea to teach English, thanking me for helping him decide what he wanted to do, made a big show of deleting his dating apps and the next morning I was blocked again.

I hated the way it ended and feel like I handled everything the wrong way but I’m still kinda angry about the way he handled things as well. He gassed me up, told me he wanted to pursue a relationship, etc. and the feelings I had totally scared me. In hindsight, I should have backed off and gave him more space than what I did but oh well. Hindsight is 20/20. I’m in a much better headspace now and feel like if we had met now instead of then things would be much different.

I know I’ll likely never see this guy again. But I still can’t get him out of my head months later. I think about him a lot and wonder if he’s okay but he has no social media and I’m blocked so I can’t get in touch. I’ve been on multiple dates. Talked to plenty of guys. A few hookups here and there but nobody even remotely compares to the connection we had and I feel like I’ll never find it again. Doesn’t help that I got zero closure. 

How do I stop myself from comparing everyone to this guy? I didn’t even know him for that long nor were we in a relationship so it’s ridiculous that I’m still even thinking about him but it’s hard to shake a connection like that I guess. What can I do to mitigate this?

96,ms2oc0,1618578173,Need help with how to proceed with this girl.,"I meet this girl at a temporary job that i have, which is away from home (i stay in a hotel 3-4 days). She was part of my team(im a supervisor) people get different shifts, so shes not in my group anymore. We started talking when a friend of mine invited her to smoke with us. Anyway, i can clearly see she likes me, and she clearly sees that i like her. But there are 2 people who are really close to her a gay guy who makes me feel unconfortable sometimes and a 32 year old woman who is married and also a bisexual woman( me and this woman got along very well) . My problem is that i dont know how to procced further. we smoke together every night. 2 nights ago i invited her to watch a movie together with me and she accepted but since i am allways an unlucky guy... she forgot her bag with important stuff like documents and cards, phone and so on at work, so we asked a collegue to bring the bag, when i called him to get the bag he told me he forgot it in the bus and that the bus is coming back in 10 minutes, we walked in to the hotel reception and her bag was on the floor. The guy left it or forgot it there and she got really upset so no more movies night... i asked again yesterday, she gave me a maybe, but the 32 year old woman intervened and i just got upset and left. From time to time there are flirty touches and sometimes because we work on a covid testing site she tells me like (keep your distance)😂 anyway... When i flirt with her sometimes she says ""I will tell my wife"" because of these actions i didnt move forward with things, like kissing her and so on. Last night we were going to smoke and we were flirting up until she said the wife thing and i told her this would be the last time i would bother her, to which she replied ""ok,i see, so this is how you would proceed?""
I dont know if i should continue to chase her. i know shes bisexual but i dont think there is something between her and the older woman.
So, what should i do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ms2oc0/need_help_with_how_to_proceed_with_this_girl/
97,ms2ybi,1618579087,Is being asked out for a drink a date?,So I bumped into my old childhood boyfriend and he messaged me asking if I’d like to go for a drink. I said sure it would be nice to catch up. Now I get the feeling  he likes me (he jokingly asked to be my Valentine this year and I said no sorry I don’t go back to ex’s). I don’t have any romantic feelings towards him but equally he didn’t say the word ‘date’ so maybe he just wants to meet as friends? How can I politely say I don’t want it to be a date but would love to see him as a friend?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ms2ybi/is_being_asked_out_for_a_drink_a_date/
98,ms3lpk,1618581143,Safety concerns with OLD,"How do you gauge whether the person you are talking to on OLD is legit and not a psycho? I have met a few people from apps and have even invited them to my house or gone to theirs on the third/fourth date. I always thought I was a good judge of character and wouldn't do this with someone who seemed sus but at the same time, knowing someone over 3 dates is practically not knowing them at all.

I go through the process of googling them and looking up their social media. There are, however, so many people on apps that are rapists/ stalkers/ psychos/ creeps, etc (that can be BOTH MEN AND WOMEN) and that information cannot be obtained by a simple google search. How do you navigate around that while ensuring your safety?

What are the things that your date does that indicate to you that they are safe to hang out with one on one? 

(I am not usually this paranoid but one of my friends got into my head and now I am replaying all of my previous dates and beating myself up for being careless. )",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ms3lpk/safety_concerns_with_old/
