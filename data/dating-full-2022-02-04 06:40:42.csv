I am a 52M w/spinal cord injury and I am in a wheelchair. I am still able to walk very short distance but not without the help of a walker or cane. Everything else still works üòâüòâ. I do have a few other health issues but nothing serious.
   I am out going, compete in many adaptive sports, love to travel, I believe that communication and trust are two of the most important things in a relationship. I am not some Hot buff guy but if I had to say, just an average man when it comes to looks and body. 
   I am a Southern Gentleman and was taught how a Lady should be treated. I am not a country bumkin but also not a city dweller. I can and have lived in both and able to adapt well in just about every situation except for when people are just being STUPID or OBNOXIOUS. 
   The issue I am having is that I am not having any luck with dating. I have chatted with and talked with several women but, it seems as though as soon as they learn that I am in a wheelchair, I get ghosted. I have done the online dating thing and even a few blind dates but it all ends the same way. Some of the women have even told me that they just will not date someone that is disabled, (Even when I tell them that I actually do more now that I'm in the chair then when I wasn't. I will try anything once and have found that there is not much I can't do with all the adaptive equipment that is out there these days.) It is not what they have said or how (I enjoy a women that is upfront and honest) it's just that I don't want to end up being old, grey and alone. 
   I think I have a great personality and fairly intellectual (so I have been told.) I am not looking for someone to take care of me, I am very self sufficient. I just want someone to accept me for who I am and not ONLY look at the fact that I am in a wheelchair.

My boyfriend (M28) comes over quite frequently and always insists on keeping his jeans on while we cuddle because he‚Äôs too ‚Äúcold‚Äù or ‚Äútoo lazy‚Äù to take them off. Even with blankets on. When I ask, he doesn‚Äôt want me to take them off for him. Any guys out there like their stiff heavy jeans THAT much too?? I didn‚Äôt press him for a better explanation but it might because he‚Äôs afraid he‚Äôll get too excited and something will happen without pants on. That happened once and he felt bad about it, even though I told him I didn‚Äôt mind and it wasn‚Äôt a big deal to me. About a month later I borrowed a pair of his sweatpants and wore them home. Now they‚Äôre at my place and on the last two occasions he‚Äôs changed into them for cuddle time. Problem solved.

First post in this forum, thanks for reading!
I invited a girl who I meet when I was in cinematography school 5 years ago and we always occasionally flirt on Instagram.
The date yesterday was good, we both shared similar thoughts and we laugh a lot without quitting our gaze from the other one, hands there, hands here, she kissed me in the bar and we hurry up to get to the apartment.
We f*cked really good, she came once, I had an amazing night but didn't come cause alcohol inhibits me.

HOWEVER, after making out, she starts calmingly dressing, I asked her if she wants to sleep with me and she says she doesn't want to. I dress up to go with her (dangerous city). We kissed passionately again before leaving.

It confuses me that she didn't want to stay the night with me. I was too ""intense"" asking her to stay? She just wanted some action?

I‚Äôve either found myself with partners who have strong narcissistic traits (everyone but my mum in my family has narc &amp; abusive traits) or partners who initially present well but three months in there‚Äôs a moment where I‚Äôve realised they simply don‚Äôt want a future with me. They‚Äôve wanted to act like they‚Äôre in a relationship but when there‚Äôs been a discussion about a relationship they‚Äôve said things that have made me realise I‚Äôve been used/manipulated, for example: I could never be with someone your age (I‚Äôm 29), I just went through a break up and I just want to be alone (he actively pursued dating me), I thought we were just friends (gaslighting), or I find out they have a girlfriend.

I don‚Äôt want to make everything about looks (I think I‚Äôm quite a well rounded person; I‚Äôm educated and have a corporate career, passions, good friends, I‚Äôve been told I treat people well and have a high level of social/emotional intelligence) but since I became more attractive and started modelling a few years ago my dating life has been a nightmare. I‚Äôve had narcissistic men pursue me and pretend to want a relationship simply to post me on their Instagram or show to their friends. And something that contributes to my mistrust in dating is that I‚Äôve never had a guy not reciprocate my interest, men will often pursue me indefinitely until I given in, but it‚Äôs typically three months in that their agendas surface and I realise everything they did to earn my trust and affection was a lie.

I know I‚Äôm not a perfect person and don‚Äôt resonate with a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù mindset but I‚Äôve read all sorts of books about boundaries, trust, dating, relationships but am still stuck in this cycle and wanted to know if anyone has some practical tips on how to avoid the sorts of time wasters/manipulators I‚Äôve described.

TLDR is basically what the title says; I‚Äôm in a relationship that I consider to be abusive/manipulative but can‚Äôt seem to find the courage to leave.

Me (26M) and GF (24F) have been dating for just over 6 months in a relationship that I now consider to be abusive and manipulative. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs but since December 2021 I feel like we‚Äôve had more downs than ups, with her being needy, jealous, selfish, untrusting, abusive, and manipulative of my feelings, with me even having reasons to suspect she has hacked/installed spyware on my phone at some point in the past month.

She does stuff like going through my phone without my consent, to the point I had to change my password and remove her access from it (I have nothing to hide tbh, but she access my phone looking for petty stuff to fight about and I drives me crazy). Has once caused a scene at my job (I‚Äôm a musician) because I was interacting with a group of girls in the crowd, which is pretty common in my line of work but I try to never be disrespectful or vulgar. Has acted very selfishly in the last couple couple trips I took her (for which she paid nothing), acting like she was doing me a favor being there and that I should do everything she wanted to, even costing me a pretty big traffic ticket because she refused to wear a helmet on the motorcycle I rented - she did not offer to pay for the ticket. She‚Äôs also forced me to have sex with her after a party when I was felling sick and refusing, which resulted in me throwing up because she wouldn‚Äôt let me just lie down and rest. She says she‚Äôs supportive of me and my job but always acts like supporting me and going to see me perform (which I don‚Äôt force her to do, she goes on her own free will) is a favor and throws that in my face every time we fight or argue. When confronted, she blames her behavior/compares our relationship with the relationship she has with her father, as well as blaming a less wealthy upbringing/lifestyle.

Finally, after our last trip, where we had some pretty big fights, I was feeling pretty worn out and talked with a friend via text about some of these problems. The next day she had a completely opposite behavior than what she had up until then, with all the issues I complained being gone, which, alongside other weird stuff that‚Äôs been happening, has led me to believe she has somehow hacked into my phone. More importantly, I feel the way she has been acting the past couple of weeks is because she knows I‚Äôm on my breaking point and she is just putting on an act because I provide way too much for her to just let this relationship go, but once she is out of the woods she‚Äôll turn back to her older self. Am I correct to assume/be afraid of this? Especially since we haven‚Äôt had any meaningful conversations about her behavior for her to see this as something that bothers me and she need to change?

I really want to get out of this, but can‚Äôt find the strenght to do so, for some reason. Is this normal?

I am an incredibly awkward person and even if a woman talks with me I never know if there is genuine interest. Even though i know i am better off alone, it doesnt mean I dont have that urge for companionship and love with someone that isnt a pet. (Ie: dont want a dog or cat) 

I honestly dont know what to do, even after almost a decade of therapy I still can't talk to women without having a full panic/ anxiety attack.

This guy and I have/had been talking for a bit. Does this guy seem interested especially at the end? I think I got ghosted but I‚Äôm not sure or maybe I ghosted him?

This is some of our conversations

‚ÄúYou snowboard? I snowboard as much as I can.. technically I‚Äôm not supposed to do that lol.‚Äù

Him 

‚ÄúYes I love snowboarding.  Last trip was to Aspen and holy smokes that place is so amazing.  Why aren‚Äôt you supposed to snowboard?‚Äù

Me

‚ÄúHave you been to Breckenridge? I tore my meniscus lol. I‚Äôm pretty active and I was told to ‚Äúchill all activities/workouts‚Äù so my knee can heal. I‚Äôm clearly not listening..‚Äù

Him
‚ÄúYea Breckinridge once and that was a pretty great trip as well.  I think I might have a meniscus issue too but I just push through it, semi-carefully.  I mean rest is good but the body needs movement too (that‚Äôs how I justify it to myself lol). The app says you‚Äôre in NY, how long till you‚Äôre back in SC?  And are you having fun up there?‚Äù

Me 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm back in 2 weeks. My family is here. It‚Äôs cold..so no lol. Yea it has! Snowboarded w/the nephews, saw friends and hit my favorite restaurant..can‚Äôt complain lol‚Äù

Him
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in Florida for a week with friends.  It‚Äôs been an amazing trip but heading back home in a couple days.  West Palm is pretty sweet though I love it here.  Anyways definitely let me know when you get back in town we should try to get together ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚Äù

Me 

‚ÄúWest Palm Beach? I‚Äôm sure that was a nice trip. My sister lives in Jacksonville Beach and I always love visiting Fl. I definitely will! I get back the 14th. I‚Äôm interested in getting together when I get back home. I‚Äôm ready for this trip to end.. I miss Charleston and the sun lol‚Äù

Him
‚ÄúThe 14th got itüòÑ. Yea I always get antsy to come back home after about a week so I get it.  Try to enjoy it though, charleston isn‚Äôt going anywhere‚Äù

Me 
‚ÄúOh for sure! I‚Äôve had a blast. I just managed to get hurt on this tripüòÇ. And you definitely go to amazing places lol. I could wait to ask but tell me more about your Djing skills.. lol‚Äù

That was the end of it. Should I reach out? Did I get ghosted? Was he ever interested?

We sat and chat here and there just trying to know her and all. During this she didn't ask many questions just couple follow ups from what I asked her. Dinner was fab. I enjoyed what she ordered and she liked the dish  ordered. She paid for it saying I paid for the activity ( we went to bowling).

Here is the main part. Next week is her birthday I asked her out and expected she will be with family and all. So she said a week after that which is valentines week.

We are meeting on a day after valentines. When I asked we can even go on Valentine's. She said she's going on a movie night with a friend! 

Dafuck now here I am thinking she is going out with some guy and I am not even in the picture at all. 

You know what on 15th I am going to ask her if she likes me or connects with me. This would for me actually determine shes actually into me or no. I think it's a bad idea because I can loose her.

Maybe I wouldn't have these thoughts if I were with her, though, so please feel free to point out if this is a long distance problem
There are some things I'd like to clear up at the beginning: I love my girlfriend, and she loves me, and I know that it's love. Saying this in advance because I think there will be some people who are going to imply or state that I don't. Or maybe you're not. My impression of comments on posts about relationships comes from r/amitheasshole, and most of them are genuine basket cases.
Basic information: I'm 22 (M), and my girlfriend is 25 (F). She used to be my senior in college, but graduated in 2020, while I'm still studying. We've been seeing each other for three months; we are in a long distance relationship, and have met only once since we began dating. Prior to that, we were friends for a year, and while we did stop talking at intervals (my fault; anger after arguments), I knew that I liked her, which is why I always apologised afterwards. That's in the past. Ever since we got together, I've worked on my temper, and been as patient as I can; I rarely say anything harsh. All that is in the past; I know that I love her, and she loves me. We even talk about the future, and marriage. I'm sorry if this comes as a shock; but we started dating after a year of me trying to...court her, I suppose you could call it. It was sudden and abrupt, and we became very serious in just a couple of weeks. I thought I'd loved her before, but that was nothing compared to how I've loved her since.

The problem: I've been having intrusive thoughts about other women. I don't know when it began, and how it grew, but it's gotten worse over time. What happens is that I occasionally have thoughts of other women, such as their image popping up in scenarios, and how I'd react. To be clear, I want to mention that these thoughts are mostly non-sexual; I don't feel any desire for them. I am NOT attracted to any of these women. At first, it was minor, and I pushed these thoughts away because I knew that they were nonsensical. I still do, but now they've gotten more frequent (although not more intense), and I don't know if I'm ACTUALLY, DELIBERATELY thinking about them, or if these thoughts are just randomly popping up because I'm fixated on them. I don't know if that makes sense, so I'll be clearer: I don't deliberately fantasise about these women. I don't WANT them. Hell, I don't even talk to them that much; ever since I realised that I was having these thoughts, I've tried to restrict myself from having any interactions with other women. In fact, since my relationship first began, I've mostly spent time with my girlfriend on text, rather than with other people.

I didn't tell my girlfriend about these thoughts at first, although I hinted at them, and told her that I'd confess something when I next saw her. That's another thing I should point out: seeing her helps. It helps a lot. When I see her, I know that I love her. All those thoughts go away...or at least, they used to. Lately, after it got too much to deal with, she pressed me, and I told her about these thoughts. She's been very supportive, and I love her for that; but today, she had a bad professional interview, and just now, when she asked me how my day went, I told her that the thoughts had gotten worse. It arrived at a point where she started crying, and it broke my heart. I hate seeing her crying. I'm tearing up as I write this. I'm sorry. I don't want to come across as some pathetic sentimental loser who wants to show off how good a guy he is, but it's true. I hate seeing my girlfriend cry. She even asked if I wanted to take a break. It upset me that she thought I needed it. I'm willing to suffer because of these thoughts, but I don't want to cause her pain.

However, more about the problem: sometimes the face of another woman pops up when I think of her; it happens randomly, and I can't tell when it might. I should also tell you that it's not a single woman; my mind shuffles around, although today I've only been thinking of one. It's gotten to the extent that I sometimes think that I'm trying so hard not to thing about them that I end up inevitably thinking about them. My mind is constantly in a whirr, and for the last few days, I've been trying to slap myself out of thinking all this. 

But what made me come here and write such a long and detailed post was today. Today has been a very, very bad day; whenever I try to think about my girlfriend in a healthy way, another image pops up. I'm honestly dreading thinking of her out of fear that I'll think of another, and it's driving me crazy.

My girlfriend wants to know if these thoughts are voluntary or involuntary, because I've told her that I don't know. And I really don't. I'm an idiot, and I doubt my own doubts because I think that maybe my subconscious is conjuring up these images. Damn it, I don't know. I don't know why this is happening. I love my girlfriend, and want this relationship to bloom; I don't WANT anyone else. I know it sounds ironic, but it's true. I don't WANT any of these women, because I love her. I don't want to cheat, or go out with other women, or play around, or any of that; I KNOW that I'm not attracted to anyone else. Then why are these thoughts popping up? Am I paranoid? Am I just an idiot? Am I deliberately making myself think these things to test whether I love her? Because earlier I used to think that that was a possibility, but right now I'm at my wit's end.

Can you help me? I need to know if these thoughts are voluntary or involuntary, and if I can stop them. I want to know how to continue this relationship, because I love ky girlfriend; this thing needs to stop. I'm going crazy. Please help me.

I need advice. And I know that some of you will tell me to get a therapist, but I don't think I can afford one right now. Anything else can help. Please help me.

I love my girlfriend, even if the distance frustrates me at times, and want to continue with it. Please help me. Please believe that I love her, and, instead of saying that I don't, help me. I don't WANT these thoughts.

TL;DR: My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for three months, and recently I've been having intrusive thoughts about other women that have grown in frequency. I have confided in her, and though she's been supportive, bad professional circumstances as well as my thoughts have upset her, unsurprisingly, and therefore upset me. I need to know if my intrusive thoughts are voluntary or involuntary, how to stop them, and how to continue with this relationship.

I just am very sad about this and need to vent/get advice I can't talk to my friends so much because they all feel used by men and say I'm ""lucky"" that men don't want me for my body. I feel horrible for even thinking this is an issue, but I have gone so long without physical intimacy both in and outside of relationships that I just feel so unwanted. I easily make very emotional connections, make people feel safe, comfortable, understood etc and I'm so happy to be able to do this. In relationships, men very quickly have said they fall for me, never felt this way before, etc but no one seems to like my body so much. I don't want to be just liked for my body, it's just that no one has ever touched me so much or made me feel wanted physically besides compliments like being told I'm pretty, like a doll, etc

Men who have dated me have sex with me, but it is more about them if that makes sense like bj/piv? (which is great I love to make my partner feel good but I wonder what it would be like to have a man interested in me too). I don't think my body is the issue. I like my size and don't want to change it. I don't wear anything like padded bras so it's not like men don't know what I look like. I'm a very thin woman in her early 20s, well educated with a degree, workout on a daily basis, eat well, wonderful friends, hobbies, have a great career and have launched my own business. I take good care of my appearance since it is part of my work as I have a career in fashion. So I don't look unkempt or unhealthy in any way + have good energy so I'm not thin and tired

I've never had a man touch my breasts or even want to take off my shirt. It feels like a stupid thing to be upset about, but it hurts my feelings to feel undesirable and great in every other way so they date me. Like I have even asked one of my exes to take off my shirt (he never expressed any interest) and he told me he likes me for what is inside. Another said he needed to confess that compared to other women in bed I'm not much to look at, but I'm very talented and creative that is worth more than looks. I agree what is inside is much more important and I feel very happy to be cherished this way, but I just feel physically it's just lacking? It makes me feel bad because other women just exist and men want to look at them. I literally have to ask and be met with disinterest about how it doesn't cross their mind to look at me naked or made fun of for having ""mosquito bites.""

I like how I look and think my body is nice which I think matters the most, but if I'm with someone I would like them to at least find me appealing and want to look at me naked? I'm not insecure about my body in general, just when it comes to intimacy and sex due to these events I do admit I worry a bit now. I feel very comfortable in my skin otherwise, I know I have a lot to offer and share. I'm so happy to uplift other people, share my life and happy moments/success with my partner, but am I expecting too much when it comes to this?

Sorry for the weird questions but this has been bugging me.

The only GF I ever had liked the idea of not having to worry about birth control but I feel like I have no chance with other because of that.

Or maybe it's because of my country's culture. Having kids isn't supreme but not wanting kids is looked down on.

Maybe I'm just overthinking but still, I seek this subs' opinions.
