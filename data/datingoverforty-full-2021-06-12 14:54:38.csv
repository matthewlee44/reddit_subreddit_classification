But this time I am really struggling.

I always thought I would get married (I didn’t). I always thought I would have kids (I didn’t).

I was deeply ready and pushing hard at 43 to get out there. And then COVID happened and everything was on pause.

My only family is my mom. I don’t have siblings, aunts uncles or cousins. I am asked for two emergency contacts on forms I only have my mom. 

My friends moved away a long time ago. I tried meetups and things in 2019 but I am such an odd person. I don’t really fit in anywhere.

This spring I was ready to move anywhere in the US. Maybe I would have better luck elsewhere. But prices of everything jumped well beyond what I can handle. I thought moving to where my mom’s friends moved to would at least be nice for her.

There is an old woman in my building that uses a walker, she must be late 80s or older. Every day she goes for a walk (so do I) and she is always with her mean assistant. The mean assistant lives with her and has a mean dog that lunges at and growls everyone, she is always on the phone and speaks a language I can’t quite make out. I have tried saying hello but she will usually glare at me or just fully ignore me. She puts out such an unpleasant vibe. But she is always there with the old lady.

After a few years of me smiling and nodding and sometimes waving (as I do for everyone in my building) the old lady finally says hello to me and we will do 10 seconds of small talk once in a while.

And I think,I won’ even get to a point where I can afford mean assistant.

This isn’t what I had hoped or dreamed for myself at all. I swear though, I tried my best. 

I lurk on here pretty much daily, even if I don’t say as much as I used to.

I’m just sad. I missed it. I missed life. I miss people. I had friends in college, I had friends when I worked in the city. But now my life is small and closed and it has been shrinking to this for a long time. I have nothing to look forward to but to hope I make good choices over the next 30 years (and don’t have too many more crises) or so that I can hire someone to live wit me.

Like many of you, I have forgotten how to be a sociable person, I think maybe it was all in my head.

My partner and I have been living together for a couple of years in my house that I owned before I met him. He pays me rent (which we agreed he would do until my mortgage is paid off) and we split the food and bills and any other shared expenses down the middle. The rest of our money is technically our own. 

So here's the thing... we have totally different approaches to what constitutes financial responsibility and general ""adulting"". He is always in debt, always buying what I consider frivolous things like gadgets and games and stuff that just clutters up the place and serves no purpose. I am pretty careful with money but I don't think I'm mean and I have a nice life and go out with friends usually once a week for dinner or drinks and if i need new clothes I buy them, go the hairdresser and have my nails done etc, I have regular weekends away and went overseas every year before covid.

My partner has done what he called ""borrowing"" money from me in the past.... what actually happened was he took money out of our joint funds without asking/telling me in order to buy himself an expensive luxury and said ""I was just borrowing it I was going to put it back eventually."" We almost split up over that and we no longer have a joint account because of this. He is still paying me back my portion of what he took. Sometimes he asks me to have a ""repayment break"" as he has some other expense, now if this was say dental work or his car needed major repairs or something else essential I would totally give him a deferment but it never is, it's ""I want to buy a 3-D printer"" or something like that. 

We argue about this so often it's wearing me down and affecting what is otherwise a good and happy relationship. We both have good professional jobs and earn about the same, well above average, so it's not a poverty thing. I feel like he isn't committed to our relationship or our future because he just refuses to save and pisses money up the wall (sorry to be crude, but that's what it feels like!) and doesn't seem to think about financial security for our future. I suppose he thinks I'll deal with it, the same way we live in my house because he was 50yo and renting when we met, and I was 38 and a mortgaged owner. Every time we do something like a holiday or any big expense he's taking out loans for it, or putting it on the credit card, whilst I've got the money for it because I prioritise saving a bit every pay period and if that means I can't go out for dinner and drinks one weekend, well I don't go that weekend.

Anyway sorry that turned into a bit of a rant! But these are very entrenched behaviours (for both of us I guess) which I don't see changing any time soon and we can't be the only couple in this situation.

I guess I've been out of the dating scene for so long (21 years!) so I don't know how it's going to go for me once the whole divorce thing happens. I don't even know if I WANT to date - not because I'm heartbroken or jaded.

If I were comfortable dating younger men then I’d have no problem. And while I don’t have any ethical issue with it, I just don’t think it’s practical. 
I’d like to meet a genuinely nice human being who believes Black Lives Matter, who is an LGBTQ ally, who is actively anti-racist and pro equity. And it’s not like there aren’t men my age who hold these beliefs, but the ones I know aren’t single and the single men I’m meeting are “all lives matter” types, anti LGBTQ, or some other BS I don’t have time for. My ex was mildly homophobic when I met him in my 20s and I was patient with him and he’s now one of the most vocal ally’s I know, but I’m not interested in being anyone else’s guide to being a decent human being. If they haven’t got it by now they never will. 
Should I keep looking for an age appropriate social justice warrior to date? Go younger (yikes)? Resign myself to being single, which I don’t mind but I’d like a partner to grow old and share life with?

I am feeling a lot better now and about a month ago I reactivated my Tinder (for a bit of distraction, and yes I know it’s not a very nice thing to do) 
I matched with a man about two weeks ago (me F45, he M47) and we chatted and it was nice, nothing too personal but good. I then suggested we move to another platform for convenience. After that things got hot and we spoke on the phone for about two hours and after that we got into sending very sexy  messages. 
I’m not really that used to it but found out that I really enjoy it so it was a lot of fun and we are still doing it btw. 
We have talked about meeting up next week when he doesn’t have his daughter (and that meet would be very much related to him going down on me according to multiple similar messages). 
I don’t really know what it is I’m actually asking but in my previous relationships this hasn’t been a thing. In my previous one we were very compatible and open in the bedroom but nothing was like this was ever exchanged over text. 
What this whole exchange has made me realise it that my previous relationship wasn’t really that good and the communication between us basically sucked and that I am kind of over it and him. 

So I guess I’m just asking if I should go with this thing and see what happens? 
We would most likely meet for a walk or drinks or something like that first but what if there is no actual physical connection after all of this with the build up and the fact that I can’t think of anything else besides the hot messages? 
Also I am obviously aware that this is probably a rebound thing but still.

To make it short and sweet:

Met a guy online.  Met for $3 espressos, (he paid at register).  He expressed that he *really really* was into me in chatting later.

He invited me to dinner, picked me up, dressed up.  He chose the restaurant, he chose cocktails and wine after.   He order appetizer while I was in the restroom.  He knew the owner of the place and we got a complementary round of drinks after.  

The check came, he puts he card down and I get mine and hold it out to him ( because I don’t even know what to do at this point any more, I get filled with so much dread at the check moment.  This NEVER happens with my female friends where one of us will just swiftly grab the check.).   He says: if you want to.   So I just drop my card also.

So I hate to admit it but at this point my attraction just dies.  When one person invites and plays the host (directs the ordering at dinner) I was raised that they pay.  I take guys out too.  Splitting check also reeks of platonic/not even good friends.  Usually in my dating and close friendships picking up check are alternated.

During the paying moment I actually get all scrambled and reevaluate the entire situation because deep down I feel if he was really into me he would have payed.

It isn’t that my offer is insincere, it’s not a test, but it just kills it for me.   

He is also foreign so I don’t know if that affects anything.

Anyway, we went for a walk after and he was talking about all the places he wanted to “take me”.    Now he has asked to “take me” to dinner again.  (Among many more expressions of how much he likes me).   

But what does “take me” even mean?  I feel once you go Dutch, from there on out it’s always Dutch (except for a birthday or something).

I like him, I just don’t know how it would go from here.  A relationship of never paying for one another seems cold.   I’m not going to stop offering to pay.  I don’t want to “accept” a date where he is “taking me” out when that isn’t the case.  I even flubbed at the end of the date and thanked him “for the ride.”

I also don’t want to keep going to elaborate expensive dinners as it’s not in my budget.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,50674,public,self,“Inviting” me too dinner again after splitting check?,0,[],0.64,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nz3cvc/inviting_me_too_dinner_again_after_splitting_check/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's ok, it was early and I was having doubts too.  But what struck me was how he approached it.

I'm a parent too so of course I understand kids come first, but I also know that having my own life makes me a better mom.  Thinking back, I realize most of the time someone's broken off communication after a few dates, I get some variation of ""it's not you, it's me,"" even when it's pretty easy to see a different dealbreaker.  A few that came to mind: 

* ""My uncle is in the hospital, I need to focus on being there for my family right now"" (What I think ... I wouldn't have sex on the first date)
* ""I need to focus on my health and get my ED figured out"" (Later, admitted he just didn't think we had much in common) 
* ""I'm just not ready for something serious"" (I suspect it had more to do with, shall we say, significant political differences)
* ""I'm taking a job in Japan"" (when really I had called him out on lying about who he was, further confirmed when he showed up on Bumble again weeks later ""looking for a long term relationship"")

I have a 13 year old son, on the spectrum. He is like a little adult, very smart, set in his ways, loving, prone to outbursts, very overweight (no sense of being full, and physical challenges like extreme clumsiness). 

I have no need to blend families in the future, but I’m not totally closed off to it. His father is emotionally distant, but has him 20-50% of the time. 

I am protective of him, for one thing I know how to keep him level with his behaviours. I also know if he gets attached to someone and we break up, he will take it personally and fear he’s why.

One of the big things that bothered me in my last relationship, was my bf’s desire to treat him and his 8 year old with the same expectations around things like being outdoorsy…. Chopping wood and the like. While I grew up that way and have no problem with exploring some of it, it’s not my son’s experience and I suggested a gentle approach. One of my major annoyances was the continual suggestion that we take the kids to the beach, which my son hates, as the texture of sand really bothers him, and my bf was told. 

The response was essentially that I coddle him to much, and I need to force him to do things for his own good. I see that a bit but I like to push things that are more attainable, like preparing food for himself, etc. Not things that I know will result in him being uncomfortable.

My bf did work with adults on the spectrum, so he’s not completely clueless. But he doesn’t like children dictating his life, which is what he felt this was like.

He was also concerned about the kids having “2 sets of rules” and felt that it would lead to his son not listening to him.

My thought was to periodically have the kids together for fun stuff, and we each parent our own kid. I also thought that at 8, his son could understand different abilities and that it wouldn’t be the problem he expected.

Beyond that, my son is university level smart… and not physical. While his son is physical, but struggles intellectually (for example he’s not really reading yet). 

In thinking about dating in the future, I’m basically thinking… I don’t want anyone near my son. Because I just don’t want to deal. In 5 years he’ll be 18 and likely in university and so anyone I date can see him from time to time but no one would try to be his father.

Or certainly for the first time since their 20s.

The issue is, I find myself wondering if these women are actually interested in me, or if I’m just the first guy that’s been nice to them since their divorce, and they really haven’t been on dates with many guys so they don’t have much of a basis of comparison. I mean I’m talking single digits in terms of number of different dates, not relationships, for some of these women.

This is not a self-confidence thing for me. I know I have a ton to offer and I get positive feedback. It’s more of a concern (and maybe this is lingering from my divorce), that they will at some point begin to wonder what they missed out on by not dating around. And conversely that they would appreciate me more if they saw what else was out there. Like I know that I’m not the perfect guy for every woman, but women who are into me are really into me. And I want someone who is really into me.

Perspectives? Am I overthinking this? If a woman who was married for 27 years, who has only had one brief fling since her divorce, is really into me, is this something I just go with?

Edit: haha, as some have pointed out, if you choose to read what I wrote narrowly, it sounds like I’m asking for one individual to speak for all women. When I asked for perspectives, what I mean is, if you either are someone similar to this or have dated people in these positions, I would be interested to hear your story or point of view on this topic. I recognize that everyone is different and there are no generalities for an entire gender. Thanks all who are giving me feedback in this vein!

My father was and still is very emotionally distant - the John Wayne/Clint Eastwood type who never shows their feelings and will never say ""I love you"" even though he probably does. My late husband was loving and kind but also a bit shy and reserved. When he passed and I was ready to date again, I spent a year dating men who all seemed to be only interested in emotionally-distant hookups and casual sex, which was fun for a while but the lack of consistency and reliability became aggravating - last-minute cancellations or no-shows were a real bummer. I had a few casual relationships with guys who I truly liked and they seemed to like me also, but always kept me at arms length and would never commit to just one woman, so again, I kept looking.

About 10 months met a guy on OLD who really clicked with me on a personal level. We have so much in common it's incredible. Great sex and great friendship. After a few months we had the DTR talk and decided to be all-in as a couple. We are even talking about moving in together. He is very communicative. I get morning and evening texts from him, daily phone calls, and when we are together he is constantly adoring me, telling me how beautiful and perfect I am, and it makes me profoundly uncomfortable! I have an average body of a 50 year old woman who doesn't work out and is slightly overweight, and yet he tells me how sexy and perfect I am. I worry that he's love-bombing me, or that he's blind or this is all too good to be true. He has never done anything dishonest or hurtful to me, and yet I feel like all this love and affection could some day turn out to be a trap. He has so many good qualities, and yet I'm very used to having my alone time and I worry what it would be like if we actually lived together. I also worry that after feeling so broken after becoming widowed that my heart may never fully open up again to fully love this man as much as he loves me. 

I just feel like this is all too good to be true or that I don't deserve such a wonderful lover.

Though I am not a 40+, my boyfriend is. I (31F), with a (43M). He was very into me in the beginning, he said it himself that he was obsessed with me at one point. 

He is the oldest man I've ever dated, he's smart, got his sh*t together and he intellectually stimulates me - the most important part. 

Sex was so good and passionate in the beginning. He even asked his friend how to initiate sex with me because he is scared that his sex drive might be too high for me. Five months forward, sex has declined a lot. Even more so that now, as of 3 weeks ago, that we are long distance.

My sex drive is ridiculously high, more than he realizes. For three weeks now, he had not asked for a  picture of me, or initiated phone/video sex. I understand that he is busy with family and work, but this makes me feel unwanted. I send pictures of myself without him asking, and he responds to them, but that's about it.

I pointed it out to him why he said to me that he was 3-4 times a day kinda  guy in the beginning, to now being 'oh I'm not a 3-4 times a day kinda guy anymore. I'm getting older. Don't make me feel bad for not losing my sex drive etc."". I only pointed that out because that was only 5 months ago.

Without tooting my own horn, I'd like to think I am physically attractive, I'm an athlete and my career is in the fitness industry.

Are we not sexually compatible anymore? Is it really just his age? Am I doing something wrong? Are we not going to be sexual, even virtually? How do I get him in the mood for phone sex?

I can't wait to hear what advice and wisdom you have to share.

So my (45/M) 2 most recent situationships have left me a little confused on how much I should reveal about myself personally and emotionally, especially early in the dating process, without scaring anyone away.  

I've dated 2 women over the last 6 months. One told me that I went too deep (emotionally) too fast once I felt comfortable with her and the other who was/is a friend before we started dating for a brief period of time, said I didn't give her the emotional depth she needed from a potential partner by keeping her at arm's length. 

I've been fighting this feeling of being disconnected for most of my life (even during my marriage) and nothing I seem to do gets rid of this feeling and it's only gotten worse over time. To the point where I don't feel like I can't connect with anyone romantically (or even on a friendship level). I don't have a great relationship with my birth family and I just feel so disconnected most of the time. 

Connecting with others has been difficult and I tend to keep people at arm's length, never fully letting anyone in; Except for my therapist, who I only let peek behind the curtain recently. I have a hard time building deep and meaningful relationships and because of the nomadic life, I lived for many years while in the military, I lack a sense of belonging and community. 

I've tried really hard to break out of this shell I've surrounded myself with by going to meetup groups, planning social activities, joining fitness groups, volunteering, church, putting my kid in sports and I still don't feel like I can relate to anyone. 

I've stayed in bad relationships because I just want someone in my life, but also don't really let them in because if I shared the years of abuse and neglect I've suffered, it causes them to pull back or becomes some weird form of trauma bonding that I don't want in my relationships.

I’ve been conditioned to have my guard up, always ready for the next thing. I've taught myself how to be hard, how to be strong, how to protect my heart before anything bad can happen.

I’m early in on the process of falling in love with someone I am over the moon about (keep the faith out there everyone wonderful outcomes are possible). 
My feelings for this person are as intense as it gets- I feel balanced and seen, the communication is solid, and I feel like my best self is possible with her. If I still feel this way a year from now I am most definitely proposing.
My question is this:
 I need help thinking of a grand romantic gesture to woo my lady- something bigger than a declaration but not as big as popping the question 
She likes nature and music and dogs and adventure we are on the west coast in the US
(context-she knows how I feel and she feels the same way/ she is typically the person who steers the direction of the relationship and I am determined to make her feel special and recognized as this is something that has sometimes been missing in past romances).

Is this all OLD has to offer? People looking to get laid? C'mon, I can go down the street and get laid. 

Where is the substance? I believe in this or that and am looking for my match. These are my world views, is there anyone out there who thinks the same way?

Although we've discussed future plans we've never actually talked about getting married. It's been implied but never stated outright that's the intention or even a desire. So, I asked him, ""you know I want to marry you someday"" He said he knew and if he didn't feel the same he wouldn't keep stringing me along because it wouldn't be fair. I told him I'd let him know when I'm ready for him to propose. He said, okay. 

It was a little scary being that vulnerable and I realize the conversation could've taken a turn. But, I'm glad it's out there and neither one of us are wondering.

Then on the third date we planned to go to sit in a pub garden and have a couple of beers in the sun, but when I got there she had been drinking all day already and was very obviously drunk was slurring words stumbling when walking.

Now I’m not against drinking and getting drunk every once in a while but just found it odd someone would turn up to a date in that state already.

 we made it to the bar , i had a couple of beers to catch up and managed a little conversation,  she admitted she had struggled with alcohol and had issues around it in the past.but she continued drinking too, and by the time I walked her home she just collapsed on her bed , I made sure she was ok then left.

But now I feel a little awkward about contacting her , should I bring it up?

He has a good job, a house, two grown boys, is a former professional football player…he looks great on the surface. He’s a sweet guy, has feelings and empathy, and is very affectionate. However, there are lots of things coming up that I do not like. First, he is a Republican. No offense to republicans, but he is FAR right, lots of guns, conspiracy theorist, voted for Trump and likes him, etc. I am a Democrat and am fairly liberal in my beliefs. This has been fine until he starts to drink. Then he will go off on a tangent about liberals, taxes, gas prices…you name it. I have asked him repeatedly to not talk politics with me, but he continues to. He also will spout off the N word. I HATE this word. I will never speak it (he and I are both white). I have told him this many times. He still uses it. There’s more. The last four Fridays I have come over to his house for dinner, he is already drunk. Last week I showed up and he was passed out in his bed and said he was just taking a “nap” before I came over. He did get up and we went to dinner, but continued to drink until he passed out ON me in bed later that night. Lastly, and maybe this will sound horrible, but he has a really small penis. I thought I could make sex decent using other techniques, but it’s not satisfying at all. I’m in my prime sexually, and I would love some regular, really good, mind-blowing sex with a dick I can feel.

I could think of there being conflicts in financial security, work/life balance, and personal bias, and could think of a few career paths that would make me consider getting involved in someone from that career. 

For instance, I briefly dated a guy with a legal background who was slowly sinking himself into the local political scene. He was a strong advocate for greener initiatives. I think we went on 3 dates, 2 involved cycling, and one was swing dancing. 

The first was a great, get-to-know you, casual and low key late afternoon date, and he really did open up about himself and his background. The other two, eh - didn't really learn so much about him except how he liked to present himself in group situations. 

And it really took those other 2 dates of just kind of watching him interact with others to make me realize he was constantly doing little more than selling himself, in preparation. He had this deep, hardship story about growing up, but then once he got that out, there wasn't much substance underneath.

 A couple of years ago, I received an email campaign ad for the city candidates, and saw he was running in a local election. I almost spit out my coffee reading, word for word, all of those personal details he was sharing with me about himself in his short campaign blurb about himself. I mean, word for word, like he's been practicing these lines his entire life. Man, talk about a line!
