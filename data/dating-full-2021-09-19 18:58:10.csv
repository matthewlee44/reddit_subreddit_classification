This will be long, please bear with me.

I am a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug this summer after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and introversion/slow to open up.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, you just dont meet many people your age after school it seems.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

Slow to open up. I have a hard time being flirty with girls before I am friends with them. I dont want to use the term demisexual (as I am not that), but I can relate to those people and that idea of needing to be close to someone before moving a relaitonship beyond a friendship. I also dont want to use the term friendzone, but it honestly feels that way most of the time. We become friends and then after some time, I think about asking her out as I start to develop feelings, but she only sees me as a friend. I have lost quite a few friends this way and frankly I dont want to lose any more and I feel broken because of it.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"". I have been also told that I am too genuine for my own good.

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

Getting out more - over the last month I have gone out to the local ""downtown scene"" with friends on a somewhat regular basis. Trying new restraunts, shops, etc. and generally getting out more. Though, I just feel too young for that croud (surrounded by young families mostly), and too old for the college scene that exists.

Meetup - none exist in my area for things I am interested in, so I made one. A short hike to the top of a popular hill for the sunset and astronomy viewing. No one showed up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

I've never dated anyone, never kissed anyone,... and I sometimes worry I'll never find a girlfriend. But that's another topic. I don't really care if it takes time for me to get a girlfriend if I just get a girlfriend eventually (That sounds quite weird the way I formulated it but I couldn't think of another way. Sorry for that). As long as it's a loving relationship where both give and take and all that, I'm fine with waiting. I also believe that I'm currently not in the place for a relationship anyway. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past 1.5 years and I'm only recovering slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

So in the general society there are some stereotypes when it comes to (heterosexual) dating/relationships such as that the male partner should be the one who takes initiative or that the male person is the one who asks the girl out on the first date etc... 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't want to seem as if I'm unable to learn to take more initiative myself but I think my potential in this area is somewhat limited. I am naturally quite shy and therefore am quite anxious with initiating conversations. I also don't really know how to initiate them tbh. And I have no idea how to flirt. So I'm quite unsure how I'm supposed to get closer with someone emotionally. Once I am in a conversation I think I can hold it most of the times.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I am this shy and anxious (I also get overwhelmed by new things and loud sounds and all that quite quickly) I'd find it great to have a very proactive and supportive partner. I also have difficulties organizing things. I definitely don't want to seem as if I'm unwilling to give anything back in the relationship but I do struggle more with everyday things than a non-autistic person. So in a way this contradicts the stereotype of the male person being the more initiative part in a relationship. This leads to a few questions:

1) How present are these stereotypes still in todays society? (Are they even true?)

2) How could I get more courage with approaching people?

3) Do I have to be the one who invites the other person out?

4) Are there girls/women that could be into me?

5) Is it strange for me to want these things? (what I wrote in the 4th paragraph)

6) Are the things in the 4th paragraph even realistic?

7) How do relationships generally develop?

I'm also quite awkward but I try to embrace it rather than hide it. It's the most genuine version of myself and I want people to see me as the person I am.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1015820,public,self,Questions about shyness and taking initiative in relationships,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/preics/questions_about_shyness_and_taking_initiative_in/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

I had been on a couple of first dates that didn’t turn into anything before I started talking to this man who had just moved there from Ohio, let’s call him Byron (20’sM). It was only a handful of days that we were messaging when he asked me if I wanted to go watch the Browns game at a local bar with him, his friend, and his roommate. A public place with a group of friends seemed like a low pressure first meeting, so I accepted. He asked if I wanted to meet an hour before the game at a brewery right next door to the sports bar, so that we could get to know each other one-on-one, before meeting up with his friend and roommate.

I get to the brewery first but wasn’t waiting long when he got there. He looked like he did in his photos, a little shorter than I had expected, but height isn’t a dealbreaker for me. The conversation was the normal getting-to-know-you stuff but I knew fairly quick that it wasn’t a particularly great connection so I wasn’t thinking it would go anywhere. What sealed my decision on that was at some point he found something very funny and when he laughed it was SO LOUD and his face turned into something out of a cartoon. Huge, top and bottom teeth showing grin, eyes wide open about to pop out of his head type of laugh. I remember myself sitting back a little bit in surprise at the outburst of laughter and thinking “Well that’s a no.” I have a strong want to never feel embarrassed by the person I’m with. And his crazy, loud laugh made me want to turn to everyone at the brewery and announce that we weren’t together. 

After about an hour of us talking at the brewery he said his friend texted him from the sports bar and was saving a table for us to watch the game, let’s call her Brittany (20’sF). I wasn’t surprised by this because he did say we would be watching the game with his friend and roommate. When we got to the bar, Brittany and I instantly hit it off. She was so welcoming to me, giving me recommendations for good food and drink in town since I was still new to the area and we had the same sense of humor so we were cracking up in no time. Byron was mainly watching the game, which was fine since I’m not a huge sports fan and had Brittany to talk to. 

At some point, Byron goes to the bathroom and while Brittany and I were talking she asked me how I knew Byron. I told her we had only been talking for a few days on Bumble and this is the first time I’m meeting him. She giggled a little and said, “That’s funny, I have been talking to him on Tinder and this is the first we are meeting each other.” I WAS SHOCKED. He had invited two women out on a dual first date under the same guise of watching the game with his “friend and roommate” (Brittany confirmed he had told her the same thing). I felt disrespected for Brittany and myself for being asked here under false pretenses. It’s alright if you want to date other people but at least be honest about it. Did he think we were that dumb that we wouldn’t figure it out?! 

Before he got back from the bathroom, Brittany and I both agreed that we were having a great conversation, so we exchanged numbers to hangout again. When Byron got back to the table we didn’t say much to him. I started texting Brittany under the table to ask her if she wanted to leave and go grab a drink at this bar down the street where I had heard a cover band playing 90s hits. I was prepared to tell Byron that we figured out his dual first date and that we were leaving. Brittany and I had our tabs open at the bar so we both got up to close them out. While waiting to close out at the bar, Brittany turned to me and said, “Yeah, I might be into him if it wasn’t for that fucking laugh.” I started laughing and said, “That fucking laugh, right?!” 

We get back to the table after closing our tabs but Byron looked like he was waiting for us to get back and said that he needed to go downstairs (we were on the second floor of this bar) to grab his friend who had just arrived. I had assumed it was this roommate he had told us about so we waited because people were quickly taking any tables that opened up. He came back with his friend, let’s call him Billy (20’sM), and Brittany and I start talking with him. He was so nice! He worked as a nurse, loved ciders like I do (I’m allergic to hops, so can’t have beer. It sucks.) and he and Brittany were giving me cider brewery recommendations in town. He even got me a Washington Apple shot because he bought everyone else a round of beers and I had mentioned I grew up in WA. All of this was going on while Byron was just watching the game and not really talking too much. 

Brittany leaned over to me while the guys were distracted by the game and asked if we could actually stay because she was liking Billy. I told her, “No problem, I’ll be your wing woman and keep crazy over here entertained.” After that whispered check in, while I was talking with Billy he said something that had made my gaydar go off. Just wanting to give Brittany a heads up, I leaned over and mentioned that she may strike out with Billy. I said I could be wrong in my feeling though so we agreed just to leave it and see how the night went. 

A little bit after that Byron goes to the bathroom, again. Brittany then turned to Billy and asked the same question she did me, “So how do you know Byron?” Billy said that he and Byron had been talking on Tinder and this is the first time they were meeting each other!!! Brittany and I whip our heads towards each other with this knowing look of utter amazement that we were in an unbelievably, crazy triple first date situation! We just kept laughing hysterically because we didn’t know what else to do! Billy probably thought we were kind of crazy but hadn’t asked about the outburst of laughter. 

Right when Byron got back to the table, Billy left for the bathroom. Brittany then turned to Byron and said something to the effect of, “So, Billy told us how you guys met!” Byrons face dropped and instantly went white. He then stood up, started clapping and cheering at the game but I looked and nothing was really even happening on the field and no one else in the bar was cheering. I think he just wanted to not be in that awkward moment. Brittany then looked to me with a smile and said, “I’m ready to leave now.” We said our goodbyes to Billy who got back not long after Byrons cheering and Byron barely even looked us in the eye as we left. Looking back, I wish I had clued Billy into what Brittany and I knew and asked if he wanted to come grab a drink with us. He was such a down to earth guy and easy to get along with. I think I just wanted to get away from Byron as quickly as possible.

Brittany and I went to the bar with the 90s cover band and they were appropriately playing “Bye Bye Bye” by *NSYNC, which we sang very loudly together and had such a fun end to the night. It’s been almost 3 years since then and Brittany and I are best friends. We are both happily in committed relationships and I’m going to be in her wedding next summer! 

I’ve always wondered, what were Byrons reasons or motives for setting up a triple first date? Did he want to get the first date out of the way with the three people he was talking with and then decide who he wanted to see again? Or was he hoping for some foursome action if we all got along together? Maybe he was wanting to play the odds and hoped to go home with at least one of us that night. Whatever the motive, I’ll give it up to him that it takes some balls to try a setup like that!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1015850,public,self,I was asked out on a triple first date,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/preqe3/i_was_asked_out_on_a_triple_first_date/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

I (F22) hung out with a guy (M25) I met online about two weeks ago. Prior to us meeting we texted pretty much daily for two months. I'm not very experienced in the world of dating but decided to give it a try as I have made lots of improvements in regards to my mental health and am feeling more comfortable with myself overall. 
We had great conversations and found we had similar outlooks, values and even had similar experiences. We talked about how we felt like we were meant to meet. I expressed how I didn't want to get my hopes up and reassured me he liked me, my personality and the fact we were similar. Needless to say I thought this relationship would go somewhere whether it was romantic (more ideal) or even just platonic (perfectly fine as I enjoyed his personality/company). 
As nervous as I was to meet him, I was still very excited. I felt pretty comfortable with him even during our first meeting given we had been talking for two months already. Once we finally met up being together just felt right to me. After we hung out for a couple hours and had a great time, (texted me and said he had fun, enjoyed my company, I said the same) we texted a couple days after hanging out and he slowly drifted away in those two weeks.
After some days with radio silence, I reached out to talk about where he stood after meeting, hoping we were on the same page. I made it clear I was totally alright with being just friends if it was something he rather do. Communication is something that is very important to me which I had expressed multiple times. I was hoping with this in mind he would be able to tell me how he was feeling. Unfortunately I haven't heard from him and don't think I will. It definitely hurts to say the least but I'm trying to keep my head up.

Great chemistry, great sex, intimacy, open communication, we have shared values about life. I have feelings for her and she also does. We both have been through many experiences, relationships and a divorce and at a stage where we really know what we want from each other. We are really clicking. I am 42 years old and I feel like a teenager these days which is a nice feeling don’t get me wrong. 

I am noticing though that I am becoming a bit obsessed with the fear of loosing her. I know it may be irrational but can’t help it. She hasn’t done anything to make me feel the worry to loose her. I don’t want to rush things and move too serious into a committed relationship and I want to let things evolve naturally and go with the flow. Just take the time to know each other more and for me to see if it just a feeling of crush or something deeper. Is my worry of losing her normal? Am I overreacting? How can I cope with it?

Today we spent together the whole late afternoon/evening, we had a good time but: 

1) he never offered paying for me (actually once even directly asked for paying separately, other times didn’t even try to stop me from paying - we were at multiple places). Knowing his cultural background (which is slightly similar to mine) I know it’s a norm to pay for the girl. And we both know he’s in a considerably better financial position than me… but still I was thinking that maybe he was testing me so I convinced myself to be ok with that. 


2) When we were going home he left me in the middle of a random street (which was quite dark and empty) in the middle of the evening - my home was less than a mile away and he didn’t even mention walking me home or just something about my safety. The area is not so safe at night, I even mentioned it during our previous drink, so I was quite… disappointed.

Are these major red flags? What’s your opinion? 

We had a good chat so I’m quite sad about these 2 issues but I feel like they could be a source of major trouble?

If he was not interested why would he spend 5 hours with me?

Things have been ""off"" since mid June (he'll hardly ever compliment me anymore, just sporadically will send anything sexual, and most of his initiated conversation to me are snapchats he sends to all his main contacts)

The last weekend in July I drove entirely to him for the first time (170 miles, normally he picks me up halfway) since my birthday is 8/5 and he wasn't available that weekend. Long story short, my car was unsafe to drive home but he had a mental breakdown and threatened to call the police if I didn't leave Sunday night. He later apologized several times though we mutually agreed to have a break after that. Mid August he suggested this weekend (9/18) for getting back together, saying he was booked until then, but he ended up staying in town not doing anything each weekend. Our plans this weekend were moved to next since a female high school friend was supposed to sleepover at his house last night, which also didn't end up happening. 

When I asked him earlier today what our plans were for this next weekend, he offered to pick me up at our usual halfway meeting point Friday night and then drive me back Sunday afternoon, though also said he works Saturday morning and has an online D&amp;D campaign Sunday morning.

We see each othe about once a week or bi-weekly. We have meals or go on outings. Never really run shy of things to talk about. Things have been going rather well. 

So about 5 months in she invited me to her place again, and proceeds to take our relationship to a sexual level. Which is great, she’s hot and has an amazing body… I had been looking forward to it. 

So we’ve had sex a few times now, she expresses how into me she is. I’m actually pretty into her but I feel we lack sexual chemistry. She doesn’t turn me on as much as past lovers have. 

So now i’m in my head about it. I feel like that magic spice of chemistry is missing. I’ve always had pretty sexual lovers in the past and now I feel like i’m missing something here. 

Is it wrong of me to feel we are better suited to be friends than lovers because of the lack of chemistry?

For reference, I’m in college and I’m 19 M

I went on 3 dates last year with the same girl but it ended up not working out. I talked a bit then asked her out from a small group our professor organized that’s how it all started but it was all online and virtual. 

I then took the last year or so to work and improve myself physically and mentally, going to the gym, becoming more confident, dressing better, etc.

It’s a new year for college and I’d like to get back into the game but the thing is I’m just not sure how to see action. Yes I can ask out my lab partners or people in clubs or even maybe the acquaintances I make in my lecture classes but I feel as if those aren’t necessarily the right places to ask someone out and if rejection happens, it’ll be maybe awkward? I’ve tried to remember the phrase, “don’t shit where you eat.”

At this point do I just do straight up cold approaches on campus or perhaps a large sporting event like a football game for example?

This is where it got really scary...she immediately sent me pics...

You know that creepy feeling you get in the pit of your stomach like something isn't right? Well I had that feeling just before even opening these pics and I should have followed it. 

When I opened the pics it was what appeared to be a toddler naked!! I immediately broke out in a cold sweat sick to my stomach terrified at what I has seeing! The person on the other end then says ""Send me one now ;) &lt;3 &lt;3""...

I imminently told them ""I'm not interested at all this is disgusting!"" They replied with ""Then why did you look at my body and accept nude pics of me on your phone??""   

At this point I immediately blocked the phone number only to immediately get a text from another number! ""Excuse me sir are you the man talking to my little daughter?!"" I replied  explaining everything that had happened..they texted me back with..""So you accepted nudes of my underage daughter on your phone?..would you like to work this out or do I have to go to the authority's with this?"" 

At this point I'm more terrified than iv'e ever been in my entire life and as hard as this was to do I actually went ahead and contacted my local Police and told them EVERYTHING. The Officer at the other end of the line could tell I was terrified and I asked if this was gonna hurt me at all. He explained that these scams have been going on and that if I was telling him the truth I had absolutely nothing to worry about...He told me to turn my phone in so they could document what was happening and that I could go ahead and delete any private information but to leave everything from this incident on there.

I turned my phone over to the Police about an hour ago and even though I did nothing wrong I'm still sitting here covered in cold sweat in panics!...I just hope I don't get set up and the Police are trustworthy..I told them I was just so scared it could get turned on me somehow only cause they could see how nervous I was. 

One of the Police said ""You turned it in bud, you called us, if you were guilty you'd be the dumbest sex offender in history hahaha"" then his partner cut in with  ""Yea we see a lot of creeps, you don't strike me as a creep at all..you did the right thing giving us a call""

I've known him for 2 years since we are in college and last fall we got closer, socializing more and more through social media during distance mode.

This Summer in June, he asked me out for lunch. I couldn't attend but was quick to reschedule. We went out and played golf instead which was fun. I also got to meet his friend and they were nice.

A couple of weeks later we went out for drinks to play pool. Also had fun.

Some days later I went for a walk and messaged him if he wanted to go for a walk. He responded super fast and was like sure. And then we walked until I had to pee and he was like you can pee at my place I live nearby, so went to his place to pee lmao 

I had to travel out of town and he also traveled out of town but we stayed in touch the whole weekend. I was snapchatting him, and he answered kind of in the same vein. If I sent a selfie with some text, he sent a selfie with almost the same text. Was kind of funny. We have then been out for drinks and playing pool again. And through our Snapchat conversation, I've kinda hinted that he is a guy with good looks and that he is smart. I jokingly call him ""the hunk"" sometimes. Last month he sent me a couple of selfies asking me which ones to use for his social media and I said I'm really bad at choosing stuff like that and that he should maybe ask another female friend to get a better judgement and he was like ""nope asking you, you're the only one I feel comfortable asking""

He also works part time at a bar nearby where I live, and once I asked him what he was up to late friday night through text and he answered saying he was at the bar having a couple of drinks. And then he was like out of the blue asking are you coming? Which sadly I couldn't attend.

However here is the deal. I've been on several dates this summer with two different guys that didn't lead to anything, and he knows about it since we've talked about it. Strangely he never brings up his dating life like I do. He never speaks about other specific women in conversations with me. I don't even know what his type is. I was complaining about this guy rejecting my date proposal and he was like ""you should ask him to go out for drinks and play pool"" with a laughing smiley. We've talked about Tinder and how it sucks for dating and he was like ""you have a better personality than most women on Tinder"" when I was telling him that maybe I have a bad/weird personality and thats why I struggle with dating.

Honestly I don't really know what this friendship is about. I feel like there's a weird dynamic going on here, its bordering between friendship and something more. But then I feel like if he wanted more than friendship he would have made that known by now, by asking me out on a proper date or inviting him over to his place. None of the outings we have been on have been said to be a date.

A few pictures a blurb or so doesn't tell me if I'll connect. For me meeting someone is the only way to tell if there's connection because you get the full effect of someone - mannerisms, personality and energy - and then determining if both want to pursue getting to know one another deeper, whatever that is or may be. I don't rush anything or go in with high expectations especially when meeting online/apps; just open with a level of genuine curiosity. 

After having built a connection, then texting and messaging makes more sense to me because I have an idea of who the person is and their cadence or context in how/what they write; I rather not have a very long winded back and forth because personally, I can't decipher vibe nor spark without having met and spent some time talking - only commonality and initial interest is what I can glean via messaging someone new. That's a baseline.

It's the in person conversations that are great when they go off on tangents in depth and there's real dialogue with someone you're into, so that you can create anticipation for what may be... but, there's got to be a level of deep interaction, picking up on conversational cues to delve into things to truly understand someone. This doesn't happen with basic small talk type of conversations... you know work, travel and going out drinking etc aren't topics that tell you anything about someone on their own. Everyone likes travel. Everyone likes going out somewhere nice ordering a few drinks and hanging out with friends. Work can be a layered conversational piece but only to an extent. Other things to discuss where someone says something different is usually a pivot point in a conversation that can evolve and tell you a lot about someone, a simple ok and brushing past like some factoid doesn't carry onward a conversation. It just shows a  lack of interest and so doesn't make the other person bother trying to continue to navigate a conversational piece that would allow you to get insight into them. So, it devolves to shallow chatter at a point, initial interest feigns. Maybe it's Covid throwing us off our respective game and we've lost our social skills.

Idk maybe it's just me, pretty faces are everywhere they're no rarity but past that what's between their ears is intriguing... it's what you get to when you show initial interest and have that time together to talk... however you manage to get to that point, if you do. Lately I feel like everyone's conversational skills are limited. I give what I get, I can only dive into things if you're interested in it.

The conversation was flowing super easy, and nothing seemed forced or awkward, even from the time I picked her up it was like we’ve know each other for a while. Before I dropped her off we made loose plans to do something the next day as well. When the next day came around and I asked if she still wanted to hangout she then told me she just found out she had plans for the rest of the weekend cause her brother was in town. I then asked if she wanted to if she could go out during the week and she said she had work all week and her only day off and already had plans that day. Next weekend I’m out of town so it will be almost a week and half between times hanging out. Side note, when we text she responds and doesn’t really use any punctuation which to me comes off as not interested and if it gets to the end of the convo we were having she just doesn’t respond instead of starting a new convo. So with all that in mind what can I do to continue to show I’m interested and want to go out again without texting he everyday or being over the top, but also not come off as not interested by not texting her at all either?

I’m a bit embarrassed now because I remember how confused he was but again he never mentioned anything and acted as usual afterwards. It wasn’t anything romantic but we didn’t even hug before and this time I hugged him and kissed him on the cheeks.

This is the time of social networks. We can reach more people in a quicker way. Lots of people mostly meet through internet, or dating apps. 

Nothing wrong with that. But I think we lost the “approach strangers” culture. In my country, for example, it’s considered very creepy, no matter what the guy looks like ( well… if the guy looks like Johnny Depp, there might be some exceptions ).

I don’t even get how total strangers might meet out of blue. I’ve never seen a guy approaching a girl in my entire life.

You may ask: Why don’t you try to get socials/dating apps?

Simply, i used to have instagram, but having 15 followers didn’t help in order to attract new people ( especially girls ). 

Dating apps? I hear about some lucky guys who meet interested girls. Never seen them. I’m not even bad looking imo. I’m tall ( 6’3 ) and pretty fit. My face doesn’t make me any favors.

This summer we rekindled dating after 3 months of no contact. I stayed at his lake house for 5 days, which was great even after 3 months of no contact, there was not a bit of difficulty in communication or anything else. 
He was the one who brought up the issues about our last fight and told me about his one night stands during our no contact period. And told me that he only wanted to be with me.

After I came back to the city we messaged everyday, our talks were great and suddenly it stopped. Then he called me after several days, I missed his call called him back and he didn’t pick up. Then I messaged him and he was very distant, then after few hours he became very open, told me that he was depressed and we talked until like 4 am.

Now the strange part about this is that at the moment when we messaged and he was distant he was at our mutual friend’s house with his friends. They had some disagreement about which I found out through my mutual friend’s friend. The situation is very blurry, but the thing that my friend’s friend told me was that the guy that I am dating mockingly mentioned me and said that he fucked me. They were drunk as I know.

After that day I talked with him and again he was very distant. Only after that I found out about this situation.

Now we are not talking, I don’t think that he knows that I know about the situation and I don’t know if I should confront him about the stuff that he said to get to the bottom of things or just ignore and forget about him? As the situation is a bit blurry I don’t know exactly what to do. 

If I confront him, how should I approach him about this?

However, with it being Covid, this hasn't been possible. No conventions run anymore around here for obvious reasons and I have gone single for over a year now. I do really want to try to approach women again but I am very unsure how to do so?

TW: brief mention of suicidal behavior &amp; SH

Background: My long-distance boyfriend and I (both college students) have been together for about six years. We met as kids on MovieStarPlanet lol. We’re “nevermets” mostly due to a slight age difference (3 years) and the fact that I wasn’t really allowed to date when we got together, so it was a secret for a long time. But now, we’ve confirmed travel plans for me to stay with him at his mom’s house early next month. I’ve met his mom via video call before, but he’ll finally introduce me to her in person–and his dad at some point during the visit.

So, the situation? I’ve been sinking into a depressive slump recently and he’s just about the only person I want any interaction with when I’m like this. Last night I got to a pretty bad place and we were texting. He asked me what was going on, said he loved me and was ther for me, and sent me a pic of him smiling (this was the extent of what he could do when we were secretly dating because we couldn’t always talk). This used to be enough to cheer me up at least a little before we became public about our relationship, but now it just leaves me feeling more empty.

I’ve talked to him multiple times about the fact that he doesn’t really bother to call me, even though it was something we so rarely had the chance to do for so long. For awhile we were watching movies together weekly on Discord, but we’ve been too busy with school and work lately. Still, we both have moments during the day when we could video chat, but it won’t happen if I don’t ask first. He’s generally been very good to me otherwise, but this hurts my heart so much.

He says he’s insecure because he feels like he’ll bore me since he’s usually just playing video games, which don’t interest me as much. We’re also not great conversationalists. Nevertheless, I often ask to call him, even if I’m just watching him stream a game, and soak in his company. He even knows I hate hanging up. So I don’t understand at what point he’ll feel secure enough to just randomly call me sometimes.

I’m very insecure too, especially when it comes to him, so I try to be understanding and let it go.

I haven't really been using any of the apps but I do still have my account and check messages once in awhile just because I don't want to get my hopes up/want to keep my options open/etc, the usual online dating bullshit.

I haven't been on any other dates since I started seeing him but again, I don't necessarily expect him to be doing the same, though it sounds as if that's what he's doing.

Now over the past two or so weeks, he had to go home unexpectedly because he had a bit of a family emergency - everything is okay now, but now that he's back in town he's also dealing with some major work issues that came up so he did warn me he was going to be sort of offline for a bit because he's trying to clear his head with life stuff. 

I totally understand this, and I've been sort of busy myself the past week or two so we haven't talked much. I sent him a text letting him know that I hope everything's going okay, but I left it close-ended so he wouldn't feel like he had to respond (neither of us really love texting). He didn't answer, and I'm wondering when/if it would be appropriate to send him a message and see if he is still interested and really does just need his space.

I don't want to come off as clingy or annoying, I'm more than willing to give him space over the next few weeks if he needs it to take care of life stuff - and if he's still interested, I would be interested in hanging out again in the future if that's something he'd want, too. But I do kind of want to figure out if he's lost interest because I don't want to wait around if I'm going to end up getting a slow ghost.

I often hear that I’m very attractive, but I don’t really think I’m much prettier than anyone else. What is it about me that’s landing me in these situations? I’m not even on dating apps!

I dont get matches that often so i was kinda hyped that she took the time to chat with me.I asked her a few Times if we could meet up, she agreed but when the day came she just replied the next day. Then she asked me out but same thing again. I wasnt thinking to much about it cause we both are shift worker and life can get busy. Few days ago i noticed that her answers were disinterested and 2 days later she ignored me. I asked her if i did smth wrong which iam sure i didnt but again no answer.
We really talked hella lot and iam wondering did she really took the all the effort and freetime just to ghost me or Was she just playing? I dont understand why u would do smth like this.

I’m a 5’10 guy and both my ex girlfriends have been 4’11. I’ve worked with girls in bars who are in this range and I think they’re cute. 

I’m afraid to be judged for it because my last couple relationships a few people have remarked that I must be some kind of creep, fetishizer, or a small dick compensating loser. Can I have some thoughts? 

I feel like if it’s OK for girls to want A super tall guy for chemistry I should have the right to want a woman shorter than me for that same chemistry.
