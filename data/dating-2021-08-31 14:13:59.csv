1,pfd10e,1630438305,I need opinions on this certain situation that’s occurring in my relationship right now. Me (F19) and my boyfriend (M19),"Okay so to start off I just want to say me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 3 years. We took a break from May 2021- July 2021, and recently just got back together a month ago. The breakup was horrible and we both knew we missed each other. I love him so much and I think us getting back together really made us both realize we want to be together for the rest of our lives. Anyways, the point of this post is recently he has been texting his friend named Alyssa. Which of course I don’t mind because I have guy friends as well. He isn’t a cheater and I know this for a fact because he never has cheated or never has given me a reason to even think he was. I’m so grateful to have a loyal boyfriend because I know sometimes it may be hard to find these days. He was the one who wanted the break and just felt like we needed some space away from each other so my trust with him lately has been hard because I never would have thought he would want a break. My point is my trust is low and is slowly being redeemed back since he broke up with my a few months ago. He said he wanted to hang with his friend Alyssa sometime this week and at first I wasn’t really happy about it because it’s another girl ya know? I don’t feel comfortable with them going to the mall alone. Maybe I’m being dramatic and they really are just friends? We talked about this cams he told me that he loves me and only me and just wants to hang with her because they have been friends since they were kids. I have really bad anxiety and have trouble with overthinking everything all the time. Will something happen between them? Are they really just friends? We are so so happy together and like I said before he has never cheated and told me they are just friends and it’s not like that at all. But my head is telling me over and over somethings going to happen between them and I hate how my mind plays tricks on me. I trust him i just don’t know the girl so I’m having a hard time trusting her. So can I just have your guys opinions? Is it normal for a boyfriend and a girl to hang out as just childhood friends? Am I thinking too much of It? He specially said he loves me and we just got back together and he was the one who came back to me. So would he really risk losing me again over something like this? All I’m asking is to let me know if I’m overthinking this or not. I just don’t wanna lose him again to anything especially another girl even tho he keeps saying over and over he’s not going anywhere and they are just friends and always will be. Just please comment what you think? Thanks :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfd10e/i_need_opinions_on_this_certain_situation_thats/

4,pfdbgy,1630439204,What qualifies as a date in todays world of guys and gals mingling casually? Based on personal example.,"So it's no news to anyone that guys and girls get along differently in 2021. Meeting a gal is not automatically a date or something romantic. At least it ain't in my book.

Tho this can make it terribly confusing when I do actually meet a girl I like...

I've been 2 years single now from a 9 year relationahip and I've reconnected with an old friend I know from events. We have NO previous relations of any kind next to vague friends. But now she actually agreed to meet me face to face.

In a few days I will meet her. We are going to see a classical music concert and have a quick bite beforehand. I plannes this and bought the tickets and she seems quite enthused.

Traditionally one might call this romantic. I wish It was actually but I have no freaking clue.

How do I tell if this is something more than just friends meeting up, or how can I like make it this way?

9 years of going steady has made me a cluess git. The landscape of dating of relationships seems to have changed a whole bunch.

Tldr: meeting up with old female vague aquantance that I like very much on a typical romantic outing. Have no clue what her standpoint is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfdbgy/what_qualifies_as_a_date_in_todays_world_of_guys/

8,pfdmkl,1630440185,"Felt like there was a real connection, things didn't pan out as I thought they might, what are your thoughts?","Hey, I hope you're having a great week so far! I'm trying to learn from an experience that I had and would like your feedback. I'm going to try to describe things in chronological order to that I/we can try to assess where things started to potentially ""fall apart"" and because I'm wondering if the situation is salvageable. 

Some background in case it matters: I'm generally a secure, confident person and people around me tend to pick up on that. I've been told I'm good looking, tend to be outgoing, and I'm sociable. Lean, athletic build but could gain some weight. Parents were strict growing up and I didn't get much dating experience, but I tend to be well-adjusted socially and typically don't feel as though I need someone in my life to make me happy (none of that ""you complete me"" garbage haha). 

Anyway, I started school a few months ago and met a girl that I was immediately attracted to. We saw each other in our lecture hall a few times, did the whole ""look, look away, look again"" sort of thing several times, then met within a few days through some mutual friends. First conversation was good, there was clearly some chemistry right off the bat and I could see that she was friendlier with me than she was being with other people. Few days later, we were leaving class and right as I got to my car I saw her again and so I started talking to her. I asked her if she had any weekend plans and she immediately asked me for my phone number. We wound up hanging out with a group on Saturday night at a bar (she invited me) and again I could feel a good deal of mutual attraction (strong eye contact, continually coming together again to talk, physically close to each other, etc.). The next morning she texted me first and we talked a little bit more. I suggested that we do something again together (I suggested trying a sport that I like that's pretty easy to learn and a lot of fun) and she showed interest in that. 

Over the next few weeks, we wound up seeing each other most weekends at a friend's house. I asked her out to get coffee (over text because I was kinda impatient) and she said yes. It was a good talk and it was clear that we have a lot in common. Date ended with a hug and her suggesting that we do something again after exams. 

From early on though, my texts were longer than hers (I tend to write a lot - as you can see here - but I generally try not to send multiple messages without a response). Since many of our classes don't overlap, I think I may have still wound up over-texting a bit just because I felt like I wanted to talk to her. We still talked pretty often, but it was generally friendly, about school, dogs, occasionally a mildly flirty text (calling her beautiful, teasing, etc.), but nothing too out there. We made plans to spend time together during a lighter week, but she wound up needing to study for a test so things feel through, but that was understandable. 

Early last week, there was a day that we spent most of the day together and it was really great. There was clearly an attraction between us, playful teasing, genuinely wanting to be around each other, and so on. We ran into each other the next morning and walked to class together and things were still good. However, the next day she seemed a bit distracted and somewhat more distant from me - though it was after we got a test back and that may have had something to do with it. 

Anyway, later on last week, I asked her out again (wasn't going to see her for a couple days so I tried calling, but wound up texting), and called it a ""lunch date."" A few hours later she replied that she thinks I'm a really great guy, enjoys my company, and so on but that she wants to be friends. The next day, I did wind up seeing her and we talked a little about it and I made it clear to her that I don't view her as a friend, saying out loud that I like her and that I felt like we have a lot in common - she thanked me a couple times for my vulnerability and openness and told me that she's preoccupied with school and that her ""heart is elsewhere"" for a guy she knew before me. She said that she's just nice in general and that people can misinterpret that, but in my view there was a very clear difference between our interactions and the interactions she was having with some of our other guy friends (I didn't mention that to her). I told her I'd be respectful of how she's feeling, that my feelings are what they are and that they're probably not going to change, and we agreed that things wouldn't be awkward between us. It was a good conversation and, in my view, we both handled it maturely. 

After that, we did wind up getting dinner with a group later in the week (my friend overheard her talking about the fact that I asked her out confidently with some of our mutual friends before I got there) and it was fine, but I could tell that the dynamic had shifted a bit. She still laughed at my jokes and things but she seemed more guarded in general - she wasn't generally talking to me directly and we sat further apart. Over the past few days, we've still wound up seeing each other in class, studying in a group together, going to the gym at the same time, etc. but things feel just as distant. 

So, I think this may be a case of where things potentially could have worked out between us but factors beyond my control in her life may have prevented that. That being said, it's also possible that I  messed things up in some way causing the attraction to fizzle out (this is something I'm particularly curious about since I do tend to get girls interested in me but I don't usually pursue them enough to see if this is a trend for me or not - I'm a very analytical person which probably isn't a good trait in emotional areas like dating hahah). 

Although we agreed that we wouldn't let things be uncomfortable between us, I don't want to inadvertently make her feel that way by hanging around too much (we have a lot of friends in common, the time we go to the gym is convenient, etc. but I still don't want her to think that I'm just doing those things to be around her). I sent her a quick text today, haven't sent her anything in about a week, just to test the waters a little but haven't heard back, which may be because she's in class still or it's possible that she just doesn't want to give me false hope.  I really like this girl and it'd be great to get to know her better to see if there is long-term potential, but if she's happier with the other guy then I'm happy for her. If her situation were to change I admittedly probably would ask her out again. 

Anyway, how do you recommend I handle things at this point? Should I just give her and that circle of friends some space for a few weeks/months? And for what it's worth, I am still focused on my own pursuits, goals, hobbies too - I'm not trying to have my life revolve around a woman, but I would like her to be a part of my life. Do you think there is still potential for a relationship in the future? 

If you read this far, thank you!

TL;DR - felt like I had a good connection with a girl, things didn't quite pan out, wondering if it's something that could possibly work and generally want to learn how I can improve.

13,pfe3um,1630441614,"My friend doesn't want ""casual/FWB"", ""polyamory"" or a relationship. But she still does online dating and says she is window shopping.","My friend is a lesbian that is process of divorcing her wife of 10 years. I tell her she should be single and not date for awhile until she knows what she wants. 

She thought she wanted ""casual"". So last weekend, she had a weekend long casual fling. When it was over there were no future plans to meet again (because, casual) and she said she left feeling empty and missing day to day companionship. 

She doesn't want a relationship because per her words, she doesn't want any obligations or be ""tied down"".

Polyamory is out of the question because of all the people and 3rd parties that would necessarily be involved and competing time and attention restrainst. 

I asked her, so why are you doing this? You exhausted all your options here. She says, well, i'm just window shopping I guess. 

So in sum, she wants sex, emotional intimacy, time and attention from another person. But doesn't want any obligations of a relationship. And casual/FWB leaves her feeling empty because it doesn't involved emotional intimacy and the caring you get from a committed partner. And no poly because of the constraints of other persons. 

So she is one of the many on online dating that have ""I'm not sure what i'm looking for"".  Not sure why she would put herself through that.

Our relationship was not very good much of the time, always a bit cold, never felt that my emotional and romantic needs were met. In the end, she finally admitted to herself that she’s not sexually attracted to men, and we called it quits.

I’m in a tough spot. I’m from a much larger metropolitan area where people are very open and approachable, and there are plenty of other eccentric folks for interesting conversations. Here, meeting people has been much harder. I experience a broad feeling of alienation in this town, not just in the romance department. 

I’m a pretty attractive guy, I dress well, work out frequently, and have good career prospects, but it seems like my interests are very niche relative to the women here, and I struggle to find anyone that I can have a conversation with, and I’m not really interested in a hookup in which we barely talk to each other.

I never had to learn how to date here because I met someone so early, and now I’m a fish out of water. I’m not doing well on dating apps, and people here are generally very closed, so meeting people through my classes and even school clubs hasn’t panned out and I hate the bar/nightclub environment. 

I’m just not sure where to start. I used to have no problem finding people to flirt with, go on dates, etc., but it’s like I’ve forgotten how, or perhaps I don’t appeal much to the populace here, as the local culture is very different from mine.

17,pfeu3p,1630443834,Potentially going on a first date for the first time in 4 years and I need some advice (24m),"So there’s a couple of things I need help with regarding this date. 

The first thing is that it’s the first date I’m going go on in 4 years if it still goes ahead. I was in a relationship for three years and I’ve been single for a year, in fact a year this month and I feel like I’m up for going back out there dating but I don’t know if a year it’s enough it probably is but I just wanna make sure. The girl I’m talking to mentioned the idea of going for drinks first and last weekend we were talking on Snapchat while she was having her birthday party with friends and she was drinking obviously and I was hanging with my friend while out drinking. He was super supportive after my breakup and was egging me on to ask this girl for a drink basically saying I’ve got nothing to lose and it’s worth a shot. I asked eventually and she said she would love to meet. The dates potentially this Sunday, I originally suggested Saturday but her shifts rotate. 

I’m hoping to go on Sunday though but and this is gonna sound stupid but my parents don’t really know and also we started talking via hinge and they don’t really get online dating they kinda look down on it and in some cases I can see why. I get it I’m 24 but I don’t wanna cause anything if you get me. What would be the best way to approach this or should I not. I love half an hour away from the city we’re going to by train and she’s 5-10 mins away by train.

We’re wanting to go to a couple of bars to get to know each other. I’m hoping to just keep it casual and not come across more unconfident that I probably will be naturally. I also don’t want to mention exes I feel that it kinda brings the mood down. Any tips on how I can have a good time and be stress free?

20,pff806,1630445056,"When is it reasonable to be frustrated with a partners communication habits, and when are some instances where it is unreasonable?","Recently I've run into this same issue with my boyfriend and I find it very emotionally exhausting. We are both 30, and we have been in a relationship for 8 months at this point. We do spend lots of quality time together and for the most part I feel really happy with him. I've met his family and we spend a lot of time together during the week. 

Lately one issue has been plaguing me a lot, and I struggle to understand if i'm just projecting my past onto him, or whether its reasonable to find it rude when he takes hours to reply to my messages... particularly ones where we are confirming plans and/or gathering important information.

I've been cheated on and such, so I could have some residual issues despite investing lots of my time into therapy. However, I will give myself some credit as I DO believe i'm pretty self aware of any jealous, possessive, anxious and obsessive behaviours I might have. I can honestly say my frustration with him isn't due to jealousy/possessiveness or thinking he's going to cheat, but rather... I get the feeling that he doesn't care for me as much as I care for him... which is a huge incompatibility issue as I don't want to spend my life with someone who is potentially halfhearted about me. In the past I've never had issues with men and communication, all of them have been excellent texters.

Often I will message him and he takes a while to reply... which took some getting used to, and it doesn't bother me much when its the day to day chat, and not urgent. However, when I ask him a time sensitive question such as ""where should I make a reservation tonight?"", ""i'm just picking up xyz, what was that thing you wanted me to get again?"" or ""would you like to come for dinner tonight?""... very often he takes hours to get back to me. My initial thoughts was always that work was overwhelming. But he frequently talks about how boring his day at the office was, and how much downtime he has (to the point where he's out with clients golfing or having lunch, or simply shooting the shit with his coworkers) it makes me feel like he's just sidelining my messages. I wonder to myself how he couldn't just take a second to reply if he always has his phone on him. It really hurts. Even if he were to put it away during the day, he gets his messages on his watch and I see him checking them at home all the time.

For the record, I do NOT bombard him with messages, nor do i nag him, or double text him or do anything that would be perceived as needy and annoying. As a result of suppressing this feeling of hurt, it is starting to grow into a bigger issue where I am starting to wonder if he sees me in his future or if im just a ""for now"" girl. 

At this point he also hasn't told me he loves me, and we haven't discussed anything regarding our future together. In combination with his lack lustre texting habits it is making me feel taken for granted and I don't have the time to waste in my dating life. 

I'm also ragingly PMS today so please help me shift my perspective if my views seem a little one sided.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pff806/when_is_it_reasonable_to_be_frustrated_with_a/

&amp;#x200B;

So I matched with this chick on tinder one day and we really hit it off! We had the exact same taste for music, which is very important for me in a potential partner because music is a HUGE part of my life. We added each other on facebook messenger after a while and even spoke on the phone a couple of times (she seemed really into me). I was really looking forward to meeting her, so one day we set up a date.

 When the big day came she never showed up. I checked messenger to check up on her and she was completey gone... Asked a friend to check if she still had an account on facebook. Lo and behold, this chick blocked me. I was so confused! I couldn't get it out of my head. Couldn't stop thinking about her. But soon I just accepted reality.

A couple of months later she hits me up on messenger out of nowhere and apologizes for her behaviour (while trying to make me feel sorry for her). Apperantly she blocked me because she thought the whole thing was to good to be true or something like that and she got scared. WHAT???She put ALOT of sad emojis through out the whole conversation and it really felt as if she made the ''puppy eyes'' digitally, you know?

The thing was... This girl was really hot and I almost gave her a second chance. But then a little a voice in my head just said ''She doesn't deserve you and you deserve better''. So I told her that I accept her apology but she blew her chance of meeting me big time.

&amp;#x200B;

To be completely honest I almost wanted to get my revenge by sleeping with her and then ghosting her. The thought was cool, but that's just not who I am. I'm not a douche or a player.

&amp;#x200B;

MORAL OF THE STORY IS: Listen to your gut! Doesn't matter if the chick is really hot. Have self respect and own your value.

**Advice to anyone here considering asking their teacher out or dating them:**

* If she looks at you, smiles, listens, and nods her head when you talk or discuss a topic, it doesn't mean that she likes you. I know it is crazy. I always thought that if a girl listens to you and looks at you when you talk, she likes you, but boy was I wrong. 
* If your teacher gives you good grades and tells you that you did a good job and should keep it up, it apparently doesn't mean she is romantically interested in you. Yes, even if she did the above mentioned things together with giving you good grades and complimenting you.
* If she laughs when you talk about Roman history and imitate Caligula it doesn't mean anything. From what I read on the Internet, if a girl that laughs at your jokes, she must like you. But apparently they lied about it because now I am in trouble. 
* If she walks behind you in the hallway it doesn't mean that she wants to see your butt.

33,pfg3zt,1630447834,Emotional Abuse while Dating,"I am not sure where to begin other than seeking a place to share my story and hopeful there is support to be found for myself and others out there stumbling through the dating life. 

I am an educated, successful, well traveled, compassionate woman (34F, straight). I spent my 20s-early 30s in a few long term relationships that ended with me moving for my career and the men not wanting to follow (which I get, no harm there) and one ended because he cheated (had cheated on every woman before me too, best to walk away). 

Recently, I was talking to a man (and met him once) that did a number on me due to the confusion and emotional roller coaster. We talked every day (morning to night, text to video chat) for three weeks.  He initiated most of the time. We shared a lot with each other, including vulnerabilities from our past - what he called “love and learn moments”. We met in person, hit it off for hours, and he raved after about how great it was - saying he couldn’t wait to meet again, this was such a great time for him. He told me every day for a week that he was so excited for our next meeting yet also bailed 3 times by simply not following through with those enthusiastic words and endless kissing emojis. 

How did he set up these bailing moments? We were supposed to meet in person and something came up once the morning of the day we were to meet. Then again a few days later, to which I shared it confused me - to be told how excited he was then be asked to go out on a specific day yet to have no follow through when the day came (there was no excuse for it, it just didn’t happen). This second bail, he flipped on me by saying I said yes to the date but never chose a place or time; he also went so far as to say I didn’t need to complicate dating so much. Wait, what? We disagreed on how that played out, he said I ruined his day, and ultimately talked me into one more chance. I caved and shouldn’t have listened to the guilt trip. But ultimately did. And thought wait and see - third strike you’re out. 

To keep it simple in how he blasted me (lovebombing, if I were to guess): he would say how excited he was to meet again, share something he thought was great from our first date, and when I said “great, me too, let me know when works” he would casually suggest a day yet not provide any place or time (clearly by design). This happened three times in one week — on a Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday. Again, after we met in person so clearly stringing along. Each were cancelled the day of when asked what time to plan for (it was the day of the supposed date FFS). 

Fast forward to the third and final time: yet again, it was predictably cancelled that morning after he was talking about it nonstop for two days. When I said I wouldn’t be reaching out, this again wasn’t my style of dating, he blew up on me. He leveraged intimate conversations against me and used information from my past including how desperate I was for living with former partners then slammed my age. Conversations he initiated about loyalty, compassion, and wealth were brought up, flipped and twisted in rapid fire hate texts that attacked every piece he could.

He is blocked. I stopped defending myself early on in this weird exchange (seeing it was grossly toxic and hateful). 

I am still processing how horribly wrong I was in judging this person’s character but woa - looking back, I saw glimpses from day one. The blaming others for his negative relationships was there - but covered in his manipulative tools and smooth talking clearly impacted by his wealthy bringing (my impoverished upbringing was used against me in his hate texts). 

People say emotional abusers show signs in early dating. The signs of control, disregard, lack of respect for boundaries and other things - like time and energy. Practicing vulnerability is difficult; discernment in practicing vulnerability in safe spaces is even more a struggle. 

Thanks for the space to share my struggle in navigating this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfg3zt/emotional_abuse_while_dating/

So I’m new to dating and tbh idk what I’m doing but I want to learn, I feel like if I don’t learn I won’t get no girl to love me and won’t get married in the future and have kids and all that.

My perspective on woman changed, I used to think of them only for sex but now I respect them because they are beings and they have feelings and are important.

A few months back (I’m 18) I was texting this girl from school and since we were in quarantine we had class online. I didn’t know what the rules were so I had my friends helped me and it was awful. I didn’t know what to say, I was acting up so bad I made awful jokes it was terrible and the thing is my friends gave me great advice to be myself and to be vulnerable by telling her I’m new to this but I felt like she would’ve dumped me because my whole reputation at school was me being bullied and since it’s high school I thought it would gave me “loser vibes” and the thing is she didn’t even care which I was very shocked, she literally gave me multiple chances and I blew it but I learned my mistakes now I want to be myself and if they can’t like it then I’ll find someone who will.

I plan on talking to this girl tomorrow at school but I never spoke to her, but the thing is I feel like I’m not ready to have a girlfriend, I don’t have money and i don’t feel I have the confidence to make her happy especially knowing her last relationship made her change her perspective on boys not to a complete extent but I can tell she was very upset about what happened. I like this girl man, I feel dumb cause idk the rules of dating, I don’t know if I have to talk to her everyday, I don’t when to ask her out or when take her on a date. I literally don’t know anything but I keep having these thoughts of me and her being married and having kids and I came to realize that those are just thoughts and that I must stay grounded. Idc if she rejects me, I love myself now but I don’t want to get into something that falls on my face, not again man.

Any advice you’ll give I’m ready, I know this is my life and I have to make choices and can’t rely on others to lead my life on but I really need perspective and dating knowledge on this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfgblu/i_need_advice_im_new_to_dating_in_general/

But it became clear that I just don't mean as much to her. I don't hold the same value. I'm not as attractive or as desirable or even better to talk to.

I am ready to date again but I am wanting to make sure the person I’m seeing isn’t just playing with me and knows what he wants. 

I recently met this guy (I’m 27F) and he’s 32. I really like him and he seemed genuine but I had my guard up a bit because he is pretty intense. Like first date he was telling me he wants a family and he wants to be serious with someone and asked me how many kids I wanted etc. He’s telling me I’m so beautiful and sweet and he wants to get to know me more and we can take it “slow.” We kissed and it was amazing. I knew he was looking for a home but not sure where, either the city we were both raised in or 4 hrs away where he went to school and had his friends. I am also waiting to take exams and get licensed for my job and that won’t happen until the summer if all goes well. 
Second date he was even more intense. Talking about how now he’s taking me into consideration about moving, how he knows we’re still seeing each other but “you’re mine,” how he wants me to meet his friends, how he wants to call me baby (i told him no not yet but he did anyway), how I’m the perfect package, how he’s serious about me. 

Third date: amazing, he’s so thoughtful and i let my guard down a bit more. Apparently that was the wrong move lol. I ask him when he plans on moving, and now he’s mainly talking about moving to the city 4 hrs away. He’s like oh you know we’re still new, I have a lot to think about still. I might go see some properties soon there. Laughs and says will you come visit me? I didn’t like that, and I started overthinking which I know is something I need to work on. The question made it sound like I was just a friend and he’s basically telling me to hit him up whenever I’m in the city. 
So i got quiet and he was like don’t overthink right now just think later. I wasn’t gunna tell him what was wrong but he was like ok just tell me. 
So I said I just think there’s a disconnect, you were so serious in the beginning and now ur saying oh we’re new. I know we’re new, like fully aware but he wasn’t acting like it? That is a little shady to me. I said i’m sorry i’m just thinking because i don’t want it to be a situation where in a few months you’re like actually byeee. I don’t want to get hurt like that. He’s like no I wouldn’t do that. Again he repeats we’re still new but I do have feelings for you, anything can happen i could meet your brother and he could hate me lol. I don’t think he understood what I was trying to say. Anyway we were wanting to see each other again but he didnt text me to ask me to do something he just texted to check in and i feel like he’s distancing himself. I’m just upset because I feel like i word vomited and i shouldnt have and I might have self sabotaged 🤦🏻‍♀️ it’s just hard to trust people because I know how caring and loving I am but tired of people taking advantage of it.

54,pfhjfe,1630452602,Dating for tall people,"Hey all, I’d love to know what you think about a project I’ve been working on during the pandemic called DateUp. The goal is to create a better dating experience for tall women by allowing them to quickly match with other tall men or shorter men that would like to date-up (of course other sexual orientations are supported too).

A bit of context, I come from a very tall family. I’m 6’9” (as a guy) and the average height in my family is probably around 6’7” for men and 6’0” for women. My grandparents even met in a tall social group back in the day. Needless to say height and dating have always been a common conversation I’ve been roped into over the years.

The way DateUp works is pretty simple. Essentially DateUp is a dating app for tall people, or those seeking someone tall. Everyone of a certain height (6’0”+ for men, 5’8”+ for women) join as “Members.” Members can match with other members nearby or with “Guests,” who are shorter people that want to date someone tall. There’s also a height verification feature.

58,pfhyqb,1630454109,Unpopular opinion? There’s nothing wrong with wearing insoles to appear taller.,"Let me explain. I’m a trans guy, and I’m basically pre T and the end of puberty. My bones have basically solidified and I will never grow unless I get leg lengthening surgery (is that a thing?)

I’m kind of tall for a woman but below average for a man in my country (5’8” or 173cm). So I’ve decided to buy some insoles that make me appear taller. They add a good 3 inches to my height, making me 5’11”, or 180cm. They were on sale and they’re actually pretty comfortable in my favourite shoes.

Im honest about them, and often show people that I am wearing them. They just give me a boost of confidence, especially since I tend to slouch a little due to years of binder use. Women also wear heels, which is accepted widely. Shoe lifts are similar.

It’s also totally cool if people don’t like it. I can understand why, with false advertising or whatever.

Thoughts?

63,pfidhs,1630455481,Apply brakes after crash,"Was on a 3rd date with a new woman I met with online. Near the end of our third date I declared my intention to kiss her as long as that was something she was comfortable with. After an awkward conversation because of the pandemic and the reality of online dating, she said she's been very curious if there is any physical connection. 

So we kissed and it was great! Maybe too great because things escalated rapidly from there and we landed somewhere between 3rd and home base as the basball metaphor goes. 

Afterward she asked that we slow things down so she can learn more about me and to avoid just having a sexual relationship. I get the idea, but now im imagining that having had sex now, everything from here on is going to be different than before we kissed. 

So for anyone thats been here before, how do you deal with that temptation for physical intimacy once you've already tasted it and what are some examples of what that looks like?

64,pfigi6,1630455786,Am I the problem?,"Before reading my post, I’m looking for a two sided answer not an extreme “yes, change now” or “no there’s bribing wrong with you, you’re perfect”.

My dating approach is somewhat guarded unless I connect with “my kind” or person. Sexual attraction is probably one of the first things I looks for but, that doesn’t mean I’ll cut off anyone I’m not instantly attracted to. 

In my experience, when I’m (sorry tmi) turned on when talking to them, over the phone, FaceTime or even texting, we’re going to get along. I look for important qualities from there onwards and I’ll go for a coffees if I see myself with them (at some point in the future).

Right now, having said that before the first meeting I follow my intuition and do not ignore my thoughts (or red flags). I’m happy being single but having someone is definitely a plus.

I’m posting because the minute something sexual is bought up, everything is ruined. I’ve lost all attraction  towards the person. My curiosity completely dies, I’m not upset or angry at the situation or the person. Even if they’ve said something borderline disrespectful. I’m not talking about flirting or grey area sort of comments (I like a tease).

I have no problem whatsoever attracting people to date but the minute I’m put off, it’s just done from there. How do I stop seeing it so black and white?

My friends say carry on and do not under any circumstance change. A good man won’t have any issue with this but I’m not so sure. I’ve accepted I’m not going to fall in love with everyone but come one at least one person would be great lol.

65,pfiice,1630455987,"""Short"" guy put me down out of insecurity","I once dated a guy who was my height - I'm 5'7"" &amp; female.

I don't care about height. I've dated shorter, I don't care.

This guy complained women rejected him a lot over height on our first date - I sympathized.

He also complained every date after that.

Then one day he said it was SO shallow women rejected him over height cuz that would be like him rejecting women just cuz they don't have big boobs.

Guess who is thin and has small boobs? Me.

I kinda just stared at him in horror and he apologized but the damage was done.

I'd never felt like I was settling for him, meanwhile he said out loud he was settling for me.

What's weird is I dated a guy who was shorter than I am who never said anything about his own height. I hit on him at a party, he was super cute, it never occurred to me his height was a problem because it wasn't for me.

My point is, sometimes the height or any other perceived shortcoming isn't the problem, the massive insecurity is.

You can be a confident person who doesn't insult people who like you, or you can be like this jerk I dated, who was so into his own inferiority complex he felt a need to put me down when I was never anything but kind and into him. :/",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfiice/short_guy_put_me_down_out_of_insecurity/

I got ghosted or a conversation wouldn’t last more than two messages (not of my doing). 

I asked one guy why he ghosted me. He said “it didn’t look like you would be interested in me” to which I said “was I not engaging in conversation?” And he said “yeah but like Idk”

The last/first date I went on from someone I met online was in June. After the date they legit asked me if I wanted to be friends with them. Lol 

Then I was finished, I only allowed myself to talk to people I met IRL. So I met this guy at a punk concert, we had each other on insta, I messaged him. He told me he thought he saw me at the concert, to which I said, “why didn’t you say hi?” And he proceeded to Heart my message and never reply back. Lmaooo. 

Now the last person I met I had high hopes for. Tho, I wasn’t going to actively pursue. My friends surprised me and invited him to an event we had. We all went out for drinks then the guy I was interested in spent the entire night trying to rekindle an old romance w/my friend. I didn’t know but years past they had slept together. Lolololol. 

Now I met this guy, I don’t know him. The last time I saw him was in 2015. I was going to ask him out cause we probably won’t cross paths again. but I’m so anxious and fearsome. I started crying because I become so anxious at thought of another rejection.

We had a long trip together last week. At around the same time, his mom started to ask whether we've planned something long-term like marriage (obv no cause we're still very young). For some background info, he's at an important transition point in his career, and probably that's why his mom doesn't want him to plan where he'll go around me.

80,pfjh5c,1630459443,Does This Girl Like me?,"So there’s a co worker I think likes me and I like her too. We’re both 17 and here’s the story so far. I originally didn’t like her because she trash talked me to another co worker about me taking all the customers at the registers (not on purpose but I just made eye contact first). Anyway a few weeks after that I had to help her at registers and she was super friendly, I remember thinking “man she’s talking a lot for not knowing me”. But I was super dry and blunt because I was mad at her remark she made at the time. She did things like ask what time I got off and then acted disappointed when I got off before her. Before I left I had to buy something and I went to her register. When I did she said “oh hey, it’s been awhile) and smiled and had a flirty look on her. She also was messing around with me and being mean in a playful way. Like messing with me when my card didn’t work and said “well we close in 30 minutes so if you don’t get it by then idk what to tell you” but it was flirty like I said


Fast forward a few weeks later and I see her one day and I decide to put what she said behind me and kinda have a “fresh start”. I started taking to her and it went so well. I made her smile and laugh a lot and she was playing with her hair a lot. I was looking to see if she played with her hair when I wasn’t talking to her and she was but not as much. It went so well that day. The next day I worked tho she was busy and around other co workers so it was hard to talk with her. I finally wanted to at least say hi. When I did I went full blown stupid and froze and just wave. I said nothing but she did the same, waved and said nothing. For some reason I looked away and then looked back. I have no clue why. When she left I told her bye and she said it back but she didn’t seem flirty or interested at all. I thought I ruined it until the next day


The next day she was there and I noticed she had her hair dyed. I wanted to compliment but decided not to because after last time I didn’t wanna make it worse. So I just told her good bye and she said “bye, hey did you get your hair cut?” I did so I said yeah. She said “it looks really nice”. I said “thank you!” And went on. She asked “do you work tomorrow?” I said “yeah wby?” She said “not until Thursday”. I said “I work tomorrow and Wednesday but not again until Sunday” she replied “I think I work Sunday!” I said “ok nice, see you!” And left. Today is when it gets amazing. That day she came in as a customer and checked out at my register. When she came up she was playfully being mean and stuff. I got to the screen where I couldn’t scan her discount and she said “wow do I need to do your job? I think I do, cause I will if you can’t” we both made each other smile and laugh a lot and it didn’t feel like a normal conversation, but like she was flirting the whole time. I asked her “do you need a bag?” She said “if it makes your life harder I totally need a bag”. When she went to leave she asked “you work Sunday right?” I said “yeah, you do right?” She said “yeah!” I said “nice I’ll see you then, btw I like your 
hair!”. So I finally complimented her new hair

Yesterday I worked with my crush and this was the first day we worked together next to each other. She said some things I can’t tell if there hints or just her messing around. There’s another boy there and she said how he’s obsessed with him. She wasn’t serious but just joking. She said “hey texted me because you know he’s obsessed” and thing like that. Idk if this was a sign for me to get her number or if she was just joking. She also was saying things like “can you do (blank) because you love me?” Or if id do something she’d said “you still love me tho”. I didn’t really know the correct way to respond to that lol. I also cut myself on a tag today and I told her “wow today was the first day I cut myself on these tags, I blame you!” And she said “I was probably distracting you” and I said “well yeah maybe”. All and all we talked for about 2 hours straight and the whole time we made each only laugh. I kept teasing her and made her laugh every time. Am I in or no?

89,pfk9ns,1630462242,I need advice with a girl,"So there was this girl that moved into my building in July. Everyone that I knew, including myself &amp; this girl, were gonna be out of that building by late-end of August. I saw her twice before asking for her snap &amp; eventually her phone number. She's in town for 6 months only, since she's attending a program that lasts for only 6 months. 

At first she was a bit flakey, I once saw her on the patio smoking a joint &amp; chilled with her. The next thing you know, we're seeing each other almost every night, nothing sexual, but we'd just chill on the patio for an hour or 2, smoke a joint or a dart, and just talking. Now I used to be a shy &amp; awkward kid, so spending so much time with a girl was new to me. On top of that, I genuinely enjoyed conversing with her &amp; I think she did as well, since she'd also message me asking if I'd wanna smoke with her when I'm off of work. 

Since she lived around where me &amp; my friends would hang out, she eventually met most of my friends. My best friend came back to town &amp; I introduced them. There was a point where she'd hangout with me &amp; my best friend and me &amp; her would talk to him about his issues (he had some drug abuse issues). Now being around her for so long didn't help, and I kept getting more attached to her. I was scared shitless to make a move that would make her uncomfortable. she's easily the coolest chick I've met, and I didn't wanna scare her off. I think she could tell that I was into her, but she's mentioned on occasion that she's not looking for anything, due to her short stay in the city.

2 weeks ago, she moved out since she was just subletting the apartment &amp; she moved somewhere else in town, rooming with some of the other people that are attending the program (all guys btw lol). At first, we still called pretty often, but I think I was a bit too clingy &amp; too available/desperate. I saw her on the day she was moving out &amp; I asked her if she wanted to hangout over the weekend, and she said that we can discuss it later. Unfortunately, I persisted &amp; I was eventually was left on read. She did call me however early the next week and we just talked about shit, like we usually do. She mentioned in the call that she wasn't looking for anything, but she also said that we should call more often. Then I didn't hear from her for the entire week, so I call her during the weekend. Then yesterday I ask her if she wants to watch something &amp; she tells me that she's not looking for something. She was also acting a bit strange. Like, we had spent so much time together in the first half of the month, but she was treating me like I wasn't close to her or anything. I let fear get the best of me. Since she wasn't living in the same building anymore, I feared that she was pretty much out of my life, so I ended up bombarding her with texts &amp; missed calls and I believe that may have eventually drove her away.

The thing is we were pretty tight, and that wasn't even a long time ago. I believe that I was too available &amp; that anyone being this desperate/clingy would instantly come off as unattractive. I understand that she's only here temporarily, and hence, isn't looking for something like that &amp; is mostly focused on her program, but I just wanna chill with a person that I get along with and vibe with. I know that it's not looking good for me right now, and most people would just suggest that I get over it and forget about her, but is there anything else that I could do that could maybe turn the tide? It's not like I'm chasing a stranger, or someone that i didn't really know. I don't really meet a lot of people that I vibe with, so when I do, I can sometimes get like this. I'm aware that I need my space &amp; I need to get on my shit, but I also really don't wanna lose her completely from my life. Any suggestion other than 'let go &amp; forget about her' would be really appreciated, since the former suggestion is not really the one that I'm looking for from this post. Thanks for reading &amp; listening y'all. Promise that I'm not always like this hahaha, I'm just at my worst when I'm desperate.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfk9ns/i_need_advice_with_a_girl/
90,pfka3m,1630462284,Does anyone feel their anxiety gets in the way of their happiness?,"35f I realize I have anxiety &amp; depression issues. I also am going through an insecure phase. Usually I'm a bit more confident but lately I've been struggling with that after a painful breakup. My last relationship (actually the last 2 guys I dated really affected my confidence) The first one played w my emotions &amp; the second one used me for a year then disappeared. What's worse is I had doubts about both of them but took a chance bc I thought they were nice &amp; really interested in me. One thing I don't tolerate though is mind games. If I feel someone is trying to manipulate me or lower my confidence to control me, that's an automatic no. 

Its been nine months since my last relationship. I took a break from dating. I talked to a few guys here &amp; there. There was one really cute guy that seemed interested in me &amp; I liked him too BUT bc of my insecurity from my last relationship nothing ended up happening w him. I tried again a few months later w him &amp; he was open to it but again I think my lack of confidence came through &amp; ultimately he told me he wasn't interested anymore. I feel things could have been different if my attitude &amp; self esteem had been better. The guy was understanding &amp; knew what I was going through. I think he was going through the same but not as bad as me. We're cool though. 

I just hate that my insecurities are getting in the way of my dating life but after you've been screwed over so many times esp after the last two it just really took a toll on me. I started seeing a really good therapist again to really get to the bottom of my issues bc my last breakup really brought out all these abandonment issues. I've also been coming to terms with some truth about my family that I'm not happy about. 

I am focusing on myself &amp; my goals, school, work. I'm saving up for my own place. I'm really thinking about my future for myself &amp; not depending on anyone to take care of me even though I'd like to find love &amp; get married one day. Even though I'm at that age where most people settle down, I try not to beat myself up about it. There's so many people my age who are in the same boat as me. I also am trying to travel &amp; get out more. I don't have many friends bc I just don't see eye to eye w many around my area in terms of hobbies &amp; interest. Sometimes it's lonely but sometimes I really enjoy the solitude. 

I just wish my anxiety &amp; doubts could stop. I wish I didn't focus so much on what makes me sad &amp; doubt potential love &amp; stop letting fear get in the way &amp; stop thinking that everyone is going to abandon me. Anyone who can relate please leave nice comment &amp; any advice &amp; tips on what you did to improve your state of mind?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfka3m/does_anyone_feel_their_anxiety_gets_in_the_way_of/

Any advice for the super introverted and reserved type?,"I've always been the quiet guy, it doesnt help I was homeschooled/online schooled and never had much of a social life in my youth. Covid and taking time to find myself before covid kinda took away my early 20s and youth, and I was planning on going back to in person schooling then, but it's whatever now. We only get older haha

I live in a cabin in the forest as an RV park caretaker. It's great. It does get lonely some days, but I do have family remaining to talk to from time to time and the occaisonal regulars

I would love to have my own garden one day, a whole acre of mazes and trees and plants of all kinds and bearing all sorts of flowers and fruits or vegetables, it sounds awesome

I also like talking about all kinds of topics, any would unravel some niche of my memory that would spiral into conversation of knowledge.

Some days I think I will eventually meet whoever is for me, something will click, maybe we will get each other somehow. I'm optimistic and patient, but i always feel like time is running out somehow

93,pfkj9b,1630463190,It's super brave to call instead of ghosting,"I (27F) recently got back into the dating world after being single for nearly 2 years, and I thought I'd try online dating (CMB) since I never had before. The first guy I dated (I went on four dates with him) ended up ghosting me instead of telling me he didn't want to go on a fifth. I started seeing a new guy at the beginning of August, and our dates were so amazing, with each one longer and more intimate than the previous (these were really long dates: the first was 9 hours, the second 13, and the third one almost 24 hours). He kept bringing up things we could do in the future, like places we could go or restaurants we could try, etc. There was literally no indication that he didn't want things to keep progressing. 

Well, he called me earlier tonight and told me that he doesn't want to see me anymore due to a conversation he had over the weekend about his future and marriage and kids, and because I'm not his religion, he said he wanted to tell me sooner rather than later. And not going to lie, I'm absolutely crushed by this because everything seemed great in person—he even said he enjoyed our dates so much. But honestly, if he had ghosted me.... that pain would have been so much worse. It's a shitty conversation to have to have with someone, but the next time you're thinking of ending things with someone, please consider calling them instead of ghosting. It's going to be so much easier for me to move on now. Even though it really, really hurts and I'm going to have to take a little bit of time away from dating to get over it, it was really a kindness for him to have that conversation with me, as hard as it must have been.

97,pfktni,1630464236,How to keep up a long distance potential relationship,"I go to school in Chicago but live in LA. I matched with a girl on tinder who used to go to my school but graduated before I got there and she currently still lives in Chicago. We started chatting and I basically got her number immediately, and we've just been texting a lot. I think she's into me (?), it's a bit flirty and we send each other pretty long texts. 

I don't go back to Chicago until September 20th, so I basically have 20 days where we're operating long distance. I honestly really like her based on our communication so far, but I don't know how to keep it up or maybe make it clear what we're both looking for? Should I facetime her (if so how the hell do I initiate that), get her snapchat too? Not really sure. We have said things like ""yes we should definitely do x thing"" or, because I speak the barest amount of French like, ""i'll teach you some French"" to which she says yes. So it seems we're both interested in doing some things together, so plans could be made pretty easily in person, but it's just a matter of keeping up our maybe shared interest in each other.

99,pfl1fr,1630465031,am i a shitty gf?,"ok so to start i want to make it clear that i am 18. i don’t have a ton of dating experience and especially not a more serious type of relationship. my bf is 24 and says he wants to marry me. he says i’m the one he really loves and he’s found his person, which feels really good to hear but i worry it’s just a facade to shut me up. 

so my bf is nothing special i won’t lie. like please don’t say anything mean, i get enough of it from my parents. they think he’s 21 btw. but he was unemployed for a few months there
when i met him and he has a son. he has a dui so he can’t drive and he is in a band. i know he’s nothing really extraordinary but i love him nonetheless. he’s special to me. 

he has been unemployed for a few months and then recently his friend got him a great job he really loves. he makes great money, works 6 days a week to get overtime, and gets really good benefits. but the same fight keeps coming up. he works 7-5 everyday so i get up at 5:30 most days to take him to work (over 40 minutes there with traffic and another back) because he has a dui and can’t drive. he gets back around 5:30-6 every night, some days i pick him up other days his mom does. then he usually falls asleep between 7-8. it sucks. i had a job but worked nights so i wouldn’t get home until around 10:30. i didn’t mind it i actually liked the work until i talked to him about it and he in a way convinced me it wasn’t a good workplace. ultimately he was right, but it kinda sucks because i was really enjoying it at first. but we would always end up fighting i would get home and he would be asleep and i would be upset i didn’t get to spend any time with him or tell him about my day or hear about his day. it sucked. so i left and have been unemployed for around a week and just today i got hired at a new place that i’m really excited about. 

but we’re still fighting. it’s still the same old shit. he has enough energy to play drums and guitar most days but can’t spend an hour with me? i mean we went from spending all day everyday together to barely 3 hours if we’re lucky. it’s a big change for both of us. 

he says i’m being insensitive to the fact that he’s tired and don’t get me wrong i totally understand he’s tired and working towards a future. i just feel like im left in the background. i’m not getting what i need out of this relationship. my love language is quality time and we don’t get any of that. i just feel like i’m dishing and dishing and dishing in an empty tank. i mean i wake up early and drive over an hour twice a day and take care of his dog in between. i help babysit his niece and have lunch with his mom all the time, i do a lot for him that i feel goes unnoticed. and it is too much for him to spend an hour to talk to me? 

he makes me seem like those huge bad guy and villain for wanting to spend time with him and i’m younger than he is and he has more experience in relationships. im just wondering if i’m being unreasonable. i just want to see him. i miss him. i feel lonely and yeah i could make friends but he’s my best friend  he’s who i want to go to with news first. he’s who i want to spend all my time with. i just don’t know what to do. i  thought about going a week without doing everything for him and see how he can manage without me. 

i just wish we could talk it out and reach some common ground like a compromise of date night once a week or something but when i asked he didn’t respond. i just wish i had some more experience under my belt when it came to this stuff so i could determine if i’m being unreasonable but all my previous relationships have been mostly flings. just tell me what to do. i’ve posted on this sub before asking for advice with this same guy and most of my response has been to leave him but i really want to work it out. please tell me if m being unreasonable and how to go about telling him. i’ve tried to tell him how i feel before and he seemed to not really care. its a certain him sided relationship. i just wish someone would tell to do because i don’t know. i don’t know if he’s worth all this and if it’s worth putting my needs aside to give him what he needs. i get he’s tired but i also can’t feel this way everyday. 

i want to make it work but idk if he’s worth even trying at this point.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pfl1fr/am_i_a_shitty_gf/
