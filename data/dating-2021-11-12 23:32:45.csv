2,qsv5py,1636784720,So are dating sites/apps really worth it??,"So I tried things like Tinder and others before and at the time I thought I was wasting time because whenever I‚Äôd sign up for one of these  sites I would get told things about memberships and crap like that and some of these sites would even have bots dm me I feel like just so that I can get scammed. Like what the hell?
Is paying for a membership really worth it? Like even without a membership can I still get anywhere? I swear I hate membership plans with a passion, they are such garbage business strategies depending on what you are paying for. So yeah anyway I‚Äôm an 18 year old male, I‚Äôm definitely introverted, I‚Äôm a geek, I‚Äôm a gamer, I‚Äôm 6,4 in height, brown wavy hair, blue eyes, and a little bit of whiskers but I shave 1 or 2 times a week. But yeah are dating sites really worth it or are they owned by outright greedy motherf*ckers who just want money who will scam you? That‚Äôs one of my biggest questions.
Also I‚Äôve heard that dating sites have tons of women who are looking more for good looks rather than personality, and I do think I‚Äôm good looking but I‚Äôm not really a good photographer lol.
Also I can‚Äôt really download anymore apps on my phone for some reason so if I ever decide to go on another dating site again do I really need the app or can I just dm girls along with doing other things on my computer??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsv5py/so_are_dating_sitesapps_really_worth_it/
3,qsv6z0,1636784860,Guy I‚Äôm seeing is suddenly inconsistent with communication,"So I (20f) have been seeing this guy (22m) for about a month and a half. Things seem to be going well.

The thing is, his texting has become pretty inconsistent.

He used to text me back pretty quickly and we‚Äôd just text back and forth throughout the day. But recently he‚Äôs started just not answering me for whole days and then trying to come back to the conversation. When he is actually answering me, he seems like his normal self, and interested in me, but he‚Äôs just become super inconsistent. One time I checked on him after not hearing from him for a while and he just said, ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôve been busy.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt see that as an excuse. If I like someone, I can take a few seconds out of my day to text them back.

Consistent communication is important to me, and he was very good at it initially but now he‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt appreciate not being spoken to for a long time only for him to act like nothing happened and not even apologize. I get that life happens, but this has happened on multiple occasions now and I‚Äôm tired of it.

6,qsveha,1636785713,How do you think entering your first relationship at 26 would be different than your teenage years?,"I'm asking cause I have never been in one. I'm only asking out of fun, however. I'm asking ""in theory"". 

In confession, what I truly want in life is to have the adolescence I never got to have. I am however not an adolescent anymore. Personally, I'm no longer open to ever finding love at this point. The beauty of doing those types of stuff at say 19, is that you probably have a group of peers going through the same things. 

In terms of life in general, I'm waiting to die. 

Doing that stuff at my age and going forward, would honestly just make me lonelier than I feel now. So to me, trying to find love isn't really worth it. The nature of romantic relationships is simply too different now. I would love to feel intense and completely hormonal about someone. But I think that type of relationship is truly unavailable now.

Has ""male friends.""","I \[M30\] have been dating a woman \[F33\] for over a month now, things are really good between us.  We have been out on so many dates, each better than the other. Today while messaging her, she mentioned her male friend/colleague(she referred to him). To be honest, I got agitated so apparently she picked up through my messages (Maybe I intentionally made that apparent) She asked if I was upset. 

Last month she cancelled our date together to go to her male friend birthday party(there were other girls there). She sent me photos of the birthday party. I let that slide by despite feeling upset and didn't make a comment or anything.

She has also mentioned that her past relationship failed because the man stopped trusting her as she went out with ""friends"" and he couldn't keep up with it. 

I am a very protective man by nature. I feel angry when I know my woman mentions or speaks of another man whether it be a friend, colleague, etc. I just can't take it. It doesn't resonate with me. So far I haven't brought the topic up yet. I want to bring it up and tell her that I can't put up with her having male friends. Should I ignore the whole thing? Am I being unreasonable? What should I do? How should I deal with the whole thing?

But a girl DM‚Äôed me asking me for fitness advice. We hit it off quite nice and chatted for like an hour or two straight. She sent me a picture of her face and body pretty quickly, which was concerning cause I thought she was catfishing me.

We continued chatting and she asked for pics of me and I sent her them. We soon started exchanging shirtless pictures and she wanted to see more, but I didn‚Äôt feel like I could trust her like that yet.

15,qswnhy,1636791023,How to get over someone,"Here‚Äôs the situation. I have been on and off seeing this guy for almost 2 years now. We were kinda just fwb but I had feelings for him, he sorta did too. It was kind of a messy situation. He hasn‚Äôt always treated me the best. I really liked him though, he‚Äôs everything I could have ever wanted in a guy. 

So back in the summer I found out he was seeing a girl after me and him got in an argument and didn‚Äôt talk for a few months. At that point in time i didn‚Äôt really care since we didn‚Äôt talk anymore, I accepted it. Then something happened between them and he came back and started talking to me again. We hung out a few times over the summer and he said next time I‚Äôll see him is when he comes home for Christmas (he lives in a different country for school) We didn‚Äôt talk for the past few months, both of us being very busy. I had this sinking feeling though that he was seeing this girl again. I messaged him today just casual talk, brought up him coming back home to which he told me he was indeed seeing that girl again. 

It really hurt to hear that and to have my suspicions confirmed. I told him that I‚Äôm happy for him but I‚Äôm upset because I‚Äôll miss him. He said he‚Äôll miss me too and that he enjoyed hanging out with me but us being in a relationship would have never worked in the long run. He lives 8 hours away in a different country for 9 and a half months of the year. Long distance is really tough to make work and I totally understand his reasoning behind never pursuing something more serious with me. It would have never worked out. 

It‚Äôs kind of difficult coming to terms with this. I envy this girl, she has what I want. I want him to be happy with me and not someone else. I felt really comfortable with him. I hate feeling like this :( I‚Äôve tried to move on from him so many times because I know the distance has always been our biggest issue. But now I know it‚Äôs over for good since he‚Äôs found someone else. Anybody have any tips on how to heal and move on from this situation? Words of reassurance?

She keeps on picking on how horrible I was but I wasn't in the best place in my life. I lived alone and I was failing at school. Depression hit me hard. She's the reason of it because we had a huge fight and she decided to find someone else. Things were actually great before she did that twice once again few months ago. I went as far as just speaking to one girl because she was my like my family. Two months later she begs for me and threatened me with suicide. She keeps saying she helped me with depression and school but she's the one who caused it. She messages me and says I put her through a lot. She also put me through a lot she broke my heart and left me in therapy for a year. She used to have problems at home and never tell me about it and now she says I was horrible. I know I wasn't the best I never ever gave up on her. I told we were both 16 years old she was practically my first proper relationship and she left a toxic one. She says she's over me but she's being like sarcastic and being in denial.

The problem is that we both still live with our parents and neither of us is comfortable with having a sleepover while parents are at home. So the only way we get to sleep together and be intimate is when my or his parents leave the house for a whole night. My parents are always at home and I have three siblings so the house is almost always full (he only spent the night once). But his family has an apartment in the city where they stay during the week (jobs and school) and then they have a house in the country where they go every weekend. When they are there the apartment is empty and if he stayed in the city I could come to stay the night. However he never stays in the city unless he has some urgent business he has to do and can't go to the country (this happens very rarely). So basically he never stays just so I could come spend the night. I would just like to be a good enough reason for him to stay in the city. I don't expect him to stay every week, but I do expect him to stay at least sometimes. However, me staying the night doesn't seem to be a good enough reason for him. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if my expectations are too high and I should just calm down. But it really makes me feel like I am not worth anything.

I did ask him to stay and his responses are always half anwers as in ""it doesn't work like that"", ""you know I can't stay"" and when I ask him to elaborate on that he just kind of says the same thing again with different words, and then I feel like I'm being annoying by asking him to stay.

Title basically. Im a guy(surprisingly..) and I really hate dating apps and what they have done to dating

Now that we have things like tinder insights and all it's clear that the difference when you are a guy or a girl is immense(it always was but a lot of people were denying it)

I started dating late(Im 24) because I did not want to hookup for my first time. Turns out at 23 I declined 3-4 sexfriend/hookups proposals already and then last year at 23 I gave up and did my first experiences with a sexfriend, which I do not regret.

Now I had sex with two women at 24. Thats pretty low in our time, but it was mostly volontarily for many years so I guess that's okay.

Im not a model but I think I look decent and I changed a lot recently by going to the gym.

I still hate dating apps,especially in the west or countries like mine(France) where trying to get a match is harder than finding a job.

At the same time most women find their dates by being on their couch at home so even if I'm trying to meet them directly(bar, parties etc) and I like the idea of being that guy that hits on them in real life(since so few of us can do it anymore, again especially in the west where its now difficult for several reasons) well it's not working much.

Im glad I had my first experiences last year(finally) and now that I am better with myself I really just wish I had someone to see, spend chill evenings with, discover new things etc.

Plus my career takes a lot of time and I just cannot commit to spend hours each day feeling desesperate trying to get matches.

For young men, dating is at its worst, I really don't know what to do if I don't like using apps. Its like you lose automatically.

On top of that people say my personality is amazing and I‚Äôm cool guy. 


Thirdly, I‚Äôm a really goal driven person and always aim for the top. I‚Äôm a scholarship student for getting the highest marks in electrical engineering. I work out regularly at the gym although recently I‚Äôve lost motivation as it just seems like whatever I do it won‚Äôt ever work out for me I will never get girls. I‚Äôm not the biggest guy but I did put on around 12kg and I‚Äôm 65kg at 5‚Äô10 which is an improvement although there‚Äôs still a lot of work to be done to get the muscle I want.  I also submitted an idea for a graphic novel for a publication company which got accepted but I now need over 5k to fund it for the illustrations which I don‚Äôt have the funds for but what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I‚Äôm on my purpose and have goals and everyone always tells me girls like a guy on their purpose a guy who has there own life outside the girl etc.  I‚Äôm even looking at making a song with one of my friends I want to go for a juice wrld style. 


Recently, there was this girl that I had the biggest crush on and  I really wanted to start dating her. It  looked like things were going great she would whisper on my ear that this song could describe us in the future (it was a romantic song) or make comments like I‚Äôm the only girl that can make you listen to juice wrld because what we have is special. And she wasn‚Äôt out my league, she had so many insecurities about herself that she didn‚Äôt even look at herself the way I looked at her she thought she was like a 6 and needed constant reassurance. She choose another guy over me despite saying all that stuff which hurt me so badly cuz she basically lead me on and I liked this girl a lot. I keep thinking what does this other guy have over me it seems like the  main Two reasons she choose him is because of his car and his ethnicity. Additionally, he‚Äôs kind of mean to her and ignores her at times which just makes me think girls chase after the bad guy. He even denied her a relationship and told her ignore me in a public setting because I don‚Äôt want people thinking we together yet she‚Äôs still stuck on him like glue. I obviously have cut her off. 


After all this I went to club with my friends to try and get over her. There was this fine girl and I got her snap but she never opened my message and left me on 5 weeks delivered. 

Afterwords I went back to the club and this girl asked for a dance and she was  grinding on me and kissing on me. But I didn‚Äôt find her attractive at all and it  was my first kiss ever. She wanted to sleep with me but I denied it got a few reasons. 

I realised I was only kissing on her to get   experience and to try and get over the girl I really liked. Additionally why does it have to be a girl that I have no interest in or find attractive  why can I NEVER GET THE GIRL I WANT was what I was thinking the whole time she was kissing me. Another reason I was even kissing her was because my dad just makes me feel like a loser because I can‚Äôt pull any girls. I denied to sleep with her and afterwords I try to go after I girl I found attractive and to no surprise I was shut down. 


What‚Äôs annoying is I just can‚Äôt get the girl that choose the other guy out my mind I was literally head over heels for her. I‚Äôm struggling to move on. Plus we spent a lot of time together even though we never went on a date. 


I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. I‚Äôm starting to think I‚Äôm ugly. You can dress the best but if you‚Äôre ugly you‚Äôre still ugly. You can be one of the funniest guys or be on you‚Äôre purpose but if you‚Äôre ugly you‚Äôre just ugly. I even set up a tinder, hinge and bumble for the last 2 weeks and I literally can‚Äôt get any matches my friends keep making lame jokes like you‚Äôre app is glitching anti no way you can get matches but I know the truth I‚Äôm just ugly. My friends are getting matches on a constant basis. 

I think I‚Äôve just accepted that I will never be able to pull girls and will probably die alone.

I met this girl in YouTube video shoot where we flirted a lot. I asked her out and she said yes very enthusiastic. (I'm 18 and she is 23)

We went out on three dates and we were both very interested. I'm not a texting person so she kept texting me and I replied because we had something good.

I'm a really touch freak and hate touching others or being touched (like 50 shades of gray) after the 3rd date I texted her and explained my problem to her and told her that I like to try this with her because I think she is worth it.

Next morning I wake up to her text saying she only sees me as a friend doesn't want us to end either because she has fun hanging out with me. (This is considering she touched me flirty and sexually a ridiculous amount on our date before laying on my shoulders and hugging my hand entire way to her house.)

Now she keeps texting me and talking to me like nothing happened; but I'm too proud to talk to her like normal, So I have been stone colding her.

But I do genuinely like her and don't know if I should let go of her considering she is interested too.

38,qsyhgd,1636799040,Love is some time mixed. .!!,"Let's Start
There are mostly people associated to, cat or dog type personality. Most often, boys are associated with dog type personality, and girls with cat type.

Though I am a boy I generally relate to cat type  personality. I have several female friends but I found them nothing more than just friends. I have friendzoned many. But here comes this girl in my class. She is intelligent and beautiful.  
Actually she is more than that, or I am exaggerating it, I don't know. She never talks to me Nor I. 

We talk very rarely,
We are now friends over 3 years, and just talk when we meet no call, no texting, bot constantly in touch.

But, when I first whatsapped her with a hi, she just replied hello and blocked me, after few months she said me good morning I replied the same and blocked her again. This thing is going on till now. 

Every time we met, we behaved very friendly, I don't think any reason to block her. Nor I can guess if she have any. When I think of her~ sometimes it gives me butterflies in my stomach, sometimes I get anxious. But it feels so good, as if you are in a different world.

Now I don't no what she thinks, this is where I am stuck. If any girls here, could she tell me how do girl see this from their POV and what should I do. I don't want to lose her.

Edit:
The cat and dog reference is to describe me don't mind it negatively

 I don't know, it just seemed me right, I have a pet I didn't have any word to describe me. Sorry

Edit: she hadn't blocked me once.
        One time she will sent me a message then 
        After a few days and will then block again.
        In past 3 years she blocked and unblocked
        Me nearly 45 times.

        I don't get it, either u hate me, or u love me

39,qsylg3,1636799533,Can make all parts of a relationship happen except love,"Hey, I'm 18m, in college, &amp; bisexual. My social life is fine, I meet and hang out with plenty of people, have friends and all, socializing isn't the issue. Sexual life is fine too. In terms of appearance I think I'm a solid 6, maybe 7 if I dress nice and can get my hair to look right haha. So physical attraction isn't the issue either. But I've legitimately never had a real relationship. Even tried dating apps for a time.

I had a boyfriend when I was 15 but it was online and we only met up once. That was cool but literally nothing has happened for me since. It's a bit frustrating-- most people my age have had at least one actual relationship by now. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I take care of myself and have future plans and all, and don't think I'm too boring. A few people have had feelings for me but how it always goes is we talk for a bit and try things out &amp; they lose interest after a few weeks. I try to keep things interesting too, I plan cool dates, try to text back quickly, etc. Do my best to be 100% respectful of people's boundaries as well and take it at their pace, and don't unload tons of emotional baggage on them or anything. But it has never gone anywhere and we always end up as friends, happens with both men and women. I've met some of my best friends this way but it's disheartening.

So I guess my question is, are there things that just make a person just not interesting to others romantically? Is there something I'm completely overlooking here? Or generally what else can I do to be more romantically appealing? Happy to answer questions too if that'd help :) Thanks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsylg3/can_make_all_parts_of_a_relationship_happen/

Guitar, poker, rock climbing, video games, chess. If you've gone to events for any of these, you'll quickly realise that the girl to guy ratio is in the gutter. Except for maybe rock climbing but even there it's maybe 70/30 at best especially in bouldering. So I haven't found any girls I like through hobbies.

I study theoretical physics which has some girls but it ain't great and other physics/math streams are a little bit better but still no one who overly tickles my fancy. When I try to become friends with girls who I may not want to be in a relationship with, they either like me, or assume I like them (and they don't like me) and hence they try avoid me to send a message I guess. The last sentence may seem a bit presumptuous but I feel that it is reasonable based on anecdotal experience. Maybe my standards are too high?

I've had a few runs where I've been seeing someone for a couple of months but it's just fizzled out.

I'm an outgoing, sociable person with a good circle of male and female friends. All in their own relationships btw.

I am msc qualified in a professional career where I'm paid an adequate market rate. Similar pay bracket to most of my peers so no worries there. Not wealthy as such, but I'm certainly not struggling for money.

I have a wide range of hobbies, I keep fit, and have one thing outside of work that I've worked hard at, and in which have reached a good level. I'm now working in a creative project in my spare time,i don't waste my evenings lying on the sofa watching TV (although I do have down time as well).

As an aside, I'm led to believe I'm very attractive, even though I don't see it myself. On two occasions this year, women have called me over from the other side of the street to tell me how handsome I am. I get a feeling this doesn't happen to many men, so it makes me believe I must be pretty good looking. But I would never let it go to my head. To add to this, I'm 6'1"", which to my understanding is pretty much the perfect height.

But on dating apps, I get almost no matches. And when I do go on a date, they almost never go anywhere. This is despite my social skills and my supposedly good physical appareance.

72,qt4792,1636819416,"I‚Äôm crying, I need advice please","I have been dating this lovely woman for about 3 months.  She is the kindest person I‚Äôve ever met, and we have a lot in common.  

I have been depressed my entire life (I‚Äôm 36/m now), and about 2 months ago I started taking Lexapro (an SSRI for depression) and I‚Äôm finally happy and confident for the first time in my life due to the medicine.

I could see myself marrying this woman in a few years, but am so curious what it is like to be single and dating as a happy/confident person, something I‚Äôve never got to experience.

Should I tell her that I need a break to deal with all these roller coaster of emotions as a single person so I can come back to her and be 100% committed?  Or do I just stay with her and always have this looming question?  If I do tell her, what is the best way to do this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qt4792/im_crying_i_need_advice_please/

74,qt4ft9,1636820117,Can this be worked on or too much of a red flag?,"M(28) have been dating my girlfriend (29) for a year now. 

When we are alone she is very thoughtful and loving. We have an excellent relationship. We laugh so much, cook together and I can tell she loves me deeply. We click so well.

The thing is she's addicted to make attention and pretty much indirectly admitted to me, she is always looking for male validation.

We walk around she locks eyes with every guy especially if he's average or good looking.

At a Halloween party she was trying extra hard to get my good looking friend to acknowledge her. She says she wasn't flirting just being ""the life of the party""..

She also always kind of disregards me in social events and definitely puts her self first. If we are going somewhere it's almost like she subtly doesn't want me looking good.

Thing is she's open to therapy for other reasons and doesn't really deny her attention seeking behaviour. But doesn't openly talk about it.

Is this worth working on? I know everyone here is more on the cynical side with relationships but nobody is perfect and maybe she can be more self aware and work on herself. 

Or do I just cut my loses and leave now, the red flags are to strong.

75,qt4i1p,1636820298,I think something‚Äôs wrong with me,"So when I meet a girl that I find interesting for one reason or the other, I am so consumed with the thought of getting with her. I put so much effort and planning but then the problem is that as soon as it actually works, my interest declines drastically to the point that I feel that I‚Äôm trapped because I put so much effort that it‚Äôd be weird to cut things off with the girl for no apparent reason. 

For context, I am a 25 year old male, I‚Äôve been in love before and had a girlfriend for 3 years. But before and after that it‚Äôs always like this. 

Can someone help because I don‚Äôt want to be this way, and the issue for me is that I just realise afterwards that I was more interested by the challenge and not by the girl herself. I genuinely think every time that the girl is amazing and that I actually like her but it always ends the same way. What‚Äôs worse is that I end up being on bad terms with the girl because of course I handle the situation badly since it would be so weird to abruptly say that I‚Äôm not interested anymore. 

I also feel like I‚Äôm a horrible person for doing that, but it is never on purpose. 

TLDR: I get with girls that I genuinely think I like and always discover afterwards that I was interested by the challenge and not the girl.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qt4i1p/i_think_somethings_wrong_with_me/

We went to a cat cafe, watched a movie and went shopping. Overall, I would say we had a great time and great chemistry flirting back and forth. To add on, flirting and physical contact was not one sided, as she initiated as well.

The next day, I decided to shoot my shot and tell her that I was interested in her. This apparently came as abit of a surprise for her as she did not expect me to have romantic feelings at all. She said she saw me as a good friend and nothing else. 

It hurts, but thankfully I expressed my intentions early on to avoid hurting myself more down the line and it seems like abit of a red flag with her flirting as much as she did without having any romantic interest.

88,qt5nw1,1636823812,How can I get this girl out of my head?,"I met this girl who lives in my apartment building several months ago. We both have puppies and ran into each other taking them out. Since then I‚Äôve ran into her a bunch of times but I never felt like I‚Äôve as myself around her. My confidence took a nose dive during the pandemic and me getting this dog was essentially a mechanism to help me get out more. Of course one of the first new people I meet is this drop dead gorgeous girl who I‚Äôm immediately attracted to. I had multiple chances to get her number but I never did. While I think I‚Äôm still going to try to set up a puppy play date with her whenever I happen to see her next, I really don‚Äôt know when I will see her next. I feel so inept for not having tried to exchange contact info with her because she‚Äôs extremely social and has made tons of friends with other dog owners around the building. I just feel kinda goofy for being an shy around her and not talking to her more in the chances I had.

I find myself completely obsessed with the thought of being with her. I barely know her, but considering my dating prospects are and have been very limited, I fell for this girl extremely easily. I‚Äôm struggling to understand whether my feelings are a true interest in her or just the idea of her. Probably a bit of both. I rarely dream, however the other night I had a dream that I asked her out and she said yes and we kissed and it was amazing. I just feel dumb for having what are essentially fantasies when in all likelihood she shares none of the same feelings since she doesn‚Äôt even know me!

How can I get her out of my head? Of course I‚Äôd still like to befriend her and see down the road if she‚Äôs interested, but who knows when‚Äôs it‚Äôs going to be I‚Äôll see her next, so I‚Äôd rather just not think about her and carry on until that happens.

She was stunned. I was surprised that she was stunned (I mean, I'm looking for a healthy relationship, not a walking talking instagram account.)
