Once Omicron is less of a threat, I (24M) plan on going to a gym or dojo for two specific reasons: To lose weight and get fit, and two, to get on the dating scene and hopefully enter a relationship. I know that might sound weird, but there's a reason for the second part. Essentially, I agree with Spike Speigel from the anime Cowboy Bepop when he said: *""I love the kind of woman who can kick my ass.""*

&amp;#x200B;

I find physical strength and capability attractive in partners. Strong, tough, muscles, is athletic/stocky/muscular, can fight. Basically, if a woman is strong and can hold her own, or wants to be strong, I'm attracted to that. Dainty, delicate, and weak, though? Nuh-uh. I'm not only looking for physical things when dating, though. Personality-wise, I find myself being attracted to tomboyish/masculine personalities, dominance/leadership, a willingness to fight, and male interests/hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

However, two people I've talked to here have said that my types (strong and/or tomboyish/masculine women) are rare, and I may want to open myself to more kinds of people when I try to get back on the dating scene. When I talked to those 2 Redditors, I confessed that my attraction to brawn in a woman was due to having a tomboyish ex-gf who could hold her own, loved horror movies and FPSes, knew a little about guns, and even killed a venomous snake that almost killed her father. One of the Redditors I talked to said she thinks I'm looking for someone to replace my ex, and I should ""get out of her shadow.""

I have been in two major relationships in my life - the first with a friend of mine from high school who I have been on and off with since junior year, and the second (lasted about a year) with a guy I met off of Tinder during one of my “off” periods with my high school ex. Needless to say, both of these relationships were unhealthy in their own ways; the first lacking any sort of commitment or stability and the second rife with mistrust due to the fact that my high school ex is in my friend group. In all honesty, I can’t even say for sure if I’ve ever been in love. As of about a month ago, I decided that if I want to be successful in dating I need to change my situation. So, even though my ex has always been a good friend of mine and remains in my friend group, I needed to cut him out of my life for good. I blocked him (after breaking things off in person) and left the friend group chat. I have hung out with some of my friends in this group since then and they are aware of the situation, and for now I only plan to hang with them as long as my ex is not there. 

Fast forward to today. I still have days where I miss my ex, mainly because we really were just such good friends and a lot of my life encompassed him, but also partly because I think I enjoy being with someone in general to stave off loneliness/boredom. I initially had the goal of remaining single for a while - I’ve been focusing on school, working out, and spending time doing activities I enjoy. Overall, I would say I’ve been happy. So then here comes the confusing part. I recently reconnected with a guy who, funnily enough, went to my middle school. I didn’t really know him back then and the only reason we found each other now is because I happened to see him at a local event in our hometown. I had always found him attractive, and the brief interaction was so lovely I ended up asking for his number through a friend of a friend later that week, even though it went directly against what I initially set out to do.

We’ve hung out four times now and at this point I just don’t know what to do.  From the beginning, I made it clear I don’t really know if I’m looking to be in a relationship and he was okay with that; I even told him about my high school ex still being in my current friend group and he didn’t appear phased, he just asked if I planned on going back to my ex again and after I said no he told me he wasn’t worried. I am assuming the reason for his quick-to-trust nature is that he has never been in a relationship, and hasn’t really had much experience with women in general from what he’s disclosed to me. It’s really shocking to me that he hasn’t pursued anyone seriously yet as I would say he is definitely conventionally attractive. He has even told me stories of girls blatantly trying to flirt with him in public, but he just wasn’t into them. And to top it off, he is probably one of the sweetest guys I’ve met - he’s just gone above and beyond to make me feel special in the short time we’ve been talking. Our dates have been fun and pretty easy going; we talk and laugh the whole time, although he does make me really nervous - moreso than I’ve ever been with a guy before. I find myself thinking about him randomly throughout the day. And I already feel so secure in knowing that he is interested in me, so there is no guessing. Our last date he kissed me goodbye and it left me feeling giddy. In short, I haven’t had a crush this bad on anyone in years, not even at the start of my second relationship.

But, even though I may feel this way right now, I also recognize that I may not be mentally ready to jump into another relationship, let alone with someone like him. I am afraid his naivety to dating is blinding him from seeing the baggage I would be bringing into a potential relationship. Part of me is also afraid I only feel this way as a coping mechanism to stay away from my ex. My past dating experience in general has sort of cultivated a mindset in which I really struggle to open up, both romantically and intimately. I am not really used to receiving or giving sweet things, and cutesy gestures, even in private, have always been hard for me, even if I picture these things in my “dream” relationship. Meanwhile, this guy took the time out of his day to leave a single rose outside my door on Valentine’s day while I was out drinking with my friends. Basically, I just don’t want to mess up this guy’s first dating experience as he seems like such a good, kind-hearted person. I honestly don’t feel good enough for him. I also don’t want to depend on being in a relationship to be happy, and I am afraid not taking some time to just be single will prevent me from growing as a person.  Finally, since I have cut things off with my longterm FWB so recently, I almost feel guilty pursuing anything with this new guy. Should I end things before it gets more serious? 

TLDR; I have really struggled in past relationships and I don’t know if I’m ready to be in a new one. I really like this guy, but he’s new to dating and I feel like I’m gonna ruin this if I pursue it further.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162617,public,self,I feel like I’m going to mess this up and I really really don’t want to,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t417lo/i_feel_like_im_going_to_mess_this_up_and_i_really/,no_ads,0,,,,

\*this is written from a straight male perspective

It’s  understood that our media shapes our cultural programs and individual  perceptions. This has been true since the days of oral tradition down to  our present day condition of being perpetually plugged in. The stories  we promote inform consumers of societal expectations and roles. As  consumers, we have the responsibility to recognize and call out  unhealthy patterns in the media which promote systemic ignorance, or  worse, justify persecution of marginalized groups.

Porn  in various forms has captivated our society for ages, but recently has  become broadly distributed and easily accessible. As a form of media,  porn permeates almost all of our platforms in some shade or another. A  quick survey reveals how mainstream these provocative visuals have  become in recent generations. (Of course, not all porn is graphic in  nature, but men’s brains are wired to respond quickly and powerfully to  visual stimuli, so this angle gives porn producers who target men the  best return on their investment. And make no mistake, the market for  porn is mostly supported by men.) Along the spectrum of porn in our  media, we see sexually attractive people employed to sell fashion,  alcohol, tourism, cars and electronics. We often see women cast in  movies, games and shows who fit roles that appeal to common male  fantasies, no doubt reinforcing beliefs in youth, men, and women who  engage with the content.

Porn as a  label is problematic because it’s not clearly defined. Sexuality and  the human body in its nude form should be celebrated, not made taboo. In  the same breath as I say this, most people would probably agree that  porn doesn’t often fit the bill of art. While tasteful photography or  paintings can elicit a deeply emotional response, porn is packaged to  trigger a mechanical response. If Michelangelo’s David is a five course  meal, porn is junk food. Mostly, porn isn’t consumed mindfully, it’s  consumed habitually and unconsciously.

What  would healthy porn consumption look like? I would expect the answer is  different to each person. In the scope of this piece, I won’t explore  this question, because I think that it’s too personal to attempt. A  better question is, what are the consequences of unhealthy porn  consumption? The problems of toxic masculinity, gender discrimination,  and violence towards women are clearly demonstrated to be complex in  their causes. I will be making the case that in these significant  challenges we face, porn plays a role.

Our  society at large has become desensitized by porn. The spectrum is  expanding through the base as it normalizes the pervasiveness soft-porn,  while on the high end of the spectrum, products created for private  consumption benefit immensely from this shift in acceptance.

Porn  created explicitly for this purpose - mostly used by men - is  psychologically damaging for the majority of those who view it. From my  experience I know this is true, and I suspect it’s true for most.

What  makes porn so damaging is that it portrays women universally as props  for sexual gratification. This is a fundamental piece of the story,  regardless of any other dressing. In this lie men are not naive \~ they  understand this is a product of fantasy and serves its purpose as  entertainment, not in being an accurate representation of reality. But  it doesn’t matter. Reinforcing the harmful stereotypes common to porn  doesn’t require this connection. Porn, especially being consumed  repetitively, works on the subconscious level. A child will understand  that superheroes aren’t real, but that doesn’t stop them from modeling  comic book characters in constructing values of right and wrong. Men who  watch porn will inevitably find themselves in situations where they  project these narratives onto people in their lives. Sometimes this will  happen consciously, and often, I believe it happens without them ever  realizing it.

Through reinforcing  popular male fantasies, porn trains men to believe they are entitled to  sex. To believe sex should come to them easily and when they want it. To  believe sex is transactional. To believe sex is dominated by masculine  principles. To believe sex is linear and objective driven. In  perpetuating these ideas about sex on both a conscious and unconscious  level, porn diminishes mens’ awareness of important concepts relating to  consent, communication, emotional connection and mutual creation.

Turning  towards my own experience, my sex education through porn is an example  of a worst case scenario which is probably very common to young men.  Both my family and my outside education systems were reticent to speak  on the topic of sex. So what I did learn about sex initially, I learned  from peers (who were usually misinformed) or from porn. My parents never  said much about porn except that it was to be avoided. I vaguely  understood it to be addictive and harmful. But as a kid who desperately  craved information, and beyond that, safe sexual experiences, porn was a  life line. Unfortunately, the themes and cliches of porn were then  given to form the baseline of my understanding of sexual relations.

Partly  due to this, as well as the lack of any meaningful conversation, I  didn’t fully appreciate a concept as simple as consent until I was well  into my twenties. I became unsatisfied with my penis size. I started to  believe, through conditioning by my peers and the media, that the  success of a sexual encounter was measured through endurance and  orgasms. I still held within me ideals that contradicted what I was  being taught through porn, but ultimately the damaging beliefs were  still able to take root.

At some  point in high school I was able to find the experience I was craving  outside of porn. Although my concept of relationships was not well  developed I was given a chance with a girl. At the time I saw the  relationship as a vehicle for sex, which I was using to distract myself  from the many emotions we experience as teenagers. While there was some  emotional processing that happened in the relationship, I don’t think it  ever occurred to me that emotional support could be the primary  function of two people who were romantically attracted to each other. I  did believe that now, being in a relationship, I didn’t need porn any  more. I could get my needs met without porn, and porn felt akin to  cheating, albeit to a lesser degree. This became a line in the sand for  me, which I felt validated my porn consumption as being somehow  healthier \~ I was only using it to get by when I was single. I would  continue this practice pretty much until I was 30.

Before  30 I made attempts to quit using porn. I think porn is easy to classify  as an addiction, but even while acknowledging this, most regular users  don’t see a strong enough correlation with the side effects to feel  truly motivated. The vast majority of consumers will still be able to  function in society - perhaps just less optimally in subtle, yet  compounding ways.

By the time I  was 30 I could no longer ignore how irresponsible it was to continue  using porn. At this time it started to dawn on me that as long as I was  only using porn when I was single, any woman who entered into a  relationship with me would be unwittingly expected to fill this porn  slot I had created in my own mind. In a sense, as long as I continued to  consume porn, I would continue to condition myself to see women as a  means of sexual gratification.

I  don’t believe this is healthy. Sexual gratification should never be  accomplished through the lens of objectification. I realized, finally,  that even if I wasn’t able to see immediate changes, I must give up my  relationship to porn if I was intent on having healthier relationships  with women. And this conviction was enough to give me the strength to  create much needed space between me and the addiction.

What  I began to notice over time was that once I broke the addiction to  porn, in a sense I also broke the addiction to sex itself. In no way did  that mean I stopped wanting to have sexual experiences, but now I could  observe and direct my sexuality better than before. I found it became  easier to prioritize relationships over sex. I saw the frequency of  intrusive sexual thoughts begin to decline, and when they were observed,  I didn’t attach to them.

I  understand that the last year and a half isn’t enough to completely  erase the effects of my porn consumption. The neural networks created  will never be fully erased, simply recede into the background over time.  But I know that I’ve come far enough now to never look back, and I’m  excited to explore the new space that I’ve created in my life for sex  outside of porn.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162618,public,nsfw,Seeing sex differently after distancing myself from porn (long post),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t41ck0/seeing_sex_differently_after_distancing_myself/,no_ads,0,,,,

I will attempt to convey the same meanings. 

So in the past two weeks ive had 2 different women lose their shit being angry at me. Both are women who have expressed interest in me and a desire to date and I told both im not looking in a serious relationship atm. 

Girl 1 Anna, anna and I hooked up a few times. I told her repeatedly Im not wanting to date her. I was upfront and direct. I actually started distancing myself and turned down offers to hook up because she kept getting clingy. Recently she complained that i dont care, that it hurts when she seems me out with other girls at the club we both frequent. She said she didnt want to be friends anymore, i said sorry to hear but i respect your desision, she immediately changed her mind. And now i feel stuck with her.

Girl 2 Maya. I met Maya at the club as well, we clicked but im not really into her for a serious relationship. I told her this, in detail. She seemed disapointed but still wanted to hook up. In the meantime she started hooking up with a guy kevin. I liked kevin at first but the more i learn about him the less i like him. Things shes told me, plus my experiences with him. He's super into her and he doesnt like me. So fastforward, I messaged a friend of Maya's, and Maya lost her shit. I get long rants that im playing her and her friend and that its wrong of me to not like kevin. Seriously she was angry that i dont want to be friends with kevin.

Tbh i know i probably ahouldve just stopped chatting with both girls after we found out we wanted different things. But i instead tried to be a friend. Its an instinct that's bitten me in the ass time and time again. I stayed in my last ltr way too long because i felt it my job to be the nice guy and try and fix everything. 

I feel that im causing more grief than relief. My instinct is if everybody is upfront and honest there should be no hard feelings. But ultimately it seems that despite me trying to be clear from the start im just giving false hope.

The other issue is about being honest about intentions. Sometimes people will lie and lead you to think they're interested in more when they really aren't. And most of the time, they don't know what they want and or they're fickle. 

It's hard to trust anybody these days with the opportunity to talk to other people is at our fingertips.

She texts me a couple of hours later saying she thought I was super cute.

She tells me she can’t because she has to work early the next day. I respond with “laaaame” and she blocks me.

Here’s verbatim how the conversation went:

Her: [You’re] super cute :)

Me: I know the vibes when I see them 😊

Her: haha I knew the feelings were mutual ☺️
how was the breakfast lol

Me: Oh shiiit we both were giving off the vibes 😂; the breakfast was amazing they should keep that combo around — gives you a little bit of everythang.

Her: no fr I agree. I was a fan of [blank] before I worked here lol 😂 

Me: Are you free tonight? I was feeling like getting out again and getting some drinks. It would be fun to have your company as well.

Her: i’m not actually i work tomorrow :(
early in the am

Me: Laaaame

*blocked*



I really wasn’t trying to be an asshole by saying  laaaaame. I meant it playfully. Can you see why I don’t like texting? 😂 It can be easy to have misunderstandings.

But maybe there’s something I’m missing? I’ve thought of a few reasons why she may have to decided to block me:

1. I asked her out too quickly

2. She got offended by me saying laaaame. 

3. Somehow our text exchange my have given her the impression that we wouldn’t be compatible… Maybe she is more of a homebody and got the impression that I am some party animal (I’m far from it). 



but maybe I’m just clueless when it comes to human interaction. I’m isolated from humanity most of the time with my job so maybe I really am becoming even more inept with handling social situations.

I don’t know exactly how it happened or when. But before I knew it I found myself thinking about him extensively and wanting to share thing and talk to him more than often. I would allow myself these thought thinking that he looked extra handsome. And even laughing by myself at something he has said house prior while I’m the comfort of my own home. I when I realized that I was jealous of him talking or giving his attention to another female coworker of ours I knew I slipped up. 
But could you blame me? 
The guy is an absolute stud, he has this reserved and serious nature about him that gives a lot of people the wrong idea. Like he might be stuck up or snobby. He barely associates when anyone at work. But when you get to know him he’s got a heart of gold. He’s hilarious and extra smart. He’s relaxed and playful. 

If I’m honest I was very surprised when he first approached me at work. He’s very well know to have had one friend at work before they quit. He’s a very handsome guy in a dark rugged sort of way. So no one really tries to talk to him. And the guys that have tried her shut down because of how short he is with everyone. He stood out to be because he was well dressed all the time. And he just oozed confidence to me. I had known of his experience but I personally did not know the guy. Nor was I really interested in getting to know him or get his attention. And even if I had it just looked on the surface like we had nothing in common. So he didn’t cross my mind twice. A year and a half into the job I remember I was walking through the cafeteria to get to break room and leave when I get stopped by someone calling my attention. When I turn around I see the guy, I was curious as to what he had to say but most of all surprised he was even speaking to me. He had cooly complimented me on my outfit and said that he always noticed how well dressed I was and that he appreciated it. I was again surprised because that wasn’t something he did at all but I accepted his compliment and went to the break room not giving it another thought. A couple of days go by and mind you, up to this point I hadn’t worked in close proximity to him at all. There are sections at work and I was always assigned to a specific place. So I was surprised to see him working with me this day especially because he was always assigned to work on the opposite side of the building with one of my guy best friend. But I didn’t think much of it and went on about my shift. I thought something was off though because I kept catching him straight up looking at me numerous times. And he’d then try to play it off. It got so strange that I thought I might look funny or something. For some context, in this area we worked in we were the only two around. I honestly didn’t think he remembered me and if he did I didn’t think he was interested in befriending me either. By the time the shift ended I started walking towards the door when I see that he starts walking with me. And just like that he asked for my name, I showed him my badge and then I asked him his. We made small casual conversation before we parted and I went my usual way to the lockers. 
Soon after that he sort of just started working in my area all the time. And we slowly got to know each other and become good friends. We would talk all the time and I honestly loved going to work to just make fun of him and talk and for once I didn’t mind my job. I would look forward to seeing him. He had told me he was married and I thought that was great. I wasn’t sad or mad over it and he was just a work friend so there really wasn’t anything to think about there. I just knew that he was a good friend and that I appreciated him. Turns out we had loads in common, and in a way he became a therapist for me and I became a source of entertainment for him as he’s put it. I would confide in him about my boy problems and so on. But he’d always say and sneak things into our conversations that would stand out to me a lot. He’d call me attractive and how a guy to played me was stupid for that. Because I was the full package, or whatever that meant. We’d talk about celebrity crushes and somehow he’d shift the conversation to our personal tastes in people. What out types were. And he’d go on to describe his type. Saying the he loved latinas with black hair who take care of themselves as are super feminine. I’m the only black haired Latina at work btw. I thought how nice this white man is married to a beautiful Latina then. So when I pointed that out he corrected me and said that his wife was white. 

Anyway he’s say things like that. And he loved talking about how we first met and our first impressions of each other. He said that I always made him nervous and that he didn’t know why. That I stood out to him and he’d look forward to whatever outfit I’d wear to work. He said that he thought I was very beautiful and that he noticed how nice I was to everyone and how I wasn’t stuck up. But he had just always felt like maybe I wouldn’t care to talk to him. I was flabbergasted at all of this. Very flattered as well, but I’d make sure to check myself. 
He said that he’d noticed me looking at him and how we’d share glances at each other so that’s what encouraged him to try and befriend me. The whole glancing at each other was news toe but I didn’t comment on it. I was just happy for his friendship.
And slowly thought the year we became close friends. We bonded over movies and Starwars and everything in between.
Before I knew it I liked him. I like him. 
I won’t act on anything though. I couldn’t disrespect him or his wife like that. I wouldn’t ever be that person. 
But a selfish part of me can’t help but think that perhaps in another life if he hadn’t married so quickly we could’ve been good. Because being with him everything is so natural. I never get bored of him and I have a lot of admiration and love for him. 
But I know that no amount of wishing will change that. So I’m not even going to further entertain the idea. 
I’ve been keeping my distance for a bit and going out on a lot of dates to get rid of this feeling. I know I won’t act on my desires.

I am 19 and I have always had a weird attraction to men with Alopecia (more specifically Alopecia Universalis). If you need a mental image of what I am talking about: think NoHo Hank from Barry or Victor Zsasz from Gotham (both played by the same actor). I have dated men who do not have Alopecia before, this is not some sort of weird dealbreaker because hair is not the only thing I care about, but now that I am single and have had some time to work on myself in-between relationships I would like to start dating again. And... well, I would like to possibly date some men with Alopecia. I however have run into a few issues with this. 

  
First off I do not want to be the weird person who fetishizes something someone else may be insecure about. I do not want to go too much into this but I suffer from a form of hair loss myself, I know how terrible it can be for your self-esteem. As I said hair is not the only thing I care about. I am also looking for somebody I can nerd the fuck out with and enjoy my hobbies with. Like, do actual functional relationship stuff. However, I tend to find men with Alopecia more physically attractive so I wanted to try to like pursue that. 

  
Secondly, I do not really know how to seek out these men. Like there is no Alopecia dating sites I know of and I never come across them on dating apps like hinge. I do not feel comfortable just approaching random men I see on the street because, you know, the reason above (that and because just going up to some random dude is creepy in general). That and there are very few forums out there just for dating with alopecia or anything similar. 

  
Thirdly, I do not even know if this is something I should pursue given the above reasons. This is probably something extremely niche and it is not very likely I would actually land a dude that fits this weirdly specific preference I have because of how niche it is. That and I feel bad for having it since its based on something that cannot really be changed and is a source of shame for many people.   
I am not really sure what to do going forward. I was planning on just not doing anything about it and just seeing where the magic of hinge takes me. However, before I completely abandon going out of my way to pursue this I figured I would take my problem to Reddit since many of you seem to give good advice.   
Should I even try to pursue this? Do I just leave this be and not do anything? Are there ways to connect with people if this is something I should pursue?

5.

And that's just the points of an early state of a relationship,there is way more if it gets serious...

I'm unsure if I find a person that's so patient about those things,especially at my age,plus I'm not able to work at the moment through my mental health,I'm financially really restricted through this,I don't got plans of ever having kids or getting married,move in together ect,because I know it would be hard to get out of these situation and I don' see myself as a housewife or mother ever.

First of all, I would like to explain the difference between a good guy and a nice guy

( I might use 'guy' and 'person'  synonymously )

Being  a nice guy comes with expectations that others will do nice things back  to you. Nice guys are susceptible to getting burned emotionally very  easily if others do not meet their expectations.

Being  the good guy comes with no expectations of others. Literally none. And  even if you have expectations internally but the outer side of you  pretends to be a good guy then you are not one and you will get  massively burned. Good guys never get burned emotionally.

So  here lies the problem. Good guys suppress their real internal emotions  very hard which makes them come off as unreal or robotic sometimes. Even  through good guys have huge amounts of mental strength to stay  charismatic and positive, it doesn't come off as relatable much these  days. Depression is slowly becoming a big factor in intimate attraction  as more and more people are getting depressed due to current world  events which is something I feel is responsible for that. Ultimately  good guys should show just a bit of emotions but not so much that it  takes them over no matter what other people might do to break their  emotional armor. There is a perfect equilibrium and good guys should try  to achieve it if they want to find their other half.  
Another problem  is that there are more people that would take advantage of good people  then would not which makes it harder to stay as a good person or good  guy. Also often times, we do not show enough appreciation to the good  guys or good people in our lives that are there for us. We should always  remember that they might not be around forever. So y'all should get to  it if you have that one person.

You  also should not be a good guy if you think like if you give to the  universe, the universe will give back to you. You should be good from  the heart, to help other and be there for them because you want to. The  thought of someone out there appreciating your kind gesture should be  reward enough for you.

Another  thing that bothers me is the false notion that other people will be  magnatically attracted to the good guy. This is totally false and does  not work. Sure you can uplift people emotionally by being ungodly  positve but there will be no attraction at all so you should keep your  expectations non existent if you are a good guy when it comes to dating.  I have tried this and this did not work for me. I would love to see  someone prove me wrong.

Being a  good guy works in the long run though. It takes time for word to spread  to that special someone you are fated to be with. You become a legend in  their eyes while also uplifting yourself.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162613,public,self,Why being the good guy is not very effective for dating in the short run,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t43vlm/why_being_the_good_guy_is_not_very_effective_for/,no_ads,0,,,,

I've been talking to a girl for a few weeks now, and we're meant to be having our third date tonight. Seem to be getting on super well and there's great physical chemistry. I've been a bit worried because I know on her profile, it said a non negotiable was that you loved animals and we've also spoken about it in our chats too. I did say I also loved animals, which I do.   


The reason I'm worried is that when we were speaking about hobbies, I never mentioned that I have in the past gone hunting for deer, in which I then harvest the meat to eat and share with others, as I feel it's a natural and clean way of eating meat. It's not just a case of doing it purely for blood sport. I feel like it's something I should share with her tonight, but I'm just having lots of different anxieties. Firstly, I'm worried it's come across that I've hidden it from her, though my reason for not initially sharing is I felt it was quite a heavy thing to say on a first date, or lied about not sharing it in my hobbies, when technically it's not something I do super often. I'm also of course scared it'll make her lose interest in me but it has to be revealed, though she's a meat eater herself (though I get it's a sensitive topic and you can be a meat eater whilst not liking hunting). I have zero intentions of antagonising her for it if she does say she doesn't like it at all.  


I think it's right to reveal this about myself if I we want to see if this may work longer term, but I don't know if it's too much, too soon etc. I'd love some advice because I feel the longer I wait, the longer it looks like I'm hiding it.

It's so funny how we as humans get our signals mixed up, so many times. 
This is especially true now with texting, the best form of miscommunication as far as I am concerned.
Somehow we just can't come out and ask what is going on. Are we that afraid of the answers? Who knows but we do it all the time and sometimes we miss the opportunity for something great because of it.

Of course I speak from experience here as I always do and realized this lately. 10 years ago while I was home on vacation, I caught up with an old friend and we were vibing. We went out a few times and I have to tell you it was nice, there was definitely chemistry there between us. We end up one night going to play pool and an old boyfriend of mine shows up and acts like we are still together. Basically he cock blocks the whole vibe thing going on. Before I knew it, this other person was gone. 

I was upset that I didn't get a chance to explain the situation, that me and this guy were definitely not together and would never be again. But I wasn't sure he was feeling what I was feeling at the time and I was too afraid to ask him. But somehow that never happened and poof! 10 years goes by without a word. 

Fast forward and we meet again and yes, the vibe is still there,even after 10 years. We have both been through relationships and here we are again, both single.
When we started speaking of our last meeting, we realized that we were both having feelings back then and we both have know idea why we never spoke about it afterwards.

How did we let 10 years go by when it could have been something beautiful? 
We as humans do this all the time, petty arguments, the tone of your voice sets someone off, not being able to say what you really feel. There are many reasons we stay quiet or stay mad at others but we have to realize that we may never have the chance to get it right. If covid taught us anything, it's that life is too short, we must say the things we feel, make the wrongs right, and apologize for things we may have said or did, that hurt others.
We need to learn to communicate and stop getting blind sided by mixed signals.

So today my friends, you are probably asking if this will go anywhere? I don't know but I do know that we have learned to be honest about our feelings.
I've learned that I never want to miss an opportunity like this again because I didn't speak up.
Whether it works out or not,  at least we put it all out there on the table, there are no mixed signals and we will let fate take it from there.

I have a hard rule against dating coworkers. And I’m not interested in any of my male friends. 

I just find it easier on dating apps? In a way is also sort of freeing as well. Now whenever I go out with my friends to bars or parties I just enjoy my time with them. If I go out and sit in a coffee shop, or go play sports, I just do my thing. I don’t really spend time chatting with random guys anymore. Every time a guy comes up to me flirting or asking me out I automatically just politely decline. Then when I’m in the right mindset, I just go on the apps, take my time and get a date. It’s less stressful for me. 

But then someone brought up a point that I’m not being fair. I should be more open and at least seriously consider the guy before thoughtlessly rejecting him because it’s not like I’m taken or not dating.

In the months of october, november and december I lived a really bad situation, in which basically I fell in love with a girl who had a boyfriend since 4 years, she was starting appreciating me too (we hanged out 3 times a week for 2 months + we were chatting A LOT every day) but then she decided her boyfriend over me, saying that since she spent 4 years with him she couldn't give up that, his family and the many friends they have in common.

After her decision I had a really terrible mental health, like I felt unable of doing the majority of my things (uni stuff, hanging out with friends, everything was not making me happy). We had certain weeks in which even as a friend she was great, I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and she would be always or nearly always pick up her phone and talk one hour or more with me to try to help me and make me feel better, saying nice things and stuff like that... then  I basically ruined that, because I knew I needed a no-contact rule in order to move on from her and at the same time we were acting as if nothing happened, for example messaging everyday a lot or hanging out, but at the same time my mental health was bad so I was unable of making a lot of jokes (it was the thing she appreciated more about me), caring too much about her (at the time she complained with me that I didn't ask too much about her vacation with her boyfriend or in general I wasn't asking much about her life because I was afraid of hearing things about her bf). Moreover, many times I had really serious breakdowns and I was venting to her often (basically every 3/4 days) and when she was unavailable for me I complained to her and yeah, idk, everything was so fucked up, like I vented to her to complain about her and her decision in a loop, because I really couldn't accept that (and maybe still cannot accept that, idk). (I know, I can be toxic sometimes).

My ""friendship"" with her finished with two key episodes:

\- We hanged out in person and I was feeling bad due to my mental health and she didn't appreciate hanging out with me because of this, she made a joke (a terrible one) because basically I had to hold her cap for a sec, I told her ""yeah next time you should leave the tip"" and she said ""yeah, 3 cents like your value"". So I was obviously offended by this and she told me ""oh that's my style of talking with friends, you are too sensible, bla bla"".

\- The last time I messaged her seeking for help I told her a lot of things and she just replied ""I am sorry to hear that"" without even trying to help somehow. This made me feel even worse and I told her that and she told me that she didn't wanted to tell me nice things to help because ""that's not what I do with friends"". Then after this moment I sent her a really really long message saying that these 2 thigns (these two last bullet points) and some things she did in the past for me were really wrong and lacking respect for me, so the best thing for me was blocking her (I know it may sound immature, but even if I didn't message her on some days, she always messaged me on a daily basis, so I was scared of her doing that again as nothing happened), and I stopped talking to her for more or less a month.

I say more or less my month, because on the day of my birthday (16 febr) I messaged her on linkedin, just to know how she was feeling (maybe the fact that on the day of my birthday I wanted to know her wellbeing status so much is a sign of my codependency), she said that she was fine and hoping that I was fine too, that she was on a vacation with her bf and that it was nice me messaging her.

After that moment I didn't write her again (also because didn't know what to say / I am scared that she hates me)... until yesterday, basically yesterday I had a news (terrible one) who hit me like a train: me, her and other 2 people were randomly selected at uni for a teamwork in a subject. This teamwork means that for more or less 1 month and half / two months me and her have to meet with the group and work together, AND I FUCKING HATE THIS. I don't want to say that I forgot her, because wouldn't be true, but I was working on my issues and with time the thoughts about her and the guilty for everything that happened was fading, now it feels like everything is back to these months again, except for the fact that the mood between us is way worse. 

I don't know why yesterday I did so (a part of me thinks that I did so just because I wanted to be clear that I want peace with her and not any conflict, since uni stuff is important for me) but basically yesterday I messaged her on whatsapp, we both sarcastically said that we were lucky being in teamwork together and basically we both said it was a shitty day. I said to her that we had the power to make that day a good one and translate that into an opportunity of peace and she said ""yeah you are right and also the teamwork will end anyway one day"" (this last part made me feel like she was thinking ""I just want this period to end"". Then basically the conversation on whatsapp ended, I went to a pizza place with some female classmates and I was in a table with 5 girls and myself the only male there. 

One of the girls made an instagram story in which I was there, and then the girl main character of the story (the one that was appreciating me and had a boyfriend and bla bla) messaged me on whatsapp later in the evening saying ""did you like the pizza?"" This message made me really panick even more because I perceived that as something aggressive towards myself, as if she has seen that I was with other girls / enjoying an evening and she felt jealous for this (in the past even if we weren't in a relationship she didn't like when I was hanging out with people which were not her, as if she wanted me only for herself, always).

Anyway, I replied to her message in a normal way, saying that the pizza wasn't the best but the company was great (maybe somehow saying this ""the company was great"" was something toxic also from my side? like me understanding that she was jealous and trying to make her feel even more angry towards me? idk). Then, after my message she didn't continue the conversation / replied at all, something that I HATE, because why would you message me to not make a conversation? I think this made it even clearer that she was angry during that evening.

This morning I woke up disappointed by the absence of any answer from her, and I thought about following her on instagram (we stopped following each other the moment I blocked her on whatsapp). I don't know why I wanted to follow her, I wanted to mute her instantly afterwards so maybe I only wanted to do that to continue this serious of subconscious mind games? To make her feel bad somehow? I don't know. Anyway, after one hour and half she didn't accept or refused my instagram request, I know her and I know that in this timespan she has for sure seen her phone, so basically I withdrawn my instagram following request and now I am here writing this post.

I am really scared of how my life will look like if everything continues like this, I am scared of her playing mind games in our teamwork or just the idea of seeing her makes me feel bad. I always wanted back in the days her to say something like ""you are not at fault for what happened between us"", ""you are not a bad person"", ""I don't hate you"" and stuff like this, instead there is this air of both of us that somehow search for each other but with that toxic attitude that really kills me.

I posted about this one relationship that I had on this subreddit a while ago, and there is more to that story that I want to share about... But I couldn't fit the whole story into one post. 

Please feel free to share your opinions about it. 

EDIT:

After that final conversation that we had, and right when I finally came to a conclusion that this was it, we had our final conversation and both of us were very clear about our decisions, and were aware that the long distance situation would not work and all, and accepted that our story was over...  Because I knew that we both knew what we wanted in a relationship and that would basically not work in our circumstances , I knew that the only thing left to do was letting go.


He texted me, and we started talking again, right when I finally lost my hope and was ready to let go... He acted like any of our past conflicts did not really happen and everything was just perfect. He would just ask me to send him a selfie and I would just send him one, and he would act like that made him the happiest man alive. (There was still this long distance situation) And was so ready and willing to be in a long distance relationship with me...


But we generally barely had time to talk to one another because of his studies and constant exams in the med school. We would just talk once or twice in a month and he would tell me that whenever he thought about me, he would start missing me and this longing feeling would be too much to bare so he would decide not to text me. And also he still had no time between school and home anyways...


After a while, I kinda happened to send him a half nude picture of mine (without my face and anything of course) and after that day, when it was  the New Years Eve, he texted me at midnight. And we started talking. We were both drunk, and with the relief of talking about the sexuality matters with me before, he started talking about how much he desired me at that very moment. And told me some other things as well. (You would guess what they are, so I decide not to mention them :D) And told me that he wished that we could be together at that moment and all... He told me that he loved me so much and he only wanted to be with me and no one else. He constantly told me that he only wanted me and being just myself would be enough to turn him on. Just a thought would be as well. He told me that he was only getting turned on by me and nothing else. Nothing else would work and everything else would feel useless. He told me that even the most effectful porn would not be as effective as my face. And everything about me would just turn him on, he said. I told him that I did not believe any of the things that he said and I surely did not believe that he loved me, because if he did, he would text me more and we would talk more. And he only wanted my body, I said. I told him that he would just leave me after we had sex and blame the long distance for it, or he would just leave me when he found someone else. And I was just surprised that his mind changed so fast. So, I told him that after we experienced some things together, he would just use the same old excuses to leave me in the future. He refused all of my accusations and had excuses for them all. He told me that he could find someone else but he did not want anyone else in the first place and he just excused his busy schedule at school on school and all about us not talking enough... After hours of conversation, I was finally ready to believe all the things that he told me, because of how convincing they were. But I still didn't send him anything and all.


After that day, he told me about a dream of his, that he saw me in his dream again, but this time, he was desperately looking for me but couldn't find me anywhere etc. It was a sad dream. After that, we had a few normal conversations like the ones we had before and all. And long story short, after a couple of days, we did sexting. He saw everything and I saw his... It was the first time that we both sent someone nudes. The sexting was a little awkward because how little we knew how that worked and he couldn't manage to turn me on. Anyways... 


After that day, his exam week was right around the corner again and I just let him study. We barely talked and sometimes I would just tease him or just text him and would just get no or late answers and would just let it go etc. I felt weird and empty. I don't know if that was because of my need for  attention or love. (I have anxious preoccupied attachment style) Anyways, I think he just bore him a bit. I did stupid things with a lack of attention and a need of talk. And even one time, I got so drunk and constantly showered him with voice messages even if he told me that he had an exam and needed to study. I don't know where my mind was, I guess it was the tequila that made me do all of that. So, in the end, he just blocked me on Whatsapp and I continued to send him annoying and meaningless messages on Instagram. So he just left them all on seen in the end and all... After that, I apologized to him about my stupid actions and he didn't say anything and just removed my block on Whatsapp. After that, I just acted a little strange from time to time with a lack of love again, I guess.. And that made him sick of me (?)


 Anyways, after a while, right when he would have a 15 days of break from school and we could finally meet up, I texted him asking what it was that was going on. And he just talked normally for a bit and... After a while, the conversation just came to a point that he told me that the relationship wasn't working (I doubt that there was one in the first place) and we were just too different. Our likes, dislikes, the music that we listened, our thoughts, our characters, our sense of humor and the way that we handled situations... We were just incompatible. And it wasn't just that and the way I made him block me when he was studying and my attitudes and all. He told me that he realized this wasn't what he was looking for in a relationship after all. And told me that he didn't know how much of it would be related to the long distance. I told him that he was giving an  account of a 4 years long length relationship in one night, and I explained the reasons behind my attitudes. He told me that we were incompatible and I refused to blame that because of our deep conversations in all these years and all, and even asked him if I was the one remembering it wrong. He told me that it was okay being friends anyways. And I asked him how that was any different from friendship. I told him that you would just add sexuality into friendship and there would be a relationship. We would just have to equalize them. He told me that he did not think that it was that simple and whenever I got sad, angry, happy, drunk... Basically anytime my self-control would decrease, the relationship's maturity level would fall into a level that he just didn't want in the relationship that he was looking for. I told him that I was sorry, and I could fix those problems and just be more careful and all and he told me that these things weren't things that should have been fixed or changed in the first place. And I told him how I barely had any experience in relationships and all and it would be normal for me to do a couple of mistakes and all... He told me that it would be better for me to experience this maturity process with a less mature person, than him losing his respect for him throughout the relationship, without his will. I told him that I forgave him when he made a couple of mistakes and mentioned that he too made some mistakes and apologized so I didn't really see relationships as being thrown in the sink with the first shake and all and he told me that he didn't see those as basic mistakes or conflicts and see those as ""a poor structure"". I asked him why he made a big conclusion right when we could finally see each other, and told him that if he wouldn't talk to me about these things, I wouldn't understand my mistake that easily and would not do the same mistake if I had my lesson learned. And he told me that he didn't want a fragile curio that he put together and shaped. And I told him that we could talk about this face to face and that way he would be more certain of the decision that he made. And told him that he told me that he matured, and changed, and he is 21, so how could he possibly let go of me that easily? He told me that I was still acting like these were some things that grew in time, when it was just broken in the start to begin with. And he told me that he realized that wasn't the relationship that he was looking for, just like going to a Rock concert and realizing you don't like loud music. And he wouldn't want to ask me to change any other way. Because it wouldn't be ""me"" anymore.

I told him that in relationships, people sit down, and discuss, communicate... And asked him if we hadn'thadn't we wasted 6-7 months because of lack of communication. I told him that I wasn't even the same person as I was one year ago, and I told him that I experience things, I learn and I grow... And wouldn't I be more careful now that he mentioned this all and be more understanding? And he told me that we weren't compatible to be in a relationship to begin with, and after all, the difficulty of the long distance wasn't going anywhere either and that was a big problem in the first place. And he told me that he didn't want his girlfriend to be miles away and get away with only a couple of days in months. I told him that I wouldn't want that either but reminded him that how he mentioned that ""the distance would not take away the longing feeling"" and how he told me that he only wanted me. So, what would it change of us not being together in a long distance relationship. And he told me that there were some problems in the relationship to begin with, that we talked about before that. Or maybe I was so ready to refuse that he couldn't be understood, he told me. I told him that I experienced the same things before, last March. He again made some decisions by himself that he regretted after. And he did not share any of it with me. I told him that relationships did not work that way. And I told him that you don't change your personality by just changing one thing about yourself. He told me that he didn't just want to try to work out things in a broken relationship, with warning me everytime he had some things that he didn't like and all, in the long distance. I offered him not to warn me everytime and just to talk about them all one time, whatever he didn't like, or just talk about them face to face because nothing was being clear with just texting and we hadn't seen each other for 1,5 years. I told him again that he was making too big decisions by himself. He told me that he didn't have a list of things that he didn't like and told me again that he didn't want to change my attitudes that weren't mistakes in the first place. Then I told him that then, he wanted a relationship that worked out perfectly well, from the beginning, with no conflicts or incompatibilities. I explained myself again. And he explained himself again, telling me that I wasn't mature enough to be in the relationship that he wanted in life. And he realized that what is going on between us was nowhere near to the maturity of his ex flirt and. long time best friend and his' relationships maturity. Their likes, dislikes, personalities, sense of humors and their way of handling situations' similarity, wasn't even making a problem to be solved in the first place and he realized that he wanted something like that in his romantic life as well. He told me that I could say that he was going easy and I would be right, because he was sick and tired of the ""difficult""


We talked for a bit, and then I told him that it was like the person that texted me on the New Years Eve was gone and a different person came and we didn't even talked on the phone once, so I asked him that if that was the way that he was making sure of our incompetilty. He told me that these were decisions that he sat through and thought. And mentioned me of a meeting that we had 3 YEARS AGO when we were friends, and how I acted cold to him because of a basic joke that he made. I told him that it was the year 2019. 2019!!! And asked him if he wasn't aware of how much matured I was after that day. He told me that today, I was still getting drunk and distracting him when he had an exam. I told him that I apologised and he told me that I did, but did it in the first place as well. I told him that one mistake is only done once and he asked me that how many different mistakes that I had a right to make. I asked him if he was that inconsiderate and I would have forgotten him. And told him that, it seems like I had no right to make mistakes... :') He told me that these weren't the problem but these things being happening, in the first place. It was like the guarantee of the things that will happen in the future, he said. He said that he realized that he was dealing with a child, in a week. And plus, sexting wouldn't be any alternative of a physical thing after all, as well... Anyways, we talked for a bit and he told me that it was just a feeling of wrongness that lasted for years (even though we only met for 4-5 times in these last 4 years :D lol and haven't really started a relationship for the first 3 years and afterwards hadn't met again for 1,5 years.) I told him that in the future, when he looked back to the past, he would say that without meeting up or giving any chance, he just ended it and would say those for making decisions with considering a friendship that lasted for years and all. He told me that he could have hints of what I would be like in a relationship, in the friendship as well. And later on, I lastly told him that I couldn't believe myself for believing all of the things that he told me on the New Years Eve, and I felt like a stupid person. He asked me which ones it waswas it and I told him every single one. I told him that I believed him and I apologized. He told me that there wasn't any lie in that part and he realized that there was a child in front of him in less then one week. I asked him again how he could he make that decision in one week. And he told me that I couldn't even wait for him to end (talking) and I apologised and he told me that with every mistake, he would think that how could I couldn't think that myself and believe more of the thought of me being a child... Anyways. I just told him that I wasn't the same person as he met 3 years ago or 1,5 years ago or the one that texted him while being drunk. He laughed and told me that hopefully we could meet again at thein the right time when we both could meet up with one another's needs and wills. He told me to take care of myself and offered me to block each other for me to study more safely study for my exam and for it to be easier for both of us. I accepted it, and told him that I wouldn't go to a different city for college, for him, and if I didn't go, or did go and meet up in another time, maybe this could happen and told him to take care of himself as well.

We have a lot in common and share very similar values.
We live in different cities but spend long weekends together and so far the relationship seems healthy and I want to make it “official”.
We set exclusivity early on but haven’t had “the talk” yet.
He’s talked to his closest friends and siblings about me, and he’s met one of my friends when she came to visit.
I am used to dating guys that chase more aggressively and in the past, when I dated guys that were more passive, I pulled off because I’d subconsciously think they are not interested.
He is a very introverted person and has social anxiety, and I really like him, so that’s why I’m trying to keep myself grounded. He can get too analytical and has stated that bf/gf titles are a bit childish and that the definition is quite ambiguous, which I agree.
For context, this is his second “relationship” and also the longest he has been in, so I get that some times he might be a bit lost when it comes to the social cues of dating.
But at the same time I don’t want to play around and I am aware that not setting a title at some point is just rejecting being emotionally accountable for the other person.
I’m considering waiting till the third month mark and see how things go, but if we don’t have the talk I will most likely move on, since I think 3 months at our pace is more than enough to know if you want to pursue things further. 
My question is should I let him know that if after a month we are still in the same position I won’t be interested in continuing the relationship? I don’t want to force the talk and I want to be mindful of his limited dating experience, but also don’t want to get more invested and waste my time if this is going to end up in a “situationship”.

I started talking to the girl and later she offered a shot in return.

Spend time talking and drinking (lots) of beers. Eventually I just said: Hey I think you are a nice girl, would you like to go on a date sometime? She tanked me for the complement and said she didn't know yet about dating. (I can't blame her as we were both intoxicated) We exchanged numbers.

Now normally when a girl says ""idk"" when I ask for a date I assume i'd be wasting my time pursuing her further. (I get that it can be scary for a girl to say NO to a man she doesn't know)

Recently I have decided after a 6 year hiatus (focusing on my professional life) to get back into dating. It’s been a bit difficult and overwhelming navigating the territory and I’d appreciate honest thoughts on the following below:

- What is the age range where you think I’d find the most success in today’s dating pool? My preference is typically younger versus older (like mid 20’s versus early 30’s) but I’ve always dated older in the past (1-2 years) so I don’t have a reference point on what’s acceptable and works in a serious relationship with larger age gaps.

- Where are the best places for me to focus my efforts in meeting and connecting with single women? I’d describe myself as a more reserved academic type of personality.

- Is online dating worth my time as an option? If so which apps or services?

Additional information: I’m from the NE USA moving to the south, I am fairly introverted but can be conversational or outspoken when I feel comfortable and I’m looking for long term dating/ultimate marriage as my goal. Moderately conservative background and average in terms of being health conscious.

Long story short, I'm (27F) have been talking/dating a 30M for about 9 months. 4 months of this was during a city lockdown so we could never see each other (so only phone calls and messages) but have been on dates ever since. We basically talk every day (messaging, insta, discord) and speak on the phone every other day for a good couple of hours. We see each other approx. every week but we're both so busy professionally so its difficult to find the time.

Anyways, he knows I'm a virgin and saving until marriage. We both follow the same religion and while he has had sex, I think he deep down acknowledges and respects I won't be. We get along really well, have great banter and for the most part, connect on every level.

A couple of weeks ago, he was out and drank a lot &amp; had messaged me ""I love you"" that night, twice - once at midnight and then again at 4am. He also missed called me twice. He isn't the emotional type so this was pretty big but I also know he doesn't like to be vulnerable so I just said that I loved this side of him and that I'd like to see more of this.

However, he has now become overly sexual with me, not in person but messaging. I don't mind a bit of sexual banter but anything explicit makes me uncomfortable. For context, we have made out and he has felt me up a bit but that's it. He knows my boundaries go further. But now everything we talk about goes back to sex - he says he wants to make love to me, that he wants to slap my booty, that he loves my breasts etc.

These comments make me feel so ... disrespected and used. I feel like he was only in it for the sex from the beginning. How can I explain to him in the most appropriate way that I just don't like these explicit comments ... or is this actually normal?

Also in terms of why we aren't exclusive yet - we've been going with the flow but I will be having the talk with him soon because I like him but can't do things casually anymore. He's told me straight up he's not on any dating apps (we met on insta so no relevance to me) and that he's not talking to anyone else and but we haven't put any labels ... I am worried though after his sexual comments that he may be in it just for the sex (although he's wasting his time)

For any further context, this is my first significant 'relationship' (I've had a few dates but nothing worth noting) but he has had 3 long term relationships (all 3+ years)

I’ve been told that I am quite good looking but have never dated girls that are “super-hot” or that I feel are at the top end of the attractiveness spectrum. I don’t do all that well on dating apps and I’d argue I’m slightly more introverted than extroverted overall.

I met a girl on an app a while ago and without providing too much personal info about her we dated for a short while (stopped for no fault of hers or mine) and have now recently reconvened. 

During our hiatus all I could think about was the possibility that we might attempt to date again. We met up again a few months ago and the chemistry was oozing. I could not have been more happy. 

Here’s the issue: 

I was reasonably attracted to this girl to start with. I wasn’t overwhelmed by her attractiveness on date one but she is attractive and has all the personality traits I could hope for in a partner. We share similar beliefs about people and the world also. 

Now a few more months down the line I have moments where I feel the attraction fleeting. I would add that we also haven’t had sex yet due to her being a virgin and being quite nervous about having sex. I’ve told her that she can take as much time as she needs.

Is my moments of fleeting feelings of attractiveness normal? Is it because of the lack of sex? Is it down to too much porn and too higher real world expectations standards? 

I would also add that I have been in some quite long term relationships in the past and I’ve always felt this attractiveness feeling fade at some stage but I’ve never gone to the lengths/ put in the effort I have for this girl with other girls. There must be an underlying reason why I work so hard to see her / make her Happy?

Is there something I can work on? Or is there something wrong fundamentally with the whole situation?

Hello everyone, just in need of some advice.

So I've started dating this guy about a month ago, he seemed really sweet - I must mention he is 24 and I am 26 - and even if I don't generally date younger men, he seemed charming and down to earth so I decided not to let my 'habits' stop me.

Our first date was fine, he drove for about an hour to get to mine because I wasn't feeling great and I was already excited that he was so interested and willing to jump through hoops not to cancel (we met on Hinge btw, not sure if the way we met might be relevant to anyone).

We meet and we are both instantly attracted to each other, we are very vocal about that. We take off to the pub we picked. He drove there and we were just going to have literally 2 drinks so that he can drive back after having some food. We had fun and each of us bought a round of drinks and then we went over to mine. I ordered pizza and said I'll get it since he drove over and everything and he was fine with it. Next weekend, he comes over. I, of course, wanting to be a great host, I made dinner the night before, woke up in the morning and cooked breakfast, made lunch and a Sunday roast (took me ages but I was excited to cook for him) not to mention that he literally emptied my snack cupboard and drinks from the fridge, but I was excited that he was so comfortable around me and in my home.

Fast forward to next weekend, we go out for drinks, we keep getting rounds, we go out and grab some chicken that was maybe £8 pounds for both of us with drinks and everything and I get the cab back to my place (£30) but I just thought we are taking turns and neither of us were too concerned about things because we are similar people (or so i thought). 

We wake up on the Sunday and he wants to go out to eat something and enjoy the weather. We get dressed and go out, find somewhere nice, eat, have a laugh. The meal was 21 pounds and I say 'Can you get this and I'll just transfer you my half' with every intention in doing so and he says we should split to which I again say 'sure, but let's not make them split the bill for £20, I can get it if you'd rather not' and he shakes it off and says 'okay', I go to the bathroom which is pretty far away from the till or exit and he's waiting there. I say 'hey, how...' and he goes 'It was 31 and I think it's only fair we split it in half so that will be £15.50'. 

Okay so, I am not cheap or against paying my way, but the approach made me physically uncomfortable. I said right away ‘that’s what we agreed on, I would never try to ditch paying, was there something that I’ve done that made you feel like I’m being unfair? Because I like paying my way.’ And all he said was ‘nevermind.’ And started changing the subject. I allowed it because he looked embarrassed, but I was very put off.

I shook it off and we went back to mine, he starts raiding my cupboards again and before leaving, he stuffs a bunch of sweets in his bag and laughs saying he’s found his favourite snacks. I laughed it off, but I wanted to say something snarky. (oh, forgot to mention, I bought a takeaway that evening that was almost £40 pounds and was waiting for him to offer to pay half or anything – he didn’t so I did not pay the ’15.50’ back (is it weird that the ‘.50’ bothered me?) which he has not mentioned since. 

Oh, also, the reason we keep meeting at my place is because he lives with his parents, not because I’m being lazy although I would have to be on trains for 2.5 hrs because I do not drive and meet his parents to get to have sex.

Okay so, besides that, he is very sweet to me, he’s cuddly and kind, he is very sweet in the way he talks to me but sometimes says the wrong thing like ‘even if you do carry more weight in the top section, you still feels nice’ – mind you, I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and constantly better myself so I try to take that comment as a failed compliment he was trying to give me but it’s stuck on my brain.

His sex drive is very low. Like for a couple in their mid-twenties that only meet on the weekend, he doesn’t have much of a sex drive. Like I think we had sex 6 times over 2 days we spent together, and they weren’t very lengthy either. Since the comment he’s made, I keep thinking maybe it’s me. Maybe he likes me as a person but isn’t attracted to me which also messes with my brain. 

Anyway, back to the topic at hand. We met again this weekend, agreed on the plans and then he no longer wanted to go out, which was fine. We stayed indoors, I ordered food. Next morning, I said we could go out, get some bits and make dinner and maybe have a meal out. We had a very cheap meal out, didn’t want to splurge on breakfast and we agreed to snack for lunch (which I bought – he got some things and stuffed them in his back right away) and he said he didn’t want dinner, so I bought some bits for lunches for the week but nothing for dinner as that’s what he insisted on. Around 5-6 he starts getting peckish and asks when we’re having dinner – I say we agreed not to eat and we can look for some takeaway if he’s hungry – he mentioned the stuff I bought earlier and I tell him it’s for my lunches for the week and I don’t really feel like cooking right now. He goes for his bag of snacks and puts it back in and then goes home shortly after. 

Now, aside from all that, he insisted we seriously date which I was unsure about but liked him as a person so agreed. Often times, he tells me how women hit on him and how he gets numbers but not to worry because he won’t ACTUALLY call them. Now, my neurotic self wants to respond to his behaviour with one to match but is it worth even wasting my time? There’s not much of my 20s left and spending them with someone who is either clueless or tries to bring me down seems stupid. I also overthink quite a lot which is why I want an outside perspective.

In this day and age, I find it hard to meet people I enjoy spending time with but for a guy that brags about his savings, always talks about how he wants to pamper me, I can’t match his behaviour with his words and if I hear him say ‘I wanted to buy you this (insert nice thing) because I knew you’d like it but I’m not paying £80 for it, it’s ridiculous, sorry babe’ one more time, I will kick him out of my home.

I don’t know if I’m  being too much. He avoids talking about serious things with me and goes distant if I bring anything up so don’t know what to do.

2) He lives in a different continent (he's in Europe, I'm in North America)
3) Long distance is not my thing (the different timezones really messed with our communication).

I just decided to end it that time because there was just no way that could work. This was 3yrs ago. 

This guy dated around and even got engaged but it didn't work out and so 3yrs later, which is now, he is trying to come back to me. (I hear he really wants to get married). But nothing has changed. He's still not my type, he still lives in Europe, and i still don't like long distance relationships. I let him down gently and i told him that because of the long distance, it won't work.

A guy asked me out in the drug counseling course we were both taking. I would say the drug class was the first red flag but I mean I was there too. He still lives with his parents in a GIGANTIC house (he’s 23, nothing really wrong with that but still relevant) I remember once I told him I couldn’t imagine ever affording a house that gorgeous, I grew up in a trailer, and he said he didn’t come from money. I got curious after that and looked up his past addresses, all giant houses. His parents paid for his IT degree that he doesn’t use. When he would come over he wouldn’t want to go out on dates but instead have me cook for him, and if I wouldnt cook for him his mommy would. Literally once he told me “hope you’re happy I came over, moms making shrimp tonight” ??? We had absolutely nothing in common aside from liking scary video games and movies. On the anniversary of my dads death I really needed some company so I invited him over and I guess I was so upset he didn’t know how to handle it and had his parents pick him up. Getting him to hang out with me or even text me back was like pulling teeth. He’s INCREDIBLE in bed but almost every time we had sex he wouldn’t pull out, and then would get annoyed when I asked for help buying plan b (I’d always ask him not to cum in me, so in a way I do understand that is assault) 

The whole reason I was in drug counseling was because I wanted to stop drinking, but hanging out with him I couldn’t STOP drinking. I simply couldn’t deal, I just couldn’t process why he asked me out if he was so obviously uninterested in me in any way. I would drink so much I would black out and lash out at him for treating me like shit, and he’d apologize and say he’ll try harder. “I’ve only been in one relationship before and it only lasted 3 months” I CAN SEE WHY. For some fucking reason I was so lonely I tried for 4 months to convince this person that I am worth being around. The last day I saw him, when I was driving him home I was pretty pissed (it was the day he made the mommy shrimp comment, it was definitely the last straw)
he asked me if I had cheated on him and I absolutely lost it. How the fuck do you consider us dating? You never fucking even speak to me? 

I am only 5 years older than this guy but I feel like the generation gap is palpable. I have never in my life experienced such a fucking mommy’s boy. Needless to say, after I dropped him off that night I deleted his number so I couldn’t reach out if I tried (I’m notorious for this, and being the only person reaching out gets so tired)

It’s been 3 weeks and I haven’t heard a peep. Imagine thinking you are in a relationship with someone and then just ghosting like that.

So I have been talking with someone for 3 months (30F, 26M). We have not met, and cannot until July as he is deployed. For 3 months we have literally texted on Discord every single day, the conversations aren’t super deep, but he always sends me a good morning message. We haven’t defined anything, which I really don’t expect because we haven’t met in person…..so it’s hard to put that expectation on the situation. We have talked about physically wanting each other and occasionally sext. He has also told me he likes me teasing him over text but doesn’t want me to think that’s all he wants to talk to me for. Some days he isn’t very chatty or communicative….but he is literally deployed and even if I only get two messages from him a day…..he doesn’t goes days without communicating. We plan on spending a weekend together when he gets back but a part of me is nervous about the first meeting and it’s for physical reasons as that’s been the topic when we talk about meeting.

However, it seems like everyone my age is doing that. Especially in Miami... Was dating/sleeping with a girl for a month and a half and it just ended because I'm uncomfortable with her sleeping with a few other guys (which she told me). 

It's not difficult to date women, in my experience. Started dating/sleeping another girl about a week after that ended, but she's also sleeping with other guys (did not bring up exclusivity yet by any means). I'm not sure if it's just the women I attract, or if it's me not fitting into the current culture. But it all makes me uncomfortable as all hell and makes me feel like I don't fit in. 

If things don't work out, that's totally fine. They don't need to work out. But it always feels like a weird competition among men to woo a women.

i also saw his moms facebook and she posted a picture of my boyfriend and i together that she took and she called me beautiful in the caption :’)

We have already had sex and opened up about a lot of things and I’m really starting to like him. We hung out on Friday and we ended up getting into a heated discussion about Covid and the vaccine. He is non-vaccinated and I am fully vaccinated. I try my best to understand his perspective but we ended up arguing and we were in a disagreement. I ended up leaving his house abruptly and I was crying the whole way home. He asked me if we could go on a hike the next day and I told him I would see how I felt in the morning as I didn’t leave his house until 3 AM. The next day I texted him around noon and asked him if he still wanted to go because I started to feel really bad for how I reacted and he told me that he would’ve liked to go in the morning so it would have to be another day now. Ever since the disagreement we had on Friday everything has changed in the way he’s texting, he seems to not be as flirty and text like he normally does such as calling me beautiful and being more flirtatious and I’m starting to wonder if he’s unsure about where we’re at. I’m starting to freak out because I’m starting to feel really guilty for how I acted and I asked him if we could see each other in person so we could talk about it and carry-on. We were going to hang out last night but it ended up not working out. We still plan to see each other soon but I can still notice a change in how he’s texting me and I’ve asked him numerous times if everything‘s OK and I told him that I feel like shit and I told him that I feel like somethings changed but he’s not giving me any answer. He still initiating texting me in the morning and calling me love and is engaging in the conversation but it definitely feels he’s taking a step back. So what I’m wondering is I feel like I need to just text him just to clear the air and just to make sure that he wants to see me still. I would still like to talk about it in person as I like to talk in person about these sorts of things but I need to get an answer now if he still wants to see me because it’s eating me alive and I don’t wanna be wasting my time. Do you think this is a good idea? He mentioned that he felt like I wasn’t going at the same pace as him and that I had walls built up which is partially true but I feel like he’s wanting me to prove to him that I like him but I also have no idea. I don’t wanna come off as sounding annoying but it’s eating me alive and I need to have some sort of an answer before we talk in person because my mind is going crazy.

By simply laying out my boundaries and standards, their true colours came out in the form of a million and two red flags. They would have continued to be low-effort and emotionally manipulative, and if I hadn’t stood up for myself I would have wasted more time and energy on the wrong person. As someone once told me, you can have it all; just not all at once. I’m so grateful for my support system made up of amazing family and friends. I’m so grateful for education and career that will provide me with financial freedom and endless opportunities. I’m so grateful for my physical health and resilient mind, that will get me through the challenges life throws at me with a positive mindset. 
I know it’s hard but I’m right there with you, trust the timing in your life and be grateful for what you already have. One day when you look back on things, all the dots will connect and suddenly everything will make sense.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162623,public,self,trust the timing of your life and be unapologetic when it comes having boundaries and standards,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t4byri/trust_the_timing_of_your_life_and_be_unapologetic/,no_ads,0,,,,

He had really formidable attributes, he was an english teacher and a really passionate person when it came to his hobbies. He was financially responsible with a nicely decorated home and a good conversationalist. There was plenty to like about him, but I had absolutely zero sexual desire towards him. He wasn't ugly, I just didn't feel anything in particular when I met him. I tend to be a chatterbox but I couldn't get a word in without him interrupting which made it hard to feel like I was being listened to. I agreed to a second date to make sure I wasn't being unfair to him, but by the end of the date I just knew it wasn't for me and I declined a kiss at the end of the night, which he was clearly disappointed about. He arranged for a third date before I could agree to it, and I took a day to think about how to let him down gently without crushing his spirit. I could tell he was enthusiastic and optimistic about a relationship with me. I wanted to pick the right words so he wasn't hurt, so I said;

*""Hey, I know you made plans for us this coming weekend but I am feeling doubtful that we are a good match for each other - and its not anyones fault. The spark isn't there for me despite the fact that I can see so many good and valuable attributes in you. I know it never feels good to have someone say this, but I hope you know that your efforts and enthusiasm in our interactions was a rare and wonderful experience that I believe will be appreciated by a woman who can reciprocate better than me. I want to earnestly wish you the best, and I am sorry for any disappointment I've caused you.""*

I felt good sending this. I felt reassured that I had been both appreciative of his time and sad that I would cause him disappointment. He had travelled a long distance for our first date and i thought it was a commendable sacrifice of his time. I thought maybe I had saved him from any embarrassment or upset. 

Boy was I wrong;

This is a genuine copy and paste of his reply to me.

*""Beautiful. Here i've JUST bought a whole load of groceries for the evening we were supposed to share together. A complete waste of money, and waste of my time. Thank you for completely disrespecting me. I wasn't feeling a spark either but i'm actually kind of glad you've cancelled because we are not compatible if you are an adult who thinks some imaginary ""spark"" is a real thing. That's just a Disney fantasy. Relationships require work, and if you aren't willing to put in the work I feel relieved that I've been spared of this as it would inevitably crash and burn. But at least I was willing to try, your loss""*

After I didn't reply to this message, he called me twice. I was bewildered and didn't pick up. Shortly I recieved this;

*""Nice. Ghosted. Can't even muster up the integrity to face your own behaviour and be an adult about this hey? I had judged you as having better character than this. So i'll say a very pleasant and grateful goodbye.""*

Now, I don't regret the words I sent him. I'd send them again in a heartbeat. Kindness is always the best option, even if its not recieved that way. The point is that there's no way out that will ensure the other person doesn't hate your guts, but honesty is going to hurt less for both parties. It may not be painless, but it is the best method for you to come out of it as a better person, even if the other person is angry. When you face up to the fact that others who show you respect and give you their time deserve open communication, you become a better person. Whether they take it in stride is up to them, you cannot make them see your heart or your character any other way than they choose to see it. 

This is also a gentle reminder for those who have been rejected by a potential date to consider the fact that they would have only been happy with one answer. This makes it impossible for the other person to turn you down in a respectful manner because it will always be perceived as disrespectful no matter what. There is no rejection that feels good, there are only rejections that feel less bad.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162624,public,self,"When it comes to letting someone down with kindness, you're often 'damned if you do, and damned if you don't'... but it's still better to try when you can.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t4chn9/when_it_comes_to_letting_someone_down_with/,no_ads,0,,,,
