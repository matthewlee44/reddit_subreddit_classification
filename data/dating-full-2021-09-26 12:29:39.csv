It sounds bad but my boyfriend of 10 months sometimes has moments in which he ignores me or doesn’t text me. He says he does it to give me space and to let me focus on me. He gets cold and seems to distance himself from me. He suffers from depression. 

For example - when I’m on vacation with family he will purposely not reach out to me or text me at all. Not even to see how I’m doing. If I’m at work, similar except I call him everyday and tell him about my day.

I know it’s technically a good thing when I am busy but sometimes he turns into a cold stone wall when I try reaching out to him to tell him things. He won’t text back or will be dry. 

I almost always feel like an idiot texting him or literally wanting his attention when he gets like this.

Just because I’m busy does not ever mean I don’t want to update him on my life and what I do.

It doesn’t help that lately he’s been stressed over school and we have been arguing quite often.

So my advice here is: how do I prevent myself from jumping out and wanting his attention when he clearly does not want to give it to me? 

This situation is made worse by the fact that I am introverted around most people and not having anyone else to talk to; it sucks when we argue or he shuts down on me

Interesting thing is that he knows that I work in the healthcare field. He was talking about how other energy drinks are bad for your ”system”.

**Depth**: Good conversation tends to have depth, meaning the replies from both parties are detailed and descriptive. They tend to be longer, have multiple parts, and are emotional. eg ""My morning was great! I just made some pancakes and they turned out to be perfect. Too bad I ran out of Nutella :(. How is your Sunday coming along?"" as opposed to ""Great. Just had breakfast. You?""

**Convergence**: A great conversation has replies that tend to converge when discussing a topic ie the time taken to reply by both parties progressively reduces over time eg she replies in 1 hour, he replies in 45 minutes, she replies in 35 minutes, and so on. This is obviously not hard and fast and can periodically diverge because we are all busy with our lives but some level of convergence shows that you are interested in them and vice versa.

**Media**: As they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Sharing pictures/audio/memes/links when used strategically takes the conversation to a whole another level, especially if is original content. 

**An anchor**: I have seen a great pickup line or icebreaker doesn't really cut it for me. It usually takes an anchoring topic that both parties dive into for a short while until they become comfortable with each other. It could be a shared like/dislike, current event, etc eg moving into a new apartment, getting a new pet, a recent celeb scandal - anything that gets both the parties talking freely.

**Humour/banter**: This one goes without saying but it is so important that it shouldn't be left out. I personally have never seen a good convo where there weren't some jokes/ribbing/sarcasm/jokes/lols. 

**Natural**: The minute you try to force a conversation you make it worse. Sometimes it is better to just let it go. Talk less, change the topic, change the rhythm, and if nothing works just stop. If it feels like an interview or interrogation you are doing it wrong.

I did vibe with her a lot and we had a decent amount in common. I've never had to think about this in my life since I've had the same girlfriend all throughout college until now so I lack experience anyway.

I have her number when everyone passed their phones around for everyone else's socials as like a formality, and I don't really know what's right and how I should approach this. I definitely wanna get to know her more but I have absolutely no clue how she feels about me or dating or anything.  

I'm pretty bad with women in general and I've only really ever had one proper (bad) relationship; I can be manically self-conscious and opinionated so it's hard to be ""open and honest"" with some of my homies let alone a stranger that I'm tryna hit on. 

Big problem too is that when I leave town in a few weeks I probably won't be back.

Week goes by and he doesn’t follow up or anything. So i’m like ugh he probably didn’t like me/wasn’t attracted to me.

so i’m like “i’m offended you think i wouldn’t want to go skydiving😂” the excuses make me think he’s not attracted to me so i say that. he’s like “no i’m very attracted to you and i want to have sex with you” “i just feel like it would take a long time cultivating our relationship and i’m kind of intense and bot looking for anything serious”

i say i know that bc you move a lot. i also say “honestly dude that’s fine. i don’t think you gave me a fair chance and you’re assuming off of one meeting but i hope you find the situation youre  looking for.” and i mean it.

but i sit here crying because i guess i give off good christian girl vibes and that’s why i’ve never been in a relationship? i don’t care about him and i do appreciate him telling me why it’s a no from him but my heart hurts and i feel like i’m constantly rejected.

I've got a hidden folder in my phone full of half naked and full on nudes of myself. I'm a fit muscular guy who is moderately handsome, especially for my age in my 30s.

Lately, I've noticed an uptick in the type of pictures on Tinder profiles where 4 or 5 are focused almost entirely on the person's body (workout shots, swimsuit shots, lingerie shots, cleavage shots) and there's maybe two good quality normal daily life pictures. You read the profile, and it's a good read, the person will be something like a teacher or a marketing manager at a sizeable company, and the person expresses their desire to find a relationship and is not interested in anything less or more casual. To me, regardless of what your profile says, though, if your profiles are going to primarily market your body, then I can't really see how you're going to find success in matches who aren't interested in anything beyond superficial/sex-based. That is, unless you are hoping to match back with another superficially-focused profile, but I would think this goes for guys, too -- If I loaded up my profile with shirtless selfies and pictures of me in my boxer briefs, I don't think I would expect anyone to think I was there for anything but getting laid. One or two pictures like that could get that point across, but you're still inviting a certain kind of attention your profile indicates it wants to ward off.

Primarily I see it on Tinder of course, but I see it a lot more on dating apps, too.

We've been talking for two and a half weeks and have been on 2 official dates.

First date was lunch,1x1, was great. I noticed she is very much a hugger which is nice. 

2nd date was last night, and it was intense. Crazy good Italian dinner, comedy club. Laughs and vibes galore! She had her hand on my thigh and on my arm. Very possessive and alpha which I like. At midnight she invited me back to her apartment (which she said she never does) and also has told me that I make her very vulnerable and it's very unlike her. I am flattered of course.

Nothing sexual happened, but we had both talked our love language being physical touch. As we sat on the couch, she put her legs on my lap and I gave her a massage, to which she  was very happy about. We talked for 2 hours and then she invited me to go to bed and stay the night. We hopped in bed and she put her hand on my chest and fell asleep on me - pretty much intertwined all night. I didn't sleep a wink lol. I was just riding that dopamine high. I genuinely enjoy every second I have with this girl. 

She's expressed fears about me going back to my ex-wife, to which I've belayed because there is no way in hell that would ever happen. But now I'm wondering, am I being love bombed? Or is this just genuine chemistry by two 30-somethings who have both been through divorce (hers being much less recent, \~3 years). The cuddling was very much consensual  and wanted on both ends, and it was only our 2nd date. I honestly felt 100% comfortable with it and didn't feel that there were any bad intentions. She is very sweet and open, and  seemingly smitten by me, and me her. Perhaps NOTHING is wrong at all, and this is just the  beginning of a blossoming relationship. One could hope! I can safely say on my end she checks all the boxes physically and emotionally. I am not in lust like I've been with other girls I've dated - this one is very, very different.

Later at a school party I met her and we chatted for a minute. I mentioned the glancing from the camp. She told me that she was glancing at me because I was glancing at her. Now I dont know who actually started but it happened. I had to leave early so the chat ended. I only learned her first name. I saw her only once after that in a hall and we just said hello while smiling. 

I (think) managed to find her social media even though I dont know her last name. I found her through mutuals and school facebook groups she is most probably a part of. I dont want to message her because it might seem creepy that I found her even though it was easy. However my experience with her so far is that she likes me even though she knows nothing about me (so its probably just physical attraction so far).

When we're making out with my GF, I have no trouble getting hard and when she does a blowjob or a handjob, my erection is 100% normal, just as I'm used to when, say, masturbating. It happens naturally, easily, the erection is strong and does not go away easily. When we're about to have sex though, no matter how hard I was beforehand, when I reach for condoms it starts getting flaccid basically right away. We've tried keeping the condoms right at hand, not doing that, her giving me a BJ while I'm fiddling with it, what have you - the result is almost always the same. The erection gets way weaker or disappears totally, I put the condom on and then we need to work at it quite a bit to get it up again - and even then, it's not _as_ up as it was without the condom. Enough to have sex but not nearly something I'm used to with my penis, especially considering how hot the situation is and how much we're obsessed with each other and how much I'd like to give her the best sex ever.

So in all honesty I think it's mainly just nerves. I've been a virgin for over 28 years of my life and she's my first GF so even though we've had sex on multiple occasions now over the span of the couple months we're together (probably totalling like 20-30 times over a few meetings) and I feel 100% safe and aroused around her, there probably still is some stress in the back of my mind which causes this. Still, maybe someone has some tips to offer? Is time the only medicine here and we should just progress normally, fighting with my penis most of the times, and wait till the act of sex itself gets so normal and everyday to me that it stops being such a big deal and it resolves on its own? Maybe someone was a virgin for such a long time too and can offer their perspective? I don't watch porn, stopped masturbating since I met her, and yet quite often getting my D ready for action feels like work. We did have a couple good encounters when it happened with no problems and my erection was strong as normal but these were few and far between sprinkled on the regular problematic sex.

Now, I'm in college, organically meeting boys...who also definetely don't want to be my boyfriend or explore that but are very eager to have sex with me. It's not just random boys like on tinder either. My most recent was with a guy I considered a friend. Everyone thought of him as the good friend who could never be a douche and so did I. After a party he kissed me and we made out on my bed. We did the same thing the next day, but because we were going so fast (top off) I was very straightforward and asked him if this was a hookup or if he actually liked me. After giving me (many) nonanswers I straight up asked him ""Can I tell you what I think you're thinking and you can agree or disagree?"" He goes yes and I say ""I think you are willing to hook up with any girl but because I'm a friend it'll feel especially good to you and you want that."" He kinda hesitates but then goes yeah that's where my heads at. I say I don't do hookups and I think we should just stay friends and I let him out of my room and we don't talk much for a day but we get to becoming good friends throughout the week because I respected that we were just looking for different things. Fast forward to this weekend, I get kind of tipsy and he gets really handsy (I'm not drunk) and we talk about cuddling again. We go to his room and start kissing but I go ""No stop I told you I don't do hookups if you like me take me on a date"" and he goes (he's sober btw) ""yeah I like you so much we should do it we should go on a date how about sunday"", so I keep kissing him. However, the next day we go to another party and he's really handsy with another girl. I get super drunk and sad about it and my friend takes me back to our dorm and talks about how he told her that we had a history and I'm so confused about what's going on. Later that night after sobering up I ask him what his intentions are again because if they were to date me he'd be acting differently like planning a date or figuring out a time we'd go out (sunday is tomorrow and I haven't heard anything yet) and he talks about how eager I am to define things (kind of gaslighting me to say I overthink.) And I ask, ""Was there even any emotion and was it a hookup again last night?"" and he goes yeah there wasn't a lot of emotion and it was more like a hookup for me. That kind of devastated me because, unlike the first time, this time he blatantly said what he knew I wanted to hear to get what he wanted. This is just the most recent and most traumatic case because I know most guys in college are this way and it just came to a head.

It's kind of a long story so I'll break it down as much as possible:

&gt;she starts working with me around May/June 
&gt;we get along quite well and I give her a ride home after work one night. We have a good conversation and from this point on she becomes increasingly flirty. We continue to talk frequently and get closer throughout the summer.
&gt;around mid August I ask her out, she says yes but tells me she wants to wait 2 weeks since her mom is in town visiting from Colombia.
&gt;2 weeks go by, mum goes back to Colombia.
&gt;she texts me, not to set up a date, but to tell me she isn't ready to date again because she's still recovering from her last relationship. She had mentioned this relationship before months prior, didn't go into great detail but implied that it was abusive.
&gt;tried to reassure me by saying she still wants to start something with me, but that she needs more time.
&gt;still continues to talk to me like normal, still gives me a kiss on the cheek when saying goodbye at the end of every shift 

Needless to say, I'm feeling pretty conflicted. On one hand I feel like I'm being strung along: first she used her mom as an excuse, then as soon as mom was gone she came up with something else. On the other hand, she continues to act the same toward me and the fact that she had brought up her past relationship months prior leads me to believe she isn't lying about it. However, even if she is telling the truth, how do I handle it? Wait around for a month or 6 until she's ready to date? Hold out hope for something that may never materialize and potentially end up wasting my time/emotional energy? At the moment I'm just trying to focus on my own obligations/goals and not think about her too much, but it's hard when I see her 2-3 days a week at work. 

Anyway, what do you guys think about my situation, from an outside perspective? Should I just give up on her altogether? Perhaps there's some users here who have been through abusive relationships and have a better idea of what she's going through? Perhaps she's just lying?

The last conversation ended, he said “ahaha yeah okay.” So I messaged him the next day and we had the usual type of conversation.

Here’s where it gets confusing, he gave me another blunt response (which is out of character for him) so I thought I’d wait for him to initiate conversation this time when he’s in the mood to talk. 

This was 2 weeks ago. In that time I ofc moved on with my life and made peace with whatever happened. My family are still recovering from covid and having lost a family member to it already, I don’t have the mental capacity for this type of confusion.

  ***So I've going through quite a bit......***  I got into a relationship in June (*we met on Hinge and had been talking since May*), he broke up with me in August because he had self-hate issues and felt like he needed to work on himself (he's Asian and used to talk about how he struggled with his identity growing up in a white high school/being bullied but also not feeling apart of the Asian community due to the 'hierarchical' behaviors of some?) and he's been going through a transition, from being unemployed, to being employed at a job he hated, to moving, then me coming into his life ""unexpectedly"". During our relationship he got a new job &amp; quit the other one he hated, I supported him and cheered him on through it because he was visibly struggling.

  When we broke up we both cried because we really liked each other. I was shocked when he cried as hard as he did. I didn't know I had that big of an effect on him. I understood. Sometimes it's hard to heal yourself while in a relationship. It works differently for different people. In a way, I feel like he felt he didn't deserve me because he would constantly mention how ""maturely"" I would handle things and how his exes would've yelled at him or would've caused a big argument. It hurt me seeing him hurt. I think I took it harder than I thought because I was ready to set my commitment issues aside and give this relationship a chance. He also didn't want kids. I want to have my own kids OR even better, adopt. (2 weeks prior I probed a question about future goals because I was having cold feet with meeting the rest of his friends..... I wanted to make sure he knew I was serious about being with him and I wanted to make sure he felt the same.)

  We're still friends because we both value each other and don't want to pretend like we never met, even though feelings are still lingering on my end (lol I'm healing though, slowly but surely).

  **Fast forward a month later**, I'm in college for my fall semester. I had to drop a class because it was clashing with my other classes. During this time my uncle was sent to the hospital with liver failure. He coded twice, two weeks apart from each other. The first time they broke his ribs. I've always been in denial about his health. This man has had 1 aneurysm, 2 strokes and 2 heart attacks in the past 4 years. Each time I was like ""*he's going to live, he'll make it through.*"" and each time he did. This time I was more hesitant, it was different. I knew it was his time. I mentally told him it's okay to let go (since he couldn't talk &amp; I couldn't be there, I would have conversations with him and sent it out into the universe). He became stable and I ended up dropping the rest of my classes because it became too stressful due to a mix up with an academic counselor I had previously talked to. So what did I do to relieve the stress I was under?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  **I WENT ON A DATE!** I was hesitant to date this guy in the beginning because my luck in dating apps hasn't been the greatest, but he convinced me and I was like eh, why not........  (I should've gone with my gut). The 1st date went well, 2nd date went well, 3rd date..... I started noticing some patterns. He would constantly joke about weird things happening to him whenever he was with me. Essentially blaming me for strange things that would happen to him. At first it was funny but then it was getting really old really fast. Second, ***he doesn't let opinions BE.*** If you have an opinion he questions it. Which isn't a bad thing at all, but when you start trying to ""correct"" my opinion or challenge my belief system that doesn't harm other people in any way (e.g. Marvel is better than DC, I prefer to give a homeless man food than giving him money.) that's when I'll start to have an issue with you. It felt like I was being talked 'at' whenever I answered a question. Almost like a child, it didn't feel like equal communication. Speaking of such. We had a debate about equality vs fairness in the car.........  \*blinks\* Lol......... the context was kids and how I wanted them to be raised equally or fairly or whatever, he felt compelled to say ""most people confuse equality with fairness and I don't understand *whomp whomp whomp whomp*"" lol, then he talked about how he wanted a maid to help out around his house, we got on the topic of immigration/slavery (e.g Haitians being whipped at the border)  **which eventually** **led to him** **asking me what the difference was between a slave and a maid............ AT DINNER.** When I tell you guys I saw a few heads turn in a predominately white space in my peripheral vision lmaoooo. In that moment I checked out mentally and got tense because I was uncomfortable with talking about that in public. It caught me off guard. I couldn't look at him. I was just looking straight ahead at the sunset while eating my food. I ALSO DIDN'T WANT TO DEBATE IT, IT'S NOT A DEBATABLE TOPIC. A SLAVE WAS TAKEN AGAINST THEIR FUCKING WILL PERIOD. It was like he was trying to seem smart by asking that. Everything I said he felt the need to philosophize. Even starting off with his responses with ""Well I don't believe in that"" and would explain why while trying to convince me to agree with him. Like okay cool, next subject. I don't like to keep talking about things if I disagree with the other person because ***I BELIEVE*** the conversation will go nowhere but in circles.

Last week I received a call that my uncle died that morning. (At this point I had no tears left since I was sporadically crying the first week I found out he was in the hospital). I felt peace because he was able to finally be at peace. Not only was I grieving but I was trying to get over my ex &amp; date this new guy. THEN this Gabby Petito case happened and I started looking for signs of narcissism in this new guy because he actually made a joke about narcissism on the 3rd date so that was freaking me out as well lol. I finally came to the conclusion that I am NOT ready for a new relationship. I honestly think I'm done with dating in general after this.

&amp;#x200B;

  **SOOOOOOOO WITH THAT I CALLED HIM 2 DAYS AGO AND TOLD HIM I WANTED TO STOP SEEING HIM!!! :D**

  **You want to know what his response was?  I told him I didn't want to heal into someone else and become co-dependent on him (which is true, I felt like I was still healing and I didn't want him to feel like he needed to carry the weight of that).** In a condescending tone he basically said he ""doesn't believe in that"" apparently mental health isn't a good reason to stop seeing someone. According to him relationships start off with co-dependency and that's how relationships strengthen. ***^(Note: His ex fiancé left him without saying a word for an entire year due to her mental health and NOW I probably see why.)*** He said mental health is always going to be there no matter what (which is true, not gonna deny that). But for *me*, **starting off a relationship this way isn't healthy**, at least in my eyes. Do I have to explain why? NO. I should not feel like I have to over-explain myself ESPECIALLY to this dude. Which is what I felt like every time he questioned my entire existence lol. Before I felt really bad for discontinuing with dating him, but his response reminded me of why I was doing it in the first place along with me clearly not being ready.

  Plus with his tendency to talk to me like I haven't experienced life is annoying (he's 2 years younger than me) and I feel like his words will add onto my depression eventually. That sounds harsh, but when he spoke to me ***I didn't feel good***. He said ""we'll yeah if you want to do the things you want to do in the future what's the point in dating right now? What the hell are you dating for you know?"" **he seems like he always has to get the last word in most of the time.** He could be mentally stimulating to some, but not to me. At the same time I'm trying to make sure I'm not mistaking his possible bluntness for toxicity. That's why I had to leave because I couldn't tell if some of these were red flags or if I was being overly sensitive due to me being in a vulnerable state, but I didn't want to stick around to find out later. My therapist mentioned that our values may not just be aligned but, there's something else there, I felt it in my body when being around him.

  Anyway, throughout this issue I started comparing my past relationship to this guy, because with the first guy I dated we voiced our opinions, respected them and moved on to the next subject. Ate food and binge watched my favorite TV show without either of us feeling weird or endlessly debating over it. When we talked about complex subjects it was MUTUAL listening and responding. He was patient with me as I was with him. We both enjoyed silence together. I loved that we could do our own thing TOGETHER in his room. GREAT TEXTER. Good Morning texts every other morning. I looked forward to spending my days with him. Cooking together. Being goofy. Playfully flirting with each other. I miss that. I want that. Not as a honeymoon phase and not necessarily with him. I want it all of the time. Even when me and my partner aren't feeling our best.

  I actually told the first guy I dated something similar during our breakup and he made a joke saying I sounded like I was giving him a Yelp review LOL. I also know this post was very lengthy but I had to get this off of my chest because dating is frustrating. I JUST started using dating apps THIS YEAR.

Backstory: Back in April, I met this girl at one of my friends parties, we hit it off well and we ended up making out that night. Before the semester ended, she came over to smoke at my place and we made out some more. The semester ended and we both left to go home for the summer, so I wasn't able to see her for a few months, we kept a little contact talking to each other once a month or so. I usually only text to set up dates/hangouts but she initiated and I knew I wasn't going to be able to see her for a few months so I wanted to keep some contact. Anyways, the semester started a month ago and she came over once after a party for about 45 minutes, we made out some more, but she left earlier than I anticipated so I wasn't able to go for sex. About a week and a half later I texted her saying I wanted to take her out, she agreed and I took her to a place for sushi. The date went really well, and after dinner she came back to my place, and we started making out, and after a few minutes of this I asked her if she wanted to go into my room. She said yes but seemed a little shy and said ""I like kissing you"" which kind of threw me off a little. Anyways, we get to my room and lay on my bed, I start feeling her up and it starts getting a little heavy, but she keeps pulling away because she got a new piercing on her septum the week prior, and my nose kept on hitting it. After this happened a few times I said that we didn't have to keep it up if it was hurting her. I also was getting the impression that it was as far as she was willing to go. So we eventually stopped, but ended up making out a little more afterwards before the night ended and when I dropped her off at her place we kissed some more. I told her I liked spending time with her and she said she does too and had a really great time that night. Now here's the thing, I hit her up the next monday (our date was the prior wednesday) to see when she was free that week and she took a lot longer to respond to me than she usually does. She apologized and said that she was busy with school projects and that she had friends and family coming for the weekend so maybe next week, I said ok and the next tuesday after I texted her saying that I wanted to make her dinner over at my place, she replied a day later saying that she was heading to a musical festival for the weekend and couldnt do anything this week either. My question to you guys is, did I blow my chance with her by trying to escalate towards sex too soon? I don't want her to get the impression that i'm only after her for sex, I really enjoy her company. However, she knows that I want to have sex, so will she be more hesitant to hangout with me? What should my pursuit from here on out be? I was thinking about just waiting for her to reach out to me.
