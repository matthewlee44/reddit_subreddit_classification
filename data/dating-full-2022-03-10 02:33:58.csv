I have been feeling this heavy feeling in my chest for a while now and I am so scared to say this so I am just going to keep this post up for a little bit then I am going to take it down. I don’t think I want specific advice, I just wanted to say this.

I have been with my boyfriend for 2 and a half years now, and I have loved being with him every moment. We have our ups and downs as every relationship does, and I love that we are able to find our way through problems and find a solution. I have always loved my boyfriend and I have nothing but respect for him and I will always prioritize him over anything. There are times that I feel that he wouldn't do the same. I hate thinking about typing this because it brings back so many bad emotions that it sickens me. My boyfriend told me he wanted an open relationship when we were dating for 4 months and I am a very monogamous person but I saw such great things in him that I was open to it, but I told him if he wanted for this to work then he would have to tell me before he engaged in any activities. About a year later I had found out that he had in fact engaged in activities without telling me with multiple people, I felt destroyed but never angry or hateful towards him. I confronted him and he had told me that he didn't want to tell me because he wanted to protect me, but to me I felt hurt because he broke a boundary I had set up. After I told him it was fine and I forgave him he saw that I had a soft spot for him and he began to use this against me. He would belittle me, he would treat me like a child and not let me think for myself. In school I was not allowed to pick classes I wanted, I could only go with whatever he said was good for me, I was not able to pick any hobbies. I have a great love for legos but I was not able to build them anymore because he said it was too childish for me. I loved playing video games so much, and they have really shaped me into the person I am now, but he thought it was stupid so he slowly made me quit them. We go on vacation a lot and we have created such amazing memories and we still continue to do so, pretty soon we will be going on another trip and I can't wait. But before he made this trip he asked me what I thought about it and I said it was cool, he then made the statement “you don't really have a say, I was basically just telling you.” then I realized that that is a lot of our relationship, my voice is never counted. He does whatever he wants and just tells me what is going to happen, he controls everything in my life. I can't even buy food without him telling me something hurtful. He has gotten physical with me once, but since that he hasn't done it as much. He continues to sleep with a lot of other people even though he knows it hurts me, he has friendships that make me uncomfortable and whenever I bring that up he gets very angry at me and so I decide to not bring them up anymore. I constantly pray at night that he will change, but I still have not seen any sign of that. I live in constant pain because of all the things he's done to me. I have never in my entire life raised my voice at him or shown any hatred towards him, but he constantly screams and puts me down. I also want to add that my mom was cheated on by my dad when I was born, he would constantly physically abuse her. My mom is still with him and I see how strong she is to continue to stay with my dad, how she has overcome such a hard challenge and I see that same thing here. If she can overcome something like that then so can I, and I will continue to fight for our relationship because I have nothing but love for my boyfriend. In a few days I am going to tell him that I want some space, some alone time just so I can get a mental break from all of this but honestly I am so scared to ask for this. I have never been more afraid than right now to ask him for this. You all might think that I should hate him or should leave him but I truly love him, deep down I want to spend my life with him. I just hope that I can be mentally strong enough to endure more of this. I am so glad that I am able to get this off my chest, it has bothered me for months, I have cried several nights and even just throughout my day because of all of this. I hope you all can pray for me, that is all I really want. I want to finally be at peace.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163136,public,self,My relationship makes me sad now,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/taoe7i/my_relationship_makes_me_sad_now/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Hi all, I have this question that would love to hear many opinions, perhaps advice. But first a bit of context:

Two years ago, I met someone on a dating app, we hit it off quite rapidly, got involved intimately, and were seeing each other for a little while, maybe a month, exclusively, although not a relationship. Then I ended up leaving for Portugal for a 2 month's vacation. We kept talking while I was away, but towards the end, it started fizzling out and when I came back home we didn't really end up meeting again. She shared with me that the time I was away really made her think that she wasn't ready for something more serious despite really liking me (let's make it clear that she was 21 at the time and I was 28). She also reassured me she didn't meet any other men while I was away that made her feel that way (usually where your mind goes when something like that happens, and I actually believed her because she's not that kind of person). So I respected her decision and we left things there, never really talked again.

Now after two years, I have randomly been trying to talk to her again, and she replied to me even though not something consistent because she was always the worst texter. It got to a point that I actually gave up because she wouldn't reply much so I didn't see it going anywhere (this was back in January this year).

This past Sunday I randomly texted her asking if she wanted to go watch Batman which she immediately replied ""you know what...YES, I am down!"" ... so I was like, this is a good sign. We hang out, we hugged, we talked a little bit (she mentioned being single), watched the movie and at the end, it was late so we just left it there and she hinted that we could talk better next time we chilled. All good, we hugged I kissed her on the cheek, told her it was great to see her again and she texted me saying she got home safe. It just felt right meeting her, she's just as cool as she used to be. So these are all positive points I'd say...

This week we have been texting, but super hard to have a convo over text with her, that didn't change and she warned me LOL, which is fine because she works late hours and unlike me, she's not a very big texter. So I just asked her if she would be down for dinner and drinks this upcoming weekend to which she answered she couldn't because she already had some plans lined up, but perhaps the weekend after, to which I replied ""sure, we can work it out"".

so my question is, after hearing all of this,

1. do you guys think there's any possibility of us getting back together over time and within the right circumstances, or do you think she's not actually interested? I am very curious to hear your responses and ideas :) 
2. also curious to know if you guys think I should share what I felt when we met again, if there is a possibility of us getting back together, or if I should just let time decide its faith and leave those questions to an in-person interaction instead?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163136,public,self,Question regarding a possible reconciliation/reconnection with a previous girl I used to date,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/taojc1/question_regarding_a_possible/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

The guy I’ve been talking to, I’ve known since we were 15. We are now both 24, going on 25 this year. He ended up being my first love (I know so cliche). We dated for a while in 10th grade and after we broke things off, we were always very flirty, and always have been throughout our complicated friendship/relationship. After our first year of college, he went into the Army and moved across the country. We always kept in contact and had a very sexual/flirty relationship. I dated other men and he’s hooked up with different women, and we just lived our lives. 

He moved back into the area right before the pandemic hit, but I was in a relationship, so we just stayed friends and talked to each other as so, and also have not met since he’s come back. He respected that I wasn’t available and was committed to my then boyfriend, and we stopped talking for almost a year. I broke up with my boyfriend towards the middle of February this year, and coincidentally, he messaged me a few days later. He had no clue I just broke up with my ex, but he just wanted to check in with me and see how I was doing, so we kept talking and of course the question came up you know how are you and your boyfriend doing, so then I told him that I had just broke up with him, which of course as you can guess, reignited the flame between us. He said he was very interested in pursuing something more serious this time because he feels like I was the one that got away and hopefully now is our time. I am very busy with my new job and adjusting to my schedule, so I don’t have a lot of free time during the week and the weekend I take to rest so I don’t go anywhere really. I’ve become such a homebody even more so than before. But we are planning to hopefully see each other maybe this weekend or so, but he wants to take things slow and build a relationship, which if you saw how he was when we were teenagers/ young adults, that’s just very weird coming from him.  I mean it’s great he’s very different than the person that I knew when we were teenagers, I mean thank God, he’s very mature and intentional with what he wants. He definitely wants to get to know each other all over again,  because honestly we’ve known each other for nearly 10 years but I don’t really KNOW who he is, I don’t know as many personal details about his life as he knows about mine because I’m an open book, where he is very closed off and private. Through the years up until he left for the Army, we were very fast paced; at 15, we started dating a week after we met, we’ve always had a very flirty, intimate relationship and now he wants to take time to learn about each other and build a more mature relationship. Which is great don’t get me wrong, but it’s just not how usually function so I feel like I don’t know how to do that with him. It would be different if we started off slow and it’s just always been that way, but to be how we were for all these years and then all of a sudden the dynamic changes, I feel like I don’t know how to be slow paced with our relationship and I don’t wanna ruin things by trying to rush it. And really I have never been in a very slow paced or normal paced relationship. It’s always been like we go out, we hit it off, we’re dating instantly, things heat up and that’s just how my relationships have gone.

27F, been on and off the dating apps for years. I’ve complained to my mother enough and she has always reassured me that I just haven’t found the right one, been hearing this since I was 21. I feel like I could have been in a relationship or at least “dated” if I went for the guys that have pursued me. However, I got tired of the ones I didn’t like back approaching me and have decided to use bumble. I’ve met up with two guys and didn’t feel them either. It’s only been twice BUT like I said I tried the other apps for years. My life has always been the ones I want don’t want me back/aren’t serious and the ones that like me I don’t want back. My mom says that she really loved my dad and she’s been with her current boyfriend for years but I just don’t get the appeal of either of them (seeing them as if I don’t know them or aren’t related to them). She says she didn’t settle but I just don’t get how you aren’t settling if you aren’t physically attracted to the person. I do feel I will genuinely end up alone, rather be alone vs being taken and miserable. Not that this matters but I don’t really have an active sex drive, I don’t enjoy masturbating and haven’t had sex in years. I saw someone very briefly 3 years ago and while he had a decent personality, I wasn’t physically attracted to him. That was my closest to a relationship, you’re seriously telling me I haven’t been able to find anyone since? It’s like the universe is telling me I can’t do any better, I have never even introduced anyone to my family going on 30. Social anxiety is something I deal with but not that much of a contributing factor.

It's not impossible to get matches; otherwise those sites would just go broke. It’s just about understanding the basics of it.

About online dating, things are not so different. The problem is that many guys have the wrong idea about it, and act ***very*** inappropriate sometimes, like sending dick picks, harassing women or being ""too open"" from the beginning. I'll give you some ideas that might help you:

\- Understand that girls get ***way*** more swipes and messages than men, same as they get stared at and approached more on the street. So they act more selective. You gotta stand out of the crowd if you want to be noticed. Once you get to find the sweet spot on what reflects your real persona the best way ***and*** what produces more right-swipes, you'll have a great profile that will get you more girls to talk to. 

**Pics:**

\- No selfies. They make you look like a lonely guy. Always ask someone else to take the photo (even more, you can approach girls IRL by doing that). - No crossed arms or holding your own hands. Try more open poses that help you look confident and friendly.

\- Show places that talk about you and try bold options, like the edge of a cliff or a waterfall if you like outdoors. Something that makes you seem adventurous and interesting.

\- No caps, sweatpants (unless you're hiking on that photo) or sunglasses. First impressions matter and most women want to find a man of good taste.

\- If you want to show your pet, put pictures of you with it, not of the pet alone. 

**Profile:** 

\- This is not a CV, don't give too much ""checklist"" information. Instead of ""I'm looking for a relationship"", ""System engineer"" or ""I cook well"", say something more exciting or mysterious, like ""**looking for a partner in crime**"", ""**I can teach you cool hacking tricks**"", ""**you gotta try my lasagna**"" or ""**Don't worry if you can't cook, I'll do it for us**""

\- Show boldness by being funny or polemic. Something like ""I'm here because I lost a bet"", ""no single moms, please"" or ""Nickelback is a great band, change my mind"" (it's not, but it sparks convos like crazy). The idea is to give them something to giggle, be curious about or even start a convo with you.

\- Less is more, especially in platforms where people's attention span is less than 10 secs. instead of ""I mostly listen to metal/rap/pop"" say ""***metal/rap/pop lover***"", or instead of ""I can find something good in every bad thing"" say ""***Life learner***"" or ""***helpless optimistic***"". 

**Convos:**

\- Don't talk about your life like it's a job interview. Be mysterious, tell funny stories and always leave a topic unfinished for the next conversation, no matter how much she insists.

\- Stand your ground. If she says something you don't like, show your disagreement respectfully. Women love seeing a guy who is not trying to please them all the time.

\- Try to arrange a date in less than a week. Of course, she might say *no* one or two times, either because she's actually busy or because she's testing you. ***Don't insist more than three times***. If so, cut up with her and put that energy on someone else who is more willing to meet you. Also, if she's not interested in you, it doesn't make her a witch. **No need to call her out**. Just block her and move on.

As I said, it's about finding the sweet spot. Try and experiment new options until you find something that works and you feel good about it.

He's a semi regular at the store I work at, and at the time, I thought he was pretty cute, and added him on snapchat. After talking with him a bit though, I decided (at the time) he wasn't really my type and didn't pursue anything with him. We've gone a few months since then where we really didn't talk much, and our conversations at the store were also pretty sparse, but always never awkward or anything, just pretty chill and nice.

The last couple of months though, we've really been talking a lot more, and getting to know each other. Then a few weekends ago, we ran into each other while out at the bars. I ended up going with to his place with him and sleeping with him (please note that we both were drunk and while it was his idea to go back to his place, everything was consensual, and I do not feel I was taken advantage of or violated in anyway). Everything seemed to be going really good after that, and when he took me back to my car, he suggested that maybe we could go out to dinner together the following weekend, possibly at the restaurant I told him was my favorite. I said yes and told him I really liked that idea.

Well, the following weekend comes around, and while we are talking a lot still, he doesn't bring up going out. Instead, he tells me he has a dinner date with his mom, and then is visiting his dad on Sunday. I'm a little disappointed, but I don't make mention of the dinner, because 1) it was never set it stone and 2) I didn't want to rush or nag him into something he wasn't ready for, thinking maybe that he just brought up with dinner thing because we had sex and was a little giddy from that. But then last week, we're talking about hanging out, again, on the weekend and he once more brings up dinner. I clearly say yes, I would like that and give him a rundown of my schedule (I do work some Saturdays). And once more, the weekend comes and but he says nothing. I decide instead that I'm going out to the bar and invite him to come with. He says he'll think about it, but then never gets back to me. The last message I get from him that weekend was late Friday night, and I don't hear from him again until Monday, when I message him asking how his day was.

At this point, I am noticing him messaging me less and responding slower. I also notice we don't have a whole lot of variety in the subjects we talk about, so I try asking him a few things about him, like his interests and stuff, and get a few vague non-answers. He brings up last weekend, and he made it seem like he was upset we didn't hang out. I told him I asked him and basically got a no, and he tells me he doesn't like going to the bar that much, whereas I'm going out almost every weekend (I work the equivalent of a 2nd shift and since I have 2 jobs, I am sometimes working both of them in one day, so not much time to go out and do stuff during the day. Bars are really the only thing that's open still when I get off from work.) So, I ask him, what would you like to do, and give him what days I have off. I tell him, I work the one job on Saturday, but will be done by 2, and don't have to work the store afterwards, so I'm pretty much free all weekend. He's says dinner sounds good and gives me a smiley face and leaves it at that. No date, no time, no place.

Yesterday, I tried to get a better answer. The only thing more I could get out of him was Mexican sounded good, and as far as a when, he said it was only Tuesday still, and that he also had to visit his family (which to be fair, he has brought up before he visits his family every weekend, he's got a much younger brother and neither of his parents are together, so he makes sure he visits both).  But, I'm honestly feeling like he's not really into the idea of us having dinner together anymore. And while I'm not suggesting he prioritize me over his family, I don't understand why he couldn't visit them earlier in the day or Sunday, and we have dinner Saturday night? Why do I have to wait until the actual weekend for him to decide? On top of that, he hasn't messaged me at all since last night, and I've come to notice the last few times we've talked, it's usually me instigating the conversation first. If I don't, he won't talk. I'm about ready to give up on him, but at the same time, I really don't want to either. Any advice on what to do?

At that time we had known each other for few years in school.

The relationship lasted for about 2 years. She decided to dump me after because of all the fights we used to have. 

After it ended, I tried every damn thing to get her back as I still loved her. But she stuck to her grounds and then we moved on where she started seeing other guys and I started meeting other girls, except for to realise that I was not able to get into another relationship because of how the previous one went. So I started meeting girls just to hook up with them. 

This went on for 5 years. Met some amazing women but didn't really date anyone. 

After 5 years I ended up reconnecting with my ex who I mentioned above. We spent a lot of time together during lockdown and till now. Planned trips together, meet for dinners, drinks almost every day, she would also come and stay at my place for days when we are in town. 

So I started feeling for her again and decided to talk to her about it. She said she wasn't 100% sure and does not feel the same way and wants to be friends instead. I think that's BS tho and she does have feelings for me. 

Note: She had gone through a lot with the other guys she dated. They sexually abused her and overall they were toxic. She suffers from PTSD and is a super anxious person. 

Now  I'm left in this dilema as to pursue her or not. If so I do I go about it? She is most likely leaving to Canada soon for studies so that is another barrier.

How to start dating?

Longer: Hello. I am looking for some advice from pretty much anyone (as most people probably know more than I do) about how to get started in dating. 

I have put a lot of work into achieving desirable qualities such as a good financial situation, great physique, education, hygiene, etc. These are more material traits, and while good, they cannot make up for my social ineptitude. 

Could anyone paint a picture of what positive, realistic social interaction looks like? I get along well with people much older than me, but the impression I get is that, upon first meeting with me, folks around my age see me as odd. They lose enthusiasm and things quickly get awkward. It must be something I am to blame for. 

It seems like commonly on this—and similar subreddits—guys are struggling with getting matches online. I do not use social media and do not want to online date. My struggle is separating toxic dating advice touted online and real life advice. 

I have never really approached a woman as I don’t want to bother them or seem creepy. I also fear rejection. It is tough.

What turns me on and is recognised as masculine in my culture is a man paying for everything, dressing smartly and being the dominant leader in the relationship.

He is better for me longterm, because he emotionally invests rather than doing the right processes.  And I grow more physically and emotionally attracted to him by the day.

He also does this thing when his body naturally gravitates to mine, he swiftly pulls away and he'll do that over the course of the date.  And then he looks at me checking to see if I want to kiss him while he's doing that, but I'm thinking I just saw you jump away from me like I'm a spider.

It's been about 5 years since I have entered the dating scene, and starting from a place of severe insecurity and a general misunderstanding on how to perceive friendships and relationships. 

I can safely say, over the years I have worked on building my self-confidence, communication skills, etc. (all of this is continuously improving!)

**A Realization: Meagre Response**

During the initial years, almost for a major chunk of the years, I had assumed that I was not up to the mark, in cases when I'd matched the response was meagre. 

This meant I further put in efforts to improve my pictures, write better bios, after all there was a massive statistical skew in the amount of men and women on the applications. 

Results started showing, relatively better than the beginnings. 

**The Unavailable**

Sooner than later, I was meeting women, and it was weird, because there I was trying to take things forward and somehow I was met with resistance. (I ensured that I left the serious parts to the 2nd or 3rd date if we had sparked) 

One must understand that direct communication isn't that hard to interpret - precisely why its called direct communication. 

This did not mean the other person stopped communicating, they chose to not answer my questions and they wanted the attention. It became clear that they wanted it to be a one-way thing. Lest you push someone, their ego gets hurt and your value is non-existent. 

Initially I'd interpreted it as me not being up to the mark, only to realize that what I am fighting with here was confusion. 

*Dating emotionally confused people is not healthy.*

**Conclusion**

There are a myriad of ways to look at it: 

1. Those who project what they don't want, more than their identities are clearly looking for attention 
2. Those who think dating is filled with fuckbois who are there only for sex, become easy prey. They are so overly focused on looking for flags, they project it while communicating, making them gullible. 
3. There are a category of those who should not be dating, local to india women/men are particularly used to living double lives hiding away from their families. Dating is impossible because they are trying to fit into multiple identities at the same time, and that makes it an emotional minefield.   
If you meet someone who says they can't meet you or step out at some points of the week/day, understand that they either (1) don't have control over their lives and/or (2) In their fight for identities, you are clearly a lower priority 
4. Those who don't have a stable mental environment.   
In multiple cases, I have had a woman try and gaslight that I wasn't putting in efforts and in another case the person could not understand when I expressed my feelings toward her and made comments on whether or not I was mentally stable. (In both cases the women lived in highly critical and personally unstable, unsupportive environments)   
Before you look/ask for further evidence, I still continue to maintain a healthy friendship with a women I met many months ago, all because of the direct communication that the both sides chose to establish. 

**Advice:**

To the Fuckbois: If you folks are hell bent on having sex: do it with direct communication, you have no need to manipulate anyone to have sex with them. 

The result of manipulation is a strong resentment toward men (in general), it only adds into the trust barrier that we have to cross to grow taller and harder for everyone. 

If you do end up meeting someone who is emotionally vulnerable (as stated in the points above) please share your observations with them so that they understand what they are going through. 

Once you have mentioned your observations, steer clear and don't spend more time. The currency of dating is time, and time spent on those who are not interested in you, and/or incompatible with you is time someone who is compatible with you is losing. 

We need to start letting go. 

**Bonus:**

On Self Doubt 

A lot of us deal with self-doubt. Which propels us to cling on thinking there is a chance something might happen. 

In that state, no matter who is on the other end, your self doubt will eat into your relationship sooner or later leaving a festering wound that will take a long time to heal.

She's in a relationship now, so I wasn't really expecting much of a connection when we met up.

At first, she seemed a little different. She wasn't as flirty with me as she used to be (which I guessed was due to her having a boyfriend now), but I did notice some things later during the day. Firstly we went swimming and our two chubby guy friends were trying to reassure each other that girls like dad bods. She then turned to me and said ""and you're just standing here like 'I have a six-pack'"". 

Later that night our group was just sitting around talking. One of our friends got really drunk and he was telling funny stories. Every single time, and I mean **every** time he said something that was funny, this girl would turn her head (she was sitting next to me) and look and me as she was laughing.

Now I know the obvious answer is yes but I have no idea how to act or what to do in a relationship (another thing I might need help with) which is why I would depend on my partner to keep things moving, and I believe she is like me in this way so I just don't know if it would work out. Second, is that obvious fear that she will say no and damage our pretty solid friendship. and third is that at the end of the day I am only a freshman (she is a sophomore) so waiting until the crush dies down is an option but at this rate idk if it will anytime soon

We are exclusive and we talk all day, every day (this is important). During the day we text and send tiktoks back and forth and in the evening we talk over xbox or on the phone. He lives out of town but drives down every weekend and stays for 2-3 days. He's switched up his work schedule just to have the weekend with me.. so his actions are telling me he's serious about me.

He's wonderful. Caring, considerate, affectionate, funny, very giving in bed.. all things I've been missing in past relationships.

Here's the thing that bothers me.. he won't add me on Facebook, even as just a friend. His reasoning is that he still has stuff on there from his previous relationship of 7 years and doesn't want me to see them and also that he never uses Facebook.

I stalked his exes fb page and she still has tons of pics of them together, status updates ect. Personally, when I ended my 5yr relationship I deleted all of that on my account so idk why they both still have it all up.

His family don't know he's broken up with his ex (7 months ago) . His explanation is that he doesn't talk to his family much but told me that his friends and ex (who he still talks too) knows about me.

The only social media platform I'm friends with him on is snapchat....

When we talk on Xbox, he appears offline.. his reason is so his friends don't bother him.

I've talked to him about these things before and was given the above explanations, reassurance that I'm not a ""secret"". That he isn't trying to get back with his ex. And that he wants me to be his gf eventually..

We went out in total of 3 dates 2of them almost lasting for more than 15hours. On date 3 everything was going great until I entered his home .

A little back story here his ex was diagnosed with a mental disorder and he had ended up being her caregiver for a year. It was almost another year since they broke up and he had no contact with his ex at all.

When I entered his house every single room had a painting done by her in recovery which he had encouraged her to do. I didn't say anything then she was a big part of his life and I understand you can't just erase that. While talking that night I felt he was still stuck in there, he didn't even realized that until I said it. He still did everything he had promised me cooked me breakfast the next day and dropped me back. 

Over the next week he constantly kept talking even though he did say he can't give me what I am looking for and he probably needs support group to get through this.

Almost 2weeks later I asked him to meet me, I had really strong feelings for this guy in a very short time, I said I wanted to try and I understand trauma but he said he can't go back after I opened that Pandora's box and we are never gonna date, at that point he didn't even know if he wanted to stay in the city anymore. He said I was definitely one In a million and he really liked me and had never connected to someone like that and want me to stay in his life.

A day later we were still talking and I felt he was a bit restrictive so I asked if it's bothering him and he said it was odd for him to get personal with me since he barely knows me and that really hurt my feelings and I acted harshly I deleted him on SC and the app told him I was done. I felt he was leading me on and then pushing me away repeatedly which was really not good for my mental health. And the next day I regretted it.

It's been 2months since and I still can't get him out of my mind. I don't know what to do here I can't contact him and even if I do I am scared of being rejected....

Let’s call him Reed. Reed has always been kind to me. We fight every so often and always manage to work it out. I love my partner because he makes me feel good about myself and he’s a lot like me personality-wise. He’s a very attractive man and has a lot of friends whereas i’d prefer staying home on a Saturday night and watching Netflix. I’ve never felt insecure about myself but this issue is coming to the point where I need advice, redditors.

Normally this would be a dealbreaker for me, but i’ve decided that since my past relationships of being cheated on/dating narcissists, that ignorance is bliss. Reed constantly goes out with his friends and drinks, posting it all on social media. I, however, am sober, and I’m not really into partying as much as I used to be. 

In one of those photos on with all of his friends, I find a reoccurring girl. It didn’t bother me until I found photos of her sitting on his lap/arm around her, etc from a month before we got together. 

I’m making an effort to not be so obsessive like I was in the past, (then found out I was getting cheated on lol) and i’ve really changed how i’ve been so far. I didn’t stalk his followers, i don’t constantly check what he’s up to or who he’s with. And i’ve opened up to Reed about some pretty horrible things i’ve done in the past when I found out I was getting cheated on for revenge. It was working out really great until he started making fun. He started saying things like “I bet you do stalk my following, I bet you know all my girl friends and family’s name, etc.” It really provoked me. “You probably know this, and that, haha it’s funny”. I told him I was making an effort and I honestly didn’t know half the people he hung out with. I was just trusting him.

Then I looked, the green-eyed monster took over and I did. The provoking probably didn’t help either. This reoccurring girl started to get the best of me and i’d find myself talking to my friends about it. 

Once we started getting serious I noticed the girl was out of the photos more and more. And one day Reed opened up to me. My partner told me he had done sexual things with one of his friends a few months ago and has been avoiding her since. I guess he wanted to be honest with me but I don’t really remember how that conversation came to be. He told me her name. Let’s call her Mary. 

Mary had been his best friend, but spent less time with her after they did sexual stuff and almost completely cut her off and he let me know that. Then I stalked some more. She is and was a constant in his life. Now I thought about her even more. I should trust he’s not spending time with her, right?

Then I go back to think at sacrifices I’ve made for him. He asked me to block one of my old friends from high school who I did have an old group with and where we had sex a few years prior. I ask him if he thinks it’s fair that I’ve blocked so-and-so on social media and stopped hanging out with him and our friends entirely and that he still has contact, and occasionally spends time with Mary. 

He said it was different.

At the time, we had an argument. And he finally realized that if I was making these sacrifices, he should do the same. He did ask me to block him in the first place, and I was perfectly fine with keeping people from our past around since it was before we met.

My partner blocked Mary. He said they were both plastered at the time and made excuses but eventually did. 

Mary hasn’t been in his life. Mary had no contact with him. Things were fine. 

I met my partner through a friend of mine, his ex-girlfriend was stalking my page and got really upset that I was spending time with my friend after they broke up. Let’s call the ex-girlfriend of my friend Kayla. Kayla showed Reed pictures of me, she was jealous and angry (although I had been her ex’s friend for over 7 years and she knew me). Reed thought I was pretty. He reached out one day and hit on me, and it went from there. 

Kayla still didn’t like me. She would talk bad about me, and wasn’t pleased me and Reed got together. Keep in mind me and her ex have been friends for several years and have been nothing other than strictly friends. 

Yesterday, my partner reached out to me. Said there was a huge drinking event with all of his friends at the bar and they were celebrating something. This Saturday coming, but Mary would be there. He asked me if I was comfortable with him going, and I can’t go because I’m currently on vacation in another continent. I said no. I told him I was uncomfortable and that it crosses my boundaries. 

He was upset. 

I asked him if he’d feel comfortable if I hung out with so-and-so’s name that I had sex with back in high school and he said no, even in a group setting.

He said it was different.

All day we had argued with me on why he should go, and told me he just genuinely wanted to see his friends. But when Mary was out of his life he had no problem going out to drink with select friends without her. Mary and Kayla are best friends. Kayla insisted she tag along. 

I really wasn’t fond of him and stuck my ground when he asked. I said it was not fair because if I was in the exact same situation he’d be uncomfortable. He still argued his point. My partner told Kayla he couldn’t go for x and y reason. He blocked Mary and had told Kayla all of it.

Keep in mind i’ve made small sacrifices for my partner, like, I stopped Face timing one of my close buddies because he changed his shirt in-front of me over FaceTime.

Reed kept arguing, and then, Kayla messaged me.

She was deliberately being rude and cussing me out, while getting involved in a matter with me and my partner. Telling me I need to let him go, why am i being controlling, saying I probably cheat on him anyways, just mean stuff. I wasn’t going to handle that so I wasn’t very nice back. Let it be known I’m a gamer and I have a lot of good roasts.

Once the conversation ended, she reached out again, still being nasty and my partner took her side.

My partner told me that I shouldn’t have roasted her and I got too personal (I don’t know anything about Kayla, seriously.)

I kept reminding him that Kayla reached out first, two times and she was getting involved in business that had nothing to do with her. She was being unnecessarily rude and I’m allowed to respond in a manner that he may not like.

So remember how Kayla was saying I probably cheat on him, etc? Reed started texting me 5 minutes after how I’m cheating on him and he’s done with me, breaking up with me, weird stuff. I kept trying to end the conversation and waited until Kayla was done putting things in his head.

He doesn’t normally act this way. 

He started checking my accounts and such and trying to grasp onto anything that would make me be comfortable with that party or just give up.

I told him that I’m not going to be with someone that disrespects my boundaries and I am still uncomfortable with it. He wouldn’t let me do the same either but still finds it’s okay that he does. 

Then Mary texted me. The girl he was sexual with. She was being very kind and trying to reassure me nothing would ever happen between the two. But it did. 

She tried to play it off as harmless and a drunken mistake, but when I had sex with my old friend from high school, I wasn’t sober either and I had just gotten out of a relationship.

 I was kind to her. Mary seemed like a nice girl. But I still wasn’t comfortable with it.

Reed had a problem with setting boundaries on our relationship, or doing/saying things that were in his favour. Once, a girl friend of his was going to sleepover in his bed. I told him I wasn’t comfortable with that. She was plastered but lived a 10 minute walk and it was easy for her to just go sleep on the couch, or for my partner to walk her home. It took him sobering up and realizing he wouldn’t like it if I was in his shoes.

She went home.

I finally did give in. He told me we needed to trust each other and I decided that it was too much for me and that none of these three were going to stop bothering me about this party. I said only if you let me unblock and hang out with my old friend and our crew. He knows i’m on vacation for a month and that it would happen nowhere near soon. So he agreed. We came to that compromise but I still feel uneasy about it. 

Why does he want to see her so bad? It was perfectly fine so far and he was avoiding her great. He managed his friends and still went out. I don’t understand.

I guarantee that when the time comes for me to hang out with my group again and my old friend will be there, he will argue and fight and not let me go.

Once Mary was kind to me, I was kind to her and Kayla as well. We ended up making a group chat and just talking, and it turns out her boyfriend will be going with her (as far as I know). I apologized and Kayla did as well. 

Me and Reed are okay now. But that whole scene was horrible, and I’m having trouble understanding it. 

The party is in two days reddit. I’m still feeling uncomfortable and my boundaries are definitely overstepped at this point. I’m really tired of this drama and I’m really not happy that he’s choosing to go. He will be spending time with someone he’s done sexual things with in the past and in a setting where he won’t be sober, just like a month before we got together.

How do I approach this? I need some advice.

TL;DR:
Partner is going to spend time with someone he did sexual things with, but sets and removes boundaries in his favour. I’m uncomfortable with it but I feel pressured into being okay with this.

I have Asperger's Syndrome. I've been friends with this woman (25F) for 5 months now and so far we seemed to get along pretty well. We met once (since we live 2 hours away, we met on a gaming Discord) and did a facetime call a couple of days ago. We've had several calls too. 

It also kinda felt like we were e-dating. She expressed her interest in wanting to date me, complimented my appearance and flirted often. She'd even talk about how we'd spend the future together with me. She was the first person I ever had romantic feelings for, and for her it was the second as she broke up with a guy she dated for 3 months when she was a uni student. 

However I'm so scared that I've lost her as a friend (and potential girlfriend) as a result of my stupidity. I was so worried and wanted to check up to see if she's doing okay because she had a lot going on in her life. So I did the unthinkable and left multiple unanswered missed calls on her device and asked her to reply to me via text on Wednesday evening.

I'd often turn to her for words of comfort and to be soothed sometimes. I'd do the same with her. 

Then this morning, she replied via text that it was way too much for her to take in and didn't know how to respond. I'm so scared that I've lost a friend here because we got on so well and had plenty in common. She isn't the greatest texter (she'd text every 24-48 hours using lengthy responses) and I appreciate that but surely if you're good friends you should at least reply to their phone calls or texts rather than straight up ignore them? 

As a result I'm feeling distraught and need to get this off my chest. I've contacted a few friends and they're currently trying to help me out with the situation. They're all advising me to leave her alone for at least 3 days but the main issue is that I've worried I've lost her.

A girl ( f 19) given me ( m 24)these signals 

- she was the one who reached out to me in these past days
- she seemed to get angry when I was talking with other girl
- I found her staring at me and smiling while I wasn’t talking
- I jokingly said to her friend that I was trying to flirt with her at a club and she said (jokingly)that since the friend has given his approval, now I need her brother’s approval ( who is super nice and I only met him Saturday)
- we basically got to hold hands, she has kind of grinded on me and she is incredibly touchy

Today I gathered my courage and asked her “I would like to drink something tonight , do you want to go out?” (in my language sounds better and she can legally drink here)

To which she answered “I don’t think so”.  

At first I thought she was rejecting me but after I answered she asked me if me and my friends were still coming to her city ( the hangout spots are mostly there). 

I answered that I was thinking about going out only with her. 

Her response was “I understand, I don’t know if I’m going out tonight, I’m studying right now”

I guess my point here is, can a relationship survive if we're both having some rocky situations lately due to personal circumstances? I did assess myself whether if do I really love him, am I the bad guy here, did I do something wrong, am I a good influence to him, and vice versa.

I’m 18, and my life until now has been what I can best describe as unique. My family is very stereotypical “old money”, in the sense that I’ve always gone to private school and spent time on the stereotypical things you’d expect: fencing classes, polo, ballet; attending galas my parents were invited to and talking to old people about politics and art and whatever. 

However, I am now in university and completely independent. I live on my own, make my own money and am free to spend my time however I want. I’ve never been in a relationship, and have rarely been in a situation where I would be around women that might be interested in me that I could flirt with or ask out. I went to school in a Middle Eastern country, so dating wasn’t a thing there at all. I now go to school in the US. 

Appearance-wise I would hope that I’m above average; I’m 1.86 metres tall, I work out and take care of myself. I’m  half Central Asian and half Iranian, though in my experience people have no idea where I’m from and I’m not too dark skinned. 

So, what can I do? Another problem is that(and I mean this im the most inoffensive way possible) that I find it difficult to relate to and casually converse with “regular” people.

Whenever we have time, we would see each other. So basically we end up seeing each other every other day. We have a very good and healthy relationship. I’ve never experienced anything like this with anyone. He would literally feed me popcorn at the movies. He would open my chopsticks for me and set them up when we eat sushi. I’m telling you he is so good. Of course, I would reciprocate the energy back for him. Recently, he told me that he would be busy this month b/c he’s going to start booking in more clients for work. We agreed that we would see each other once a week. The last time we saw each other was last Friday. I usually see him after my shifts at the hospital. We were perfectly fine, we were doing couple things. He asked me to sleepover like he usually would. I say no because I have work the next morning. Anyways, I noticed that this week that his texts were off. We text every day. He would always ask if I ate, what I did, goodnight/good morning, etc. But it has been so off these past couple days. I knew something was wrong. Yesterday he started to ignore my texts. Ok, maybe he’s busy?? But I’m scared now. So I call him. HE HANGS UP ON ME!! I know he would never do that to me. Now I’m freaking out. I have a feeling that he’s gonna end this. I get a text later on from him, “Hey sorry for ignoring you lately. I just realized that I still have feelings for my ex, I don't think it's fair to you if we keep doing this. Hope you understand.” No I don’t understand?? I asked to call but he said there was nothing more to talk about. Wth!! His ex and him haven’t been together for 2 years. I’m confused and so lost. This feels like my first heartbreak all over again. If I were to settle, it would be with him. I would take him back in a heartbeat. But I’m still confused.

If I see an unattractive woman and get to know her as a friend without any intention of sex, but she is attracted to me, I'm a bastard.

It seems the only situation in which I don't come out of the whole thing as a bastard is a situation in which neither party is attracted to the other, in which case great, but it doesn't exactly solve my problem with dating.

So I have a 2nd date with a girl I matched via Hinge tomorrow. We talked quite a lot on the first 2 weeks and had our date last week. It went well and she ended up spending more time chatting with me (was meant to leave at 2 for an appointment, but ended up staying till 4). 

I have a 2nd date tomorrow with her and want to know if it's appropriate to ask to be exclusively dating. Not BF/GF but rather not talking to others. 

She told me she is taking to other guys. I on the other hand, after the first date, decided to just put my effort here regardless of the outcome. But I am quite cautious cause I could easily be replaced by the next match.

He used to have the worst behaviour with me and used to talk to me in a very disrespectful way, had anger-control problems, but as I requested him, he went to a psychologist and solved the problem. However, the solution he actually gave to the problem was a silence treatment: he simply stopped interacting with me instead of making plans for the two of us (I had to suggest always what to do) or simply chatting while doing chores, etc. I was desperate and tried to get his attention by telling him days ahead from valentine's day that I would really appreciate if we could do something such as watching a film and ordering pizza, cooking together, whatever thing we could both enjoy was fine. The due date arrived, and after waiting until dinner time nothing happened, I had even asked him to do so, and that is when I decided to break up with him, and I did break up with him.

Four days after this, I was so sad that some friends convinced me to have a night out (pubs were opened in my region when this happened) and started drinking, chatting with strangers, an there was this one guy who started talking to me and kissed me, we didn't make out or anything; we also spent some time talking but nothing too important or specially interesting.

Some weeks later,my ex apologized and said he would try his best to make things better even if we were not gonna come back together anymore, just to let me know that he didn't do it because he didn't understand what I wanted. Later those weeks, he was being an amazing person. A month afterwards, I decided to give him a second chance. Before telling him the news,I told him what happened to me the night I mentioned a few lines before, and he got superangry saying that what I did was considered cheating for him. He thinks it was too early for me to go out and to kiss with someone else other than him 5 days after a break up, and that I don't care about him as I could ""easily replace him with a guy I don't even know"", when this dude obviously didn't mean anything special to me. All of this situation makes me think we shouldn't be back together at all, as I really don't think I cheated. Pls redittors, do you consider this cheating?

TL;DR: I broke up with my bf, met another guy who was interested in me.
