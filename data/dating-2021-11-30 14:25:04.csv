Recently (past two weeks) he’s been finding little reasons to see me everyday that doesn’t always involve being physical. Like asking me to meet up with him or asking me to stop by his house, etc. We’ve had less sex recently but he wants to talk more and see me a lot more often. We make sexual jokes when we’re around each other or rub up against each other but that’s been about it. We also FaceTime, talk, and text everyday. 

At first it was all about the sex. We talked but mostly about meeting up or about what we wanted to do during our next hookup. Now the conversation has changed to have more meaning. I have no issue with it but in the beginning we made our intentions very clear.

This was part of the reason we stopped seeing each other. This was a really long winded way of setting up what our relationship type was, casual. 

We talked about many different topics, current events or just whatever we were thinking about. Out of nowhere one day he asked me if I ever had an abortion. I said no. He then told me his sisters both had multiple abortions. I was like okay? I don’t know why he asked me this really but brushed it off. He asked me again if I had one like a month later, again I said no, and asked why he was so concerned about it. He wouldn’t give me a straight answer.

 I’ve never had someone ask me something so personal with no reason for it, it rubbed me the wrong way and has sat with me since then. So what do you think? Is this an inappropriate question?

Fast forward, I find out he follows a couple politically charged insane conservative accounts on social media. We met on an app where I list I’m liberal and have my preferences set as such. His leanings aren’t listed. While I have my leanings, I do not follow the equivalent of extreme lib accounts. I’ve def said things to make my views obvious and he generally agrees but today he pushed back for the first time…was related to Covid.

It is something that’s important to me, esp socially…sometimes I wish I didn’t care so much but I do. Obviously not marrying the guy yet but I’m just bummed. I don’t want to knock him out but like I said, it’s super important to me. I want to bring it up in person, but due to work travel we won’t see each other for a couple weeks.

In some cases, men I dated became very very controlling later on. And me being an empathetic person did not help containing that behavior. 

I got back into dating earlier this year, and went on some six dates with this one guy. His parting words for me were that I was ""too sweet"". He was looking for a candy and not the whole bag. He needed someone rational. 

I have never had my friends tell me that I'm irrational. I consider myself to be a realist. 

Since when did dressing up real nice for dates, buying thoughtful presents when the occasion arose and complimenting your date for the right reasons, become unfashionable. 

To keep things objective, here are some examples of things I did that made my date angry:

1. On date number five with this guy, I had a friend prepare some of his favorite dishes, because I don't know how to cook. I packed those dishes and dropped it off at his place.

2. I made too much eye contact while talking or too little eye contact.

3. I dress up too much for our dinner dates even though I dress down for brunch and lunch. 

He needs someone more practical. My heart hurts because this is the bare minimum effort for me. I didn't go above &amp; beyond to make him happy. I send flowers to my girl friends at their workplace when they are down. I believe in the goodness of gestures. I believe in creating safe spaces for people around me so that they can be themselves free of judgemental.

Second date went for a walk it was ok we talked a lot (but she says that I talked too much, I usually explain things mentioning details, don't really like boring 1 sentences responses)

I am kinda out of the loop and not very active on social media rn. 
Whats going on is that 3 weeks ago i met a girl very randomly and we’ve been texting non stop and have gone out 4 times total. We haven’t kissed but she almost did kiss me, BUT also, she touched me. She flirts heavily and i am falling for her very fast. The tension is hard to resist. 


The thing is i literally just found out that she is tiktok ‘famous’ and is in a relationship with another girl. + I checked her background and she has previously been in a messy, toxic relationship where she cheated and then got a third girl involved and just like so so so much drama. 

The situation seems to be scary tbh and i dont know what to do. If from one side my heart is broken because of what i’ve found out, the other side of me just keeps wanting her. I crave her literally the whole time and i cant stop thinking about the insane connection we have. The way she is with me, like super cute, interesting, charming. 
I remember the second time we went out she invited me at her place and we sat for 20 minutes straight staring at the walls, and it felt good. Cause we were both so electric and in ecstasy because we were next to each other. 

Above i said she touched me and what i meant by that is that the third we met up we briefly went shopping cause i needed something and i tried the dress on, let her inside my cabin when i was done and i was looking at myself in the mirror and she was behind me, with her breath on my neck. And while we were looking at each other trough the mirror she made her hand slip trough my whole body and she squeezed both my breast and then my thigh. I was in complete shock. Electrified. And she never stopped making eye contact. She just knows what shes doing. I am completely falling for her. 


Plus she always remembers EVERYTHING i say and keeps baking stuff i like and gifting me things i mention even if its silly stuff. She literally shows me sooo much love its insane. 


I dont know what to do. I dont know if i should tell her that i know about her gf. I dont want her to distance herself from me. I know it isn’t okay cause duh, she has a gf but my mind and body are craving her and i just can’t stop that. I am attracted to her in a way i cant explain. I don’t think i can help myself. I dont think i can retain myself from this. I literally dont know how things will turn out, how it will end up, if she would even leave her gf, why she hasn’t left her yet, why she hasnt been honest about being ina relationship...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r602iy/girl_is_flirting_with_me_f20_and_i_am_falling_for/

39,r608oa,1638314091,How do I handle post date anxiety?,"Hello! f 25 here, not a native and on my phone
I noticed a pattern in my dating behaviour. I go on dates, sometimes I have sex on the first date, everything seems good to me and I think my date also enjoyed himself. I leave the date with a high, feeling relaxed, great about myself, sexy and desired. and I think about how proud I am of myself for being so chill, and feeling excited for something casual. 
and then the high dissapears within 24 hours and if the guy hasnt texted me yet I get crazy anxiety, my head is buzzing, I feel a heavyness in my chest and I feel like freaking out. and then, as the empowerd woman I claim to be, text the guy first. something chill like „i had a good time, hope you too, lets do that again!“ and I dont receive a reply. I freak out and feel like puking, fall into a sad hole, question myself and never want to date again. I start regretting having had sex and think about how it can be that I am still so soulcrushingly single, even though 24 hours prior I was loving that I had sex, felt feministic and empowered, and just wanted something casual. 
 And after a few weeks I forget all about it and it starts again with another guy.

I dont really know how I can change that. How do I handle rejection better? And how do I not depend that much on confirmation after a date? Also, why am I being ghosted so often, I really dont get it. Do I perceive dates so differently than my dates? Why are my emotions changing so rapidly? Do I really just want something casual or am I lying to myself? I think I want something casual, I overcame this anxiety once with someone who showed me very clearly that he was interested, and we were casually seeing each other for sex for a few months and I fucking loved it! 

This is all very exhausting to me and it makes me quite unhappy, can someone relate to this and tell me how they overcame this? I‘m a bit lost",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r608oa/how_do_i_handle_post_date_anxiety/

I look like I am 27-30 at the oldest, I am fit, I have a good job. I am not that bad looking. I have my own apartment/car - I say all of that just to get across that I am not some disgusting guy living in his mothers basement with no job or car.. LMAO ;-)  


I have been trying to meet a lady online now for 3-4 years. I have had no luck whatsoever. I am always respectable. I always make my TRUE intentions known. Those intentions are that I am in no rush but that my ultimate goal is a serious long term relationship that could someday hopefully lead to marriage - No BTW I do not talk about marriage at all in the beginning, I am very well versed in ensuring I don't scare anyone away seeming clingy or weird - Like talking about looking for a wife in the first message, etc.   
I usually start out discussing what I am looking for, asking her what she is looking for. What I am interested in, and vice versa. Normal, healthy and intelligent conversation. Once we get that out of the way, I will usually ask her when she would be willing to go out and do something interesting. I always make it known that her comfort is my priority, if she isnt happy with some place I would be interested in taking her, I am always open to suggestions, etc. I am very laid back. It seems like NONE OF THIS MATTERS. I can hardly ever get lady that is actually my type to answer messages, and if they do, I can get them to continue to talk even less, and IF I DO happen to get them to continue talking for more then a night, or a few messages. Getting them to agree to meet? Damn near impossible..

 I have a therapist who is about 34 and she is pretty damn attractive (as a gauge only for this conversation) and even she says its just how people are, has also given me some stories about what she went through, to help me better understand what women go through online. But I am not doing that?! I am not acting like that, because it is NOT who I am. But I am loosing the interest. I am a strong person, but getting let down over and over, and honesty straight getting my heart broken multiple times is making me not even want to try dating anymore.  
Also don't get me started on trying to meet a women in public, that is nearly guaranteed (95%) to be a let down, or a rejection in the form of a lie that she isn't single (usually)

49,r61d1s,1638317349,I'm terrible about overthinking/overanalyzing situations? Can any of you offer some advice on this girl I've been seeing?,"The girl is my coworker. My job is hardly a big thing so please don't just stop in and say ""Don't shit where you eat"". I'm completely over that.

Feel free to look at my post history (I think I only have 1 other post haha). I originally asked for advice on whether or not a girl was expecting to have sex or be intimate with me. She seemed very interested in me, and I still think she is. 

At work, we flirt with each other alot. Comment on how the other looks, point out something sexual, talk dirty, and sometimes we maintain eye contact within like a foot of each other for extended periods of time. 

I asked her out last week after about a month and a half of overthinking it and she was very receptive to it. I offered to cook dinner for her one night. She kept asking me if I still wanted to come over and was teasing me about it in a playful way.

Now to start with where I'm starting to have my doubts. Maybe completely unfounded, but like I said, I overthink and overanalyze to my detriment. The day the date was supposed to happen, she texted me in the morning and she had a family emergency with her brother. I know this wasn't a lie and didn't hold against her or anything. I told her it's unfortunate and I was really looking forward to tonight, to which she responded ""I was really looking forward to it too😞"". I basically just said if everything is okay by the next day I'm available, just hit me up. She said she would and that was basically the end of that conversation.

The next day, I asked how her and her brother were doing. Eventually I asked if she thought Monday was gonna be possible. She said it should be be everything ends up okay. I ended by simply saying, ""Alright, just hmu if it all goes well""

DISCLAIMER: I felt like I needed to add this in here. This is the only time I've asked her and I don't think I'm being pushy or selfish. I know things happen outside of your control and while I am disappointed we weren't able to have our date, I know what she's going through now is more important, so I really don't want to be annoying about it.

Today was the day of our backup date and she hasn't responded yet. I've read all the FAQ and websites on what to do in this situation: She cancelled but offered to reschedule. Ask her whatever day works for her and leave the ball in her court and let her take the lead, which other than asking her the other day, I have and haven't texted her since.

I know I'm probably overanalyzing this which I why put that in the title and I'm trying not to think about but it's hard not to. At the very least I'm not constantly hitting her up saying ""Today? Today? Today?"" so that's a start😂.

TL;Dr
* girl I've basically been in the ""talking stage"" in for about 2 weeks (but have known about 6 months) accepts my offer to come over to her house

* Something unexpected comes up and she has to cancel but offers to reschedule. We both agree we're disappointed.

* I text her the day before the reschedule date to ask if her if she thinks tomorrow is possible. She hopes so, but can't promise anything.

* Today is the day of the reschedule and I haven't heard back from her and I'm really getting in my head over it, but also am refraining from being annoying or clingy about the whole thing.

I (30m) went on a first date(26f) from Hinge almost a month ago.

We went on a first date, it went well, and we are interested in seeing each other again. Unfortunately this was just a few days before I was scheduled to leave the country for a few weeks. We had a date planned for when I got back, but my return got delayed another couple weeks. At this point it will be almost 6 weeks before I get to see her again.

Now we still communicate, text like once a day, and we do a video chat hangout once a week. I feel this is great and I feel our online hangouts are going well.

The only thing is I feel like I'm struggling to keep my romantic intentions known. The online hangouts are great, but obviously I cant make any physical contact. And it feels like its really easy to fall into this ""friend"" pattern, and that's something I want to avoid. I mean, I try to compliment her and talk about plans we might make, but it also feels weird to just shower her with compliments.

So I guess my question is, do I just straight up say I'm still interested in her romantically and really want to take her out, even if its a little out of the blue. Or am I overthinking this and just keep doing what were doing, and just wait till we actually see her in person to make more progress.

56,r61xn4,1638319046,A HUGE green flag for people with a fear of abandonment,"One huge green flag for me in a relationship is someone who doesn't leave during a conflict or when things get tough.

As a disclaimer, I do have a fear of abandonment and I have been working it out in therapy. However, I still find that finding someone who will stay with me when we are having an argument / working through a conflict helps. Finding someone who knows your triggers is so helpful and even having someone stay there beside me is helpful.

I don't think someone just being there will fix anything but from my perspective, I am used to people leaving when things get bad and that is traumatizing. Someone that can stay with me is really helpful and even if we are not talking and just sitting there in silence, even that means the world to me.

57,r61y5s,1638319088,Do I deserve a second chance?,"I’m going to try and summarize a long situation so you can get the gist and give me advice/opinions. 

Basically, over this summer I (f) was going through a lot and was dating multiple men at once to try and fill some sort of void and escape my emotions. To clarify, these were never serious dates, nothing was exclusive and I truly don’t believe I was “cheating” on anyone. However, I decided that I’m not this kind of person, I don’t like “playing the field” because to me I felt guilty and still felt like I was unofficially cheating. 

My cousin gave me the advice to pick one if I wanted and see how things played out with one person instead of leading on all three. I chose the one I had spoken to the longest and had the most in common with. The second guy (went on two dates in a month) I ended things with. It was very amicable, no hard feelings I think, I just essentially said I wanted to be friends, he understood but made it clear he wasn’t comfortable being only friends since he wanted to work towards something more than that. I totally understood, we wished each other well and went our separate ways. The third guy is irrelevant to this story. 

This first guy I continued dating for several months blah blah blah. Turns out we didn’t have the same views on relationships so we ended things as well, on good terms, no trauma or whatnot lol. 

I went to therapy to deal with my shit, got myself sorted and now I can’t stop thinking about guy #2 (he’s the same age as me if that makes any difference). I don’t think I’m rebounding since it’s been several months since I ended things with the first guy. Me and the second guy seemed to connect and I had fun when we went out. I think I just maybe chose the wrong one to pursue? 

I was thinking of texting guy #2 to ask if he’d be interested in me taking him out for coffee, apologizing and saying I regret my decision and think I made a mistake. 

I wasn’t going to tell him essentially I chose someone else because I think it’s hurtful and unnecessary unless he blatantly asks because I don’t want to lie. 

But my question is, based on this info, do you guys think I deserve a second chance? Or should I just cut my loss and move on and live with my decision?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r61y5s/do_i_deserve_a_second_chance/

We met on bumble and both were looking for longterm relationships. We used to go out once or twice a week and got along really really well. I've gone over her house and met her mom and grandparents too, as well as she came to my friends halloween party.

I do really like her, we love so many of the same things, and we would talk for longer than I had ever talked to anyone else in a single go too, but lately I feel like on her part she hasn't really put anything in towards relationship wise. We have kissed but its only when I had asked if I could kiss her when she had dropped me off back home. She hasn't done it herself. I'm very big into physical touch,(one of my top 3 love languages) even just hand holding, cuddling, or leaning up against one another, and I know she doesn't like touching whatsoever when she's tired(and she usually is always tired).

Lately our schedules just haven't been matching up at all to go out too(if she works one day she doesn't want to go out at all) I tried to bring myself to talk to her last time we went out but I just couldn't bring myself to it.
I don't want to talk to her about the physical touch thing cause I feel I will be an a** saying I want physical touch but I know I have to say something soon I'm just so nervous and anxious its killing me.

61,r62dhl,1638320345,Met a great guy but questioning compatibility,"My ex boyfriend and I (24F) broke up in March 2021, since then I haven’t taken dating too seriously. Been mostly focusing on myself and thinking about what I want in a long term partner. I downloaded bumble during the summer and was using it on and off, went on a few dates here and there but nothing substantial. 

I started swiping on bumble a few days ago out of boredom and I matched with this guy (25M) who I had instant chemistry with. The text messages were back and forth and we got each other’s humour like we shared a brain. Once we got to know each other a bit better, we realized that we’re both looking for the same things (long term partner, family, similar values). We haven’t met yet, but so far we’ve been talking for two days and spoke on the phone twice. I’m meeting him on Friday. 

However the longer we talk the more I doubt, I know we haven’t met yet but I keep thinking that if we’re not truly compatible then it’s better to end it sooner than later. There’s a few things that I’m unsure about;
- I recently got a promotion where I’ll be making a good amount of money (88k). He just got into the tech field and is working as a recruiter, his current salary is 45k but he says he will make six figures in 2-3 years based on his plan to move up in the company. I want to be with someone who makes at least as much as I do.
- When we talk on the phone, it feels more disconnected than over text. I feel like he talks about himself a lot and I find it difficult to get a word in, there’s not as much back and forth.

I’m not sure if I just have rose coloured glasses on and I’m making this more than it is. Since my break up, I’m careful about getting too excited over a potential prospect, my ex portrayed himself as a great guy with all these great qualities but the relationship quickly deteriorated once we got serious. I’m worried about making the same mistake. 
I’m also not sure if we really do have chemistry? Especially if the phone calls are awkward at times. It seems like we have the same long term goals and values. He takes his job very seriously and wants to make good money in the future. I’m worried I’ll fall for this guy who may not be a good match for me and it’ll end in another heartbreak.

But it was pretty obvious that there were a lot of guys that also like her/tried hitting on her. 

This week i asked her what her plans for the week are and she said she‘ll have people come over… (like on different days, not a native speaker don’t know how to put it sorry)
Now obviously this means there a guys who simultaneously asked her out and for some reason that really bothers me. It makes me really anxious and i feel so demotivated because my brain just tells me there will be someone better than me…

I thought wow imagine I a girl like that liking me. Then over the next few days I noticed her giving me the signs (when a girl likes you) and I caught her looking a few times. Then finally one day she comes into the building from what I assume is her break and she walks past my desk and as soon as i lift up my face to look at her (i was on a call and was typing) she gives me a huge smile and she seems nervous to do it but she does it but unfortunately I freeze from being surprised like that and don't smile back and instead look back down at my keyboard. :( I then look up again as she walks by my desk completely and I see she has a face on her like ""I shouldn't have done that; he didn't even smile back :("" .

I mainly didn’t specify because we’ve only been on one date, so I don’t feel like it’s reasonable for him to expect me to not date anyone else at this point. I did think it would be kind of rude to blatantly mention going on other dates, so I just kept it vague. He’s also shown a hint of possibly being clingy.

I call him to find out if he was being serious and he said yeah I should still come over.  

I get another Uber from my house to his house  (he only lives 15 minutes away from me) I message him and tell that I’m going to be there at a particular time .. I  got no response from him but I just assumed he he was busy tidying his house.

I get to his house (bare in mind it is 1:30 am)  and it is freezing cold  I live in United Kingdom where it is cold for no reason.  I pressed the doorbell - no answer. I call him - no answer. I standby the door shivering there is no movement in the household all the lights are off.

I was extremely confused I thought to myself is this guy really sleeping ??? I couldn’t believe that I was outside like a fox I was in shock. I then get another Uber back home around nearly 2 am in the morning and then he sends me 13 messages around 4am extremely shocked that he fell asleep and was  apologising and shocked at what happened. 
I replied a bit bluntly and then he called me during the day when he was on his break at work and he apologised many times and said he would like to reimburse me for my uber trips and make it up to me. I told him no it’s fine he doesn’t need to do that and kept it straight to the point with him on the phone. I was just a bit over the situation and it kind of turned me off of him even though I know it was an honest mistake on his part however it was still very off putting. He also said he will give me a couple of days to calm down and he will reach out to me.

He actually didn’t give me any time to myself he messaged me the next day trying to start a conversation of me which I understand but I just felt like it was too soon I still haven’t replied to him he sent me a message out four in the afternoon it is now 3 am in the morning do you guys do you guys think I’m overreacting regarding the situation and should I reply .. I don’t know what to do.

I just wanted to add this has been the only guy I’ve spoken to since I’ve come out of a six year relationship so I don’t know if this is a sign  to have more options …",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r64wvd/dating_gone_wrong/

95,r658sh,1638329340,"I feel like I have a good connection with the nurse at the blood donor clinic that I go to, but I have no idea how to ask her out","I donate blood regularly. A group of nurses and support staff travel around the local area and are in my community to collect donated blood every 3 months or so. The clinic is set up for donors to get in, funnel through the process, and get out as soon as possible (especially during COVID). There's no real chance to have a private conversation since there are always other donors to attend to and nurses around, and once I'm done I'm sent to the snack corner to make room for the next donor.

One nurse in particular has taken my blood for a few years. We usually have good conversation and share some laughs, but nothing that you would say is unprofessional for her. She does remember me every time I come in and I feel like there's a connection, at least from what I can tell given the circumstances.

I'm at a loss for how to ask her for her number, or really how to further a connection at all. I 100% don't want to compromise her or embarrass her in front of her peers while she's on the job... I was thinking of maybe discreetly slipping her a folded note or something, but that's all I have.

Any ideas? Or is this a lost cause?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r658sh/i_feel_like_i_have_a_good_connection_with_the/
96,r65djc,1638329750,Could my slanted smile/teeth be the reason I’m single?,"If a girl has imperfect teeth, is she automatically unattractive and undateable? Like if a girl is a 10 out of 10 otherwise but has 1 or 2 crooked teeth, a gap, or a slanted smile (even if her teeth are white) is she automatically deemed unattractive or undatable? I’ve heard it’s one of the first things guys look at.. I have a slightly crooked front tooth that makes my whole mouth look a bit off and I’ve always been insecure about it. I’m saving up for Invisalign but I’ve already had braces once. I feel like guys notice before I even have a chance to speak. My teeth are white.

97,r65ezw,1638329881,Would you find this irritating or am I being too picky?,"Hello! 

I’ve been going on dates with this guy I met on Hinge. We’ve only been on two, but both have been good and we had good chemistry + I met two of his friend groups on the second date. We’ve taken a two week break from seeing each other because I had a friend in town and he was out of town for the holidays. We also don’t see each other on weekdays because I’m always busy with school + work and he works during my off times. So we texted over the break about seeing each other this weekend, yesterday he asked what my plans were for the weekend and today he asked which day worked best for me to hangout (so clearly a lot of communication around this). I said Saturday, which worked because one of his friends is having a birthday dinner on Friday. Then he immediately said his roommate had been having a hard week and wanted to get dinner with him but he was hoping that the Friday dinner would count (roommate was also invited to friends birthday dinner). He asked if I wanted to get dinner Saturday if that were the case. So basically fri and sat were busy all along. 

Sorry if this was confusing to read but am I wrong for being irritated by this? To me, if your schedule isn’t clear or you have other plans, why would you suggest that we hangout multiple times? I’m also slightly irritated because we haven’t done a dinner date; our dates have been more nightlife oriented/going out (which is cool and typical for early dating in NYC lol, but I like a little romance!) so I don’t want to agree to see him after one of these dinners just to go out. He does spend most weekends going out because I guess that’s a finance bro thing…idk?? and I like the invite but it’s a little frustrating.

I’m still in a phase where I’m okay with dating/seeing other people so this isn’t end of the world but sometimes I miss red flags that Reddit may not (or I may be the red flag)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r65ezw/would_you_find_this_irritating_or_am_i_being_too/
98,r65fmk,1638329935,Would you date someone without a car?,"So I \[22M\], spent the last year backpacking around the country, and I recently got back in my home state where I'll graduate this year. I have a good job, where I work full time as well as go to school, so I haven't had time to get a car yet. I've been taking some weekend classes, and during winter break I'll finally get my license. I've already looked at cars and should be driving by the end of January since I have the money set aside.

There's a girl I'm a bit smitten over, and I'd like to ask her out, however, I know that not having a car is a deal-breaker for many women. I feel like my situation is a bit understandable, and it'll only be about 2 months until I""m fully driving, but I'm not sure if I should just wait until then to ask her out. She drives, and I'm actively working towards my license, with classes already being taken, and am financially in a very good position and can afford uber when needed, but I'm a bit embarrassed by not having a car.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r65fmk/would_you_date_someone_without_a_car/
