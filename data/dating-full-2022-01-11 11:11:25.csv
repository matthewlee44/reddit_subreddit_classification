First off thank you to everyone who commented. I learned so much and felt validated and supported. You all are wonderful.

Now for the update. It‚Äôs been a over a week since H boldly confessed to sexually assaulting me whenever I was asleep. As some suggested I did tell our mutual friend who set us up what happened. She felt extremely guilty but I assured her that it‚Äôs not her fault and H likely had all of us fooled with his nice guy act. She has been by my side 100%. 

I talked to my therapist about the situation. He confirmed what many of you all stated that this was in fact assault and that H‚Äôs behavior when being confronted about this was a major red flag. I‚Äôm increasing the frequency of my appointments for the foreseeable future. I don‚Äôt think I have fully processed what really happened but I know I need help. 

I really wish that I can say things have been on the up and up but truthfully I am drowning. Since H confessed I have been experiencing crippling insomnia. I use to be able to sleep like a log anywhere and almost immediately. Now I‚Äôm lucky if I can even get more than two hours of light sleep. I‚Äôm so fucking angry he took this from me. 

At first I wasn‚Äôt going to bother with reporting H. However, I quickly changed my mind when he immediately began harassing/stalking me. Myself and mutual friends blocked him on everything. But every day I have been getting multiple private calls and H has left gifts/notes asking for forgiveness. Sunday H showed up at my church. A church I never told him the name of. A church that is not his denomination and is near my parents(whom he has never met) so more than 45 minutes from his home. All he knew is that I never miss service b/c of my family. This scared me a lot. I am meeting with an advocate my therapist connected me with later this week that will help me move forward on pressing charges and getting a restraining order.

It‚Äôs been 9 days since my last interaction with H at my apartment and I have gotten at least 5 blocked calls a day. You guys were so right. I feel stupid for letting things get this far and just disgusted with H‚Äôs impact on my life. I‚Äôm so tired, I feel defeated and I just want everything to stop.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1151483,public,self,UPDATE: I (25F) thinks the guy (27M) I‚Äôm dating did something inappropriate while I was asleep.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1ba0p/update_i_25f_thinks_the_guy_27m_im_dating_did/,no_ads,0.0,,,

One (The least common in my experience) they get annoyed or feel emasculated and in that case? Why would you want to date them? Why would you want to be with someone who's masculinity is so fragile that they are offended by flowers? 

Two (Most of my experiences) They look confused for a bit and then light up. They tell you how they've never gotten/expected to get flowers. I've seen six foot tall men carry a single flower so gingerly like it's the most precious thing in the world. I've seen bulky biker type men try and sneakily glance at the flowers with this look of bewilderment on their faces. I've seen young men new to dating look like they are about to cry at a single small gesture. I've watched men try to learn how to carefully press or preserve flowers even though we decided not to date because it was their first one ever. I watch some of them them immediately soften up, like it's a single small pinprick that just drops their armor. Going from a rough ""I care about nothing"" dude to melting butter. 


A lot of men, they expect to chase a woman and be the one who has to prove themselves, they rarely expect to be wooed themselves. They come into dates expecting to shoulder the load and under a lot of pressure to act just right. Take some of that load off, show that you are just as invested in a gentle way. Make them get to feel special for a bit. Normalize bringing flowers to men. 



I think the strongest relationships are the ones where both partners still try to woo eachother occasionally. Not all the time, life settles down when you've been together awhile, but you should never stop trying. Your partner chooses you every single day. Don't forget to remind them why they make that choice. 



Don't give your partner time to doubt that they are loved and cared for, remind them occasionally. Do a little something to brighten their day. Dote on them a tiny bit occasionally.

I‚Äôve been talking to this guy for 4 months online now daily. He lives in the US, I live in Asia (important point for the following), but we‚Äôve never met IRL. We met on social media randomly and it led to us chatting daily on Snapchat. We might meet some day. 

This morning he sent me ‚ÄúI wish you could cuddle with me rn‚Äù snapchat (he does that quite often when he sends me a good morning message), so I replied and we both playfully talked about me laying in his arms he said he‚Äôd kiss my forehead etc.

Then I just said absolutely and he said  ‚Äúlove you (my name)‚Äù. I asked him is it a common thing to say to everyone in the US culture, and he just said ‚Äúno what do you mean‚Äù, 

I explained to him that for me ‚Äúlove you‚Äù is something you say only to family members or someone really important in my life. 

He then proceeded to say ‚ÄúThat makes sense. Well then I don‚Äôt love you haha‚Äù

In the beginning of our chatting history he wasn‚Äôt affectionate much and only later started complimenting me and even confessed how badly he‚Äôd like to meet me.

Eventually I'd want to marry someone who can speak fluent Tagalog as I can, so that we can pass the language down to our kids. My current boyfriend isn't all too invested in the Filipino culture as well, and that's one drawback that I've kinda had in our relationship. I've talked about his disinterest in the culture, and he understood where I came from and tried to be more open about it (but honestly, selfishly speaking I feel as though I'd want a long term partner that has a better foot in the culture than a surface level understanding).

My problem now is what to do. I love my boyfriend, but he doesn't quite fit the bullet points of what I look for in a husband. Maybe it's too early for me to think this way, but I don't want to extend our relationship on if I know he is not the man for my solid future.

Can things get worse or am i just overthinking?

So my girlfriend (21) and I (24) have been seeing each other often which is good i like it a lot and I'm getting to know her a lot more. She lives in Nuevo Laredo which is across the border for me I live in Laredo, Texas so it's not much of a big deal. The relationship is still new and we‚Äôve been official since November but have been talking since august.We had plans to watch Season 2 of Euphoria Sunday(yesterday) and also to make hot dogs for us while we watch. So anyways on Saturday night she asked me ""So we're seeing each other till tomorrow then?"" and I told her its however you want because she was going to a party she had to go to for a close friends kid's birthday party. So I told her I don't mind seeing you I can go for you if you like but if you want to stay at the party and hang out with your friends then that's alright. She later on said oh okay and later on that night she told me ""hey so I decided I'm going over"" so me all excited looking foward to her she messages me to go for her so I'm waiting about a block away from the border she gets in my truck and is MAD. She told me the guy's that work at the bridge made her throw away her food that she brought for me and her and also ingredients that she brought for the hotdogs. She's upset and obviously embarrassed because while all of that happend she sorta held up the line. I felt really bad because she didn't have to go through any of that and during the whole night we were watching a movie and she just getting on her phone and we weren't holding hands like we usually do or the usual stuff so i know she didn't feel good and i tried talking to her but she didn't want to so I didn't want to bring up what happend then when we went to bed she told me ""hey tomorrow can you drop me off early i don't think I'm going to stay here all day tomorrow"" so fast foward i drop her off the car ride is quiet she makes small talk and so do then. Then i wait till noon to text her just to give her space and asks how she's doing. We then start talking like nothing happend but i messaged her and told her that i was sorry for what she had to go through and I want her to feel more comfortable talking to me because i do care about how she feels and what she thinks and she just said that every thing that happend has nothing to do with me and it's not my fault and that she just likes spending time with herself which confused me because i feel like she doesn't know how to express her feelings.

I (26M) have gone on 4 dates with a woman my age. I cannot tell if I am more invested than she is or if we have different communication styles and she is slow to open up. I do not want to end up dating someone who likes me less than I like her.

On the dates she matches my energy very well. She is a great communicator, we get along, I like her sense of humor, she asks good questions, she is kind, and she almost always has initiated the conversation about the next date. 3/4 times she either slipped in the idea point blank for the next date or just straight up asked to see me again before I could, including on our last date. We talked on the phone once too in this month of knowing each other and she was very engaged and tried to drag out the conversation, in a good way. These are the good signs.

The following signs that make me wonder. I think they revolve around her communication preferences and the pace she wants to go, rather than her interest. I am not 100% certain of this though and worry this is an imbalanced thing. We do very little texting, she openly has said she is not a big texter. I am always the one to initiate texts about plans and have done the majority of the planning. That may be a gender roles thing. This isn't huge but I feel like she doesn't care too much when we are planning. 

We also have yet to kiss, she has turned me down for one, and her body language is very closed off so I don't make moves. I asked her about this on our last date and she said she is just slow to open up and be affectionate. She also mentioned a bad relationship where a guy didn't respect her boundaries. I don't know the detail but maybe all of this is just about her being cautious. 

But anyways, I want to communicate with her more in a way which respects that we are casual, though neither is talking to anyone else. I also want to respect that she wants a slow pace. I don't know if that is best to just be light hearted for a bit, or if asking direct questions is the better move. I am afraid she is uncomfortable with directly addressing the direction of us dating, so I don't to overwhelm her. That is the stress, I think we need to communicate more directly and often, which she seems to be a little more hesitant to do that and may think it be a deal breaker. Or at least that is what I am afraid of. The communication issues may all be solvable if I just approach appropriately. But does it seem like she just isn't into me like I am into her?

TL;DR: I am dating a woman who wants to go slow. That is okay, but we are going so slow that I think we aren't communicating enough for how long we have been talking. I want to try to make things work, but am afraid that addressing the issue would be too much for her this early on. That may all be in my head. Is she just not as into me as I am into her?

It was mostly my fault for her dumbing me, because I was acting like a little girl. From then on until now, I haven't tried to get back together with her cause this was our try number two. I decided she is not for me and she is very immature, and I shouldn't have gotten in a relationship with her in the first place during this time.

 From time to time she still reaches out to me, calls my mom, asks her on the street about me, gets her mom to call my mom from time to time to ask her about ""business"" related questions. 

This is somewhat manageable, because I delete my Instagram DM's when she sends me something so I don't even bother reading it. Also I don't really care cause I live in my university campus now and not with my parents. Also I told my mom to ignore her, which she does a pretty good job of.

The problem is she wants to move to my university to ""pursue her dreams"". Next year we will be living in more-or-less the same building. And we will see eachother on campus.  

I have tried everything to cut contact with her. Ignoring her, saying to her directly that I don't want her. Every time I tell her to get away from me, she says something along the lines of ""if you wanted to talk/get back together, you can just ask, and not try to get my attention in such ways"". The self-absorbtion of this beatch is unbelievable. 

Can I use the way I acted in the end of the relationship but taken to the extreme. What I mean is to act needy, blow up her phone, say I love her all the time, ask her where she is, if she is with other guys in her company. Stuff like that, to make sure she loses respect for me permanently and won't ever contact me again. 

Being a responsible adult clearly doesn't work with her so I'd like some ideas.

On the last Saturday, a friend and I went to a birthday party, and we met multiple people there. One of them was the girl I'm talking about. We talked, shared drinks, and danced until we moved to another party. At this second party, things started to get pretty interesting. We danced multiple times, and she was close all the time. While dancing, we stood face-to-face multiple times to nearly kiss. All this happened while our common friends were next to us. The party ended, and¬†his friends told me to take her home. I left my friend in his house and asked this girl for her apartment address, but she didn't want to give it to me and insisted on going to my house to continue talking. I accepted.

We continued talking for about an hour. Later, I ask her if she wants me to take her home or if she prefers to stay and sleep. She doesn't want to decide, so she asks me what I want. Of course, I said that she could stay. We laid in bed together and continued talking for a few minutes. One thing that she said is that she never slept with a guy the first time she met him. I didn't know how to take that, so I didn't say anything. Then we cuddled and slept.

We woke up about seven hours later, and¬†I took her to her apartment and arranged a date for the next weekend.

We have been texting for a couple of days now, and we have very similar points of view and interests, but I don't know if I'm a little paranoid or what, but I feel like she is giving me mixed signals. Sometimes she answers my texts even if I didn't end the message, and other times she takes hours to answer, and last night she left me on seen until I say good night.

We spent the first year as fwb, but generally we behaved like a couple anyway. However, we stopped seeing each other for like 6 months last year, we were off (because of me) and when we got together again, I said I love you accidentally during sex and he ghosted me. Then after that, we didn't talk  for several months (I think like 7 or 8 months, he did message, but I didn't want anything to do w him). I did a lot of self reflecting and realize that was lovebombing that i was doing. 

We both had our faults, so I wasn't really mad about him ghosting me because there's a lot of stuff I need to work on anyway. So we moved past it.  I see this go around as a new start, and I actually want to put in the work to make things good. I'm in a better place not only mentally but in life as well. 

Due to opposite schedules, we don't really get a whole lot of time together. if it is. it's like 30 minutes before I have class and when he's getting off work during the week but that isn't promised.  Or we get one day together, which is the weekend. So I'm generally very affectionate towards him like I feel like I turn into basically a giddy and happy person whenever  I see him because honestly I miss him alot during the week. I try my best to be at my best. 

  
But today, he made the effort to seeing me after work,  we were like talking and I was just smiling and looking at him as I do. He was like ""are you drunk?"" I was like  ""ha, no. the heck"" ""drunk on love?"" then he laughed and was like ""is there something you want to tell me""  and was just looking at me smiling. My mind immediately is like ""does he want me to say ""I love you""?, but I said no in a confused sense.

I'm a 23 year old guy who never has had a relationship and is a virgin. I'm planning on changing that this year.

A couple of days ago I was browsing another subreddit. In one thread people talked about how long after getting to know someone they usually have sex together for the first time. Many people there (if not the majority) said that they usually have sex on the first date because they need to find out if the they fit together sexually.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading all this made me question if I'm normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I'm not going to desire to have sex with a Woman until I have a certain trust and emotional bond with her (before someone labels me ""demisexuall"": This is not about not perciving physial and pychological desires, I'm just a hopeless romantic (At least in my mind, if it's ok to use that term for yourself if you haven't dated anone yet)).

&amp;#x200B;

Is this going to lessen my chances with women? Am I going to be percieved as prude, boring and a killjoy? Do most people expect to have sex on the first date or within the first couple of dates?

My name is Reiko, 32 years old, Asian, with a stable career. Live on the West Coast of the United States. I probably should have had some bad times, but I'm sure I'll get over it.

I like: traveling, swimming, golfing, reading, cooking, yoga, camping, beach walks and more. I have many hobbies. I only said part of it.

I'm looking for someone who resonates with me. Down to earth person, I like to be a little cautious. Once we really get to know each other, I'm open to an online relationship and maybe even meet in real life.

What do I want from you? Someone read my post first and was looking for the same thing! I hope this is a long term thing. Find a mature and steady man to communicate with each other, your age should be 36+, I like middle-aged men, older men, younger men may not be suitable for me

Just in general it seems (for me at least) that it's extremely hard to meet someone in person especially since COVID happened.¬†

I have a decently sized group of friends that I hang out with. The issue is that all of my friends who live close to me are in relationships and all of my single friends are a few hours away. Since my friends who live close to me are all in relationships it just leaves me when looking to meet people in person. I don't really want to go to events and what not on my own as I'd much rather have some friends with me. The only issue is that whenever my friends and I hang out there's no one around in our age group; always people much older than us. We've had conversations about how we don't understand where everyone is. Especially since we know people our age who live in our town but no one ever seems to be around. Plus which fact because of COVID it's hard to determine if you're interested in someone or not since everyone‚Äôs wearing a mask. Also, I'm not going out as much anymore because of COVID.

Enter online dating. What I thought would be the solution to my relationship search. And nope. At least not yet... Since joining some dating apps back in June I've had very little success on these apps. I'm getting matches but not dates. The three major apps I've been using are Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder (I know tinder isn't the best app for a relationship but I figured it won't hurt to be on it). On Hinge I've had 12 matches: 5 of which I've talked to, 2 of which I've asked out (which resulted in 0 dates). The other 7 never responded to my opening message. On Bumble I've 8 matches with only two actually messaging me. Meanwhile, on tinder I've had 70+ matches with barely any of them ever saying a word.¬†

I'm not expecting to be inundated in dates but I would've expected to at least go on a few dates by now. I'm just waiting for the one match that will give me a reason to delete all of these apps. I'm hopeful that that match will come soon and know that eventually I'll be off these apps.

I (m42) meet her (f29) online, we got great connection real fast, text and video calling every day. Everything was great. We accept each other the way we were. She referred me to her friends as my ""future husband"". 
So after 6 months, I told her I wanted to visit her to see if the chemistry was as good in real life than online. She said YES, so I traveled from Paris, France to San Francisco. 

She told me, no one would traveled half across the world for her. So we spend 2 weeks together, we had a great time, the chemistry was there even in real life. Then I fly back to France. 

Then, she start to get distant, we didn't had the same connection, we had before. 
So I asked her, did I do something wrong. She said she had a hard time to cope with me being gone, and as well a family member passed way. So that could explain why... So I give it some time. 
I was missing her as well, so I asked her if she wanted me to get closer to her, so we won't get frustrated being away from each other. 

She told me that I was too pushy, and she wasn't ready for me moving closer.
So I decided to end up the relationship, because we didn't want the same things.

So was I too pushy?? Was I wrong to ask to move closer to her??

The truth is though that nobody who has really long dry spells says that. It's always people who are in a good position who claim that they wouldn't be bothered. Similiar to people with money who will tell everybody about the insignificance of money. Either that or people who have given up.

Looking for a partner is not about looking for happiness. It's about recognizing that you're a social animal. I'm not buying into the idea that we need to be content alone. Ultimately, we're here to couple up. There's a very old instinct that's driving both men and women to come together.

I begin chatting her up, and we move pretty quickly to texting. I'm trying to set up a date, invite her to a show I was playing, but she's too busy, and she'd let me know when she's free. I had no faith she'd let me know when she's free. But I drop it, and leave it be for a week and a half, when I text her to see how she's doing. We begin to gain some momentum, finding commonalities in our culture growing up, and I felt we had some chemistry going, so I ask her out again. She's free one week from now. Perfect. Date set, reservations made, nerves are set. 

I'm only nervous, because this is the first girl in many dates last year that I'm actually excited about. Anyway, we meet at the restaurant and the chemistry is there. She is absolutely stunning, and I know right away, I want to see her again. After dinner, we go for a walk on the beach, and just continue talking. She alludes to setting up a second date, I hug her goodbye, kicking myself all the way home for not kissing her (like I've done and more with previous dates). I just didn't see the opening, and I didn't know if she was ready. 

Anyway, trying to set up a second date, but she's going on vacation for a week, and she said she'd see me when she gets back. I could not WAIT till that second date. I so enjoyed spending time with her. She gets back around New Year's, and we plan a second date. This time, she lets me pick her up in my car, and I had the night planned; dinner reservations (again) and then a nice cafe afterwards. 

And again, we hit it off, and I feel the chemistry is there, and I could not get enough of her. The time flew by. We again, after the cafe, went for a walk on the back, and ended up talking till 2:30AM. I drive her back, and we make out for a good ten seconds. I was absolutely euphoric. 

She tells me to text her when I get home, and I do. She tells me she wanted to continue kissing me. I agreed. The next morning (Thursday), she wanted to see a movie with me, just didn't know which one. She starts school the next week, so I figure since we're both feeling each other, then we wouldn't mind going on one more date before the week is over (bad call? who knows). On Friday morning, I tell her ""we're going out"" (this might have been my mistake, was trying to be assertive, didn't know how she'd take out). But it worked out, because she agreed, and I was going to pick her up in the evening. I bought her favorite flowers (ones that were out of season, but I got lucky), and had the whole night planned. 3 hours before, she said she wasn't in the mood to go out, and if we can do it next Friday. 

I was gutted, of course. But I told her at least let me drop something off for you, because I already got it and it won't last till next week (she had a feeling of what it was). She told me to park the car and bring clothes to lounge in. I was no longer gutted. 

I come over  and she makes us dinner, and we put on a movie. No making out, no cuddling, nothing. You can actually fit a whole other person in between our space on the couch. I was confused. She told me she didn't feel like making out, she doesn't believe in timelines for this or that. And that maybe she got into online dating too early after a recent breakup. But that she wanted to spend time with me and that's why she invited me over, otherwise she would have just grabbed the flowers and that was that. 

She was trying to end the night early, so after a bit of talking after the film, I left, without even a kiss goodbye. 

I. Was. Heartbroken. Where did I go wrong? I'm so confused, why did she invite me over if she didn't want to spend time with me? Maybe she was nervous for school starting next week? Maybe she was stressed about something else she didn't feel like discussing? You don't invite someone to where you live unless you want to see them again, no? 

I got into my car, dejected, and spent the next 48 hours sulking. I text her a day later, thanking her for dinner, and telling her now I have to return the favor by showing off my cooking skills. She was surprised I had any (I don't, but I'm gonna try), and told her let's how school goes and what kind of time I have (with a smiley face). 

I haven't really texted her since then. Gotta play it cool, right? Gotta feel what the person is giving you? I don't expect to hear from her again. I don't know what to do at this point. 

Do I let it go? Wait for her to come to me? Invite her over for dinner on Saturday night? My hopes are so damn low, you'd need to get down on your chest to see it. 

Felt this one was going somewhere, but as usual, the girls I'm excited to see again, are not in the right place to see me for some reason. I've had no problems with the last 5 or 6 dates taking it anywhere I wanted them to go.
