One the second date he literally said “ it’s so weird how comfortable I feel around you, I feel like I known you for years” and I felt that too, like we are just ourselves with each other. He also asked if I was looking for something serious because he is.

I just said that I’m open but we need to get to know each other better to tell if we will drive each other mad lol. 

The thing is that I just reconnected ex (M22) - he was my first longest, and most intense relationship. I told him I’m seeing this other guy but it’s not official. He is really into cuckoldry but said “are you going to play with me”?

I asked about what he meant but he didn’t want to say. He is okay with me seeing this guy due to the fact he moved to across the country a year ago  and he likes me sleeping with other men. 

The thing is my ex wants to come to my state for a week to visit me, but I feel a bit conflicted, the new guy didn’t ask to be official or exclusive as it’s too early.

4,otiow3,1627505351,Hurting: I left a guy I really liked because he would not commit," 

I am extremely hurt: I decided to leave the guy who was I was having a 7 month casual thing. It was all really great, we liked each other a lot, but he would not commit.

He was recently divorced and did not want a relationship. Isnt it ironic though that we managed to get into a ""relationship"" without labels. We talked everyday, shared everything, saw each other once or twice a week, traveled together and we also told each other we made each other really happy. He would consistently do a lot of traveling without me, and I guess saw other people as well. I didnt, I was too involved to see anyone else and I thought I could handle casual just with him. One week before, I said I would like to try something more serious one day but he had no answer.

This was the greatest relationship I have ever had, but while I was with him, I was constantly anxious because I thought that if I expressed my needs he would leave (he said he did not want pressure of any kind). The thing is, 6 months later I flipped, because not knowing what would happen the next day with us made me crazy (was he out with someone? was he going to find another casual gf? when would he invite me over? etc). Having no real commitment drove me nuts, so one day after talking to a friend I did a blitzkrieg attack (ended everything out of the blue). He is not good with emotions, so he basically just said he understood my position. Now I am sad that I might have hurt his feelings by saying I couldnt handle it anymore completely out of the blue. I want a long term relationship and having someone who was great (trust me it was the healthiest relationship) but could not give me the slightlest bit of reassurance that he was commited to me was killing me.

Now I am here, trying to let go of the hope that he will come back.

Just wanted to hear your stories and see if I did the right thing, even though I really like him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otiow3/hurting_i_left_a_guy_i_really_liked_because_he/

8,otjmv6,1627508209,Busy or just not that interested in me?,"

I’ve knew this girl for more than 7 years, we always had a thing when we were younger but nothing ever came of it. 

Anyway I’m just out of a relationship about 2 months so this Saturday past I thought that I’ll try tinder and get back in the dating scene. She showed up, I haven’t had contact with her in about 2 years so I thought “why not?” And just sent her a text asking how she was, we had a nice back and forth and I asked her for some coffee and a catch up, well couple of hours later we got our coffee and decided to go for a walk on the beach, we then just chilled and she grabbed my hand then initiated a cuddle, we remained like that for about a half an hour then got some food and she said we can do this next week if I would like and went back to hers and watched a movie. 

I texted her when I got home and said I had a great night and offered plans depending on the weather. She said she had a fun night too and she said we’ll see how the weather goes. I said cool and left it at that. 

Anyway I texted her today asking how her sun burn was (we both burnt really badly) she immediately replied “that it was a bit better lol” and I said “yeah like wise, how’s your week going?” And just haven’t heard anything  back. It’s been around 13 hours since. Now she has flaked in the past, hence why it never went anywhere when we were younger. 

I know people will say there’s a multitude of reasons and that she could be busy etc, but she always has her phone on her. 

I’m trying not to get hung up, I’ve another date on Saturday with a different girl, it’s just odd how you can have such a great time then just not hear anything back.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otjmv6/busy_or_just_not_that_interested_in_me/

11,otjyaz,1627509191,"Should I be worried about my girlfriend cheating? Sorry for the long story, but it’s necessary for context.","Preface: My (24M) girlfriend (24F) have been together through thick and thin, good and bad, for the better part of the past 6 years. We had a troubled beginning, as I was an addict and she was a “fixer”, but after the first couple years of up and downs, we really started to blossom. We both started studying in school, and our careers aligned and brought us even closer. She became my best friend, my partner, and a love like no other. There’s no doubt in anyone’s mind that we’re a special couple. Last year about this time, we moved in together, and things were great. Until they weren’t. 

The initial problem:
I relapsed early this year, and even though my partner years ago swore that she would never stay with me through my addiction again, she did. She stuck with me and tried to help as I struggled for weeks, and then months. Then the inevitable happened, she tried to put her foot down, I pushed her too far (emotionally, not physically), and she couldn’t take it. We split up, and were apart for just under 3 months, as I tried to clean up. She genuinely didn’t know if I would ever be back, and during this time happened to run into an old fling. They hit it off, and, well, ended up having a series of 2 “one night stands”- she swears that they were just one night stands and no strings were attached afterwards. Fast forward a bit, and we’re working back towards getting together. I’ve been clean, we’ve been seeing each other and are considering a future once again. Well, not a week after I thought we were moving in a good direction, she ran into “him” again, and had another one night stand.. but this time, she literally told me the *next morning* and said that it wasn’t right, and would be the last time. I tried to accept this, as we were still technically single, but it still hurt. Fast forward another month or so, and we’ve moved back in together; things seemed rocky at first but we quickly became ourselves again. I thought things were going well, like *really* well, but the other day, this started to come into question..

The problem now:
The other day we were on a visit to her family, and it was a great trip so far. One morning, however, as we were each sending our daily “Snapchat’s” to our friends that we have “streaks” with, I thought I noticed “his” emoji in the list of names she sent messages to. I tried to keep this to myself, but by the time we were on the road, she knew something was up. She asked me, and I blatantly asked if I could see her phone. She let me, and I opened it and confirmed what I saw; she had messaged him, but it just showed the one time from the morning. My girlfriend quickly explained that she had “accidentally selected his name that morning while sending the generic message she sends to all her streaks”.. I don’t know if I believe this, because his name isn’t near the top of the alphabetical list, but I let it go as such.. I did mention, however, that I would have blocked someone like that if I was in the situation, just to be sure nothing like this happened again; she totally blew this off and we let the conversation die. 

Then the other day, I caught her quickly swipe closed facebook as I approached her at home. She thought I didn’t see, but I did.. and since we share passwords (I’m not proud of this next bit) I went to the bathroom and logged onto her Facebook... and checked the search bar. Sure enough, his name was there and I quickly snapped a screenshot. A few moments later, when I finished in the bathroom, I refreshed the page, and it was no longer there. I went out to the living room and tried to be blank with her, but she started to catch on and got defensive before I could even say anything. She said “are we fighting, or what’s your deal?” And I said no, let it go, and have been playing nice since then.. that brings us to now. 

The questions:
I genuinely don’t believe my S/O would physically cheat, not cheat at all actually, but this evidence has just got me thinking the worst. So, is it possible she really accidentally messaged “him”? And what should I make of her hiding her interest in him? Are there any glaring signs im missing, or obvious other pieces of evidence for or against her cheating? I really *reallllly* want her to be innocent. In fact, I truly believe she is. But this is too big of a question to go unanswered.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otjyaz/should_i_be_worried_about_my_girlfriend_cheating/

17,otkaiv,1627510235,Things started off so well but then she pulls a 180?,"Met a girl online about 5 weeks ago and after 2 weeks of talking she invites me to go visit her (we're several states away). We planned a weekend together and that happened about a week ago, which was about a month since we first starting talking. It went great. You would think that the way we interacted that weekend we were a couple of some considerable time. We made out a lot, held hands non-stop, both of which she initiated first by the way. We were very physical but in an intimate and affectionate way. It was clear there was a strong connection there. We got along very well too and spoke and never really had any dull moments. Before I left she told me she was so glad I made the trip and to keep in touch. It was obvious the weekend was a success. However, I was still unsure what the next move was for me. I really liked her but I thought that if I made a move right then I'd be appearing too needy and moving too fast so I took things a little slower (even though I was ok with moving fast).

The following week after that (last week) I was busy with work and had a major setback there so I wasn't really 100% that week, but I still managed to text her throughout the week. But that whole week I was thinking how to escalate this thing because we both like each other. Then monday this week I tell her I want to come visit her again and she throws me a massive curveball. She basically said she didn't like how I didnt express my feelings about her and the trip. I realized I shouldve communicated better but tried explaining that I acted that way because I didnt want to come off as too needy and push her away until I was sure I knew what she wanted. Thats the whole reason I planned this second trip to see her. Now shes basically saying shes not sure if she wants something romantic, which doesnt make sense as she clearly did a week ago. I ended up telling her how I did feel about her and opened up but somehow its not really doing much. 

Just shocking as things were looking so great until that text. The texts in the last week were not indicative at all of her having lost any interest either... Looking back it seemed she wanted to move fast but again, I had met her just a month ago and as a guy 1) it takes a little bit to open up to people and 2) you dont want to come off as needy and pushing things too fast. 

Now Im just giving her space and letting her decide as I told her my stance and what Im looking for. Think thats the best move but curious what you think about the situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otkaiv/things_started_off_so_well_but_then_she_pulls_a/

Yay for me, I guess? Here’s where the issue is, my standards are high but I can’t get people who reach them. 

Physical appearance matters to me, but I always end up settling for less which is very upsetting. I’d expect a guy to be taller then me (at least 5’10+) and to have a decent body (doesn’t need to be a six pack, but no dad bods). Also, I’m a black girl and I’ve noticed that I strongly, strongly prefer a white guy over a black guy. 

Heres another issue, I’m really not all that. I’m cute, but I’m skinny and flat and I sort of have a boyish figure. Defiantly not the beauty “standard” for a female. That often makes me want to settle, but I just can’t be in a relationship with someone who I’m not 100% attracted to. Personality is also extremely important, and I haven’t found an attractive guy yet with a good personality.

I put effort into making sure I look attractive and absolutely love meeting new people and my goal is always to see how I can make them laugh or have a good time because I feed off of the positive energy and truly love it. Fortunately that sometimes results in people giving their number to me or asking if I want to hang out or go on a date sometime. Unfortunately, I’ve wiggled out of almost all these encounters with girls because I have a problem.  Due to some unresolved childhood trauma, I do not feel comfortable having sex. I promised I would work on it with a therapist this summer but between having work 7 days a week, calling 3 full practices, and having my doctor recommend me to a marriage counselor, I became discouraged and it slipped away from me. If you were looking to date a guy, would this be a dealbreaker for getting into a relationship with them? I understand sex isn’t everything but it is still very important in a relationship and a complete absence of it is different from it just being bad or something (especially at my age and in college). Just last semester I had 3 separate girls belittle me after trying to explain why I wasnt ready for sex or hookups and while I now know that isn’t how they should have treated me, it didn’t make it any less discouraging. Should I keep looking or would it be more fair / smart to my potential partners if I wait until I work it all out with a therapist?

She is tired of the confinement and wants me (26F) to show her around. She lit up like a Christmas tree when I accepted.

She did her research and wanted to go to specific places for sightseeing, for shopping, to eat out and do outdoorsy activities like hiking and taking lots of pictures. Next thing I know it is getting dark and she wants to have few drinks for the road, once we were done she is holding my hand and being kinda mellow.

At her door she hugs me tight and asks if I'd like to come upstairs  to brag to her roommate about her new awesome friend. I'm flattered and figured it'd be rude to decline for no reason. She introduces  us and I'm automatically invited to come around anytime.

Now I'm back at home and I'm trying to figured out what has just happened. Maybe there are cultures where people are naturally affectionate and open. Which is cool but what if she's into me? Was that a date? What do I expect to happen from now on?

38,otlqas,1627514958,Girl I'm seeing flipped out on me - what to do now,"So... the girl I'm seeing (for 3+ months) at the beginning, she wanted to work towards a relationship; I wanted more of a low-key FWB situation, or at best a go-with-the-flow scenario. For the first month, we were on totally different pages until one day after we went to the coast, I realized she probably wanted something more than I was ready for.

We went back and forth - she said, ""we can either be friends or work towards a relationship"" my compromise was, ""how about, let's see where this goes? No FWB arrangement, but let's flow with things..."" so the arrangement was take it day by day.

She brought up commitment recently, to which I said no - she then mentioned ""well, I would like that you start spending the day with me rather than coming over late and having wine then us sleeping together, I'd like to do things during the day, I need you to show up on time and I want you to plan things.""

I come over to her place at around 7-8 on Fridays/every other weekend, and this tends to be spur of the moment. She told me she would rather have me plan things, and that she is the one always planning/inviting me a week ahead. Ok. Well, I didn't/can't change things all at once... so... last weekend, she texted me on a Friday to invite me over for dinner the next day.

I didn't respond until after she called me the Saturday evening - I forgot to text her back about the invite. So, instead of calling her back I texted her around 6pm Saturday in response to the 7pm text she sent me on Friday about coming over for dinner. She texted me back with, ""why are you texting me this late to decline my invite - after I called you?"" I was with friends, so I didn't want to respond.

Later on, she said, ""You are being cruel. You know I don't like to be ignored.""

I didn't think anything of it. I know she has had a history of being cheated on, and she's in therapy for it, and I'm aware of that. She then texted me the following morning ""I cannot do this with you anymore - I feel like you don't care about me. I've been trying to see you for more than 2x a month, I want you to plan things, I want to know what's going on with you, and I get nothing. This is cruel and mean. All the best, but this can't go forward.""

I freaked out because I thought it was so disrespectful to break up/part over text. I don't want to lose her - and we are now taking space - I'm really angry with her for doing this, but I don't know how to continue. I want her in my life, but I can't deal with her thinking I'm being dishonest and her projection of thinking I'm doing something shady, when I wasn't - I admit, I also didn't tell her what I was doing - I thought if she had a problem, she would've called.

So I told her how angry and disappointed I was; she triggered me, and she knows I hate text messages (I prefer calling over text), and I hate it with a passion. She did it anyway, which I thought was very selfish. After I told her everything, she apologized and sent a letter. I wasn't doing anything bad or harmful to her - and I wish she would trust me that I wouldn't do shady things - she said ""had you told me what was going on, I would've been ok. I only see you 2x a week; I'm not even sure if you're still on dating apps - you don't like to text, you are ridged with planning...what else was I supposed to do?""

We meet every so often. Sometimes I can be in her city for 4 days or so and we usually meet several hours a day as long as I am staying there. Sometimes I can visit 3 weekends in a row and sometimes it can take a month or two between meetings.  


I like to stay in touch with her when I am away but that isn't really her style. We haven't had any serious talks about it. She is just slow to reply. I am used to it taking at least a day before she replies. Sometimes she wants to chat for a while but it varies a lot.  


Every now and then she takes several days to reply and recently she went 8 days radio silence so I got worried that she was actually ghosting me. She wasn't. She is mentally ill so she was having an episode that lasted longer than usual. She closes down when I try to talk about it though. Like she is embarrassed to tell me what really is going on.  


Our dates when we meet in person are usually fantastic. The time in between are pain though. Our communication over sms is pretty bad. It makes or breaks my day if she answers or not. I usually just send her a simple message with a picture of my cat or something.   


Sometimes I get a quick answer and a conversation going and sometimes nothing for days. Then after 5 days I get a giant heart emoji or something and feel good again for a few days.  


I guess my point is that I let her make or break my day. I need to be doing normal stuff like working out and meeting friends when I am not with her. I am doing those things but I let her take up a too large part of my life when the time we get together isn't too much.

I checked his LinkedIn profile &amp; found out that he has recently gotten accepted into a  PhD program at my university.That means he’ll be moving to my city soon. I also know that he’s a real human because his PhD supervisor is a friend of my mom. Maybe that’s how he found me on FB.

I know I’ll probably run into him on campus this fall because my university is pretty small. I am planning on acting super friendly, receptive, warm &amp; kind when I do see him. I’ll also dress nicely &amp; look my absolute best.

We get into a few arguments every now and then but it’s never been anything bad.

The only thing that’s been a strain in our relationship so far is how different our life philosophies are- I KNOW that sounds stupid but basically he is a huge realist and pessimistic. Because I was lost support from my parents for being gay, I have to work a LOT on top of school so as I’ve grown I’ve become very fixated on positivity. This makes me a very sensitive person and I def think I can be “toxically positive” in some cases for sure.

This gets in the way of our relationship sometimes because my boyfriend is very critical and sort of mean when it comes to jokes. He can also be unnecessarily argumentative which stresses me out as someone who’s admittedly very defensive. But we’ve talked about it and he’s come a long way with being kinder.

However, today I got a text from him saying “what the fuck is wrong with you” while I was at work, I was so anxious and confused so I ran to the back to read the texts, and basically he was really upset about a spill I didn’t realize I made and left. It got on his stuff so I think he’s totally in the right to be upset, but the way he spoke to me in the heat of the moment made me so uncomfortable and anxious. I understand that people just get upset sometimes and lash out but I feel like saying “what the fuck is wrong with you” and being that passive aggressive and upset over an accident is concerning.

About a half hour later he sent another text, this time it was really long but calm and communicative. He just explained that he felt that I wasn’t as respectful of his things as he was to mine. I think that’s a very fair thing to be upset about and I understood his point and ofc was very sorry, my concern only lies with how he initially reacted? He also never addressed the way he spoke to me in the heat of the moment.

I can’t tell if I’m being too sensitive or if this is a valid concern.

51,otmocr,1627518403,My boyfriend (22M) and I (22F) are stuck,"I think I just want help thinking this all through so I’m going to run through my thoughts and my thought process here.

My boyfriend and I have been together for just over half a year now but we have been friends for 5 years. I met him online through playing games with friends and we had an on and off long distance relationship for a couple years. It never really worked out previously because I couldn’t handle long distance with all the stressors in my life. Overtime I was able to developer better skills for coping and handling stress so we decided to give it another shot. I love him, he is the perfect boyfriend in every meaning of the word... he’s kind, considerate, loving, caring, funny, like truly, he is wonderful. He loves me unconditionally and unquestionably, when we talk about problems he does his best to accommodate and talk it through with me (I try to be the same for him but only he could say if I really am &gt;.&lt;). I see him once a month if I’m lucky but there are no guarantees and it’s getting more difficult to plan the visits here just because we’re both a little more busy. (It takes a plan ride or a 6hr + car ride to get to each other )

So now the “issue”, it really is just with me, but basically it feels like there is a piece missing from it all. The biggest obstacles for me with the distance are the lack of touch and the lack of romance. It’s so easy in distance relationships to just get stuck in a routine, doing the same thing every day, and that’s what it has felt like lately. It’s hard to find ways to be romantic from so far away but it feels like he doesn’t try. He won’t make an effort until I’ve brought it up multiple times as a formal issue and even then he will probably just continue to do nothing. 

I suppose it just feels like he doesn’t listen and then I feel not heard and feel less inclined to share when I’m having a problem. It’s something I want to work through with him so if you’ve ever beeen in a distance relationship please let me know how you maintained it :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otmocr/my_boyfriend_22m_and_i_22f_are_stuck/

53,otmzhi,1627519534,I’m 21 with almost no experience. My lack of success is starting to really affect my mental health.,"Hi all. I am 21 (M)and have never dated in my life. Sufficient to say, I am still a virgin. I’ve tried asking people out, dating apps, attending social events, bars etc. to no luck. Either they are already dating, just had a break up, or just straight up not interested. Any sort of connection I did have was short lived or nothing came out of it. The loneliness, FOMO, and the feeling that I will be single forever is ruining my mental health. Especially with so many of my friends either dating or married. 

A little background: I have a degree in Mathematics and a well paying corporate job. I’m super nerdy; I love gaming, anime, and of course, Math. Physically I’m not the hottest guy around, but I do take care of myself and am decently fit. 

These are some characteristics about myself that I think attribute to my lack of success. I grew up super religious and sheltered. I went to an all boy school, so when I went to a public college I had no social skills and was at a middle school level in terms of dating knowledge and experience. 

That said, I’m no longer awkward and can hold a decent conversation. However, I am so worried about my lack of experience. If/when I finally do date, I would have no idea what to do.

I didn't develop proper social skills as a result. It also made me insecure about being 5'7. I missed out on my entire teen years and never partied, never had a girlfriend, never did anything crazy or memorable, no lifelong friends, and ofc never got laid. 

I graduated 2 years ago and I'm headed for the same trajectory for my 20s, still no partying, no hook ups, no girlfriends, nada. I dress much better, got ripped, grew my curls out. But I haven't been laid in over a year, with the only 2 bodies under my belt being from tinder. In other words I've never naturally been able to get a girl into bed. The last time I asked for someone's number was in Jan, she never texted back. The few friends I use to have &amp; cousins my own age have been getting action naturally since as young as 15. My entire family is good looking but I'm the only one who can't get sex. My older cousin came over the other day and bragged about these 5 diff hot ass girls he fucked when in Miami, 1 of them even being a young stripper that wanted to take HIM home, and that really made me feel shitty. Feel even shittier when the fam says I'm handsome and that I can get any girl I want, will be a heart breaker, and that I'll have to fight off advances by multiple woman. None of this is true for me but the same cousin will get hit on and called hot anywhere when I'm with him just by existing; drive thru, gym, I've seen it all. I'll never be whistled at or approached like him

Everyone says these are supposed to be among the best years of a young single man's life, it all only makes me feel like less of a man and ashamed. A lack of meaningful relationships &amp; friendships, lack of fun crazy but memorable wild experiences, shit everyone else here seems to have done and more when my age.

We constantly update each other about our personal lives, problems, relationships - you name it. I'd say there has always been a little bit of attraction to one another on both ends, even if we have been with different people in the past.

We kissed once, when we first met. He tried to pursue things but I wasn't in the right headspace, so we agreed to remain friends. 2 weeks ago, we drank outside with other friends. It's been the first time we've seen each other after a while (because of the pandemic), and we shared a drunken kiss. Since he has recently shared that he isn't interested in being in a relationship, I thought he wouldn't make a big deal of the kiss. 

Since then, he has already told me how he feels about me and he pretty much seems serious about being in a relationship with me. I haven't said anything back to him because I'm unsure of my feelings. Definitely there is attraction but I don't see myself getting serious with anyone just yet since I've just gotten out of a 2-year relationship.

60,otn9ex,1627520551,"(24M) Is there such a thing as a guy being ""too"" attractive or the wrong kind of attractive to be taken seriously in dating? Or is this just a comforting lie?","Just to preface this, I'm not trying to be arrogant here in asking this. I went from underweight, less attractive, and less confident to in great shape, much better styled and groomed, and much more confidence. I'm just trying to present my experiences objectively for context to help try and understand why it's caused such a difference in reactions from women. 

So I'm a 24 year old guy and the common consensus I see here on Reddit is that the more attractive you are, the more attention you get, the more receptive women are to you, let you get away with more, etc. 

While that has been true in places like Tinder (has absolutely exploded since), in real life my experiences have been the exact opposite; women were much more friendly and receptive to me when I was underweight and less attractive. Whereas now that I've improved myself quite a lot, I find that women my age are generally much less receptive/standoffish to me whereas everyone else (men, older women, etc) are significantly friendlier to me now. 

Recently, I was talking to a (quite attractive) woman I once dated and this topic came up and here's some quotes from her:

* ""Ngl I was shook at how how you were the first time we met""
* ""I can see why you'd get the cold shoulder from girls""
* ""If you came up to me, handsome as you are and introduced yourself, my friends would write you off pretty quick""
* ""Hot guys are hit on for something short term""
* ""Maybe your pool of people are relationship people and they assume you're not because you're hot""

I also find that I'm commonly either directly or indirectly assumed to be a fuckboi/player just based on the way that I look; e.g. before I've even had a chance to have a proper conversation with them.

So is there such a thing as women being intimidated/distrusting/put off by an attractive guy? Or by the ""wrong"" kind of attractive guy? Or is this just more of a comforting lie people tell themselves?

I don't think I'm anywhere near the level of attractive that could feasibly cause a reaction like this but given the huge difference in receptiveness, I'm curious if there's any merit to that at all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otn9ex/24m_is_there_such_a_thing_as_a_guy_being_too/
61,otndhh,1627520955,"Would you lose interest in a someone if they were taking too long to text back, even if they were otherwise a good person?","I matched with this guy on tinder back at the start of June. I was getting a lot of matches and found it difficult to reply to every message, until I realized I didn’t have to. I think I ended up responding to him almost a month later when he sent a follow up message, and his profile shot up to the top. I was planning on deleting the app because of the types of messages I was getting, and just realizing I probably wasn’t going to meet any of them. Anyway, I ended up giving him my number in a “what the hell kinda move” and deleted tinder. 

I feel like I can tell that he’s a genuinely nice person, just based on the few conversations I’ve had with him and snooping around his IG. The problem is, this man takes anywhere from 8-18hrs to respond to a message. And because I don’t want to seem like I’m jumping at every opportunity to talk to him, I take just as long to reply. But this is petty and I don’t like these kinds of games. It sucks because I like him and want to see him but the fact he takes so long is turning me off. 

We’re planning on meeting up next Friday. I should mention that he asked me out and has been very flexible with the days and time that don’t work for me, so he is clearly interested.

81,otopau,1627525930,"Something is holding me back from developing deeper feelings for this guy, but I don't know if I'm being fair to myself, or if I'm being my own worst enemy?","I've \[24 F\] been seeing this guy \[25 M\] for about two months now, and have been on about 10 dates. From the start, I've always had this kind of mental block holding me back from opening up and developing deeper feelings for him. I think part of it is that I feel most like myself (goofy, comfortable, etc) around him, and it reminds me of how I felt with my ex, so it makes me scared of getting hurt again. I recognize though that feeling like myself and comfortable around him is a great thing. He's attractive (to me), smart, values mental health/therapy, athletic, the sex is great (he's the only guy that's ever made me orgasm from sex alone), and we have a lot of common interests. 

But, there are also some things that I don't know if I like about him or not. He always makes us split the check on dates and sometimes just let's me pay for the whole thing and never offers to pay me back (please don't crucify me for saying this--it's just a personal thing for me--I like it when a guy pays for the bill sometimes and I do NOT have a problem with splitting but sometimes his behavior comes across as cheap?? I also always used to offer to pay for stuff with my ex and sometimes he took advantage of that so I guess that's why now I look for a guy that is willing to pay for stuff without being asked to). He is pretty messy but that's not a dealbreaker for me per-say, but it does get annoying when we always spend time at my place and never his because he says its messy. He always gives me compliments but get's kind of jokey (but he's kind of serious) when I say thank you and don't immediately give him a compliment back?  Which kind of annoys me sometimes, but again not a dealbreaker.

**NOW THE IMPORTANT BIT..**Here comes the big potential red flags (but I don't know if I'm overreacting). He spent a full 24+ hours at my place one weekend. Came in the afternoon the day before, and didn't leave until the next night basically. This was probably like the 7th or 8th time we hung out together. He was supposed to leave in the afternoon after breakfast, but he said he wanted to stay longer to spend more time with me so I said okay and I was actually starting to really open up more. Then he said he had to meet up with some friends around 8pm. We had sex around 7pm (as well as multiple times that day), and he left at 7:30pm to go home and get ready to go to the bar with friends. He told me this elaborate story about his plans with friends that night, and i told him I hope it would be fun. He also had a short talk with me before he left saying that he wasn't seeing anyone else besides me on dates, and didn't think we needed to use protection because he wasn't sleeping with anyone else either. I told him, we weren't exclusive yet and I think it's okay if he goes on dates, but he insisted he didn't want to see anyone else besides me. 

Around 8:30pm-9pm ish I go to this restaurant with my friend on study break to pick up takeout, and I see this guy on a date.... I didn't see any of the friends he said he'd be with...only one girl. It killed me a little because it actually seemed like they were having a great time. And then I wondered if he only stayed at my place longer that day because this restaurant was right next to my apartment. I texted him saying that I thought i saw him but I didn't want to say hi because he seemed busy, and he didn't respond to me an hour later, and said if I was still at the restaurant to come hang with them. He then called me and hung up. I called him back 3 times and he didn't answer until almost midnight. He said he was with a friend and wish I could've hung with them and that he just dropped her home. I told him I didn't believe him and that it was okay if it was a date, I just wish he would be honest. He started to laugh and said ""wow I can't believe you think I'm lying, let me give you a timeline of events!!"". He gave me some bogus timeline of events, saying his friends were there but walked out and he ended up messing up some times, kept laughing at me for thinking he was lying, but I stood my ground and I basically caught him in his fake timeline of events. Then he said his friends set him up on a blind date with his friend from class and left mid way during dinner so him and the girl could hit it off. THEN he changed what he said, he finally admitted it was a girl he didn't know (she wasn't his classmate) and his friends set him up but were never there to begin with and that he never made plans for a date and didn't know where the date would be. I told him it just seemed weird to me that he fucked me 30 mins before this date and decided to go on a date hardly a 10 min walk from where I live. He said he didn't plan the date to be so close to my apartment, his friends told him to go to this restaurant. **The thing is**, after he said that, I remembered seeing a notification pop up on his phone from a reservation website/text thingy before he left my place, but he had taken his phone quickly and I didn't see what it said past that so I thought it must've been for his hangout with his friends. So I still think he was lying. But, I got hurt because he didn't need to lie. I told him it was okay for him to go on dates because we aren't exclusive, but he still lied and kind of gaslit me when I saw him with my own eyes on a date. And I understand why he wouldn't tell me he was going on a date prior to that, but why lie after the fact after I saw him? 

He came to my apt the next day to apologize because he said he wanted to rebuild my trust. He choked up on my couch and said he really wanted to still see me and had wanted to become exclusive soon, and to give him a chance to prove that lying isn't like him and this was a one time thing. He said he isn't going on dates with anyone right now. I said okay, and he spent the night, as well as came over the next day. So we basically spent three days in a row together. 

**Flash forward a week later**, my best friend messages me about a guy she matched with on a dating app AND ITS THIS GUY. Not only that, HE MESSAGED HER ON THE APP LITERALLY A MINUTE AFTER CALLING ME TO TELL ME HE WAS AT MY APT AND TO LET HIM IN SO HE COULD APOLOGIZE. Literally, when I checked my call log, he called me to let me into my building, and messaged her on the app 60 seconds later while I was on my way to get him. After he choked up on my couch and everything. I texted him and told him I felt like he was manipulating my feelings and that he kept lying about things he didn't need to lie about. He told me a month ago he hadn't used dating apps at all since meeting me, he told me a week prior he wasn't seeing anyone else. All the while I keep telling him its okay if he wants to because we aren't exclusive yet. So why lie when you could just not say anything?????

He told me he just uses the app as a confidence booster, and that he only messaged my friend with the intention of never going on a date with her. I told him it doesn't matter whether he would have gone on a date or not, I guess I was just bothered again about the lying. Then he told me I misheard him and that a month ago, when he told me he hadn't been using dating apps since meeting me *he had mentioned a specific app*. But I only recall him ever saying ALL dating apps. So now I feel crazy and I'm second guessing what I heard.

I don't know if I'm overreacting or not, so I'd really like a second opinion. Please be kind, I'm really trying to keep an open mind and not be crazy, because I do feel a little crazy for even being hurt at him. And these events have been keeping me from opening up and falling for him, but I don't know if these are fair things to hold me back, or if I'm being my own worst enemy and overthinking it? Any advice is really appreciated, because I don't want to be unfair to this guy. I think I've been patient and he told me that he would never have handled this as patiently if the roles were reversed. But, am I overreacting? Or should I be cautious and break it off?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otopau/something_is_holding_me_back_from_developing/

83,otoy2t,1627526866,"When women talk about ""bad boys,"" they really mean ""sociopaths""","I just read the description of a sociopath (antisocial personality disorder) on a medical site which is summarized as:

* Disregard for right and wrong
* Persistent lying or deceit to exploit others
* Being callous, cynical and disrespectful of others
* Using charm or wit to manipulate others for personal gain or personal pleasure
* Arrogance, a sense of superiority and being extremely opinionated
* Recurring problems with the law, including criminal behavior
* Repeatedly violating the rights of others through intimidation and dishonesty
* Impulsiveness or failure to plan ahead
* Hostility, significant irritability, agitation, aggression or violence
* Lack of empathy for others and lack of remorse about harming others
* Unnecessary risk-taking or dangerous behavior with no regard for the safety of self or others
* Poor or abusive relationships
* Failure to consider the negative consequences of behavior or learn from them
* Being consistently irresponsible and repeatedly failing to fulfill work or financial obligations

Then I realized this basically describes every single ""bad boy"" in any movie I've seen or any time I've known a woman who affectionately calls a guy this.

Also all the guys I can think of that I've known who checked off a lot of those criteria was very successful with women.

Examples of sociopaths in the media would be Christian Grey from 50 Shades of Grey, Reggie from Archie comics, Jeremy Meeks, Loki from the Marvel movies, etc.

85,otp504,1627527649,How Can I Get My Confidence Back?,"Hi all,

I (M,27) have been in two very serious relationships for long periods of time and have probably been single for 5 months in my entire adult life. My first LTR (5.5 years) ended with my partner cheating on me relentlessly for months before breaking up with me. They were emotionally and physically abusive to me and l was pretty shattered by it. My latest relationship I ended because once again it was emotionally abusive. Within a month my partner was dating other people and sleeping with them (we had to live together and I had to have it rubbed in my face everyday). Needless to say I am totally shattered right now.

At this point I don't know how to gain some confidence. I have pretty bad social anxiety, which doesn't help matters. I have learned how to manage it pretty well, but the fear of approaching someone is very real. I tried OLD, but my stock is pretty love as I am probably like a 6 in the looks department and a pretty odd guy in general. I am just kind of hurting for companionship and connection right now (and also sex!). Anyone else been here? How did you gain some confidence around dating?

86,otp5c9,1627527681,Doing the deed on a first date.,"I’m a 31 year old female and I don’t see why some people see it as a big deal to do the deed on the first date. I have no issue with it if I’m getting a good vibe from the guy and I like him. It wouldn’t change my opinion of him or make me think he sleeps around.

A friend of mine told me if you give it up on a first date the guy will see you as easy and not girlfriend material.

Does anyone else agree with the above?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otp5c9/doing_the_deed_on_a_first_date/

89,otpif0,1627529090,I asked a girl to hang out... and she actually did!,"Well, kind of... and it wasn't romantic, but oh well...

Two weeks ago I asked a girl in my class if I could hang out with her. She said she will invite me and a group of friends for tea and she will let me know. I said okay and went about my day.

Two weeks later she mentioned to me that it was happening and asked if I would be available. I answered. Yesterday she made a group chat with everyone involved. Then today she gave us a time and place.

It was a success! I managed to make one new friend and we mainly socialized about school funny drama in our classes. I got to know my friends as well. In the end we took a picture and I posted it on my Snapchat story. I had lots of fun. The execution was near flawless (albeit not perfect). This is a day that will go down in history. If I didn't ask if I could hang out with her then this would not have happened.

91,otpjqv,1627529239,I’m smitten.,"I (24f) have been seeing this guy (24m) for about 4 weeks now. We’ve had a couple of dates, but it will be a couple of weeks before the next one because of some stuff he has going on. We also live kind of far apart, which means we can’t see each other as much as I’d like. 

But damn I really like him. He checks almost every box for me. I’ve never gotten past the fourth date in any relationship, and at this point I don’t know how to act. Should I text him every day? Should I tell him vulnerable things about me? He doesn’t seem as invested as me, which terrifies me. I think he wants me to calm down a bit but I don’t know how.

Because I’ve never had a relationship, I’m extremely desperate for really just anyone to like me. How do I curb this desperation and eagerness so I don’t scare this guy off?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otpjqv/im_smitten/

After that, we didn't text for 2 days, I was hoping she would text me so I decided to text her.

Her respond :

""yeah it was fun""

It's been 2 days and we haven't texted.

93,otpopk,1627529811,Hit on by nasty lady at work,"I work registration in a hospital emergency room, and a mom brought her small child in for a fairly routine accident (being intentionally vague because HIPPA). I went in the patient’s room to give him his hospital bracelet and his mom was laying in the bed cuddling him. I asked him to stick his arm out for the bracelet and he reached over her lap towards me. I just put the the bracelet on him without thinking about it by my hands were centimeters away from her hooha to the point where the 2nd knuckle on my middle fingers might’ve made the smallest amount of contact with her zipper. 

She looked me right in the eyes and said “you have a soft touch” 

I thought to say “I’m sorry! Did I get you?” But my shock and discomfort at being on the receiving end of this apparent pass from a person who is literally holding their child only allowed something like “mmsorry” to escape my lips. She said “you’re alright” at which point I took two long strides towards the door when she called for me. When I turned around she was still giving me that look (don’t make me describe the look) and she said playfully “slow down, it ain’t like it’s got teeth”.

My mouth fell open and turned and went “gurl!” before nervously laughing it off.

On my way out the door I heard her kid say “what’s got teeth mom?”

She actually cute with a nice body but FFS in front of her kid! I’d heard years ago that single women in public with their children DO NOT WANT to be approached and this level of aggression completely blindsided me",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otpopk/hit_on_by_nasty_lady_at_work/

95,otptsu,1627530402,I’m tired of feeling bad for feeling bad about being single,"Let me engrave this into everyone’s brains including my own real quick: It’s perfectly NORMAL and should be ACCEPTABLE to feel loneliness and want companionship with a partner. 

I’m turning 30 in a few weeks and have never had a girlfriend; no, not that there is anything wrong with me, because for all intense and purposes I am currently the best version of myself I have ever been. I’m single and never had a girlfriend before because the right person just hasn’t come along yet and that’s okay. 

What really bugs me is when I see constant advice on Reddit along the lines of “work on yourself first”, “enjoy being single”, “If you can’t be happy on your own then you can’t expect someone else to make you happy.” “Maybe you should try therapy” etc etc etc 

The problem with those statements is that they always imply that person is doing something wrong or there is something inherently wrong with them…this is a silly assumption. 

I personally work a good full-time job, hit the gym 5 days a week, live alone in my own place, have a very supportive family and small friend group and even enjoy a numerous number of activities like hiking, amateur modeling, gaming and photography. I am in a great spot. 

Where I do struggle is dealing with the feeling of loneliness. Everywhere you go there is a constant reminder of how shitty being single is. Just this weekend I went hiking on my own to a beautiful location and all I saw the whole time were couples holding hands and enjoying the beautiful Saturday together; I was envious of them. 

I want to know what it’s like to have a date night, cuddle up on a Sunday evening watching a movie, celebrate Valentine’s Day, cook a meal together, have silly arguments, not be a fifth wheel when I get invited out and my friends bring their wives and most of all fall in love and be a dad. Some of the best moments in life come from being in a relationship. Some things you just can’t do alone and certainly not enjoy to their full potential; especially the being a dad part. 

Those are normal desires and it’s hard to cope, especially as you get older. Please stop making fun of those who are experiencing normal emotions.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otptsu/im_tired_of_feeling_bad_for_feeling_bad_about/
96,otpwlx,1627530714,Guy I’m casually seeing introduced me to his mom,"Long story short, the guy (21M) I’m (19F) seeing is leaving in September for his last year at university. I told him I’d like to see things continue past summer, he said that he knows how hard LDR is and he doesn’t think, and I quote, “it would be smart to go in with that mindset that might cause someone to get hurt” (my first thought was that he had a failed LDR and is hesitant to engage in another, which is totally valid). 

We’ve also only been seeing each other since June, so we agreed that we’d continue without a label and reassess the RS at the end of the summer to see if we want to stay casually in touch while we’re both at school. 

He came over on our fourth date, met my parents (bc I live with them and they wanted to meet him so it was sort of inevitable, he didn’t have any issue at all, even said he “really liked” my mom) 

I met his stepdad on our second date in accidental passing, then his mom (because she wanted to meet me) on our fifth date. 

Is this normal? Especially for someone who only wants something for the summer? Help please!! Lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otpwlx/guy_im_casually_seeing_introduced_me_to_his_mom/
97,otq54e,1627531670,"hung out with a girl and forgot to get her number, should i add her as a friend on fb and msg?","So, I (29m) was hanging out with a girl (26f) at my place actually, we have couple friends in common and one of them was visiting and crashing at my place over the weekend. And i picked her up and we hung out at my place and she crashed at my place on my futon with my buddy (the mutual friend, lets call him bob). I liked her a lot and from when we were hanging out, i could definitely feel that she liked me too. we got along great. I misplaced  my phone for a moment, and she was asked if she should call it, and then quickly said or maybe have my friend (bob) call my phone  (so maybe she was a bit shy about it idk?). And so as she was leaving she said we should hang out again, and i was said yeah lets hang out again soon. then my buddy came over to say goodbye / give me a hug, and i spaced out and forgot to get her number. 

This was on Sunday and i been kind of thinking about it since... and was wondering if I should just add her as a friend on FB and just message her to hang out and do something and get her number like that? We do have a couple of mutual friends on fb, and we did meet once before at my friends cabin in the mountains on a ski trip but we were both so drunk and i remember but dont remember too much (was 3.5 years ago).

But yeah, i did really want to hang out with her again, and was kinda annoyed with myself for blanking out and not asking her for her number, but i liked her a lot and wanna just hang out and kick it again even if as just friends be cool too tbh.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otq54e/hung_out_with_a_girl_and_forgot_to_get_her_number/
