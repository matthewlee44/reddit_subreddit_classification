For whatever reason, it's just not happening right now. I have a solid social life, a great group of both male and female friends, for the most part I got my anxiety under control, but it's just not happening. I'd say I am slightly better looking than average, and I am starting to see gains from the gym.  I'm starting to get really down about the lack of success so I'm deciding to take a two week reboot. Obviously, if someone comes on to me or it happens naturally, I would go for it, and I am going to keep going out and meeting people, but I am going to do everything with the intention of not looking to hookup. Hopefully that gets things back into balance.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkuov2/taking_a_break/

We went out for dinner last Tuesday just for something to do and if I stopped talking I would’ve started crying. I miss him. I miss how we used to be. I miss when I first came over to his apartment and we watched Netflix and fell asleep on the futon he had. I miss waking up in the middle of the night and him holding me so tight I couldn’t move, but I didn’t care. I miss laying on his chest and hearing his heartbeat. I wanted to hug him so f——— bad on Tuesday and I knew I couldn’t bc he’s screwing around with this other girl. And I went home and I cried. I cried harder that night than I have in a long, long time. 

I just told him tonight that no matter what he does I want him to be happy. I think he just kinda blew it off bc he was busy working. Not that it matters anyway but I wish I would’ve opened my mouth earlier about this, and I’m afraid if I do now he’ll get upset that I’m crossing the line. 

Anyway he’s moving 10 hrs away in March for a new job and last Tuesday was probably the last time I’ll ever get to see him. I’m so stressed out bc I want to open my mouth but I value his space and don’t want to interfere.

2,qkus0i,1635821770,Knights of the Golden Dawn,"Coming home from the millitary , I helped my best freind to found a knigts templar organisation iny old town. 

The town has the biggest industrial complex in the north. Around 5 000 men work here around the clock, welders from south Africa. Mason's from Poland etc. 
In a town that has only have 25 000 inhabitants. 

My ex left me for a contractor, she threw me to the wolfs. But I had one ace up my sleeve a long time freind from my childhood.

Susatan the farmers daughter, she was now a long time drug abuser. And had accumulate a horrible reputation. A wild heart, that had a soft spot for me. 

Liberating her from her old habits was a tricky game, but as long as she could smoke all the weed she wants. Getting her off the drugs wasn't that hard. 

I payed for her drivers licence, I bought her first car. I filled it with gas. 

I was rejected from the knights brothers, because of me being with her. I just didn't care. This is my only chance of having a partner so to hell with you guys!

But ofc, Susatan wild at heart

I woke up to my pickup starting (her car is at her parents ranch)  I call her... I really need the pickup for work. No answer... 

I had to have a colleague pick me up, then he drops me off at home after work. No work car there, this just makes me saaaad!.

5 days later... Vroom! I can hear my pickup pulling imto my drive way. It is Susatan! 

I run down to give her a hug, she brushes me off. Her eyes are glassy. ""You know you could have given me some kind of warning, like a plan or something"" I say casually. ""Pfff you are not the boss of me, she answers"".

She was still high on mushrooms, she had been tripping her ass off with the local celebrities on a farm out of town.

As hard as I tried, in the end she left me for a D celebrity. Who was married and had 7 kids.

She’d do the thing where she’d kind of nudge on me when she’d talk and we’d bump into each other. We were there until like 3 am because we did one of those ghost tour things. We hung out for a bit after and she took me to one of her favorite smoke spots near where she lives, we talked and sat for a bit,  then drove me back to her place. She invited me to spend the night and made up her bed for us but she said I could head in cuz she was still awake and wanted to watch some more tv. When I woke up she was still passed out on the couch. She woke up and we watched tv for a bit and said “sorry, because she didn’t think she was gonna pass out.” We were kind of sitting on opposite sides of the couch playing footsies so I perked up and asked if she wanted to cuddle but she said that “it was hard to cuddle on this couch and she was comfy the way she was,” so I took that as a blunt No and just didn’t try again and left a lil while later.

From the moment we met everything just felt right, great chemistry and conversation was easy and fun, within 20 minutes we were talking about a 2nd date.
We went on a pretty simple date, buying Mexican food and sitting on a little jetty over a lake to eat and talk.
As we got our food out, he pulled out his phone and said “wait let’s set the mood”, and played “that’s Amore” and opened a picture of a candle and sat it in front of us so it was like a romantic candlelit dinner. I was absolutely smitten. We sat there for hours talking, laughing, holding hands, snuggling into each other and kissing.
We discovered the most bizarre things we had in common which I haven’t met anyone else that shares these. Before anyone says he was telling me what I wanted to hear, he brought these up himself unprompted.
He seems so sweet, attentive, intelligent, witty, driven and it really doesn’t hurt that physically, he’s absolutely gorgeous.

It feels way too good to be true, and I’m trying to maintain some level of skepticism because of course I know about the love bombing of abusers, but this doesn’t seem like that at all.
He seems so genuinely kind and exactly the kind of person I hoped to one day meet. 
I’ve been holding off on dating much for the last two years because I had been hopping between relationships from the ages of 18-21 and really needed to take some time to myself. He told me he has also been single for about 2 years and also hasn’t been looking to get into a relationship, but said he really likes me and I think we both see great potential here.

I woke up this morning worried that it was all a dream, but sure enough I looked over at my phone and saw a message from him.

I’ve been walking around all day with a smile plastered across my face that won’t budge. It feels like this could very well be the first day of the rest of my life.
But, I guess I know I really should slow my roll and try not to let all the excitement cloud my judgement.

He asked if I get tested and I told him I was a virgin because of my religious background( he is also a Christian ). He didn’t take it in any bad way and I switched the subject. Towards the end of the date he asked would I like to go out on another date and I said yes and we both decided to go to the movies. Later that night we were texting and seeing which movie we wanted to see and what day. He later asked me if I’m a virgin because I haven’t found anyone I was comfortable with or am I waiting till marriage. I told him I was waiting and he said that was a dealbreaker and let me down gently. I told him it was understandable and that I would still want to be friends and hangout because I actually did have a great time with him. He said the same and we just kept in touch. His birthday was a week ago and I wished him happy birthday and we chatted for a bit. He ask was I free this past weekend and I said yes. We both love college football and have the same favorite team. He asked did I want to go watch the game with him at this new bar around our city and I said yes. He picked me up and we went (not a date just hanging out as friends). We had a blast and it was great. The waitress came to our table about the checks and he said just one and payed for everything. His friend was having a kickback and he invited me and my friend because I told him me and my friend were going out clubbing after. He said that my friend could meet me at his friends place. (The distance kinda made sense at the time). We went to his friends place and asked what club me and my friend were going to and I told him. He looked it up and just like I told my friend it was in the middle of nowhere lol. His vibe gave off “that place is way too far and he didn’t want me going to the middle of nowhere” he said me and my friend could just tag along with his friends. We did but me and my friend just went to the club next door. The next day he asked if we got home ok and I said yea. I joked about him not knowing the movie from where my Halloween came from and said we need to have a movie marathon and I asked when we was free. He’s coming over this weekend for it. 
What kind of friendship is it when we’re not dating but he still pays for everything and is pretty protective of me? Also I’m not complaining it’s just that the friendship happened in a unconventional way. It wasn’t like he didn’t think I was cute or wasn’t his type but because of me waiting till marriage.

21,qkvoi8,1635824898,Weird chat on Snapchat,"So... I've not had the greatest luck with dating apps lately, and have been matching with only a very few pretty bad matches (far away, not attractive, not into men, etc.)

I am a 32 y/o male, treat people with respect and kindness, and am very smart.  But I'm not the most photogenic, have pretty poor access to photos of myself other than selfies, and just generally find online dating difficult, especially since the pandemic (well, met a couple really great girls it didn't work out with right before it, then nothing for almost 2 years now...)

So, when I saw a Tinder profile that put a Snapchat/invited ppl to message, I figured I'd take a chance, even though this is normally a great way to unintentionslly meet scammers, internet prostitutes, or bots...

Anyways, talked to this girl a little, she seemed like an actual person, kind of flirty, but not generic/obvious scammer responses, and then got this after a little while:

""U want my content (flame emojii) btw?""

To which, surprised, and a little hurt this might also be someone looking to get into my wallet rather than my heart or my pants, I responded:

""I don't know what you mean"" (strangely this reply was *saved* by the girl)

Reply: ""U want my hot (flame) content?""
Reply: ""U know .. pics/vids etc...""

Me: I don't know what you mean by ""content""
Me: That sounds like something a TV network or something would use
Me: Like you might be selling me something...

I thought about this, decided I might be coming across wrong/ offending an innocent girl (who'd only expressed a seemingly sincere interest in a ""FWB"" situation before)

Me: I mean, that's not what you're doing right?  (At least, that's not what I understand ""FWB"" to mean)  it just sounds weird saying ""content""...
Me: I hope I didn't upset you by saying that's what it sounded like...
Me: I really like talking to you, and don't want to offend you by getting the wrong idea or anything...

This seems like it might be an exploitative situation (someone trying to exploit me or get me to buy ""sexy"" content after feigning an interest in me as a person), and indeed, JUST as I am writing this, got:

""Oh ok..Im looking for a SD too btw..😅""

[I'm pretty sure SD= ""Sugar Daddy""]

It seems like this is just another Tinder girl who only sees $$$ signs when she talks to me (and I am by no means rich, old, or ugly- just the opposite on all 3 accounts, actually).

Am I misreading this entirely?  Usually I get angry at the apparent scammer/prostitute/vid-girl well before this point, but I've become concerned lately that I might be being too quick to judge people, and I really don't want to be THAT person.  I believe strongly in ""judge not lest ye be judged.""  I just want a person who's sincerely interested in me, as a person, and I don't want to partake in any illegal activity.

&amp;#x200B;

In September, I (26yo) met him (26yo) on Tinder. After a few days of chatting, we went on the first date and I would say it went quite well. Since then he has been quite enthusiastic in the text messages by literally telling me what was he doing throughout the day (e.g. photos of his meals, how's his job, the places he visited). At the same time, he has been flirty to me by saying tonnes of sweet words, and I've been slowly getting more invested in him. But yeah, I did not ask what was he looking for on Tinder, but seems like he wants something serious or long-term. On the 5th date, I was invited to his home for a sleepover. We did not have sex but cuddled a lot, and it triggered me to confess my feelings and say I really like him. However, he just said we barely know each other (we only knew for 5 weeks) and he would like to take things slow. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a few days, he started to be distant and dry by replying to my text very slow and non-emotional. Like he used to have many emojis but not anymore, and he often ends the conversation by ""lol"" or ""yeah"". But during these few weeks, we still see each other once a week by having meals or hanging around (he initiated once, me twice), though nothing couple-ish or sweet. And I did not mention exclusivity again. While he barely replies to my text throughout the week, the most annoying thing is that I saw him keep using Snapchat or messenger or whatsoever during our date, like keep texting somebody when we are eating. I did ask him why he behaved so distant recently and he just said he got busy with family and work. I am sure I am being ghosted but I am not sure why he still spent the time to meet me in person.

There have been a couple of girls who I was physically attracted to so I tried to ""force"" myself to like them but there was just no spark. 

Well recently, I got a job as a busser in a busy restaurant. My first day there I saw a pretty girl who worked as a hostess there who caught my eye. I didn't think much of it as there are cute girls everywhere. I didn't get a chance to talk to her at all since it was so busy that night and the whole restaurant is just pretty loud in general (even if I did get the chance I'd probably be to nervous to introduce myself anyway).

The next day I was working during the lunch shift, where the restaurant was much less busy and somewhat quieter. This girl, who I'll call Becca, was also working and she introduced herself to me. Because she was a hostess and I was one of the only bussers working that day, we worked pretty close together. This only made my crush worse.

Not only was she pretty, but she was super nice and fun to be around in general. I'm still new to working in a restaurant so she was helping me along in any way she could (ie. showing me things that I missed). She would ask me for help with small things when work got slow so that I wasn't just standing there like an idiot. She would kind of tease me when I'd make mistakes, in a lighthearted way.

She was also pretty touchy. Not in a sexual way but she would stick an old piece of tape to me when she'd pass by, walk super close behind me in a joking way, and would generally just touch my back as she passed behind me. Like I said, it was still busy enough that there wasn't enough time for full on conversations, but I was crushing on her pretty hard with all those little encounters.

So now I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure if I'm just reading too far into this, she seems to be pretty friendly in general. I don't really get the chance to talk to her much since the restaurant is usually pretty busy and we typically get off work at different times.

I'd really love to ask her out but I'm afraid that she might not feel the same or that she already has a boyfriend.

31,qkw3yd,1635826418,Breakup advice,"First time post whoop!!

I was dating a guy for 7 months. I met him before covid, and he was separated at the time. His divorce finalised during covid. We had a really stable and close relationship. He would call twice a day to chat and we were each other’s best friends. So many laughs etc.
I’m pretty anxious and it rears it’s head sometimes. I asked him around the 6 month mark what he felt we were as I was curious, but that I was forming strong feelings and needed to know if I should back off. When we spoke he said he was a ‘slow burn’ type of guy, and was more important in building a strong relationship and foundation than rushing into things and saying big words. He also said he genuinely isn’t sure what he wants in the future and wanted to take it slow, but that we were definitely exclusive and together. I was happy with all that.
Then 3 weeks later we got into a terrible flight when we were both drunk. I embarrassed him and also (don’t quite remember) told him I didn’t want to waste my time with him and wanted to know if it was going anywhere 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ (hello anxiety)
Since then, long story short, he has ended things. He said it isn’t to do with the fight (although how can it not be), and that he just isn’t sure where he sees it going. I reminded him that just a few weeks earlier we had discussed this and he was fine with it. I think the fight, and then my bloody words, scared him away. I will always feel like I ruined it.
His last message to me has confused me. He told me so many wonderful things about me and that he didn’t want it to end and wanted to give it time, that he cares deeply for me and will continue to, but ‘continuing while not being where you are emotionally is not doing us a favour’.
I don’t understand as he was fine with this and then not fine all of a sudden. My heart says he got scared. We truly had a great connection and he has also said that in another text. It’s been 7 days no contact. What do you think? Will he cool down and contact again? I never got to say goodbye and let of me is wanting to text him that, but art of me also just wants to see him to talk.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkw3yd/breakup_advice/
32,qkw7yi,1635826830,Next Steps,"So me and this girl I’ve been seeing are discussing becoming more serious. I asked about being official a few days ago, and she said she wanted to do a few more dates first and then later we texted and pretty much she would be down but wants to know how I feel about sex, and also is worried I don’t know her enough (we’ve been dating almost two months now).

The sex stuff was easy to talk about, but now I am anxious about the other part; how long that takes, how to go about that getting to know better, and just the wait game is exciting but anxiety-inducing haha. Anyone have any suggestions for best approach to this step? 

I want to get that stability of being official, and from what I understand she wants to make sure that I do like her for who she is (and is worried I don’t know the real her).

33,qkw8es,1635826878,I denied myself happiness with him because I have a horrible past. Feel free to rip me apart. 26 F,"I have been raped twice, roofied, and sexually assaulted all by different men. 

And because of this, I struggle with chronic suicidal ideation and it’s awful. Only Reddit and my therapist know; I haven’t actually told anyone because I don’t want to drag anyone into my misery. 

Anyways, I met this guy who I didn’t think much of at first, just slowly got to know him. And found out over time that he was everything I wanted in a partner. 

He is 6 years older than I am. 

And the moment I figured it out was watching him very calmly handle one of our students who was going off on him and talk him down from his behavior. 

That this guy brought me calm and peace after a lot of years of traumatic pain and abuse. 

However, my suicidal ideation reached a point of terrifying reality in the spring, and I briefly decided to be stupid and tell him I had feelings for him, but didn’t want to do anything about it, because we worked together. 

He still to this day doesn’t know the truth. 

I denied myself happiness with him because I don’t want to drag anyone else into my pain; I don’t know how long it’s going to be until I get better. 

Even with consistent therapy and meds. 

The only bright moment I had with him was over the summer when we went back to normal and I popped my head in the door and said “Just so you know, I’ll always mean what I said in May-youre by far one of the most amazing people I’ve ever met.”

He’s hard to pull a smile out of and that day I surprisingly watched as he smiled from ear to ear at my words and gave me a hug before I left. 

Whatever girl marries him will be lucky.

We kissed and eventually slept together, and I left feeling even deeper feelings for him. 

After coming back, I called him and let him know that I wanted to try long distance but he immediately told me he wasn’t up for that, and that he didn’t like me enough to put in the time and effort long distance requires. 

I was crushed, but feel that if he wasn’t truly interested in anything, he most-likely led me on while we were together.

49,qkx9vp,1635830862,Is it weird to start a conversation with someone you're interested in using Facebook?,"Hi all,

First I'll give a bit of background and explain why I'm asking. I'm 26(M) and have been what I'd consider single for about 6 months. My last somewhat legitimate relationship ended about 6 months ago when she moved across the country. I'd just bought a house and was about to start grad school, so me joining her was out of the question. We also had a bit of a rocky relationship due to some mental illness and other really unfortunate situations and when she decided to move i forced myself to cut contact completely. She was probably the only girl I've ever truly loved and i found it extremely difficult. It's been a rough few months, for sure. 

Funny enough, I didn't like grad school and dropped out 4 weeks in. Quit my job right after that as well and have just been working from home, glassblowing, writing and reselling stuff from auctions. Oddly enough I'm making more money than I ever made before. I also have roommates so I'm paying almost nothing to live in a house way nicer than I have any business living in. 

Anyways, after giving it some thought, I think i'm ready to start dating again pretty soon. A few problems with that, though. I work from home and never meet anyone new. All of my friends from college moved away years ago and my other local friend groups have become disjointed. Even my best friend of 8 years and I rarely speak anymore as her and I have seemingly nothing in common and I got tired of putting in effort. I pretty much just hang out with my dog and talk to my roommates and occasional old people at auctions. I've tried online dating and actually had reasonable success as far as matches go, but every time I met up with them I was pretty disappointed. I eventually just deleted my accounts and really don't want to resort back to it. 

Anyway, i'll cut to the chase. For the past few months I keep noticing this girl I'm friends with on Facebook. I dont really have much of a presence on social media, but every time I get on Facebook and see something she's posted I'm just impressed. She's super pretty, for one. But she also just seems like a super genuine person. She's a single mom and I can tell that her daughter is her number one priority. It's just super wholesome to see their photos together, and for the past few days I've been randomly thinking about whether it would be weird to message her and ask her on a date. I dont really know her at all. God knows when we even became friends on there. I have no idea what I'd say. 

My main fear is being seen as creepy. Every girl I've dated has had creepy dudes constantly messaging them and I refuse to stoop to that level. If I was to do it I want to make sure its in a way that's respectful and not at all pushy or weird. I just don't know if there's a way to do that. And before someone asks, no, dating a girl with a child from a previous relationship wouldn't bother me at all. I want a family one day too. Dating someone that has a head start on that wouldn't bother me in the slightest. 

Thanks for any help or advice.

Bf told me she is always watching his back for him, she warned him about his exs and she turned out to be right about them having red flags. 

Que a couple weeks ago I found out she was screenshotting memes I’d shared joking about depression/sarcastic humor etc and she told him that was a red flag. Because I have poor mental health(what millennial doesn’t appreciate a little self depreciating humor??). Since then there have been a few times she felt I was ‘too friendly’ with someone on one of my posts (my literal sisters husband that’s like my brother once) and she told him that he needed to end it with me. I also noticed she accidentally liked an IG photo from 5 years ago so… she’s been snooping. 

Bf brought these things up as concerns, and then went on to tell me she had been the one who informed him. In all, I’m starting to feel really weird about this and a part of me wants to unfriend her.

63,qkycsc,1635835447,How to not let a crush interfere with life?,"I have been seeing this man a few years older than me consistently for about two months now. We first hung out in March of this year for about two times but I was going through a break up so I decided to take time to myself. I decided to start seeing him again after returning back to the city following the natural disaster that caused me to evacuate. We went on our first actual date to a nice restaurant and he proceeded to ask me to be his date to his coworkers wedding. We initially will see each other once a week and I have also been involved in raising his new kitten watching the cat when he was gone and out of town. Last week we had a conversation in which I expressed that I was very into him and liked him but as I am finishing my graduate degree soon I need to focus on finding a job. He responded that he hadn’t tried to put a lot of pressure on it as he won’t know if I will be here come January. Ever since we had that discussion I feel our relationship has changed a little bit with us now talking to each other more frequently not just when we want to schedule a date or when we are going to see each other next. 


This weekend he had a friend visiting town for Halloween and we all went to a concert together. I ended up spending the night at His place Friday through Sunday. On Sunday we were out and I dropped off him and his friend at his apartment. He is a very private person who enjoys personal time and I figured he would want to spend some time with his friend however he seemed surprised that I wasn’t sleeping over and told me that he wanted me to.

That being said I think is very evident that we like one another, however I cannot stop pondering or questioning how he really feels about me. I currently work the equivalent of 60 hours a week and I had told him that I had not had the time nor desire on my part to be setting up dates with other people, however  had indicated that he had been on a few dates. We also expressed to each other that we have a crush on one another which was pretty sweet. Either way I feel that I am just overthinking things and am hoping that someone can give me some advice and how to best move forward",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkycsc/how_to_not_let_a_crush_interfere_with_life/

Because twice now I’ve connected with post-break up men, one five months out of a five year and another one year out of a 10 year + some marriage. And it happens the same way:

-They express interest. Telling me they like me or whatever. 
-Then they say they’re not ready to date because they need to work on themselves or are confused. 
-But then I find out they have a date set up with another girl and it’s always someone they were “talking to” before or “met” before me. Always that they already had some “standing” date with this girl. 

Like if you’re not ready and are so confused then why have you been setting up dates with girls that you met even before me when you should’ve been even LESS ready?

79,ql0bxs,1635844791,Don't let someone guilt you into being in a relationship with them.,"So I'm a 24 year old gay male. I met this guy on Grindr a couple weeks ago. We eventually started communicating over text. He seemed personable and interesting. I enjoyed his personality a lot at first but I wasn't sexually attracted to him. I told him that I wasn't looking for a relationship and that I don't like to have casual sex. He immediately took that super personal and started badgering me about how I should just have the courage to tell him I wasn't sexually attracted to him. I lied to him and told him that wasn't the case since I didn't feel like being rude. This wouldn't be such a big deal but because I didn't tell him that he immediately started to get super clingy. He started excessively mentioning how he really wanted to be intimate and calling me ""babe"". He also sent me really ""seductive"" voice messages about how he really liked me and other stuff. It made me feel really uncomfortable. At first I assumed maybe it was cause I wasn't attracted to him but after some thought I think it was his incessant need to be able to have me as a partner that really soured my feelings. Again I liked our conversations on a friendly level but the sort of rush to operate as a couple made me feel like I was just a fixture in his wants and desires. So this dynamic has been playing out now for a couple weeks and even though I never engage him in romantic conversation he still constantly pushes it. To the point that I feel sick. It's very demanding and it feels almost like I'm being guilted and shamed into wanting to be with him. I've had experiences like this with other guys. I'm just sick of it. I'm tired of people pushing me to want to be with them. Why can't they accept that maybe it would be better for us to be friends? I just wish some dudes could accept that maybe I don't feel in love with them but that doesn't mean I won't be friends with them.

I am a 23 years old guy, who would like to hear any ideas to improve my dating chances. I have never had a girlfriend, doesn't even hold a hand of a girl. I would really like to have a long-term relationship.

Here is everything which can be important:

Physical attributes: I have an ugly face. I have experienced several things that proved this. I am also overweight. 130 kg or about 290 lbs. The only thing I like about myself, that I am 6 '1, and I do not show signs of balding. I have a very simple haircut. 

Seggs: Unfortunately my size down there, cause me some anxiety. I am at the bottom 5-10% in that regard (according to statistics). I am more than willing to compensate, but this does not mean it will be enough. For some girls this is simply not ideal, to put it mildly.

Clothes: Nothing special. Black Nike trainers, jeans, piquet shirt, branded (Nike, Adidas etc.) hoodie (I love these. Comfortable and practical). Of course I have some fancier shirts, a suit, but that's all.

Interests, hobbies: Formula 1, history, science, cars, computer games. Learning about anything interesting. Like the Discovery Channel, when it was good...

Social: I have no true friends. A big red flag, I know. I simply can not connect with others. Maybe because my interests? Otherwise, I think I hold a good, but not close relation with others, such as my classmates. I do not like parties. I do not smoke or drink.

Career: I just started my PhD in a science field. For the next few years my only income is that little money I get from the University scholarship. ( I would like to concentrate on my studies.) I live with my parents, but at least I can save money.

My ideal girl: Kind, intelligent, has similar views about life, share some of my interests. Do not drink or smoke. Looks does not matter much, but i have some deal breakers: bad hygiene, piercings, tattoo in visible places.

I've noticed a  lot of guys I meet on tinder are overly aggressive about sex and intimacy. It's like the idea of just exploring friendship isn't possible. I've had many guys block me because I wouldn't send nudes or do other bs. Most recently I had this experience with a guy that started out fine but quickly became really uncomfortable. I tried to establish a friendship with this guy and at first we really hit it off well. It seemed like we had a decent connection. However after a few hours or so of conversing he started to become very very persistent about sex. Telling me how much he likes me and how he wants to cuddle and all kinds of ""seductive"" stuff. I tried to play it cool and basically tell this person that I'm not looking for sex. They didn't get the message and kept on going with messages about how much they want to be together. Now I don't know what to do. I find it a bit overwhelming and somewhat of a turn off to be consistently propositioned for sex. We could just hangout but now that I know they are super intent on having sex it just feels a bit uncomfortable. Part of me is upset that we won't be able to establish the same kind of friendship with this forced tension. I think it's not fair to just expect sex from everyone you're friendly with. For starters it's unattractive and very manipulative.

95,ql241u,1635852419,Is it okay to not feel 'love'?,"Looking for guidance on if I could have handled things better. 

I got into a relationship with a girl a couple weeks ago. We matched on a dating app mid August, and began dating early October. We had met up a couple times, and would call and text quite frequently.

I was definitely very interested in her, and cared a lot for her. But at the start, I had to ask her slow down, as I didn't want to rush a relationship. Once we began dating, she would say she loves me, and it was very hard for me to say it back- I liked her a lot, but love is a strong word. 

I felt strong bouts of infatuation, but I didn't want to say it unless I was really sure. To my fault, I once replied with ""I love you too"", but using the word felt very uncomfortable. 

Over the next couple days she would occasionally say it, and I would say I liked her a lot too, or just continue on with the conversation. I mentioned that constantly saying how much I like someone isn't something I find comfortable, but that didn't change. 

About a week into 'officially' dating, we had a disagreement as she asked ""why won't you say it back? Are you not sure of me?""

We ended it the next day as I couldn't keep up with the speed and intensity she wanted, and didn't see myself catching up soon. 

I still follow her social media, and I know I should stop. It's been a couple weeks, and there's still stories that are definitely pointed at me, which often are to the lines of ""the guy made a mistake, and doesn't deserve the love"". 

It's hurtful as I definitely cared, and still do care about her. But I felt two months of just knowing someone was too soon to genuinely feel love.

96,ql276y,1635852754,Interested in a guy that is on a break with his partner,"Hello everyone! I’m reaching out for advice. 

I am interested in a guy at my school, but I recently learned that he has been on a break with his gf almost 3 years; they started dating their freshman year of college. 

I see him after my class and don’t usually say hi because I feel a tad shy. He is my first crush in 3 years. Though I still maintain confidence, and I believe that shows in my body language. I’m not sure if I’m right on this, but I think he thinks I’m pretty?  

I would like to express my interest to him, and I finally had a conversation with him not too long ago. I don’t think he wants to go out alone with me. At first, I suggested that we go out for a meal along with his friend (which I want as well ofc, but I hope to go out with him alone), which he agreed to. Before I left home, I mentioned it again but said just the both of us. He then mentioned the new friend (his friend) I made coming along. Also, he is popular around campus and is very involved. 

I still didn’t meet him and his friend, but I wish I could tell him I’m interested in him. I go to a small school, and I worry his “ex” might do something, as my other friend said she might do. 

Thank you for all your help!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ql276y/interested_in_a_guy_that_is_on_a_break_with_his/
