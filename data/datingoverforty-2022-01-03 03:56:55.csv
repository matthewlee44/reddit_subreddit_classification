0,ruzgcf,1641208632,What are your thoughts on men (or women) moving forward really slowly in dating?,"Lately I am on the radar of 2 men (who of course are on my radar too). Both are divorced and with some emotional baggage, around 48 years old.  With one, we met and have a sort of LDR (the next step would be to meet again), and with the other I have not yet met him in person but he has indicated that he would like to eventually meet.  

I am quite an impulsive woman, in the sense that I tend to go with my intuition - if I like someone, I just know it, and I will move forward quite quickly.   However these men, despite my positive signals, are moving surely but veeery slowly. At this stage I do not doubt their interest, but I am genuinely puzzled as to why they are proceeding ever so slowly.    

Any  thoughts?  I am particularly interested in hearing the views of persons who know that they proceed very slowly.   Please note that I do not judge - I merely wish to understand, since for an impatient person like me this is a pretty hard situation to be in :)",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ruzgcf/what_are_your_thoughts_on_men_or_women_moving/

I've been dating this guy since the summer, and throughout the time there were a few things here and there that bothered me a bit. I let them go because he seems generous and kind. We also have a language barrier - and I feel like I'm not myself with him, especially as the relationship gets deeper, I feel I can't express myself in a way that he understands. 

The things that irk me - he has diabetes - I don't know much about it - (type 2) - and he eats candy and he eats badly (cake, danishes, muffins), and drinks diet drinks all day (like 2-3 a day). He drinks wine I'd say most evenings, sometimes a full bottle on his own. This seems very bad for type 2 diabetes...

I have mentioned it before - but he tends to joke about everything a lot. Like all the time. So a mention of his sugar levels is met with a joke. I thought at the beginning of the relationship, the sugar thing was just a problem here and there, (it was high occasionally) but it's consistently bad.

I guess what I'm saying - is it okay to let him go for this? there are a few other little things (how he parents and his jokes about other serious matters)- but I guess I've reached a point where I am no longer comfortable.

Those of us who left our marriages had 100’s of thousands of dollars siphoned into their lost ex’s and subsequent divorces, but we rebuilt through grit and hard work. I had to re-establish my own security by duct-taping the scraps post divorce, my dear friend had to sell her practice and her home, but has now re-established both and is the sole provider for her children, another dear friend was in a 1-bedroom with her 3 kids post-divorce after her husband pulled crazy antics and lost all their assets, but she now has her own home and a stable career. The married ones are the financial anchors, advancing in their careers while their spouses (some in the same industry!) whine at their own fate and call their wives “lucky”. As for us single ones, most of the guys we meet are like our exes: lost and unmotivated. None of us are looking for someone to support our livelihood or bolster our lifestyle. But we are looking for individuals with healthy self-esteem and resilience. What’s going on? Is it psychological? How can we find our match in terms of independence and self-motivation? I’ve met exactly two men so far who exhibit that missing thing. Doesn’t matter to me one bit that they make less than I do.

I am on the curvy/chubby side but am rather athletic, and have been noticing a pattern where my older dates (50s) seem put off by my shape (and some even alluded to that) but younger men seemed turned on by my appearance - I was “smoking hot,” and I heard/learned the word “thicc” as a compliment (I personally prefer zaftig, but whatever).  Younger or older, I could keep up with them on the trail or at a sport, so it’s not about fitness per se.

I’m trying so hard not to generalize about large swaths of the male population (and hence hesitated about posting lest this go against the rules), but it was such a noticeable and puzzling trend that I was curious whether anyone has any insights.

17,rveb03,1641249906,How do you handle STD testing when dating people who are also dating multiple people?,"When my partners and I (39F) have had the sex talk in the past, we were only dating each other at the time so getting tested and showing recent STD test results were no biggie for either of us. That was like 10 years ago and none were from online sites which probably made it easier to be monogamous from the get go since we met at a meetup or volunteering and started dating that way. Neither of us were actively looking or dating which is what I’m trying to say. Now that I’m using online dating I’m finding the guys I date are also dating others (which is fine) but they are sleeping with them too. So far I’ve been waiting until they aren’t with anyone else and that’s worked great because I find it very hard to be intimate with someone i don’t have an emotional connection with. So the time we spend outside the bedroom while they are sleeping with others works for both of us.

The problem came recently with a guy (45M) I’m really feeling a connection with, and though he is sleeping with one person right now, I was willing to let that go since we discussed birth control and STD protection. The problem came when I asked him to get tested with me and he said sometimes him and the other girl have sex without condoms if they don’t have any. He said it’s not often but he asked if I need him to get tested every time he sleeps with her with no protection. I told him I understand some STDs have a few month incubation period so it’s always the possibility he can test negative before something shows up so I asked him a few more questions. 

First I asked him what does he need before he can see if he wants to be exclusive with someone. I was trying to understand the timeline of how he saw things going with me and the likelihood that he would continue sleeping with her and me at the same time for much longer. Then I asked him if she was sleeping with other people too, and if they had gotten tested/shared results at anytime. I was shocked when he said I was the first woman who has ever asked him to show test results before sleeping together, and he said him and this other woman never discussed getting tested, they slept together on the very first date and it’s never come up after that. He also never asked her if she was sleeping with others. 

He ended up asking her and when she said he has been her only partner for the last month now, I asked if he wanted to be exclusive with either of us . I appreciated his honesty in saying that he wanted to explore our sexual compatibility before he made that decision but something was still making me unsettled. We tabled the conversation when I said I was having hesitations- I explained it as my body is saying yes I want to do this, my heart is saying I want to feel this connection in a new way, but my logical mind is like proceed with caution. 

The next week when we went out to dinner he handed me a print out of his test results that showed everything was negative. I was happy and I even made the joke “someone is going to get laid tonight” lol. But then he was like it was weird, because he asked her to get tested too, and her test came back positive for HPV. I just put my face in my hands because it turned out my logical mind was really my intuition. He didn’t understand why that mattered for us, and I told him that there is no testing for men for HPV unless they have physical symptoms, so he may have it and if we have a condom mishap he may give it to me. He kept saying that’s a lot of maybes, and we shouldn’t worry about that, but I told him that some types of HPV can lead to cervical cancer, so this is a big deal. I work in pharma and the medical field so I’m not speaking out my ass or being unnecessarily paranoid. 

No surprise nothing happened after dinner lol and it turned out when he brought it up with her again it turns out she knew she had HPV, but she was hoping it would have cleared away by now. She said that almost everyone has it or gets it so it’s not a big deal, and when he mentioned the cancer thing she said that it’s rare and hers isn’t cancerous. They stopped dating because though it takes two people to agree on having sex without protection, she engaged in the risky behaviors knowing she potentially had an STD still. 

Since then we also stopped dating- we ended it the night we were going to have sex lol. I had to wait until my appointment for birth control before we   could do anything, so it was like a few weeks he ended it with her. He was supposed to come over that night, I cooked a really nice dinner and we were going to watch the new matrix movie on HBO. After about 30 minutes when he hadn’t showed up, I sent him a text and he immediately called me. I knew something was up lol. A couple of days prior he got drunk at a bar and ended up going home with a girl he met. He said it was just a one night stand, but he felt so guilty about it he didn’t think he could come over. I was  like, we aren’t exclusive so you doing that is on you, but did you wear a condom? He couldn’t remember and they didn’t exchange contact information when he left in the morning. 

So i’m wondering how do you all navigate STD testing when dating while you and/or the person you are dating  has more than one sex partner?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rveb03/how_do_you_handle_std_testing_when_dating_people/

19,rvheyo,1641258506,Brand new…go easy on me and tell me I’m not crazy?,"38 year old female.  Married for 15 years with 3 kids.  I have been recently separated (last year) and moving forward w a somewhat confusing divorce.  I probably shouldn’t have jumped to OLD but, curiosity got the best of me and honestly at first, I really didn’t even picture myself going through with an actual date!  I’m very young looking and talkative, my most accounts I think men find me attractive and maybe I was just looking for a confidence boost since it’s been soooo long!

Fast forward to meeting someone, lots of online communication, setting a meet up. Really didn’t see any red flags at first, not that I would have known anyway.  Gave my phone number per his request before we met.  Date was a little more wild than I anticipated.  I was very nervous, he was super outgoing and talked more than me (which I rarely come across), drank way way too much and should have seen the red flags.  Kissing, lots and lots of compliments on my physical appearance, invited me back to his place, etc.  I did not oblige but sort of just thought he was outgoing/silly/over the top.  Ended up hanging out again the next night, at his place (again, please go easy on me).  Texting all day, etc.  

Basically, this continued on, although we usually only get together once per week.  He has said many times he’s uncomfortable that I’m still married, which I understand but as we are coming up on 2 months, I’m started to think….this is a narcissist and how have I been so stupid!!!  We text everyday but if he expresses annoyance at my still being married and then I respond w something mature like…let’s talk and get together…it’s met with comments like “you’re getting weird on me”. We have very sarcastic banter but occasionally he will say something “you’re joking right?  Bc you sound psycho”. Even if it’s something silly like “oh you took 7 hours to reply….hmmm”. Now, if I don’t answer him in a few hours he will text w a sarcastic “I see how it is”.  He’s also referred to his ex wife and ex long term GF as “psycho” but won’t elaborate much on what he might have done wrong.

None of this was CRAZY to me for a while.  For one, I attributed his hot/cold way of making plans to him wanting to keep a distance bc of my “marriage”.  I respected that.  Now I’m realizing I was just being played!  Our times together were always fun and don’t get me wrong, I didn’t do anything I didn’t want to do.  Our overnights were fun and intimate really with lots of cuddling and good talks.

The stress of waiting for texts back on some days while getting floods of them on others or not being able to express any actual feelings for fear of sort of being made fun of or made to feel like I’m seeing this as something it isn’t is getting to me and I’m feeeling like such a moron for not realizing I’m most likely dealing with a narcissist.  

So my experienced ones, am I crazy?  Is this just part of the inevitable learning process of adult dating?  And what do I do now?  It feels weird to block and if I call him out he will say I’m crazy (he says all woman are crazy).  I can’t continue.  The further I go the harder it is to not care.  Right now I figure it’s been 2 months, I can get over anything that only lasted this long.  It’s my ego more than anything else.

Be sure to notice these red flags and run before you get too invested 

Things I’ve been lied about in the last year 
1. Residence: still living with ex husband, lives abroad and looking for a partner in other cities/countries, lives abroad but has a apartment here they visit once or twice a year 
2. Dating history: says they’ve been a devoted wife for 10 years but really been in an open marriage and performed BDSM acts with strangers for two years while still married. Shares story of a ONS without seeing if it makes me uncomfortable 
3. Security: say they’re trusting and in love but accuse me constantly of cheating, spying on them, drugging them… with me doing nothing to raise such suspicions. Hides social media accounts from me
4. Dating goals: claim they’re looking for a serious relationship but still check their OLD profile while dating me. Claim their looking for marriage but can’t let go of their previous relationship/marriage name/feeling for ex 
5. Work habits: claim to enjoy frequent communication and contact with me but as soon as work gets a little demanding will abandon plans or show up much later than they said they would without confirming. Comes over but is buried in laptop working despite claiming they’re here to see me. 
6. Children: tell me they want more children when they don’t (or aren’t ready)
7. Status: hides the fact they are divorcing their spouse on social media. Doesn’t tell friends, even “close” friends that we are dating despite putting their face on social media 
8. Gaslighting: says something mean or hurtful then blames me for it. Says something unflattering then claims they didn’t say it. Whenever I voice a concern she says it’s due to my anxiety or something else 
9. Rudeness: says they’ll call you in a hour but doesn’t call back for a day. Says they be over to see you at 6 but call four hours later saying they haven’t left yet. 
10. Intimacy: demands sex to be more rough and kinky without asking if I’m ok with it
11. Quality time: set up time to see a movie or cook a nice meal and they are staring at their laptop or phone. 

People like this are very broken and do not deserve the gift of your time or attention. I just wish I had listened to my gut and dumped them on the first date.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rvj9c6/dont_ignore_red_flags/

How bad did I blow this?,"I've been trying to date after a long marriage (almost 20 years) and finally after a string of bad dates I met someone on tinder that I really liked. We exchanged some messages and set up a date. Send sent me her number before the date which seemed odd.

We had drinks then got some food and we're both having a great time. She's 100% my type, smart, sophisticated, attractive and we had a ton in common (she's recently divorced too). When we left the restaurant I just gave her a hug goodbye but then offered to walk her to her car. Then she's kind of looking at me so I kiss her and she hits me with tongue. I just ask when I can see her again. Did she want to hookup here?

We setup another date and go to a nice dinner. Everything goes well. While we are walking outside she asks something like, ""so what do you want to do"" I can't remember exactly what I said but it was something stupid like ""I'm just enjoying hanging out with you."" She grabs my hand as we are walking to the parking garage and then more kissing and I probably said some borderline boyfriendy stuff that I regret. We part. She texts me when she gets home and just says she had a good time and sent me some music that we had talked about.

The day after she texts me and says she's not ready for serious dating and that's not where her head is. At this point I'm super disappointed because I really liked her. Also I'm disappointed that I didn't at least try to hook up as that's what it seems she wanted to do. Even though I wanted a relationship a hookup would have been amazing after being divorced.

Went on day with younger woman never married and never had kids.
Went great both agreed there was chemistry. She asked for my number and asked to kiss me. She mentioned she was aggressive which I’m fine with.
She texted that night she had a great time and wanted to do it again.
Well the next text conversations got kind of more personal nothing to sexual. We talked about pillows on the bed, fans on or off , how we slept. She mentioned she slept naked and was aggressive at cuddling  and-her pet didn’t cuddle as much as she wanted. My comment was clothes get all twisted and I can see the reason for sleeping naked and maybe she’s overworking the pet and he needs a break. She asked if I wanted the job position, I said I’m a hard worker and great at cuddling and will work for free.

In person -

Pro: More personal.  Could ellict more emotions

Con: Puts the person on the spot.  If it's not the answer you were looking for, feeling may be hurt

Via Text -

I have kept in contact with an ex from 3 years ago (37m) who had broken up with me 4 months into our relationship because he had only been divorced for a year and wanted to play the field before settling down again. 

Through our talks, it sounds like he's ready for commitment. I've told him that I feel like I'm too boring for him. He says that he wants ""safety and stability"". I've told him that I'm broken right now and need to work on making myself happy again before I get into another relationship. He has also just gotten out of his first ""relationship"" (dated 2 months) since we broke up and understands that it will take time...or so he says.

I've kept in contact with him because he is an AMAZING father to his 3 girls. If he put that same effort into a relationship that would be one EXTREMELY happy woman. 

My therapist asks what my hesitation is. What's the worst that could happen? But I find myself holding back from him. He asked me to come over tonight for wine and cuddling. I get the feeling like he just wants sex. (Our sex life was amazing but I'm not craving it right now after my breakup.)

He can sense my hesitation and the tension between us is thick.

46,rwdtop,1641356124,Dating with a hidden disability,"I have a unique story. I'm a 43f and have never been in a relationship.  Long story short, I was born almost fully deaf. Deaf in one ear and severe hearing loss in the other ear. I spent years learning to speak and read lips with the support of a hearing aid in the ""good"" ear. I grew up in a hearing family and, as a teen/kid I didn't have much of a social life in public school. I am not part of the deaf culture and don't use ASL. I spent many years focusing on school and have a good career as a public school teacher. Therefore I feel like I'm a bit behind the curve relationship-wise as I didn't have access to same communication tools. 
 It was hard work navigating hearing loss in a hearing world, especially with communication.  It wasn't until texting and instant messaging that I started to form friendships and meet others. I've tried OLD with mixed results. I'm told I'm quite attractive and many people are surprised I'm deaf as I speak fairly well, albeit with small deaf accent. I've been on different dates over the years but it's been a while at least 8 years.   I just got upgraded my hearing aid for a cochlear implant a few months before the pandemic. It's been fantastic. I'm very self-reliant and fine with my own company,  but lately, maybe it's age and  it's probably due to hearing much better with my new cochlear implant,  but I want to see what I'm missing out on.  This includes sex as I'm not very experienced in that field at all. 
My question is, when past relationships are asked about how  could that be answered? Or sexual experience? Also how would you want to know that someone has a hidden disability? In a profile or in person? Through a casual mention? I've got a lot to offer and hiding in my shell (though not entirely by choice) isn't working well.

50,rwp7nk,1641395878,Reflecting on some things recently,"I've been out of the dating pool for a while... I spent a lot of years traveling for work, so meeting someone serious didn't seem practical. A couple months ago I accepted a different position in a new city that doesn't require much travel. Now all my friends live far away; I don't really know anyone here. It feels like I'm starting over.

New Year's Eve, I got an unexpected call. A good friend's teenaged daughter drove eight hours to see someone nearby, but he ghosted her, so she had nowhere to go. She asked to crash at my house. She showed up, and we spent the entire night talking, catching up, and walked around a nearby ocean pier for a couple hours in the morning. The following afternoon, she took off to go find the boy she came down to see.

Since this is reddit, I feel obligated to say that nothing happened between us. I'm a close family friend who's known her most of her life. My best friends are my family, and that's exactly how I see her.

But after she left, it surprised me that I missed her. Not specifically her, though. It was so nice to have someone here with me. Someone to talk to and share things with, someone to help explore this new area. I've been alone for a long time, but the whole thing made me realize this is the first I've felt lonely.

I'm a social person, and don't have problems meeting people, but I haven't really connected with anyone here yet. It's making me consider online dating, but I haven't done that in about ten years. I did fairly well in my early 30's, but I didn't enjoy meeting people that way, so I'm reluctant to try it again.

A big part of me thinks that dating isn't the answer, that I need a core group of friends here, and the rest will fall into place. But I'm sure you all know that making close friends can be pretty challenging in your 40's. Meeting people is easy, meeting the right people is hard.

But at the same time, am I wasting time by not actively looking? Until now, I've been perfectly happy by myself. And suddenly it feels like so many valuable years have slipped by.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rwp7nk/reflecting_on_some_things_recently/

53,rwr2zy,1641400942,M40s having insecurities with new relationship,"I'm sorry in advance for the length of this, but feel like I need to include all relevant details. I could really use hearing some other viewpoints on this, because I'm catching myself in a crazy cycle of insecurity.

I (M/early 40s) have been dating a woman (F/late 30s) for almost a year. I'm in the late stages of divorcing my ex (and have a few kids). We met via dating app about a year ago, and we've been pretty much inseparable since then (we've basically been texting every few hours since our first date). We started seeing each other once a week for a month or two, then twice a week (at least). Our personalities are kind of different, but we really get along, and have a great time with each other. 

We first had sex about 6 weeks after our first date, and it was absolutely mind-blowing (at least for me). Since then we've been having sex pretty much every time we see each other (sometimes twice a day), and started having overnights a few months later. We didn't have the conversation about exclusivity until a few months ago (although I was exclusive since we first met - not that I necessarily expected her to be, just that I didn't want to have to deal with the weird emotions about seeing multiple people, and I found this relationship very promising from the very beginning). I told her I had feelings for her about six weeks ago, and while she she made it clear she had feelings too, she ""wasn't ready"" to say the words just then (she did a few weeks after that, and regularly says she loves me now). We've formally been BF and GF for a few months.

I've had a handful of insecurities since we started dating (all resulting from my poor marriage). These insecurities generally relate my performance in the bedroom and overall sense of self-worth. I had a really poor sexual relationship with my ex (who was never all that into sex, and had some very specific things I needed to do in the bedroom to satisfy her, so it was always completely clear when I was ""getting the job done"" with her). This woman doesn't seem to have specific ""requirements"" for what I need to do in the bedroom, and she seems to enjoy sex. A few months after we started having sex I mentioned this insecurity to her and asked her how I was doing. She sort of laughed it off and said that if I wasn't getting the job done she'd ""let me know right away."" I didn't bring it up further because I wanted to take her at her word, and didn't want to appear completely insecure (and figured time in a healthy sexual relationship might cure this insecurity).

We had sex a few nights ago and it didn't seem all that fantastic for her. It was a bit rushed, she wasn't as into it as she usually is, she didn't want me to go down on her (which is something my ex required to orgasm, but she doesn't seem to like all that much, strangely). Basically the opposite of how she usually is. My insecurities started to come out right away, and I brought them up as we were still lying there. She didn't laugh them off this time, but she said ""you're good, don't worry about it"" (but it seemed like she was blowing me off). I told her this was important to me and if I wasn't taking care of business I'd definitely want to know, wouldn't be offended, would welcome any advice she had, etc. She sounded like she really didn't want to talk about it, just told me not to worry about it, so I left it there. 

This insecurity is starting to bleed into other aspects of my feelings for her. Because I was married for close to 20 years, I'm fairly sure she's had many more sexual partners than I have (and this isn't a problem for me at all). This insecurity is starting me down a path where I start thinking that she's comparing me with other guys she's been with and I don't measure up, I start thinking that she's likely to jump ship the moment an old boyfriend comes back into the picture, she isn't actually in love with me and is just settling for me, etc.) 

Was it possible she was just having a bad night? How do I (and should I) continue discussion on this topic? If she tells me everything is OK, I'm inclined to take her at her word, but to me the difference between getting the job done and not getting it done is obvious, and if she tells me I'm getting it done when all evidence says otherwise, it's going to continue to bother me. It's at the point that while every single thing she does and says should objectively tell me that everything is good, but I'm starting to convince myself it's all going to fall apart suddenly. 

Thanks for letting me vent. Any advice is appreciated.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rwr2zy/m40s_having_insecurities_with_new_relationship/

Over the course of 12 years of marriage, I've come to realize that my spouse is never going to contribute her fair share. I will outwork her every day of the week. She won't plan things, won't make decisions, is generally unwilling to discuss things without a big blowup first. She is moody, although not unbearable.

I've tried to address this stuff. Not well received. I get either mockery, denial, or an attempt to address it and then nothing changing. Ive also tried to ignore it, and just not let it bother me. She refused to go back to work after the kids, and with COVID, I see now how she spends her days. It's about an hour of house work, and 8 hours of naps, texts, dog walks. Nice life that I'm subsidizing.  I dont really feel like I have a partner. 

On the other hand. It's not terrible. We mostly get along. It's not as thought life is unbearable here. I have thought a lot about ending things here. But I worry that maybe it's me. I am driven, I work a lot, I workout a lot. She is none of these things. She wants to be happy and coast through. 

We have kids. They are used to be traveling for work, and I like to tell myself that they will be ok if we split. I would obviously continue to be an involved parent. 

But worry is that I would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. I enjoy having time alone (only child), but do I want that every day, day in day out? Do I want to be dating? Am I likely to find someone that makes this change feel worth it? I'm a romantic at heart (she is not). I would love to know that I will find my happily ever after. But, how likely is that?

So, from where you sit, knowing what you know now. Is it worth starting over? I'm not happy. I know this. But I'm not convinced that I would be much better elsewhere. 

Last thing. I'm reasonably attractive, early 40s, above average income (I'm self-employed), pretty outgoing, relatively fit. I'm ok with casual encounters, but the point of separating would be to find happiness first with myself, and eventually with a forever partner.

75,rxy6jx,1641528419,Cancelled.........Again,"Ahhhh the dreaded text…

Hey, sorry but I’m going to take a raincheck on tonight’s date. Perhaps we can reschedule sometime…..

At this point I know I will never, ever meet this woman.

I have gone through this more times than I care to count. But here I am, dealing with another cancellation a mere 4 hours before the date.

I am annoyed. This type of behavior has become the norm, and I don’t like it.

Most of you reading this probably understand this all too well.

Here is some context - 

I (M50) am a musician with my shit together. On Hinge I get about 2-3 likes a day. I am not a model, but I would say I do pretty well.

OLD has become toxic. 

I am pretty serious in wanting to find a life partner, and I don’t understand the constant ghosting, cancellations, and lack of civility.

I make sure to be open and honest to anyone I am dating, whether I am interested or not. Doing the right thing should be the minimum one should expect from a potential date.

Just the other night a woman called me an asshole for telling her that we weren’t a match.

Why, you ask?

She used a lot of filters on her pictures, cat-fished me, and was high. 

Yet I was the asshole. 

Dating should be fun. You go out, have a couple of drinks and hopefully great conversations. It doesn't have to be that complicated. 

Maybe it works out, maybe it doesn’t. 

But at least you get to spend a few hours getting to know someone new.

That doesn’t even exist anymore. 

It’s not fun anymore.

The reality is that swiping, social media, and ludicrous expectations has turned us into entitled 

Idiots.

Never settle! They say.

If that is the case, then we will all die alone. 

Because there is no perfect person!!!!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rxy6jx/cancelledagain/

This is why I’m posting today. So he was visiting me today before we were going out for the evening. We were watching telly sitting next to one another on the sofa and he picked up his phone from the coffee table and was hunched over his mobile while checking it in such a way so I couldn’t see the screen. As moments before we were talking about where to go for dinner I had originally thought he was checking restaurants. Nothing of note my rational mind tells me. I have been cheated on by an ex in the past 5 years ago so I’m sensitive of any change of behaviour with phones. I told my insecure part of myself to back down, as I often do as I’m being silly nothing to worry about etc. What made me think something was a bit off was he normally sits back while looking through his phone. I’m not one to check someone’s phone screen even when someone is sitting next to me as I respect people’s privacy. As he was sitting in such a fashion for a good few minutes I let my curiosity win and I changed how I was sitting so I could see the screen. He was texting a woman. Now I know he has female friends as well as male and I’m not one to be jealous of my partner having female friends but I felt he was hiding this message chat from me for some reason. I felt confused. Lines of thought - Who is this person and so forth. Later at dinner he had a message and was reading through it he said a friend had sent him a news article. He opened the text as soon as it beeped even though we were talking. I told myself he has other friends it wouldn’t be the same friend. After dinner we went to the cinema and before the adverts came on his was texting, I looked over and it was the same woman from earlier and noticed a new article thing on the feed. Something else I took note this person was replying to his texts very quickly. Something else to note is that when he visited me after Christmas he was getting a good number of texts, I told myself most people are off work so they’ll want to get in touch. One time though we were watching a film on telly and I was talking to him about something as he didn’t respond I looked over and he was holding his phone next to his leg texting so I couldn’t see. I thought that was odd at the time now I’m wondering if something is up.

Is this something to be concerned about or is it just my own fears getting the better of me?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rxy80c/hiding_text_messages_from_me_not_wanting_me_to/
77,ry031e,1641534374,Update: How do you avoid liars and cheaters in OLD?,"Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rvpap8/how_do_you_avoid_cheaters_and_liars_old/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). 

I know I’ve been a train wreck, but I actually got some good advice along with the negative judgement. I have been trying to get an appointment for STD checking, but the health department here locally is full on appointments for 6 weeks out. I’m looking into other options but one actually gave me a panic attack because it is service that sends you to the place where he works to get the urine and blood drawn.  

I was able to find his girlfriend’s phone number. I signed up for a free phone number service app, and I texted her from that. I sent pics of his Tinder profile, proof we matched, and an explanation that he was there, I’d slept with him, that she needed to get tested for STDs, and I said I was so sorry. 

She responded back asking when, denied it could have happened, I offered proof, then I sent it to her. 

She believed me. She confronted him and he said he never slept with me. I said “Well, he did. And if he’s lying about me, there are probably others, and you need to look out for your own health.” She called and asked questions, I answered honestly, and she said it all sounded exactly how he had gotten her.  She called him to the room, asked him again, he said he didn’t sleep with me. I maintained I’d sent her proof already, and I wasn’t 12 years old, so I’m not going to go back and forth about it. He knew what he did, as he most certainly did have sex with me. She had me on speakerphone, she said, “what do you have to say about that? …. That’s right, nothing, because you know you did it and so do I!”  

She said she was going to call me back. She never did, and honestly it doesn’t matter if she does. She knows everything now, so what she does is on her, what he did is on him, and they are none of my business anymore. 

I feel I did the right thing, despite making the wrong decision in the heat of things. I feel a huge sense of relief about that part but still super anxious about finding testing options. If anyone has ideas how I can avoid $600 lab fees in the US for full panel early testing, please reply here. I think many people in this community could benefit from this info. 

Also: Googling his images got me no information. He was not in the search results at all. Funny though that mugshots showed up for one of his pics and car seats for another (I laughed out loud at that. He was paranoid about his height and being shorter than me so I got a good snort out of it at least). 

I’ll probably never date again or talk to anyone else on these apps ever. I’m done. I’ll meet in real life or be single forever—and I don’t know if that even bothers me anymore as long as I never have to weed out this crap.

Earlier in the week, the texting felt so indifferent that I actually spoke up for myself and commented that our communication styles are obviously different so I could use clarity on if he feels enthusiasm (which he showed in person) or ambivalence (which was the texting vibe). He said that he is genuinely enjoying spending time with me and wants to do so more, but because of past experiences doesn't rush into things-- I was happy we were on exactly the same page and we made plans for tonight.

Last night, he texted saying he has cold symptoms and cancelled our plans for tonight. This morning he got at home Covid tests, and dropped one off at my door. We both tested negative, so again I directly asked what this means for tonight and he still wanted to cancel (no surprise) saying just in case, for safety and didn't suggest rescheduling. I answered with ""sounds good. Be well soon.""

While it hurts to be rejected by someone I was truly enjoying getting to know and I do wish he could have matched my direct communication, I am super proud of myself for communicating directly and advocating for myself. Those things don't come easily to me.

82,ryhlnq,1641588734,The struggle to date with past terrible experience,"Hi All, you’ve all been pretty wonderful in giving me your thoughts and advice before. So, here is what’s happening. I matched with this guy from old back in September, we both have crazy schedules but we managed to meet. Everything is great, he’s kind, and all good. I found out that he was still actively seeking dates on the app, then i deleted my account thinking he probably thinks the same since im still on the app. No talk about exclusivity yet, but on out second date we both agreed this isn’t a hook up, fwb, casual thing. We are both seeking long term serious relationship. A couple of years ago i came out of an extremely abusive marriage that lasted for 15 years. My ex husband was the only man i ever knew. I like him very much, and scared to do anything, scared to say anything more than “i like you” and he said the same. Fast forward Last week he calls and says, i really need to meet up with you, i don’t think we’re compatible, and mentioned along the lines something like “do you ever even call?” With quite a pissed off tone, then proceeded with i really like you and want to stay friends. I was quiet and replied i am not that person who can be friends. Yet, you are entitled to feel whatever you feel and i can only respect that. He insists we meet, i agree because i felt i need to say something too. We were supposed to meet last weekend, i told him the following weekend (which is tomorrow &amp; day after) will be my birthday weekend amd I don’t wanna do this on my birthday. I lost my job same day i got his call, he insists on helping me and called throughout the week to let me know he’s making calls….etc
I thanked him and thought that was kind of him. Now we are most probably meeting tomorrow, because of my terrible anxiety and i just go blank i wrote down literally a script of what i want to say. 
I think, because i poured my heart out in the past, I probably came off as I don’t care… i want to tell him how he made me feel, i poured my heart out amd wrote it all down.
How I felt with him makes me feel its worth trying. Im worried i’ll come off as needy and clingy. Im not asking for another shot, because he seemed like his decision was made. 
Any advice?

Do you have something that is continually brought up by those you date or in relationships with that seems to be a problem and how are you working on it?

For me it’s that I’m unimpressed with a lot of things that, according to feedback and observation, a lot of other women aren’t impressed by.

This has been brought up quite frequently. I just find it difficult to want to congratulate someone on communication, bringing me flowers, cooking dinner, being a good parent, scheduling time to see me…the list goes on. 

To be clear I do acknowledge these things but I guess my reaction isn’t big enough? I think it’s given me the appearance that I’m hard to please but I’m really not. I just want to be heard, stimulated and valued. Anything very much outside the norm I do have a big reaction to but normal every day things I just really don’t and feel a thank you should be enough. I say thank you and acknowledge effort on a regular basis I just think that my reaction isn’t big enough to them.

How I’m working on it? Still trying to decide if it’s something I should work on. So guess a bit of a stand still at the moment.

97,ryvmfj,1641632366,How my last relationship ended (long read),"Just want to share a little bit of a story about my most recent relationship. While I'm still sad, I've moved on from the relationship. 

Last month I (40M) ended a nearly 4 year relationship with my (ex)gf (37F). We met through my language teacher while I was working in China. Up until just before COVID started we got along great (but not perfect). 

I admittedly did not communicate my female (platonic) friends well with her, which started creating a lot of cracks in the relationship foundation. And I had two short term relationships that ended in utter disaster (will share at later time). It also didn't help that she knew I dated a lot prior to us meeting and her bff (who I don't get along) slept with pretty much any man that has a pulse. Eventually these factors created a lot of insecurities. I kept reminding her that she's amazing and tried to be very transparent with my communication with her. 

She's met my mother, closest relatives and friends, my friends and relatives were floored when, for the first time, I introduced her to them. Of the 38 years of my life (at the time), I've never introduced a woman whom I'm seeing to them. She was incredible and my family and friends loved her. I was ring shopping when first signs of relationship trouble started happening. 

While I went hiking with two of my female friends, we bumped into an ex, who I'll call S (a narcissist), while she's on her date. We were walking in direct path of one another. My two friends knew how much damage S had done to me during the short amount of time we were together. As S approached, one of my friends jumped onto me and gave me a hicky and said something along the lines of ""who would ever pass you up?!"" While the other friend (her sister) said ""you two are so cute together."" While a very much appreciated their protectiveness, I would've appreciated without the hicky. Before anyone thinks she's interested in me. Her and I had talked about our relationship before (before I even met my ex) and it's very strictly platonic (we originally did start out as dating, chemistry wasn't there, but we both had same type of humor).

My ex blew up over the hicky and wanted to confront my friend over it. My friend told her what had happen, but ex didn't really buy the story. She felt we had conspired together on the story. 

Ex: What are the odds of you running into someone you know in a city of 18 million people?

Me: Remember that crossfit photo I showed you where 3 people I dated were all in the same photo? Or about the story of bumping into college friends 1500 miles away from where we went to school? Or the time I bumped into this couple at the airport who I paired up hiking for safety? World is small when hobbies are the same. 

My friend ended up hanging up on her. I got dog housed for the week. 

When I found out I was being sent back to US I wanted to do some shopping before my things are shipped back (and I'm not a person who likes to shop). As word got out that I'm leaving, the first woman I had relationship with in China (let's call her K) reached out wanting to meet for lunch. I was very hesitant meeting her, but eventually agreed. Told my ex that I'm going to lunch with her and the restaurant we were going to. She was supposedly fine with it (one of those okay but not okay deal). At the restaurant, K wanted to share the news of her pregnancy and show off her baby bump with her fiancé. She didn't want to do it over WeChat video. I thought was weird but happy for her. However, had a miscommunication with the ex and went to the wrong meetup spot to go shopping. I ended up about an hour late and was accused of banging K.

From that point on she was a bit distant. I left China not having fully reconciled with her, but remained in relationship with her. 

Things started getting better over 2020 and most of 2021. Unfortunately, with the timezone difference, we can only really video chat on Friday and Saturday nights. We couldn't see each other in person due to US/ China tension and China was not doing tourist visas (my work permit in China expired). For her, US doesn't make it easy for single women in their 30s to visit. 

As places started opening up I stated traveling with my friend's family (ex had met them). To my ex, she thought it was weird that I'm hanging out with their family so much (true, but they were my only friends in 400 mile radius of where I lived. They lived 10 min away). Ex made a few passing remark that she thinks I'm dating their 22 y/o daughter. I kept reminding her I never date women more than 5 years younger than me. And I treat my friend's kids as if I had my own. It was when I started getting annoyed with her insecurities and told her I never had problems breaking up with someone if I don't believe it'll work out and I am very much in love with her. 

A month goes by I change job and moved across country. Thinking my new location will help ease her into US life (she's visited US 3 times), I told her, 

""I want you to visit US under K1 visa [90 day fiancé], but I can't promise you at the end of the 90 days I will marry you, but I want to give this a go. If it doesn't work out I'll pay for your airfare back and provide you 2 month living expense while you find a place and job.""

After a month's thought she called one evening explaining her feelings and that based on how my offer didn't express love and she would not risk coming to US. Also she felt it was odd that I had far too many female friends than male friends in China (most single guys in China didn't want to hang out with me) vs complete opposite in US.

There's a lot more to the story and I know what I've typed didn't do her true personality justice. 

TL;DR - Ex and I split in Dec after nearly 4 years over increasing insecurities starting with platonic female friends acting protective when I bumped into another ex (S) by acting overly affectionate via a hicky on my neck. Ex didn't buy the story. Another ex (K) wanted to announce her pregnancy and baby bump in person. Ex was okay at first, but when I went to the wrong meetup place, was accused of sleeping with ex (K). After returning to US, ex suspected I was dating friend's daughter. Ex didn't felt loved with my proposal to come to US (with no guarantee of marriage at end of 90 days despite covering her living expense if things don't work out).",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ryvmfj/how_my_last_relationship_ended_long_read/
