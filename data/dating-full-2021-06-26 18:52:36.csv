I'm nearly 30 years old; through high school I had no girlfriends, then a couple in my early twenties, and some flings both around that time and after.

But since 21, I've had no serious girlfriend, no relationship that lasted more than a couple weeks.

In fact, multiple times, I've literally been in a bedroom with a girl, and just left, prior to sex.

This is the basic matter of this question. It's not a performance issue, but a psychological one.

This post is long, but this is as much as I could condense the past 8 years of my lack of a dating life.

The last girlfriend I had, at the age of 21 (my second one ever) brought up some quite nasty facets of myself, and the dynamics of relationships:

\- She was trying to get pregnant the entire time. This was obvious in retrospect (she kept taking pregnancy tests and telling me about them) but I was so naive at the time it didn't hit.

\- The above scared me at how easily I either denied or was not aware of the possibility, and at how diabolical women can be. (Yes the problem in all of this is that I generalize this possibility to all women).

\- The breakup was mutual, in that we both agreed, but I was not happy in the relationship (neither were) yet I felt trapped and powerless that I could not end it despite wanting to (which is an echo of my parents' dynamic). We ended up splitting up because she had to leave the country, thank god for that.

\- Despite how bad the relationship was, and that I wanted the breakup, and how easy it was to see each other off the day she left, the ensuing months were a horrible hell for just what I put myself through mentally. I attach so fast and they (women) become so all-consuming of my view of my future (even ones with a shit relationship dynamic) that it is a major blow to me even when someone I just met doesn't like me or turns off of me (probably in large part due to my neediness).

I was just starting to come out of my shell with women around that time, and then after that relationship, as a distinct marker point, my relationships with women started to go way downhill right away. I didn't have sex again for years.

So I am stuck between a kind of rock and a hard place of my own doing. I want a relationship on some levels - specifically the ""need""/desire for companionship and physical/emotional intimacy - but I block myself off preemptively, both, admittedly, from a fear of rejection, but further on down the line, as I pay more attention, I sort of feel like I ""should"" want them, but some thing in me (all that aforementioned) doesn't actually want them, because the consequences would be too dire..

Yet the paradox here is that if they give me the time of day, I'll go as far down the rabbit hole of attention as they will tolerate me (lack of intimacy), while still somehow having that block of wanting(biologically)-but-not-wanting(psychologically) sex because of a kind of extremist view of some kind of commitment that will imply or force (even if only in my mind - and seems to be that's the case).

Thus I am frustrated.

I have a natural desire for women, but multiple layers of conflicting psychological blocks.

I see women as man-eaters, who none the less I readily and easily commit to - in fact it's my default - whether or not they want that from me, and despite not having any around, they (whichever random woman is physically attractive, even if she expresses no interest in me) instantly become top priority in my life (let alone if they stick around any length of time, the gap between them and whatever second place is just amplifies).

I am not enjoying this. I am not enjoying how I make myself go on a mental and emotional roller coaster despite (or maybe causing?) having no ongoing or even fruitful sexual relationships with women. And yet I am trying to protect myself from them. 

I want therefore something I feel is harmful for me, and it's a paradox.

I suppose, if I could boil it down, I'd like to ask how I could genuinely want for women, without this view that they're out to get me or that regardless of their intention I'd be stuck, or owe them something (my commitment) even right out of the gate?

I think later on there's more to unpack than that - like getting back the courage to go meet them - but I realized I'm never going to do so much as that as long as I think that ultimately, having sex with them will lead me down a dark path of trapped commitment to an overall negative factor in my life.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,861628,public,self,How do I start wanting to be in a relationship?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8gqct/how_do_i_start_wanting_to_be_in_a_relationship/,all_ads,6,,,,,

She no longer works there nor do I. It was instant attraction, she is intelligent, authentic and just a beautiful person in general. We went on 2 dates in 3 weeks, we kept it professional at work, just chatting to each other in a friendly way and having the occasional laugh at things.

One day, our last day working together we are talking and she’s talking about her new job, I mention we should go on another date, maybe too eagerly, she says now she has a new job she doesn’t have as much time and isn’t feeling it.

I walk off really hurt, but hiding it. It being so out of the blue it caught me off guard and I needed to be on my own for a bit to refocus. I reproach her and say what do you mean “not feeling it”, I say “the dates” she says yes but not the first date, she specially said that one was amazing, she was into me and kept wanting the date to go on and on offering to go to new places which is a really good sign and she even waiting at the end of the date when we were both sat on a bench for a really long time for me to finally have the balls to ask her for a second date and to be her boyfriend to which she eagerly said yes.

It’s just the second date wasn’t the best, firstly it was at 9:40 am which isn’t exactly romantic, it was raining, and we walked around a park in the pouring rain and I couldn’t keep the umbrella up because it was too gusty so we both got wet. Despite this she was still showing signs of attraction, she kept conversations going, she wanted to walk further and longer despite the rain etc.

So with that context, it hit me hard when she said she wasn’t feeling it. As she was walking off for the last time after work, I ran after her and just said “if you change your mind, just text me, that’s all I wanted to say” and walked back. I haven’t texted her since other than congratulating her on her new job sincerely. It’s been 2 days since we saw each other or texted.

I worry that because I wasn’t forward enough on the dates and we never kissed after each of them that she thought I was “friendzoning” her. But I was just trying to read the room and give her time to get used to me before going for the kiss, since she is shy.

Before she friend zoned me she said “I really really really like you and we should get drinks as the last date just didn’t feel right” she even mentioned a bar. Is it even possible to impress somebody again after being friend zoned to get out the friend zone. A part of me wants to go with her and try to impress her, but another doesn’t and just wants me to let her go and not go because if I went and just realised it was just “mates going for drinks”, I’d have to go through all the pain again.

Es gibt da ein Mädchen auf welches ich stehe, wir kennen uns schon seit 12 Jahren. Natürlich habe ich das klassische Problem, dass ich nicht weiß wie sie für mich empfindet. Wir treffen uns regelmäßig, mindestens einmal in der Woche. Meistens sehen wir uns dann den Sonnenuntergang an, eigentlich ist das ja eher Romantisch aber ich weiß nicht was sie dabei denkt. Sie hat mir auch erzählt das ich einer der wenigen in unserer Umgebung bin mit dem sie etwas macht, da die meisten einfach komisch sind. Als wir gestern in der Stadt etwas essen waren und zurück zum Auto gegangen sind habe ich bemerkt das ein Typ ihr sehr auffällig hintergestarrt hat, daraufhin meinte ich zu ihr das sie kurz vor mir laufen soll da es für sie unangenehm sein könnte (dachte ich mir) und einerseits hat es mich Extrem angekotzt. Als wir dann beim Auto waren hatten wir nochmal kurz darüber gesprochen, anstatt einer angewiederten reaktion wie ich es erwartet hatte, kam nur ein:,, wie sah er den aus?'' Eigentlich war ich mir zu circa 70% sicher das sie mich auch auf die selbe Art mag, aber diese Situation hat mir die ganze nacht den Schlaf geraubt und ich weiß nicht mehr weiter. Ihr direkt zu sagen was ich für sie empfinde geht momentan nicht, da ich mich dazu noch nicht bereit fühle. Noch zur Info, wir hatten eine Zeit lang weniger kontakt doch aufgrund von Corona hat dies wieder zugenommen.

(Keep in mind we didn’t get good during the movie, at the end I need to pee, she also lived 40 mintues away too) ( sorry if story is a little confusing not good at writing a story and feel uncomfortable and shaking currently… 😪)

The movie part of the date was nice we cuddled watching it. No like serious physical contact. Didn’t kiss which happy we didn’t. 

She was cool the whole movie and talking a little more then what I would’ve liked but not a red flag. 

Was after the movie where she just turned into a big red flag 😅 

so movie ends and she still cuddling me as people are leaving. I subtly joke like oh wow we need to move cause people are trying to get by and I don’t wanna be rude or that guy. She doesn’t move till everyone is gone and I’m like oh boy is she trying to kiss me or do something sexual?

I then get up and she awkwardly gets up and takes her time. We exit the movie area and are walking back I mention maybe seeing another movie together cause date was nice but would have to wait an hour and  half and didn’t want too. 

So she then wants to walk to a home decor place on the way there and in the store starts getting really personal about where I work and how long I’ve lived here and if imma stay here.

At this point I’m like okay we need to end the date. So we leave the store and walk back to the movie parking lot. I  admit I said we could do another date but I was trying to end the date cause she wanted to go to a park and walk with me. That’s my bad for saying we should do another date. That was wrong of me. 

I felt uncomfortable and wanted to get out of there with out being rude. We walk to my car and she stops me and says. Hey can we talk for a second? I’m like okay? She’s like I had a good time tonight you want to keep taking? I’m like oh uhh I thought we were gonna. End the date here and go home you live 40 mintues? 

She then goes in to hug me and tries to kiss me and I kinda back off. She then starts a new conversation with me and tries to hug my side and asks me 3 more times wanna keep talking?

Every time I keep saying not that I don’t want too I had a good time with you just wanna go home and eat and process the date.  

Then she asks me to walk her to her car and I wanna be gentle men and polite so I do it’s one row over from my car. We get there and agains tries to hug my side and get all touchy. I then swat my leg cause uncomfortable and play it off as a mosquito biting me. 

She then starts telling me in detail her entire Monday work day. Tuesday. And I cut her off saying hey I had a good time imma head home and process the date. We can maybe do another one next week. She then hugs me and I’m like okay bye. 

I walk away and she’s like waving me over like hey let’s plan that next date. I say that’s okay let’s just text about it. I want you to get home safe. Text me when you get home safe. I quickly walk to my car. 

Usually I will get my gps set up and music but I was so afraid and creeped out and just anxiety was making me shake… so I just drove away. I got creep feeling like she may follow me… Fml just idk very horrible vibes I got and just wasn’t okay with how touchy she got.

Been out of the relationship thing since I was 18. Took the time afterwords to focus on myself. Honestly, it took me a while to get over it emotionally too. I now feel ready to start dating, and in fact just went on a first date a couple days ago for the first time since. 

The issue being, I am finding it way too emotionally draining. I’m looking for an actual relationship, and for me, that requires a complete and exclusive emotional connection. I’m dumping all of my eggs into one basket every time. I can’t *not* do that. 
This last date went well, imo and what she said, but I guess I got ghosted after we set up a second date. And honestly, it’s spirit crushing. I had little emotional connection or physical attraction prior, but that typically all happens after I meet someone on a personal level. Like on/after a 1st date. I can’t just look at someone and be attracted to them. 

All the expectations, nervousness, anxiety of meeting...just to then actually feel that connection and then start over with someone new. How do others do it? I’m not in it for hookups or anything, nor would I participate in that. I legit just want a relationship. It’s so easy for me to form my own emotional connections to people, and it takes so much out of me when it doesn’t work.

Okay so i'm a 26 year old guy, never dated. Opened up a dating account two days ago. I was to ashamed to go on Tinder. So i went to an international dating site &amp; changed the city to limit myself from bumping into people i may know. While i wasn't the most unpopular kid in school i still got a lot of shit &amp; i guess the fear of being ridiculed still haunts me today.

However there's still people from the same country as me on the site.  
I didn't actually have high hopes, my confidence is lower than a submarine &amp; has been that way for many years now. But i felt it was worth a try, because as of right now i wont meet anyone.

So i actually got 30+ matches. (I bought premium so i didn't have to swipe for hours)  
\***Drumroll**\*, none of them are actually from my own country. They're all foreigners from various countries, mostly Asian.  
Many of them are super pretty &amp; way out of my league. So i should be thrilled...

But instead i feel worthless since no girls from my own country actually wants me. I mean the bar is high.  
And then looking through all the Asian women like i was ordering something off on Ebay.  
I don't know. anymore. At least i'm their age but there's literally no way for me to know if they genuinely find me attractive or not? Maybe exotic at best.  
Or that i seem way more interesting in my profile than i really am. 

I literally earn minimum wage &amp; live with my mom right now. Since i'm currently selling my apartment. I don't have a useful degree. I do have about 100K $ saved up, when the apartment is sold. But without a solid income i doubt i'm eligible for another loan. Which i probably couldn't afford anyway.  
And a degree will take years.  
So with other words, who'd actually want to live with me in my mothers basement?

Good mixture between anxiety, depression &amp; self hatred. I should probably just go see a shrink instead.

I was engaged around 5 years ago give or take. I was not a good boyfriend and was very emotionally neglectful. Did a lot of things I’m not proud of and spent years meditating on that and gave my ex a heartfelt apology for specific things and it was well received. Also came to grips with my depression and have sense started getting medicated for it because meditation and talking to myself (and being brutally honest in self reflection) has not been enough. 

One of the things that I noticed in a trend of toxic relationships is I always had sex with the person I’m into after like a first date. The only exception was a girl that was on her period and she didn’t want to so we waited for that to clear up so she was more comfortable with doing it. I’m not saying that it’s bad or good to wait but I have been infatuated with the idea of sex that feels more meaningful because you know you are doing it with someone you truly love.

In the years between it has been rough. I would meet someone I’m into and they either just wanna hook up or just don’t want anything serious. Which is fine for them but not what I’m looking for. I promised myself that I wouldn’t cave on having just hookup sex and also I wouldn’t welcome any dating prospects unless I felt we were on the same page. 

Well, the other night on my OKCupid I had a convo with this girl that just posted that she’s looking for friends and we had a conversation. We met up today and got lunch then went back to her place and played chess and go fish. Just sort of hung out and joked and talked a lot of shit to each other. I think she’s really cute, funny, awkward (I am too) and just an all around really cool person. So before I left I told myself to face my crippling fear of rejection and ask this girl out on a romantic date. 

Before I could even ask her, she suggested that we should exchange phone numbers. That definitely made me asking a lot easier. So I said something like “I really enjoyed hanging out and I think you’re super dope so would you be willing to go on a romantic date with me? Like, today was definitely more of a hangout and get a feel for each other” and she said yes! On top of that she also said she is not into just hooking up since that’s what so many people are looking for. I told her that was perfect. 

The thing is, maybe we won’t get that far into anything serious or maybe we will. I don’t know.

I live overseas and it’s rare that I connect with other English speaking people from my home state. Plus I work at a job where I don’t regularly meet new people. Not to mention that often as an adult you strike up a conversation with people who are jerks, racists, rude, etc. Plus COVID has dramatically reduced these encounters. It’s been a lonely year. 

So I had a great time getting to know new people (one of the guys I was attracted to) that ends when the plane lands. I say, “it was nice chatting with you and have a nice time at home” and disembark the plane. 

Why do I do this? I’m a chatty and friendly person but I’m not good at ensuring that things progress further. I just don’t know how to take things to the next step (whether it be with friendships or romantic relationships). This happens more than I’d like to admit. 

So since I’ve landed I’ve been questions the root cause of my tendency of doing this. Fear of rejection? False projections? Avoidance of true connections? Obviously I’m overthinking this.

I don’t have many avenues for meeting new people, and I don’t want to date any of my female friends. In general my dating game is kind of on pause right now. I’m really wondering if I should just wait till college but damn I’m lonely and all my friends have girlfriends which is making me feel very jelly.  I even tried tinder and it sucked it felt like the best Someone my age could get there was a hookup and every other girl already had kids. I’m wondering what ways could a 18 year old right before college meet new people? Should I just cherish my time single this summer and continue dating in college?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,862434,public,self,I don’t have anyone I want to date.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8q2s3/i_dont_have_anyone_i_want_to_date/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I'm not asking for someone who's almost identical for a partner, but rather someone who likes a couple of things I do, and is open to more. It feels as though everyone has one thing going for them and that's it. I'm all about trying new things, so if they had different interests I would totally get into them as relationships are a back and forth deal, but it feels next to impossible to find someone who's remotely similar. 

To be honest, I thought my interests weren't super uncommon, but apparently liking them all at the same time is. Like, if someone someone enjoyed being active here and there, enjoyed some of the same shows and books that I read, and wanted to explore this amazing planet, then that would be perfect.
