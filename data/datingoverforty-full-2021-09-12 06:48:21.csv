Do I ask deeper questions sooner like by date 2 just hit all the kids, marriage, life questions? Do I relocate to a place where I know dating will be more fruitful for me? Do I just stop OLDing and do IRL?

As the title says I'm trying to find a way to date better. I can only control my own actions and my own response to guys. There's a lot thats out of my hands.

Yesterday on date #4 with a guy he was acting weird and saying he was so tired. We know how this goes. I asked him if he wanted me to leave so he could sleep. I knew he wasn't interested in me with his behaviour that evening and he should have cancelled in advanceif he wasn't interested. He really wasted my time yesterdaywhen I could have been doing an evening hike instead. Got the text an hour later, no spark, not feeling the chemistry he was hoping for.

Okay cool. But it has left me thinking. Other than focusing on dating only IRL from now on what else can I do.

(I also don't have sex until date 6 to 8 when me and a guy have been std tested. This helps me weed out guys.)

I try to ask questions and vet guys in advance. I'll now be adding in a phone call before even meeting. I ask them what they're looking for but should I ask deeper questions before meeting or on the 2nd or 3rd date? I think I will ask if they want a relationship or if they want kids. But I don't want to put thr cart before the horse with strangers.

I'm not sure why this guy saying there's no spark/chemistry hit different but this time it did. 

I'm 40 and take responsibility for my own actions or inaction while OLDing but I can't shake the fact that OLDing worked better for me in my old province and now in Vancouver BC its been awful.

I'm actually planning to relocate again but I don't want to bring bad dating habits. I'll chat with my counselor about this. We haven't covered the issue of dating yet.

I keep getting ghosted or stuck on pen pal with endless messaging.  I appreciate the feedback that I'm a creep 47 year old man bc of my Reddit comments on posts of 20-something's girls.  I didn't have the post up for very long (maybe an hour or two) bc it seemed most women said the same thing with the comments.  Valid points and I appreciated the feedback.

Which leads me to my next question... and I realize that I'm opening myself to being called every name in the book and I'm okay with that.  I've tried dating women my age (40's) but it seems I keep picking women that never want to meet up.  Yes, everyone has busy lives, especially single moms trying to raise 2-3 kids while trying to balance her career, friends, family, relationship with the ex-husband, and trying to squeeze in time for herself.  So meeting in person is going to take patience and advanced planning.  However, there's a pattern of planning something 1-2 weeks in advance and then having her cancel at the last minute.  This has been happening to me for 1-2 years before the pandemic and has picked right back up again.  It's disappointing and frustrating. And yes, I realize that 99% of the time, the cancellation has absolutely nothing to do with me.  But the pattern over a few years is demoralizing... once that occurs, it's much easier to date a younger woman (20-30's).  But if that makes me a creep, then what am I suppose to do???  Be content being alone???  I'm not perfect.  I'm a real and flawed human being.  I continue to use talk therapy to become more self aware.  

So my question is not what's wrong with me, but rather how do I meet a woman that is age appropriate that actually has time and wants to take a chance to meet in person?

We ended up talking a lot in between that time, something I normally don't do for the standard reasons, and totally hit it off. I'm quite picky and very rarely meet someone that I vibe with so well. Just everything about him is so great. 

In passing during one of our conversations, he mentions how much he weighs and it gave me pause. His pictures show some extra weight, but it looks like the typical covid and mid-life weight gain. I figured he must hide it well or I am out of touch with how much a guy his size actually weighs. In hindsight, I think he was warning me maybe(?). I gained covid weight myself, but I've dropped 15 of the 20 pounds I gained. I get that weight can fluctuate at our age.

Fast forward to our date night. We finally meet and his weight is more than I was expecting. We still had a great conversation though and I'm otherwise attracted to him. I was acting a bit more reserved and not as flirtatious, which he picked up on, but I did not want to lead him on and needed time to process this. I really, really want to be able to overlook this, but I don't know if I can and I'd hate to lead him on further trying to find out. I also worry it comes down to a lifestyle mismatch. I generally eat healthy and exercise regularly. But like I said, I rarely find someone I connect with so well on every other level. 

Has anyone been in this situation before? Is it salvageable? I also don't know what to say to him. There is no kind way of saying something like this to a person. On the other hand, if this is a temporary problem on his end and he is wanting to lose the weight, I'd be on board. However, he hasn't mentioned anything of the such.

What I've taken from most last two postings is I'm just an awful human being that is a creep who doesn't know what he's want.  And definitely isn't serious about dating.  I'm immature, impatient, and prey on young women.  And based upon my comment history, and ONLY based on my comment history, I can see how many of you have come to that assessment.  My assessment of myself... I act in desperation when extremely lonely.  That desperation and being impulsive are two red flags.

As a human being, I need connections with other human.  For many different reasons, I've isolated myself after a bad break-up devastated me.  I found out at the end that she cheated the entire 5-year relationship.  I was in therapy in my 30's unpacking and trying to heal from childhood neglect and abandonment issues (which many people have).  Although finding out she cheated the entire relationship, triggered my childhood issues and simply broke me.  I just broke.  And although, unhealthy, I completed isolated myself from everyone (including family and friends).

So yes, I'm struggling to find my place in the dating world.  And maybe some of you are right, I'm not suitable to date  I need to work more on myself and not on dating.

Yes, I know that’s an extremely short period of time, but Jack has already indicated that he’s ready to be exclusive with me. In this case, exclusive would mean not dating or sleeping with anyone else, deactivating our dating apps, and not searching for other potential partners.

Here’s a whole bunch of background info that you might find relevant. We have not had sex yet. I am having sex with another guy I’ve been casually dating (non-exclusively) for a month but I am willing to not have sex again with that other guy until Jack and I come to a decision about exclusivity (I do not like being sexually active with more than one man at a time). Jack is not seeing anyone else right now. He is divorced (2 years ago) and has 2 young kids in a 50/50 custody arrangement, and he describes his relationship with his ex as amicable. He has been through two rebound relationships since the divorce, the last one of which ended about 8 months ago. He has been going to therapy since the last rebound ended and says it has helped tremendously and that he now knows what he wants in a long term partner.

We have a tremendous amount of chemistry: sexual, emotional and mental. However, it’s only been 9 days and I’m still worried about lovebombing. I brought this up with him, and he says our connection doesn’t feel like lovebombing or trauma bonding to him, but I’m not so sure. Obviously, the best strategy would be to wait a while to see how things develop, but there’s one slight complication in this case: I’ll be leaving town in less than 2 weeks on a business trip that will last two months. Neither of us wants to leave the other hanging when that happens, so I’m feeling that we should make a decision before then.  He really wants to declare things exclusive right now, but I would rather wait the two weeks. Then again, 3 weeks isn’t such a long time either so maybe the extra two weeks isn’t such a big deal? And if something comes up over those next two weeks we could always simply call it off.

Sorry this is long and rambling, I guess I’m just looking for advice and insight into how I should continue this conversation with Jack. I haven’t been at the point where I wanted to be exclusive with someone for several years, and I was a different person then so that experience doesn’t seem like such a great guide here.

I also knew my self worth and knew there was plenty of other wonderful women to love,. 

A few months later, my ex saw all the attractive women who wanted to be with me, that drove her mad with jealousy. She dumped her boyfriend twice to be with me, but I turned her down. Did I enjoy it? Yes.

I had another wonderful girl who put an end to our relationship because she was coming out of a separation. 

I practiced the rule of no contact, not to get her back but to move on. It is surprising when somebody knows you are happy without them, they want you back because they are scared to lose you.
Though I do not encourage you to do this for the sake of making her regret dumping you, I encourage you to do the following things for your own good:

1 Cut contact for good, do not stalk her Facebook profile, pretend she no longer exists.
2 Get yourself in shape, not just for the sake of looking good. But feeling good as well
3 Read as many books that will make you a better person and give you a better outlook on life.
4 Have goals in life, short term and long term , daily goals, weekly goals, monthly goals and yearly goals as well.
5 Instead of brooding about your ex dumping you, look at the advantages of her no longer being in your life and the freedom you gain.
6 Practice a hobby that gives you joy and makes you feel great.
7 Have an abundance mentality. There are millions wonderful women to love and many will be probably better than your ex. Probably, more like definitely
8 Do all these 7 things not to make your ex girlfriend regret dumping you but instead of you not regretting she dumping you .

So, I’m in a bit of a bad way and can’t stop panicking. I (male, 33 years old) have been in a relationship with this guy (42 years old) for almost 2 years now. This was his first relationship. He came out about 6 years ago, and his parents reacted quite badly (his dad started crying and they didn’t talk about it again, and his mom just told him not to tell anyone else in the family). His sister (44) has never been in a relationship, which I’ve always found strange. They both depend quite a lot on their parents, and until recently my boyfriend’s mom would do all his laundry/ironing and most of his cooking. She’d almost come to clean his flat, where we both live (I moved in a few months ago).

Anyway, since I met him, he has had a tendency to see things negatively. He basically doesn’t enjoy anything – going out, his job (he’s a doctor), often I get the sense he doesn’t really enjoy our relationship. He kind of just seems neutral/negative about everything in life. He’s said a few times, jokingly, you’ve complicated my life; life was much easier when I was single (which is basically his entire life). He’s always complained that we don’t have enough sex (it’s true, some weeks when we’ve both been working lots, we’ve only had sex once a week), and when we do, it doesn’t meet his expectations (he’s by no means a very sexual person, as you can imagine of someone who doesn’t get a lot of enjoyment out of life in general). He has also been hassling me to go to the gym, and he says I need more muscles for him to be properly attracted to me. My friends say he’s seen too many movies and doesn’t have any experience, so has completely unrealistic expectations (he also compares himself to everyone going).

Anyway, I’m from UK (we live in Spain) and want to go back, as my job prospects are dismal in Spain (I’m self employed and the conditions are horrendous). We’ve talked about it, and he applied for a job at a hospital in England. He was offered the job and now just has to pass an English exam to get his license to practice, before starting. At the same time, he’s studying for a public exam to get a fixed-term position in Spain, as he says he doesn’t want to leave Spain without having a job to come back to (here, civil servants can leave and come back to a job with their name on it ha). Now he’s saying he can’t leave his family (btw, I can’t go their house when he goes because of his dad’s homophobia, so I feel like, I don’t have my family here, and can’t have a relationship with his either, which is shit). He literally is just thinking about his needs and I’m pretty sure that if he had to choose between carrying on working in Spain or our relationship (in the UK), he’d choose the former. I fact I’m almost positive, as not once has he said something like “let’s do this together”, “what do you need?”, and just goes on and on about how he can’t leave his family, his apartment, his current hospital, etc. The way I work in relationships just isn’t like that – I think a couple should be a team who embark upon projects together and are flexible in terms of the other’s needs. Maybe, I’m being unrealistic as well on that point, and that’s not how couples work.

Anyway, yesterday everything he looked at me, he’d kiss me and say “such a shame” or something along those lines and look sad. Then yesterday, he said, he’ll have to talk one day about where we’re going. So I’m now in a panic. I live with him in his flat, and I don’t know if he’s going to want to break up. Am I right in thinking it’s almost a given at this point that he will break up with me? Any other advice would be very greatly welcomed 😊. I do love him, and don’t want to lose him.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,57660,public,self,How to fix this relationship?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pnghhe/how_to_fix_this_relationship/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,

\*\*\*

In the weeks after my ex unceremoniously ended our marriage of 25 unfailingly loyal (for me) years, my mind drifted back to some of the girls I'd dated in my 20s, before I met my ex. 

I thought of Megan, the kind and loving ""older"" woman (late 20s) who I dated my senior year in college for a few months and who I truly adored except I was just too young then to settle down into a permanent LTR like she wanted -- in those weeks after my marriage ended I wondered where Megan was, if she were happy, and what my life would have been like if I'd married her... I also thought back on my other college girlfriend, the partying and highly-sexual young woman I had liked soooo much but at a time when neither one of us was ready to settle down so broke it off after six months -- she was such a fun loving and easygoing person, did she end up with a life that kept her happy?...  I thought of Hayley, the 24 year old who was sooooooo extroverted and confident and funny, and who liked me so much, and who one night f\*cked my brains out nonstop for several hours like I'd never experienced before or since -- I'd heard from friend groups she still asked about me from time to time even though I hadn't seen her in over 25 years, and I wondered why it was that I broke up with her way back when?... And I yearned a bit for the exotic and mesmerizing South American woman I met while traveling where there was an incredible lightning bolt between us that we both felt and expressed but the distance got in the way -- should I have moved south to be with her like she had suggested? Would these people have treated me more kindly than my ex wife had, been more present than my ex wife had, been a lot more romantic and satisfying than my ex wife was, and would they have not ended a marriage so unkindly like my ex had? 

Thankfully these were all just fleeting thoughts/fancies as I dealt with the shock of 25 years ending, and I was in no way was at risk of looking them up. But after my wife of 25 years had somewhat abruptly decided she wanted a new life and a new path that didn't include her goofball (me) husband, I did wonder if I would have had a more satisfying adult life if I'd settled down with them rather than my charming-but-self-centered ex.

Meanwhile, I have several single friends in their 40s who desperately want to be married or in an LTR. Without exception, they all have a ""one that got away"" story which seems to become more pronounced and heavy with each unsuccessful dating experience and as the years go by. Sometimes, after an LTR ends, they'll start crying as they lament a person that they lost long ago. My terrific friend, who is single and 49, had a heartfelt cry while we were talking just a few months ago as she lamented over breaking up with a super nice but not handsome enough guy she loved in her early 20s -- she felt like if she'd just gotten over his lack of gorgeousness that she would have had a kind and loving adulthood without the relationship drama she's experienced over 20 years.

And I realize -- how much a curse the ones who got away are for us who are unexpectedly single or unhappy in middle life. They are specters who hover over us, whisper to us, gleefully convince us that we are miserable only because we made a huge mistake so many years ago or that we weren't good enough for them so many years ago, that the person we let get away (or who ran away from us) was our lost chance for a satisfying adulthood. That we are cursed to be unhappy in adulthood simply because that person slipped away from us.

For us romantics who yearn for true love, I'm starting to realize that it's so important to actually taint the memories of the ones who got away. To remember -- or fabricate -- their faults. For me, it would be that Megan was kind to me but also supercilious and thought she was wiser/better than me and was always giving me mini-lectures about life that was a turn-off for me. And that Hayley never ever stopped talking, and when she thought something was funny would repeat it over and over to me to the point that it was excruciating. And that she was so loud that she was sometimes embarrassing since other people would glance towards that loud voice. Or that the funloving young woman I dated in college had a veeeerrrrryyyyyy hard time with monogamy and that I ended things with her permanently after I'd already been suspecting she was cheating then learned from friends that she'd hooked up with a guy at a party (and then called me the next day without a care in the world as though it was just a regular day). 

Everyone has bad breath. Or annoying habits. And for the ones who got away, I think it's soooo important to exaggerate those in our memories. Because the reality is those specters -- who we make soooo lofty and perfect in our memories -- stand in the way of true contentment, even if we are single. 

I experienced and ""defeated"" a disease that could easily have killed me, and should have incapacitated me. It made me so very grounded, and taught me to only live for today. And how much happier that has made me overall. And I think it's so important -- for our mental health -- to live in the today, and not in the ghosts of our past. 

So for those of us in our 40s and beyond who are dating, who still some times think back to the ones who got away, I'm wishing for us that we forget about them. And only look for moments of joy for today.

 I know that after 2 years of trying, with 6 different apps…I’m not really good at it But..I feel there’s a tiny, infinitesimal chance that I will get a date or two from trying (which is only the first step..).  So after using bumble, OKC, match, tinder, hinge, and FB dating (not all at once)….I’ve settled on only using hinge and hoping for the best.  I don’t really know what the reason for the lack of dates is.  Whether it’s the photos, my general appearance, the answers to questions, traffic, or just my age being the limiting factor…I don’t really know. I’ve gotten a few matches, but the conversation is generally poor, and fizzles out after a few hours. I presume they're focused on other people.  I also know that this experience is pretty common – maybe not the 2 years part..but the lack of interest. I’m still self-conscious about the things I lack visually to attract women, and it’s still tough to be out by myself on the weekends and see those guys that have those attributes with a woman accompanying them.  

Either way, I’ve accepted that it’s most likely not going to happen anytime soon, but unless I give myself the chance to get seen somehow…it’s definitely NOT going to happen.  I’ve tried a few local shared activities clubs and met some great friends of both sexes, but literally every woman I’ve been interested in, has been already partnered in some way.

I had all weekend to ponder my feelings and what I wanted to do with them. I cried a lot. I journaled a lot. I talked to a trusted best friend. I read. I sat in the quiet with my thoughts. And then on Sunday afternoon I drove to his house. It's a 30 minute drive and I rehearsed all the way there. I wanted to be able to stay focused and not get sidetracked. When I got there mercifully the kids were gone and we had the house to ourselves. I got as far as ""I can't do this anymore"" before I started sobbing. But I just kept going. When I got to the end I swear it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop in the room. I wasn't sure what was going to happen next. He hung his head and said, ""I know you deserve better than I've been able to give you, and I'm sorry."" Then he continued... he said he had no idea I was hurting so much and it was never his intention to cause me pain. He told me that he loves me but he's not in a position to negotiate every other week right now because of his son. He admitted that yes, we've fallen into a bit of a rut because of my work schedule and yes, he'd gotten comfortable with it. Then he said, ""will you give me a chance to fix this?"" I told him I'd be happy with one extra night a week. 

The conversation revealed two things to me: It felt so good to say the words out loud. It wasn't enough to talk about it with strangers, or friends, or even write about it... although I do think that helped me form a more coherent thought so that I could say the words out loud. Sometimes it's good to bounce your thoughts off of a third person. The other thing I realized was that I'd be devastated if this relationship ended. I could have very well gotten to the end of what I had to say and he could have said ""nice knowin' ya."" In that moment of silence, not knowing for sure how he was going to react, I realized, he's the only person I want to spend my life with and if that means slowing down my expectations, while he picks up the pace just a little...

A little background info about me: I have been single by choice for 4 years and just started dating again. I don't have much experience dating as I've been in relationships for most of my life and met people through friends. I currently live in a small town and don't drive, so my dating pool is limited to men who are ok driving from the nearest cities (all about 1h away).

The man I have been dating is a divorcee, no kids. He was married for over a decade and has been seperated and single for a year and a half. He is respectful, stable, active, intelligent and takes care of himself. He also has a great personality, a good career and a dry sense of humour which I like. He's overall someone I could see myself having a long-term relationship with as our values align.

On the flipside, he lacks confidence and often self-depreciate himself. More importantly, I don't find him very attractive physically. There's a minimum of attraction because of all the reasons above, but he's not my type and I don't feel any spark. I also recently spent the weekend at his place and was uncomfortable with how recent the divorce feels. She still gets some mail and it's lying around in the house, there's a picture of them at their wedding in the living room, she still has beauty products in the guest bathroom (which he told me beforehand he never uses), etc. He is looking for something long-term and has told me he has no feeling for her anymore, so this might just not be important for him.

TIA if you take the time to read. I’m having a sleepless morning and been writing this since 3am. 

Backstory:Been divorced for almost 2 years now. My 40yr old ex husband is a disgusting predator who had an affair with a 21 year old server working for him in his restaurant where he is the executive chef. I was blindsided. I was deeply deeply hurt, suffering from severe depression, ptsd &amp; anxiety, and then of course, the pandemic happened and I felt like I  spiraled. I did not want to live anymore. 

Fast forward to now. I have been through extensive trauma focused therapy. Matter of fact about $10k worth, ugh. I started dating. I got into the best shape of my life. I feel much better about my self and my self esteem has skyrocketed. While still angry about my ex’s disgusting, predatory behavior, the rage is much less frequent &amp; I’m feeling stronger than ever. I’ve landed some reeeeeally  hot dates, although nothing has really turned into much more, I’m totally fine with that. I’ve been enjoying casually meeting people. I’m loving myself. I feel like I exude a lot of confidence. 

Had a few dates tell me they could tell I had been very hurt in the past. So now on dates, I make a conscious effort to not talk about my past or bash the fat disgusting trash I was once married to. (I save that for my girlgang time lol) When the divorced subject comes up, I simply say I’m divorced and it was because of a gross case of infidelity by my husband. 

Just had what I thought was a great date this weekend. Coffee, lunch, great conversation and connection. After it was over, next day got the same old talk. “You’re great. You seem like a real person. You’re beautiful. You seem driven. It seems like you’ve been really hurt in the past and you deserve someone who will give you everything you could ever want in a relationship, but let’s be friends.” 

I’m ok with it. I don’t have expectations of a full blown relationship from the getgo, ever. My only talk about the ex was when we were mutually speaking about making new travel memories in places we had been with our exes. No bashing, no dwelling, no anger, just stated that I wanted to go back for the fact he was having his affair at the time and I’d like to make some new memories of the place. 

So my question…(finally lol) 
Are 40+yr old women who were cheated on or abused just looked at as damaged goods even after the “glow-up”? Yes, I was extremely hurt by someone who vowed to love me forever, but I’ve done (and am still doing) the work to fix me. How do I not project this past trauma?

I think I'm a very good conversationalist, and have connected with many women where we feverishly chatted back and forth with in-depth conversation, leading to many phone calls or video chats (though not always leading to a date).

Beyond the common situation of women responding with very short responses of a few words or a short sentence, one very common problem I see is if you ask a woman two or more questions, they only respond to one - and then it seems rude to ask the missed question again.  If it happens a few times, I often just end the conversation, figuring if a person can't engage in some basic dialogue then it's not worth pursuing further.

Am I expecting too much, that a person can answer multiple questions in an exchange?

So, I ask for a pic of hers. And she’s right. I never thought about it. Seeing what was in her fridge was very telling. Things like contents, were they all just haphazardly stuffed in there, or was there a place for everything? 

Hers was very neat, anything identical was next to each other. I could tell she eats healthy, with an occasional snack. I learned right away what her beverage of choice was. Some things were name brand, some things were store. She likes real butter, veggies, whole milk. Mustard, or Mayo? Looks like she’s a mustard girl. That works because I’m a mustard guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I like to think that I have reasonable and realistic expectations for my next relationship (I've checked with my therapist and trusted friends on this) and I do what I can to put myself out there and find like-minded people. I'm super active in the community - running a hiking group (where I don't date anyone to prevent drama), volunteer on the regular, go to church and PTA meetings, have a robust social circle, and have been told that I'm generally a likable guy (abet overlooked and hard to read at times). 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like I can be the type of person I'd want to date - aka offer what you want to receive yet not find it in someone else. I can do the inner work and become emotionally available and mature and not find someone who's on the same journey or willing to meet me halfway.  I've traveled, tried doing new things, explored hobbies and volunteer groups, and whatever else people always suggest to meet potential dates....and yet not a single person has ignited that spark (or even a slow burn) that says yeah, I can totally fall for her.   

&amp;#x200B;

I've accepted what I can’t control is huge and gives me peace. I can reasonably control who I am, how I show up, where I go and what I do, but I can’t control who others are, how they present themselves and interact, or where they go and what they do. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I've asked my friends where they met their SO, usually it was meeting at work or through mutual friends. None of them met on apps so I don't believe in the 25% of relationships start online statistic. Even on Apps, you have to have a certain amount of luck to find someone compatible.  Based on these observations. I concede that there seems to be a certain luck element in finding your person but dating is one facet of my life that I struggle to accept that luck is the answer.

A few years ago, I fell in love with someone at my old workplace.  We were both single and after growing closer at work, he confessed one night out of the blue that he had feelings for me (he didn’t know when he took that leap that I had feelings too).  However due to the difference in our positions (he was much more senior and 14 years older in his 50s), it was inappropriate for us to get into a relationship. I respected him for making that decision as it would have messed up my career not his.  We never kissed or had any sexual relationship although both admitted the attraction was strong.  There was a real intimacy in what we shared with each other when we talked - way beyond colleagues or just friends. 

We continued to work closely together and I left the firm a while later.  He asked me to keep in touch (saying it 3 or 4 times when he said his final goodbye at my leaving drinks) and I had hopes that something might happen after I left. However he never replied to the couple of messages I sent suggesting coffee and a catch up.  I know he suffers from depression managed as best as he can by medication and had resigned himself to never being in another relationship for this reason.  His marriage ended very traumatically and whilst very confident at work, he told me just how shy and unconfident he is around women. He is still single and hasn’t dated anyone for the last 10 years. 

I just can’t seem to let go of him.  When I look on dating apps, I am looking for men that remind me of him.  I can’t find anyone who challenges me intellectually in the same way.  It’s like he has become the blueprint. When I feel low, I remember how caring he was towards me and how safe he made me feel.  I’ve had two relationships since (one long term) but in all honesty, neither of them came close to touching the feelings I had for him.

I don’t want to contact him again just to not get a response - it would make me sad. I don’t want to be desperate or a stalker.  I don’t want to feel like I imagined it all when he confirmed he felt it too.

How do I let go of him and accept that he knows where to find me and chooses not to.  Are there any books that are helpful for working through this and getting my mind and my heart to just let go?  I don’t want to carry this sadness with me anymore.  It’s been 4 years now since I left and 3 years since I last saw him when I bumped into him in a bar.

The thing is, I've had a lot of dating experience, and I've never felt so sure about something from the beginning. We were compatible on so many levels. There was depth, humor, deep connection, fun, amazing chemistry, shared life goals and drive, we could talk about difficult things and communicate through misunderstandings. It felt perfect.

I know breaking it off was the right thing. Because it felt imbalanced, and I didn't want to be the only one ready for something serious, or continue along this road and be hurt more later. But then, why did it feel so right?! I'm pretty sure it did for him too. It didn't last that long, but sometimes it's not the length of the relationship that matters as much as the quality of connection.

and gave her the status ,that she was the greatest thing since slice bread , she could do no wrong ,she treated me like her king and was she this perfect being who could walk on water

Well I’ve come to the conclusion that it wasn’t her I missed it was the thought of what could have been and the dream of this fairy tale that we could live happily ever after and be in love with each other for ever 

I think the thought of being on my own scared me more at first than that of being with someone who wasn’t right for me , it’s hard let go of that sometimes and instead of realising that sometimes you have to let things go you become needy and emotionally uncontrollable, they say rejection breeds obsession and it’s right , we become this lonely sole who needs validating off some one who doesn’t want to love us anymore

I judge people who don't vote. That's on me.

Since Gore V. Bush I've made it a priority myself to vote and I haven't missed an election day since.

I live in California now and vote by mail. I have a drop box on my daily walk route so I usually just drop it in the official drop box once it's completed. Easy.

I have a GF. We've been dating on and off for a little over a year and exclusive since January or so. I would say it's serious.

I care about politics but it doesn't totally rule me - over the last few years it has become more intense and I am fairly liberal personally. I don't really care how someone votes as much as I care that they DO it. Especially if it's so easy and you have the ballot sitting right there. RIGHT THERE. It's a FRICKIN POST CARD kind of simple.

My GF didn't vote in the recall election. She had the ballot at her house right there in plain view and just literally said 'naw, I don't need to. There's no way.' I brought it up to her and at first I tried to be funny about it but when it seemed like she was digging her heels in I just said - it's important to me that people vote but I didn't give her an ultimatum or say I couldn't be with someone who didn't vote. That isn't even really the case, I understand that not everyone feels the way I do and that sometimes life gets in the way. Actually I don't because in the US federal law provides for time to vote and employers must allow you to do so. Whatever though, life happens. She says she usually does but 'doesn't need to this time.'  

This isn't life happening, this is her choosing to not vote and then when I told her it was important to me she seemed to dig in spitefully. 

Spite is intended to hurt.

Oh also, I have baggage (cause I'm over 40 and we all pretty much have something right?). I was in a relationship for a long time where I accepted things I didn't like, things that were less important than this but also things that were far worse. I accepted them. I was hella unhappy though. My point is that I have certainly lived with a lot worse things in a partner but at this point, I do not want to live with not good enough ever again.

I didn't ask her to do it because I didn't feel that I had the right to ask that of her - it is her choice. I just don't like her choice. I feel differently about her now. 

I have seen on the dating apps, 'Don't contact me if you are a (Conservative/Liberal/Whatever)' and I've never quite been there but I have shied away from the more Trumptastic of the ladies...

I know I need to talk to her and my talking point is mainly that when I told her it was important to me she seemed to dig in her heels and get spiteful in a 'you can't make me' kind of way. We can talk about it and she can be 'sorry' even maybe but you can't undo things like this.

Hi there, and thanks for reading, 
5 years ago I divorced my husband. Admittedly I was in a messed up place in life, our marriage of 14 years was in the gutter, I felt incredibly lonely and I left him for another man, who I’ve since been married too but recently separated. Around the time of my first divorce, I had a best friend Lilly, but we had a falling out after I learnt that she and my husband went out for coffee quite soon after my divorce with him. Me and Lilly we incredibly close, like sisters, and I felt so betrayed, I immediately cut her off and we haven’t talked since. Lilly also went through a depressive episode after an abortion (which she chose to have I must add) and tried to harm herself (in a serious manner) at my place when I was out of town, just before I saw her out for coffee with my ex , I ended the friendship due to that as well, as I needed to protect my young daughter from her negative toxic energy. Anyways, she claimed nothing ever happened between them but there’s absolutely no way I believe her and I always felt my ex husband had a sweet spot for her. 

Anyways, I’ve been in bad shape after my second separation, and I’ve tried to regain somewhat of a friendship with my ex husband. Obviously too much has happened between us for anything to ever be romantic, but I was hoping for us to build a friendship again. Yesterday he came round and confessed that him and Lilly have been dating for 9 months, and that he’s serious about her. I’m absolutely fuming over this. I also don’t want Lilly around me and me and my ex husbands child because I know Lilly is mentally unstable. I told my ex that I think he’s making a huge mistake and that I know her better then he does, but he won’t listen.
