3,s8bkk6,1642657575,think i was rejected for not having sex on first date? idk very confused,"Just got the rejection text today saying ""I genuinely have loved hanging out w you and would very much like to be friends but i'm not sure about the romantic level"" :(

This text is very confusing to me since the last date seemed to go well and I thought overall things were going great and that she was into me.

To start at the beginning we matched on Hinge and kinda already knew each other thru a mutual friend that we both hung out with at a concert years ago. Our first date we met at a Thai restaurant at 7pm and the convo was so good our dinner lasted 2 hours, just talking and laughing. Then we went to a bar for maybe another hour, then I walked her home and she invited me up. Once inside, we started making out and she said she wanted to have sex but I told her I didn't want to do that on a first date so we just kept making out til I left at 1am since it was a week night and we both had work the next day. During the date we had talked about liking the same comedian and I told her I had tickets to see the comedian and a band the next week so we already had our next date planned while on the first date.

The second date we met up and had tacos before the concert. The convo seemed to flow smoothly and go as well as the first date had gone, if not better. After the concert we walked for maybe 30 minutes. It started to rain so we went under an awning and made out for awhile, which felt very romantic and like a movie or something. She even said she thought I was a great kisser and that she liked kissing me etc. We did seem to have good chemistry and the kissing was very heated and felt passionate. She also brought up that I didn't want to have sex after that first date and asked why and I told her I had just gotten out of a longterm relationship plus I was never the type to sleep with someone on night 1. Even after I answered she kinda seemed hung up on it and let me know that she really likes having sex and I responded that I do also but I guess I just take things slower than she does or whatever. Besides this the rest of the night's convos seemed normal and nothing stuck out to me as a bump in the night. Once we got to the subway I asked if she wanted to hang out again and she said she wanted to and we could make plans later on and we parted ways there as we both had work the next day.

That next week was when omicron started to get really bad in NYC so we both said thru text how we were trying to lay low before we went back home to see our families for the holidays. I then left NYC to go back home for 3 weeks. I'm not a very good texter in general plus I was preoccupied a lot during those 3 weeks as my grandma died and had a funeral so we only really texted for one day during those 3 weeks but I wasn't too worried about it based on how the 2 dates had gone. When I got back to the city on a Saturday I texted her at 4pm Sunday but she waited til 10am Monday morning to let me know she was still at her parents upstate. She also seemed less responsive and less talkative for this convo. I then waited another week and texted her yesterday asking how Westchester was at her parents to which she responded 8 hours later with the rejection text at 11pm. I kinda felt like she was doing a fade out type thing to me from our past 2 times texting once I got back to NYC but I was still surprised based on how our 2nd date had gone even though it was 4 weeks ago at this point. I wanted to ask her specifically how I fucked it up but that also seemed like a crazy thing to do plus I know I'm not going to change her mind or anything but I kinda wanted to know why for my own sake. 

So now I'm just sitting here wondering how I fucked it up since it seemed to be going so well. Looking back maybe it was the fact I didn't sleep with her yet, which seems like what some women get mad at men for doing so it would be weird if she was doing that to me? Or perhaps she didn't like that I didn't text her much during the holidays for 3 weeks and it killed the romance for her? The rejection text mentions there being no romance yet she wanted to sleep with me right away and told me she liked kissing me etc on our last date. Perhaps for her wanting to sleep with someone and make out doesn't mean she's actually into them romantically though? I've been friend zoned before but never after seemingly having chemistry like I had with her. Usually being friendzoned isn't surprising cause the person doesn't try to sleep with me and we didn't have much sexual chemistry. Maybe there could be another reason I'm missing though or I am fixating too much on thinking its cause I didn't sleep with her yet even though she wanted to.

5,s8bu5g,1642658454,"Hi. ""The one"" doesn't exist.","I've lost count of how many times I've met someone I thought was so incredibly special and unique and how I was meant to find her and she was meant to find me, until the relationship doesn't work out for any number of reasons and I stop seeing her in that light. Some of these infatuations have lasted for weeks, some for months, one for 4 years. The latter was a close friend of mine with whom I was so deeply infatuated that no matter how I looked at my future, I could never, ever see myself with someone else. I don't see any of them in that light anymore. Mostly because none of our relationships panned out, but that's the point. I was biased and maybe a little desperate, so I placed them on a pedestal no one deserves to be placed on.

I'm a very niche kind of dude. My interests don't match up with a lot of men my age, let alone women. This is why whenever I meet a girl who actually likes the things I like, I feel like I lose myself in thinking that she is ""the one"" meant for me. I start panicking and worrying about whether or not she likes me, when what I should be worrying about is whether or not *I like her*. *Her*, not her interests and hobbies. And in most of my cases, when I look back at the women I was infatuated with, I never really liked any of their personalities. Maybe a couple, but not enough to want to spend the rest of my life with them.

There isn't a single ""someone"" meant for every one of us. The truth is, you can never really know whether you're compatible with a person or not until you actually get into a relationship and live with them for a good few years at the least. So, the next time you meet someone special, take it easy. Don't stress about the future, don't stress about ""messing it up"", don't worry about whether they like you back or not. Instead, try to gauge whether *you* like them or not. Not their hobbies, or the way they smile, or that unique emoji they send you with every text. Them, their personality, their beliefs and ideologies. Most importantly, understand that if it's meant to be, it'll be.

7,s8bz28,1642658920,Advice Re: sex on first “date”,"Hi all. So I (30 F) hung out with a guy (25 M) I met at the gym. I’m generally very reserved but we ended up hitting it off so figured after about two weeks of talking at the gym, why not have a spontaneous dinner. Well, I ended up asking to have sex with him (cuz hashtag consent). To that, he commented that he never would have assumed I’d ask that question based on my demeanor with but just genuinely wanted to hang out with me. (But, naturally, he didn’t decline the sex. Lol.) Anyways we’ve had sex once more after that (and I’d like to think it’s good sex as we have a great connection) but I just feel like since the sex, we’ve been communicating less. As in before the sex he at the very least made an effort to send a text or even work out together. Not much of that is happening. 
That said, do guys become less interested after a girl has sex so quickly? Because one minute he thought I was cool, funny, beautiful blah blah and now he’s pretty MIA. Or maybe he thinks I’m not interested in anything serious as I mentioned I am open to something casual if he doesn’t have the time or desire to sincerely hang out? Why is this so complicated?! My game plan is to wait until he reaches out, if he does at all, before I inquire about the situation.

8,s8c6kh,1642659631,How do you overcome low self confidence that may be based on nothing?,"I’m a 21 year old bisexual guy, (I like hooking up with men, but mostly prefer women when it comes to long term relationships). 

Most of my partners were pretty clear they found me attractive, and the long term partners tried to drill it into my head that I’m not ugly. I never was able to feel that way myself though.

I’ve hardly tried to date since I broke off my last relationship back in May. I’ve been exploring hookups with men recently (playing on easy mode as some might say), so I haven’t really been looking for anything with women. 

I’ve finally found myself emotionally ready and in the right life situation to start looking for relationships again, but my self confidence has reached an all time low in recent months. 

It’s gotten to the point where I think that if people I know see me on a dating app, I worry they will find it hilarious that I think I’m good enough to date. I recognize it’s  irrational, but it doesn’t stop me from thinking that whenever I think about reactivating my profiles.

I’ve gotten in even better shape, started wearing more well fitting clothes, and I’ve taken better care of myself in general over the last 8 months. I look in the mirror from time to time and think “you handsome bastard”, but it seems to be just as often I think “you piece of trash.”

I’m starting to realize that I’ve probably just started to enter the window where I’m at the height of my datability and attractiveness, so if I was ever to shoot some shots, now is the time to do it.

11,s8cl4i,1642661025,Online dating has made me feel more lonely,"Am I crazy or is this normal? I (30F) have been single for 5 years now and during that time I stayed away from men and dating. It wasn’t intentional I was just very closed off to the possibility, didn’t try to meet someone and didn’t accidentally meet anyone. I was mostly okay with this, yes I thought that it would be nice to meet someone and share my life with them but I just kinda assumed it would happen for me. 

Anyway late last year I joined a couple of dating apps out of curiosity, I had a couple of one night stands which was very out of character for me but I had given up on finding anything meaningful and thought this was it for me. 

I ended up meeting a guy on Hinge and for the first time in 5 years I was excited about someone. I really, really liked him and he seemed to like me too. It felt like we were building toward a relationship and then I was blindsided and it’s like overnight he just decided he didn’t want me anymore and couldn’t handle it. 

I don’t want to go into the details of what happened there because it’s a long story but the whole thing has left me absolutely gutted. I can’t shake it, I can’t get over it and now I feel lonelier than I ever have in my life. I have no intentions of putting myself out there again and can already feel that my walls are back up ten feet higher than before. 

It’s like I had accepted being alone and knew it would happen for me eventually but now I have finally lost hope and it’s hit me like a tonne of bricks. Like having a brief taste of intimacy and having someone be into me and having it taken away is so much worse than not having it at all.

He said yeah sure let’s try that and he said don’t worry too much, relax, and be in the moment. I was very happy because I thought he was understanding. We had this conversation 3 days ago and yes he did what I asked but even the 30 minutes doesn’t seem like 30 minutes because there are always pause in between and he’s always like “I have to go to bed super tired”. I understand he’s tired but I feel like I’m being reasonable in asking him to talk to be 30 minutes from the whole day? Today is even worst, he did not even reply / text me goodnight or our 30 minutes time isn’t even there. Our last conversation is like “What’s up what’s up” and I’m like “hi babe” “to the one who’s always ignoring my questions” (this is the first time I called him babe btw) and he didn’t reply. Every time I asked some questions after he goes to bed, he just ignored the whole question I wrote and just said “Hey what’s up” or “Morning”. I have to ask him again the second / third time. He said he’s too tired to type sometimes.

On the trip, we met some other people our age. There was this one guy that was hitting on the girl I liked, and I got really jealous. I was drunk and not thinking straight. I told this guy that I liked the girl.

The girl eventually found out, and she actually asked me herself if what I said was true. I didn't realize she liked me back, but I had to tell her that I had a girlfriend. She looked so disappointed, and I felt really bad.

A few days after the trip, she requested to follow me on Instagram. I left it pending for two weeks, and I rejected it. I felt really bad, because I already led her on, but I was just trying to do the right thing for my girlfriend. It wasn't so much that I felt threatened by her, but I thought that if I didn't see pictures and things this girl was doing, it would be easier to forget about her. Also, I thought by waiting for a little while, it would make the rejection easier as opposed to rejecting it right away. I wanted to make it look like I at least considered it before saying now. However, the same night I rejected her request, she blocked me.

I found out later that she tried requesting me to show that we were still friends. Her intention was not to get in the way of my girlfriend and I, but since I denied claims that I liked her, she figured that it was just a misunderstanding and we could at least be social media friends. After all, she and I live in different countries, over two thousand miles away.

I tried forgetting about her. It's been two months since I met her, and I just broke up with my girlfriend. I don't feel the same way about her anymore. This other girl, however, I like a lot more.

24,s8efbb,1642668096,Unpopular opinion: you don't need to be in a relationship,"Society has drilled into our subconscious that people are ""supposed"" to date and ""supposed"" to have relationships, get married, have kids, etc.

We're thankfully getting to the point where it's acceptable to not want to have kids. It is your life, your body, your choice. How about realizing this a step further: you don't need to be married to live happily. Even further, you don't need to be in a relationship to be happy!

I'm 25F and I've dated, I've had my share of serious relationships, I've struggled with and gotten past codependency and trying to fit myself under other people's standards and societal norms...

...but I am the happiest I ever been now that I am living my life under my own standards. And I am so very happy on my own. I don't want a relationship with anyone. I'm not trying to find someone to fit some mold in my life that an arbitrary society says I need to fill.

I constantly see all these posts with people complaining that they're always looking for someone to fill some void in their lives. But I feel like this void is something society tells you you have. ""Others seem so happy in a relationship, and I don't have that so I'm not happy"". And then once you do find this relationship, it's ""I have a relationship just like others have, so now I am happy because I succeeded and am just as good as anyone else"".

Don't get me wrong, when you happen to meet someone and it so happens that you just want to spend all your time with them, that's great, go for it, but in my (probably unpopular) opinion, very many people are looking for a partner or are in a relationship for the wrong reason, and that's to appease some societal norm.

Tl;dr: many people's feelings of needing/wanting a relationship is due to a societal standard, and once they start thinking for themselves they can realize that they can be wholely happy on their own.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8efbb/unpopular_opinion_you_dont_need_to_be_in_a/

I've just gone home after each date which I don't mind. I think it's a respect issue with his flatmate too. He doesn't want to bring back guys and make her uncomfortable, which I understand and respect. I am definitely not pressuring him to have me over, because that's his space and his right.

This weekend, I have the house to myself, and I mentioned this to him a week ago, to which he was excited and expressed interest towards. Today I asked him to come round tomorrow after his shift to spend the night and he said ""I'll see how the shift goes tbh""...

He doesn't seem that excited to spend the night at mine while my folks are out of town? His excuse is he has work again the next day at 10am. I told him that he could come Saturday night or Sunday night (if Friday night didn't work) to which he said ""I'll keep that in mind"" which again, doesn't sound very exciting of him?

He's mentioned to me before that's he's scared of sex, and hasn't done it with a guy before. So maybe that's why he's not keen on coming over or hasn't invited me back to his. To be honest, even if we don't have sex just yet, I'm okay to cuddle and enjoy his company really. It will be just nice to have our own place for once.

On our dates we chat, spend 6 to 12 hours together and kiss and get on heaps. So I'm slightly confused as to why he's being ""weird"" about staying at mine. Maybe I'm also overthinking this and this weekend just isn't a good time? Feel free to pitch any ideas or advice. I'm a little scared this is a sign of him not being as into me as I thought.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8ejla/date_doesnt_seem_too_excited_to_come_over_to_mine/
26,s8elnx,1642668851,Need advice: first date after a random approach," 

I (28M) live in a big Spanish city and, last Tuesday, while I went with a colleague out for lunch in a small restaurant. Since it's a small, quite famous vegetarian restaurant, there was a little bit of a queue, so we waited in line. Behind me there was this very pretty girl (in her twenties from her face), who at one point just smiled for some reason (probably looking at something on her phone) and I was just mesmerised (the smile is my favorite thing in a girl).

So, once we got in, I simply walked out (my colleague had sat down) and told her something along the lines of ""Hey, I really like your smile and I'd like to know you better, so if you feel so, can I ask for your number?"", she was surprised commenting how she usually makes the first move and the woman with her laughed (in a positive way) but then she gave me her number and we introduced each other (by the way, she is Spanish and I'm Italian, but I can speak fairly fluently Spanish). After that, I simply went in and had lunch and, while going out after eating, I simply waved hello as she had sat down to eat with her friend/relative with her replying with a smile. A couple of hours later, I texted her suggesting I'd like to take her out for a beer or a coffee: the idea is nothing serious or intimidating, just easy to see where everything is going. She replied after a few hours saying that a coffee was a good idea and wishing good night.

Okay, after this babbling, long story short my question: what are your advice for this first ""date""? All my relationships and flirting came out of social circles (serious ones at least), so I am like a fish out of water in terms of dates. And especially in this case, since I only know her name (and I presume she is single) and I don't even know if this qualifies as a proper date (I'd like to invite her out on this Saturday at like 10 am).  
So, my ""plan"" is to ask my Spanish colleagues for a nice coffee spot (besides googling for suggestions), meet her like 10' from there and walk together to go over the inevitable initial awkwardness and see where it leads. Is this a good plan?

I want to go without any expectation, meaning that, while I would like possibly to get a relationship, I'm just open to see where it all goes. For all I know, she could be my future wife, a good friend, or more likely just a random acquaintance. I don't know and I don't want to overthink it, but I do want to enjoy this opportunity (especially considering I come from a long dry spot and a pretty lonely love life). I had never approached a random girl and I just realise the opportunity was good (had she said no, we would have been both at our tables, no awkwardness or big deal), so I'd really like to do my best.

So, any advice on how to behave, what to do and not to do, anything really 'cause I am kind lost (happy but lost).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8elnx/need_advice_first_date_after_a_random_approach/

The matter is I know this woman, we have been living together for a while and we built a nice relationship.

She could be easily 30 years older than me but still I feel attracted by her.

While I was living with her we engaged in nice conversations and I always noticed there was something else, a little attraction but I couldnt go further at that time.

I understand that affection can be from someone that gives you conversation.

She is separated from long time ago and I ignore if she is seen someone, I believe she is not.

We meet up every now and then, always the conversations and the meetups coming from me.

I tried to approach her and I realised she doesn't feel uncomfortable with my touch (or maybe yea but she doesn't show in any way shape or form).

However if I try to get closer, I feel she is hesitant. This could be because she hasn't been with anyone in long time.

Last time I spoke with her I said I would like to do a hike with her and she said she is always up for the adventure. I feel she likes engaging with me and she always have fun.

I'm in my late 20s and she is in her late 50s

I don't know how to approach and I suppose I'm too fearful to be direct and offend her.

37,s8giit,1642676575,My girlfriend is barely sexually attracted to me please help me understand what is going on??,"Please read I am on the verge of wanting to kill myself 😔I’ve been with my girlfriend for 2 years. In the first few months of dating she was always turned on and it was so easy to turn her on like a light switch and it made me feel really confident and loved and wanted. She is my everything and I was so happy. But then she stopped getting turned on easily and for the majority of our relationship since (it has settled a bit with time) my girlfriend has had bad mental health where she freaks out and constantly overthinks about whether or not she is lesbian. I love her so much and I tried to be there for her for so long despite the pain but overtime it killed me everyday and it completely and permanently has destroyed my confidence and how I feel about myself. 

I snooped her phone and I saw things she posted on her mental health apps (I know it’s bad but I couldn’t help it I went crazy because she wasn’t fully telling me what was going on for a very long time)and long story short most of her posts in a summary were she can’t get turned on by just looking at me (and naked boys in general)and she finds the naked female body more arousing than the males. She could only get aroused by lesbian porn. I saw things in her history before we dated like “I want to fuck a girl” etc even tho she told me and still tells me she never wanted/wants to have sex with a girl and it’s gross. I always (99% of the time ) initiate sex and when we get into sex she enjoys it but other than that I feel no sexual want/chemistry from her at all. She does however say she finds me pretty a lot and thinks I’m hot. 

I feel like pure shit. I feel so dejected all the time. I cry about it behind her back so regularly  and it’s been a year and a half now. I can’t cry to her about it because she freaks out about it and tells me I’m a bad person for not understanding her. It really has destroyed my confidence and I feel so ugly and worthless. Especially when I’m always getting so turned on by seeing her naked but I never feel the same energy back. I feel like I have nothing to live for I feel so insecure and it has made me feel so unwanted and so depressed and suicidal.

I’ve met this guy on Tinder and it was pretty clear he wanted me to come over as quick as possible to his place. I wanted to get to know him at first so he took me out but asked to come over the 2nd date again. He’s a good looking sporty man (M26), I’m also an attractive lady (F23) and get a lot of attention from good looking guys.

I agreed but told him I’m not promising anything sexual yet. He agreed, told me “sex isn’t the only thing on his mind”. (I kinda know it is, idk why he tries to make it seem like it isn’t) I just thought, alright.

One thing that I didn’t like before going to his place is that I asked him if he could pick me up from the city, as I live quite far from the city and would have to travel to another suburb from there. The response I got was “yea if that’s needed, but the bus also comes here”. 

Usually the guys I’m with happily pick me up especially if they want me to go to their place.

It just… didn’t feel like he would put in effort? which I always want to see in a guy in the beginning. 

So I went over to his place by myself (he did offer to pick me up but I was already omw). 

He was talkative and didn’t make any too sexual moves, as I had told him earlier I’m not sure about sex yet, but I felt comfortable with him after the movie and made the move for sex. It went fine.

I spent the night afterwards as it was late (he had told me earlier I can stay for the night). We talked a lot during the night and he said “do you need me to drop you off somewhere tomorrow?”. I said yea if you want, he asked where I live, I showed him the suburb. It’s  like 5 miles from his place to mine, but buses go through the city centre which makes the travel time over an hour. So ofc it would’ve been nice if he would’ve dropped me off in the morning.

Morning comes, he tries to make a move for sex again, but I have some stomach pain from last night’s session and we don’t fuck. 

He doesn’t even mention dropping me off home nor does he ask about how I plan on going home or anything. He knows I don’t know the suburb at all. 

I tell him I had a great time, he says he hopes I’ll come over again soon some time, and then he kisses me and we makeout for a while. _I leave alone_

Before this we had talked _every day_ on and off, not constantly though, but still. He doesn’t message me the whole day (doesn’t ask did I get home safe or how did I get there, nothing).

He only sent me a snapch*t 3 days later, which wasn’t even anything directly to me, but rather sent it probably to many people. I responded, but he didn’t really put effort to make a conversation. 

A week goes by of quietness and he asks if I wanna meet again. We agree that I’ll text him when my exams are done and I’ll have time to come over again. I texted him next week and told him when I’m free, he agreed we should meet, but never made an effort to make the plans and basically left me hanging.

2 weeks of silence go by and he comes back without any explanation.

**I’m down to hookup and have fun, but I don’t even feel like I would want to pleasure him sexually and do my best performance in oral etc if I know subconsciously that he’s lazy and doesn’t even care about me as a person or my safety or anything at a bare minimum level**.

59,s8k1mm,1642688416,"Dating advice for short men, from women."," I won't gaslight you. Yes, agreed, for the most part, that short men aren't considered terribly sexually attractive by the vast majority of women.  

But, that isn't all to be in a relationship. Just because you aren't someone they would sleep with in an ONS situation doesn't mean they can't grow to find you attractive.  

There are women who are unattractive, too. You must find someone who you don't \*find attractive, who probably won't be attracted to you either, and develop a relationship between you both. This is what they mean by ""attraction can grow"".  

Yes, the woman you're with would probably much rather prefer to be with a tall guy, but then, you'd feel the same about her.   

Yes, it's unfair. Life isn't meant to be. But, you can't really sit around complaining, can you? You have to do something. Get fit, get well dressed, groom well, get a good haircut, be giving in bed, don't be sexist in any way, get a stable financial situation, be hygienic, have a clean and well-furnished apartment, get rid of any insecurities that you have, and develop a good personality.       

Hope I could help. Best of luck, guys!  

\*Note: By ""not attractive"", I mean that they aren't a ""hell no"", but they aren't exactly a ""hell yes"", either.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8k1mm/dating_advice_for_short_men_from_women/

I went on a date a week ago with a guy I met on bumble, everything went well and the next day he invited me to a beach in my country (quite expensive) all paid for. We went and spent four days together, we had sex the second day and when we came back I notice him very distant, like he is not interested in me at all.

I just got out of a 5 year relationship and this has been the kindest thing anyone has ever done for me and I feel very silly because I keep thinking about him, I check his networks, I check to see if he is online and now I feel like I went backwards with everything I had worked on getting over my ex.

61,s8kgb7,1642689559,My very short guide to dating success:,"1) Happiness, confidence, and stability are attractive. They don't guarantee that the human of your dreams will swoon at your feet, but they improve your chances.

2) ""Work on yourself"" sounds like cheap and trite advice, and honestly sometimes it is. But there is a good reason to do so anyway: We don't all look like instagram models, we don't all have as much dough as personal finance youtubers, and we're not all athletes. But taking a part of ourselves that we dislike or that others find unattractive and working every day (or most days) to improve it both maximizes our chances of finding a partner and minimizes the downside if we don't. You win either way.

3) If you are single, (like I am) well-meaning people, usually in relationships themselves, will sometimes tell you something that sounds like ""Well you shouldn't want a relationship"". They are wrong, but there is a kernel of truth in what they say. We are all human (well maybe a cat or two is reading this) and it is 100% natural to want to be loved and to love others back. That said, desperation is unattractive. Feeling desperate does not make you a bad person and can happen to the best of us, but it will turn others away.

4) ""Men"" and ""Women"" are not monolithic blocks of human with one single mind each. Reddit dating subs are full of questions along the lines of  ""Do women/men like \_\_\_\_\_?"" ""Do women/men feel \_\_\_\_\_?"" It is true that generalities exist (Everybody likes to feel safe, more women are hurt by men than vice versa, society sets some kinda dumb standards for what an 'attractive' male or female body is, etcetera). If you are wondering what a specific person is thinking or feeling, asking that specific person in an appropriate way at an appropriate place and time is often the best way to find out.

5) Dating is hard. Some people will find you unattractive, some people will ghost you, and some people will treat you like trash. It happens to everyone, so try not to let it get you down. You will like people who don't like you back. You will make mistakes. If you're anything like me, it might be an emotional rollercoaster. People may judge you for these emotions; try not to let any of this get you down either. At least not for long

&amp;#x200B;

Humans of r/dating, best of luck. I can't guarantee you anything, but I think the tips above may help you maximize your chance of a fulfilling life.

63,s8kmtm,1642690110,Alas! Another ghoster,"I have been seeing this guy for just over a month, and things seemed to be going rather well. At first I wasn't majorly into him, however he had made it quite clear he liked me a lot. We met up a fair bit, he wasn't the best texter but in person we hit it off really well, so I assumed he was the kind of person who preferred to talk in person (which is fine). He had told me he really liked me, and that we 'get one another'... whatever that means. 

We had made ourselves exclusive the other week, and I had started to catch a little more feelings than I had before. I thought to myself, 'Maybe this is different, and I need to embrace it', as I was starting to second guess a little beforehand. 

We last saw one another last weekend, I stayed round his and spent the day with him. At this point, I had started to open up more to him about the way I felt, telling him I liked him etc. Then when I left, I felt something in my gut that something wasn't quite right. I think I started to deep things a little more as I started to grow feelings for him. Then after that day, he stopped texting me. A couple of days after I asked what he was up too, and even called him. He never answered, and it really upset me. I was shocked! I didn't know whether something was up, but he was definitely online and knew I had tried to call, but never phoned back (he would always call me). The next day I asked why he was ignoring me, and he replied bluntly that he had a heavy night drinking the other night. I said it was a shitty excuse, and told him it would have been nice to know this. He was very passive and blunt, and said he doesn't like going on his phone all the time, (this is funny as whenever we were together, he was pretty much always on his phone).

I don't know what to do now, as we haven't spoken in a couple of days, the last message I sent was asking to call him, and he's completely ignored it. I want answers, but I don't want to be pushy. What can I do?

To be honest with you, I am incredibly upset and angry about this, as it always seems to happen.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8kmtm/alas_another_ghoster/
64,s8kz9m,1642691070,I feel very embarrassed about getting intimate too fast with my date.,"TL;DR: Met a girl on OkCupid and we bonded quite a bit. The first date went super well. The second date also went well, though things got pretty spicy pretty quickly and she told me she wants to slow down. I totally agree with her, but now I feel embarrassed that I let myself get to that point, and I'm praying that the relationship isn't soured in any way.

I (22M) matched with a girl (F19) on OkCupid about a month ago. We talked on Discord for about two weeks to get to know each other, and we quickly discovered how much we shared in common (kinks, hobbies, personal experiences). Let me tell you, there was a *lot* of anticipation building up to the first date. She told me a lot that she was very touch-starved from the past few years of not dating, on top of some trauma (she says she is hypersexual) from other experiences. She told me that she has never felt such an emotional bond with someone and that I seem like a keeper. I conveyed that I felt the same for her.

The first date was perhaps one of the best that I've ever had. We met at a mall and she took me to various stores (including an adult toy store). While we were in the elevator, she grabbed my head and kissed me, which was so exhilarating. We went to a hibachi place right after (with her mother, believe it or not) and had an amazing time. Her mother even paid for the meal, and I insisted that I help pay her at least. Yes, I realize that this does not sound like a typical date, but let me tell you, I thought it was just amazing.

The next day, I invited her over to my apartment. We started with making out, then she started giving me a handjob while her feet were over my face. I was too nervous to finish, so then we stopped and played Resident Evil and watched funny videos for the rest of the evening. I walked her out to her mom's car, and she later told me her mom really appreciated that.

The day after that, we were talking about possible date ideas, and I suggested a romantic bath. She said that she really would like to do that, but in the future, as she wants us to slow down now. I completely agree with her, because while I feel pretty confident that she's the one I want to be with long-term, I don't think there's any need to rush at all. She also said that while she had a great time on the second date, she was touch-starved and let herself go a little, and for now, she wants to be in the cuddling phase. She said that ""sometimes it happens"". Later that day, we had a great time playing some PC games online.

Again, I completely agree with her. I really, really like her and I honestly can't fathom being without her companionship. But I'm just ashamed and embarrassed that I let myself go instead of slowing things down before we had the second date. She's been quite transparent with me since we started talking, and I just hope that this isn't a sign that she has doubts about dating me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8kz9m/i_feel_very_embarrassed_about_getting_intimate/

After that, his demeanor changed. He started cussing more, and acting like a db.  
I talked to him again two weeks after the first time I talked to him. I asked him out, and he was like: 😶. He just said ""we'll talk next time.""  
I didn't know if it was rejection or not. He missed classes for 1 week bc he was in contact w someone who had covid. When I brought up the topic again he said ""Oh, you were a bit quick the other day, I already have a girlfriend.""What's the point in saying ""we'll talk next time"", then ?

67,s8lcsr,1642692139,"Men’s advice. Subtle touch, flirting, teasing (not negging), and eye contact are key to being viewed as a romantic interest, not a platonic friend","Sometimes a date will go really well—the conversation flows, you both laugh, you have fun—however, the next day you get the “You’re a great guy, but..” text. This can be utterly confusing. I’ve been there.

Having fun and making her laugh is not enough. Making her laugh is only one component of attraction. Some guys make the mistake of believing being funny is the primary component. 

She not only wants have fun, but feel an emotional spark. This can’t be done alone by making her laugh, or going to interesting places. There are several components to laying the foundation of engaging her emotions.

- Subtle, playful, incremental touch. A light hug when meeting her, playfully touching her arm while laughing. This component is crucial. However, it has to make sense in the context of your interaction, or it will come off as being creepy. Touching her hands within the first several minutes of sitting down is an example. If you’re walking, leading by putting your hand on her back lightly if you’re crossing a road or walking to different area shows leadership and has a protective quality at the same time

- Teasing and flirting. There is a  difference between teasing and negging. A neg usually involves a backhanded compliment about her appearance that is meant to make her self conscious. It’s subtle mental manipulation and is unethical. When you tease, you’re both in on the joke. Think of the way you tease someone when you’re in a relationship. When you like someone, it’s a natural behavior to lightly make fun of each other and have fun. Use that same type of energy. If she makes a joke that doesn’t stick, or says something dorky, look away jokingly as if you’re frightened, or for split second act like you’re getting out of your seat to leave. Teasing and flirting go hand in hand. You want to convey subtle sexual energy, though the way you look at her while you’re laughing and teasing. Use restraint; you don’t want to constantly be teasing one another. Ask her open ended questions as well.

- Eye contact. In studies, participants (who were strangers) that were placed in a room and stared into each other’s eyes reported feeling increased feelings of affection after prolonged eye contact. The importance of eye contact can’t be overstated. You don’t want to glare, but you should be maintaining steady eye contact throughout 90% of your conversation, looking away periodically so things don’t appear unnatural. While she’s talking look at her eyes, and then briefly look at her lips, and then back to her eyes. This conveys desire, while helping break the eye contact so it doesn’t turn into staring",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8lcsr/mens_advice_subtle_touch_flirting_teasing_not/

So I'm currently in the last class of school and a few months ago I noticed a pretty girl at the bus stop, who I think is two classes below me. I would really like to get to know her but the problem is, I'm introverted and very shy (just like the average teenage Redditor) so I haven't talked to her yet even though I had a chance to talk to her multiple times. Every time I see her I think about not being brave enough to actually talk to her and feel bad because of it.

Yesterday at school it has been announced that we can buy flowers with a custom message for someone in school which will be handed to the persons at valentine's day. Because of this I thought that maybe I could figure out her name by asking two of her friends, who take the same bus as me every morning, and send her a flower with a message like ""Hey I would like to get to know you"" and maybe my phone number or something. 

So my question is whether you think that this is a good idea and if so what message I could send her with that flower.

76,s8m7xw,1642694497,Is this something to be upset about? Girl I'm dating will post on social media but not reply?,"We've been seeing each other a few months, and recently decided to be exclusive. We tend to have decent conversations, where we are usually texting each other back.

There are times where I will call and text her, and she won't get back to me and I know she has received it, because she's posting stuff on Snap. It just makes me feel like our conversation is a lower priority than social media and it does bug me. When we're together in person, things tend to be good.

Last night for example, but I also think I'm also to blame as well.

She texted me in the morning and I replied a few minutes later. Then she texted me a little later asking if I got her message and that she didn't want to call and play phone 'tag,' in the off-chance I wasn't available to take the call, and I got caught up with work so I didn't get a chance to reply. I called her around 9PM, and we briefly talk while letting her know that I apologized for being occupied at the time. During the conversation, she mentions her best friend is calling her. I tell her okay, just call me back and she says okay that she will text me first beforehand to make sure I was still awake.

A few hours roll by, and I assumed she wasn't going to get back to me so I went to go workout and fell asleep. Then, when I wake up, I see on her Snap that she had posted a story saying she fell asleep at 11, which means she could've called or texted me around that time. 

I'm beginning to think that now that the honeymoon phase is sort of over, she's either getting comfortable around me with the thought that I wouldn't leave her, or doesn't think much of it. I'm not a huge fan of manipulation, but I'm going to start giving her back the same energy from now on.

I've always been told that you should judge someone based on what they do, not what they say.

So she has time for social media but not time to respond.

I want to accept this but am having trouble since I feel v. uncomfortable w/ porn - what should I do?","GFs (20) ex wanted her to engage in exhibitionism/amateur porn and she never felt comfortable doing it. Then he r\*ped her and she had a hyper-sexual reaction and engaged in a few things that were given to other random people/posted. She is unidentifiable in the content for the most part. She immediately stopped shortly thereafter. 

Firstly I really just don't feel comfortable w/ my gf having done porn of any kind. Before this relationship, there was no way I would've dated someone who had done porn/exhibitionism. It's just a natural turnoff I guess. But this is such a special case I feel - I feel extremely bad for her because she doesn't feel comfortable with it either - it still haunts her and is completely not her fault as she was the victim of some heavy abuse in her past relationship. \`So its not like she even had control over it or we don't share the same values. 

It's been almost a month since she's told me, and its still bothering me on and off and kind of tearing me up, and affecting my  emotion towards her. I've been trying really hard to get past it and she really wants us to work out and I feel so so bad because she has had an extremely abusive past w/ both her family and her previous BF and I want to be the person who can show her what non-abuse looks like.

After that, we haven't talked since. We're still friends on social media, and we're not bitter at each other (at least I'm not with her). We just, drifted apart and stopped talking. I moved to a different town. Just the other day I heard she got a job in the town where I live, so I was thinking of texting her and starting up a new conversation. I don't really care if it leads to anything romantic or not, I always thought she was really chill and wouldn't care if we're just friends. However I always get anxiety when it comes to reaching out to people (which is weird because I have no anxiety in any other social situation). So please help me decide if I should reach out to her. I know that there's really no downside to it (I haven't talked to her in years, so worst case scenario is she doesn't reply and nothing changes), but I'm still hesitating to do it for some reason.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8mw90/should_i_text_this_girl_what_should_i_say/

84,s8n786,1642697132,Cast a Wide Net. Found Someone. How to End Things with Runner-up?,"I was on Tinder and met a bunch of people simultaneously to find someone I got on with well. I'm not at the point of being exclusive with any of them. There's M, C, and J.

Ironically, M is the only one who explicitly knows about all the other dates I was going on at the time, which already made him so much more comfortable to be around and now he's by far my favorite. Possibly my favorite person I've ever met. Since work has ramped up, I really only have time/energy to continue seeing M. (And introvert-energy wise, he doesn't drain me which is **invaluable**.)

It's also of note, that I've only been intimate with M at this point.

My question is: how do I break it off with the runner-ups? I like C and J, but no amount of 'like' will outweigh someone who doesn't drain me and who I'm immensely comfortable around. I also know by the things C and J have said to me, that I'm going to end up hurting them - which I don't want to do!

J was an online friend of mine for several years prior to this and we decided to start dating when I was single. And yes, it was stupid that I decided to start seeing a friend. I should have known better.

I've been seeing C the longest and I'm under the impression that he thinks we're exclusive despite us never having that conversation.

I want to be honest, but I can't imagine, no matter how kindly I said it, it would sound anything different from, ""I cast a wide net and you made it to second place! Too bad second place doesn't win!"" Should I lie and say I'm just really busy now? Should I explain to C that we haven't been exclusive? Should I tell J I liked us better as friends? Eugh!

87,s8nc9p,1642697508,For the men who wanna date virgin women,"This advice is for you, virgin male youngsters who wanna date virgins of the opposite gender. I gotta warn you that this is targetted torwards males from about 15-25. If you're above that age range some things here may not apply. That being said, let's begin.

First, what is a ""virgin""? The definition i'm using is ""has never engaged in any sexual acts"". It means that giving handjobs, oral, being fingered, among other things, counst as losing your virginity. Of course, different people may have different definitions but this is the one i'm using.

Now, trying to find a virgin girl might prove to be a challenge nowadays. Teens are encouraged to start their sex lives early so it's not uncommon for girls to have their first time at 14. In recent years, however, there's been a rise in virginity among young people so there may be hope. Still, we can't just rely on pure chance so we must find a way to raise our chances of finding virgins. In order to do that we must first identify what kind of girl has higher chances of being virgins.

The most obvious answer is religious girls. There is a catch, however. Religious girls have a far higher incentive to lie about being virgins due to purity culture and some may even be ""born-again virgins"" so i wouldn't trust religious circles to find virgins.

More liberal-minded girls are less likely to lie about their sexual history. They are, however, more likely to not be virgins. Still, the honesty factor makes pursuing them worth it but we gotta find characteristics that make them more likely to be virgins.

The number 1 trait that's shared among virgins is shyness. Extroverted, talkative people have more social interactions, thus have more opportunities of having sex. Shy people, on the other hand, have a hard time bonding with others and rarely if ever go out to party, thus removing them from the casual sex scene. The shy girls are, however, harder to find due to not going out much. The best environments to meet such girls are school and college. It's important to note that i'm not referring to girls who fake being shy to look cute, i'm talking about ACTUAL shy girls who have a hard time even looking someone in the eyes.

Pretty girls always attract attention even if they are shy so it's wiser to target average-ugly girls (if you are attracted to them, of course). Chubby girls, flat-chested girls, they tend to attract little to no attention so they are your best bets.

Now, on how to approach. To gain such a girl's trust you have to not pressure them. If you study together, ask her about the class. Talk to her a little everyday without pressuring her. If you make her feel comfortable she'll warm up to you and you can SLOWLY escalate things.

I hope this will be of use.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8nc9p/for_the_men_who_wanna_date_virgin_women/

22M, my dating life is ok-ish, I’m perfectly capable of flirting, dating apps work alright (for tinder standards, at least), don’t look to bad, and overall I don’t have much trouble finding dates.

But I’m getting sick of always being the one to start conversations, ask girls out, etc.

It’s exhausting. Why do I always have to be the one to go through the risk of rejection, to please you with plans, to ask about your life and how you’re doing? Could you not? Just once? 

It’s like trying to push a car with a dead battery while your passenger comfortably seats in the back seat.

The last time I’ve been asked out by a woman was 6 years ago.

94,s8oid5,1642700575,Should I give it time or move on?,"I dated a guy for a year casually. I ended it because I started to catch feelings but I didn't tell him that. We would run into each other here and there. He started reaching out to me consistently about 6 months after it ended and we went on a few dates which he initiated. I told him I can't do casual with him again, if that's what he wants. He said likes spending time with me and all these other things but isn't 100% what he wants and it's something for him to think about. Based on some of the reasons he gave about why he doesn't know made me think he was in a controlling relationship before. I didn't dig because I didn't want him to think I was pressuring him. He has only brought up his ex 1 other time and I know she hurt him pretty bad. At the same time we've already dated and he has listed all these characteristics he likes about me so I don't think I should have to convince him that I'm worth a commitment. He wants to keep dating but idk if I can especially if it doesn't go somewhere, which would also mean I would be going back on my word of want I want. When I told him I wanted more, he didnt shut it down but said he'll have to think about it so I'm going to let him reach out to me about it. Should I give him time? Should I just move on? Or should I keep dating him (bring up exclusivity to start with) and just see what happens? I'm not sure if he's dating other people but I don't think so. Should I talk to him about his reasons for not being sure about committing?

So I did that with this guy, we can call him Andrew. I friended Andrew and he accepted. I thought he was cute so I sent him a pm about some university things and left it at that, u know just to start a conversation. Then he showed up on my Instagram and obviously FB is not that popular anymore so I'm never active on it. So I requested to follow him on instagram and he accepted. I just had an innocent crush on him from his pictures and I knew we went to the same uni so I texted him again for a continuation of the university help I needed before. This way maybe a week and a half apart from the first time. I was thinking, he isn't in my program, I'll never have to see him again if I don't want to so let's ask him out. If he says no, whatever. So I asked him out for a cup of coffee during ur second conversation online and he said you seem nice but I'm not into you in the same way u seem to be into me. And I was like, that's totally fair, no problem and did not think about him again. 

Problem is, I knew he worked at this university cafe we have. I thought he just worked there as a waiter/cashier kind of thing and not as part of management. I had applied to work at that cafe as part of management before I knew he worked there. I just brushed it off and thought okay what are the chances he will be working as part of the management? That's a very slim chance. So I went to my interview for the position this morning and I was welcomed to the team. So the guy interviewing me gave me the names of the other people part of the management and guess what? Andrew was part of the management team yay \*i'm being sarcastic\*! I mean what are the chances??? I have to work closely with him and I'm feeling really embarrassed. I don't think he knows yet but he's going to find out eventually when I show up for the first day of work and I am dreading meeting him. I really don't want him to think I was stalking him :( it was just an innocent, very short term crush on someone I thought I would never actually have to meet = no consequences but now, this happens and I'm contemplating dropping out although that would be kind of an inconvenience to the cafe because they will have to find a new person etc and I don't want the other people to hate me by saying one minute I'm super excited to work there and then the other minute I want to drop out.

What should I do?? I could pretend like nothing happened but I am truly worried he's going to think I'm stalking him and I've had trauma before where this guy gaslighted me for being on the same train as him *one* time by pure coincidence. He did apologize later on for spreading rumours about me being a stalker but I am traumatised from that event and *cannot* go through it again. So please help! I thought stuff like this only happened in k-dramas but nooo, it *has* to happen to me lol 

TL;DR: Guy I asked out online who goes to my uni even though we don't know each other and only talked twice online is actually part of the management at a university cafe that i will be starting to work at. Meaning, I have to meet him and I'm scared he's going to think I'm stalking him hence i am contemplating dropping out but that will probably make the other cafe members hate me for acting super excited and then dropping out suddenly for no reason.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8osu5/real_life_kdramain_a_bad_way/
