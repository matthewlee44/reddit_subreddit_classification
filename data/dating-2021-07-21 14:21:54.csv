0,oowzle,1626895353,Is it weird that I get jealous of my bf‚Äôs ex sometimes?,"I (19f) have been dating my lovely boyfriend (20m) for almost 2 years now ever since our freshman year of university. He is my first for everything and I love him so much and we are moving in together in about a month! He has always been super transparent about everything and he has told me about all his previous relationships. But if I think about them, it makes me a bit uncomfy?

His main relationship was a gf during junior year to senior year of high school and I sometimes feel jealous about it when I think about them together..? Or like at the experiences they had together? I feel uncomfortable/sad thinking about how they went to prom, loved each other, hugged and kissed or cuddled the same way he and I do now, or how they took each other‚Äôs v cards and fucked like almost everyday. I‚Äôve told him how I feel about this before and he‚Äôs tried explaining/reassuring that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a reason why relationships end‚Äù and obviously, he‚Äôs dating me, not her; but I think there‚Äôs nothing he can really do about it since it‚Äôs a me thing? 

Maybe it‚Äôs just because he‚Äôs my first and I wish he could‚Äôve experienced these with me first and I understand this is probably a bit relationshiply immature of me to think lol. I try not to think about it because you know, past is in the past, but it‚Äôs hard to just stop thinking about it. Plus there is absolutely nothing for me to be worried about: We trust each other, we don‚Äôt hide anything, and we are both so happy together! 

But yeah, just wondering if this is normal/is there any way to stop me from thinking about this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oowzle/is_it_weird_that_i_get_jealous_of_my_bfs_ex/

She replied with something like ""omg DONT, men need to make the first move or it will come across that ur easy or crazy"".

Later on during our 'date' (we went for a walk to the beach), we sat beside each other and talked. he turned around to point out something behind us and I just went for it. A big ol' smooch on the cheek. He turned and looked at me and I kissed him again, on the lips.

7,ooxkno,1626897114,Sugar baby to Gf to Friend,"Hey everyone,

NSFW for talk of sexwork. 

I just wanna first say please be gentle but honest. I'm feeling pretty raw and tender right now, so please try to see me as human in your replies. 

That said, **the short of it is** that I dated a woman for two years which ended horribly because we ran into very MINOR financial trouble. My family is pretty well-off, but she didn't know this. We had great sex, a nice place, we both loved the same things, and we were happy for the most part. From my perspective, everything was great until money was a problem.  She still dumped me immediately after money problems, so I came to the conclusion that money was the key motivator in relationships. Eventually, after many arguments, she blocked me on everything as I was not civil about it. I was rude and cold as I felt she betrayed me (I took care of her and gave her money when she really needed it, but when I hit a rough patch she just left). I find myself hating her because of this.

**Most recently,** I tried dating a Sugarbaby. It was long-distance. I never met her in person. She promptly told me what she wanted. Things started mostly sexual. Everything was clear. No lies. Straight to the point. We worked it out for quite some time (about a year), but eventually I wanted an emotional connection. Of course, as I thought might happen, that didn't work because she said she isn't attracted to me at all even though we have a lot of similar interests. She was very straight-forward which I appreciate. I still think she was wrong to make this conclusion without even seeing me in person or many photos of me at all (In her videos and photos she sent me I felt she was like a 7.5 and I'm at least like 6-7 in looks), but that's her decision.

**From there, we downgraded to a friendship. Today, my friendship ended with the second woman** because she was over the sugar thing and found a new relationship. I didn't want to know the details, but she told me she lusts for them and that she never needed me. I was honest with her and told her that I want her and not to be her friend.  The sheer idea of me wanting her made her so uncomfortable she blocked me. She said she lost respect for me after I told her that I wanted her physically and emotionally to myself (in very plain language) - That I disrespected her relationship (she's been with this person for maybe... 2 weeks as far as I know, if longer, it was in secret). She told me, ""Money can't buy love, Soft-Secretary-7407."" I still very much feel attached to her, and I miss her even though she shut me down so hard and painfully and won't even be my friend.

In the end, I feel like either there's something severely wrong with me or that relationships just can't work in modern times as the apps are horrible for me. I don't believe in 'THE ONE' or cosmic love or something like that. I am feeling very lost, hopeless, and honestly a bit suicidal. 

Have any of you been through something similar? What would some of you do in my position?

TLDR; I feel like I need someone in my life to love, but I am struggling to believe I can find anyone after over 20+ relationships since I was young (about 3 painful long-term adult relationships).

I‚Äôve got nobody to blame but myself.  The signs were there from the very beginning, probably since the 2nd or 3rd date.  We got along perfectly when were together, in person, but when we weren‚Äôt together it was like pulling teeth to try to get a response from her and to make plans.  I asked her to give me a call multiple times, she never did.  The only thing I ever asked from her.  I would always pay the bill, but the one time I went to the bathroom while the check was being brought out at dinner, she decided to split it instead of picking up that one tab.  It was awkward because when I got back I was thanking her, thinking that she had picked it up.  Then my card came back with the receipt, realizing that she split it lol.  Also, she was never including me in anything she was doing or talking about (future plans etc.).

Guys, I was an idiot.  I thought maybe she was just oblivious a bit or I had to win her over, but these signs should never be ignored.  I always though I‚Äôm the back of my mind that maybe she didn‚Äôt like me all that much or had someone else on the side but I ignored those feelings....don‚Äôt.

1. Was it a mistake texting her? Would it have been better if I had just left it alone?

Hot date? When‚Äôs that last time some guy has had one of those? more like extremely platonic meeting where you discuss hobbies and interests and she barley smiles. 

I am so sorry you have to sit here with me instead of that guy with the sharp jawline you wanted.These women give off zero indication they are actually attracted to you. She could line up a decent, good looking guy every day if she wanted. And she‚Äôs just some girl.

What should a guy do, leave? try again in 5 months when you can find another date. That‚Äôs untenable, you have to compromise, meet their expectations of trying to impress them.

shit tests, flaking, pay for their dinners. This is what women do. Not flirting or making you feel good about yourself. You flirt and do everything you can in the short window of time she allows you to try to make her ‚Äúfeel a spark‚Äù.

It takes several months to even get a match and response from a girl who would meet your average 20s guy basic requirements. Overwhelmingly, a guy is going to get ‚Äúlikes‚Äù (in quotes because they don‚Äôt actually like you,   they see you as someone who benefits them in a creepy status/financial way) from women who either barley speak English (they‚Äôre always swiping on white guys), overweight, or have kids.

No man has those kind of options.

How am I suppose to relate to someone like this?

I‚Äôve noticed that 20-something single moms have much better personalities. They will actually respond, match your energy, SMILE, and follow up with questions. I don‚Äôt know if this is because they have actually been humbled for once in their life or the character had been there all along, but they never bothered because not until now do they actually need something from you (support/money).

16,oozmmj,1626903358,[29M] Trying to lose virginity but unable to get it up to have sex,"I've been a virgin all my 29 years of life but lately found a girlfriend. We love each other's company but for the love of me, I cannot get it up. We've tried on two occasions already, once in a very comportable space (my apartment) but every time, the scenario is the same - it seems like everything is OK but then when we try to go all the way or when she tries to perform oral sex on me, my penis goes soft within seconds... We can be cuddling and it would seem like it's getting hard but then when it goes out of the pants - instant boner killer. We even tried twice on the same night with a lot of space inbetween with cuddling and just being with each other but again - it _seemed_ to be working when it was in the pants (though even then it's softer than I'd ever imagine it be in a company of a girl knowing how easy it is for me to get it up on my own) but then started gradually getting softer during the BJ.

I don't understand that cause I'm crazy about her and I thought that having an erect penis is going to be the least of my problems when the occasion arises cause I never had _any_ trouble with it but it's proving to be impossible so far. I don't use porn in any excessive amount and in the past weeks, I'm not even masturbating (with or without porn) and yet still even though everything looks fine, I cannot get it up in the situation that should seem _the most hot_, ie. her naked and the situation steamy. I thought that in a safe space and after a couple of dates it would resolve on its own but even though we cuddled for _hours_ that one night, it still did not help.

Is this normal? Can this take a few tries and just resolve on its own? I know that the subconscious stress, me not being accustomed to anybody touching my penis and performance anxiety probably play a factor but I just thought that even if this did not work the first time, it'd be sure to work by the second one, especially since the surroundings were familiar, safe and unrushed. I don't want to shove any medicines down my throat until I'm certain that's the only way, hence why I'm asking about the proclivity for that to resolve on its own. Any personal accounts?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm overworked and underpaid. I don‚Äôt have the money, time, or energy. Dates take an hour or two over beers. And then I‚Äôm done.‚Äù

I‚Äôve been in a similar situation before. And the idea of swiping left and right compulsively out of boredom, and meeting people for drinks just to change the routine, wasn‚Äôt appealing to me. **Boredom dating is like boredom eating: You do it just because it‚Äôs there. But it‚Äôs tasteless. And usually unhealthy.**

In my experience, boredom is a symptom of something else: an unfulfilling career, a fear of the unknown, unattended personal issues. It‚Äôs easier said than done, but I‚Äôm happier when I deal with one of those symptoms first before heading back into the dating pool.

If you‚Äôre in the dating pool and you‚Äôre consistently getting mediocre dates, then one or more of these reasons is probably the cause. I talk about these reasons in more detail [here](https://psiloveyou.xyz/4-reasons-dating-isnt-working-for-you-b985cf3f11c1), but the main points are:

# 1. Showing up at a potluck expecting to eat, but not bringing any food 

I can‚Äôt count how many people in the dating pool have shown up with bland dishes and empty pots. Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt control what other people bring to a date. But you can decide [what you bring](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/on34e3/how_i_genuinely_connect_with_any_girl_on_a_date/). 

And the first thing you don‚Äôt bring? A bucket of expectations. Don‚Äôt expect your date to be something. Instead, ask yourself: ‚ÄúHow can I bring out interesting things from this person?‚Äù

# 2. Qualifying dates

Online dating makes it even easier: You can specify what height or pet preferences you want from a date. But these specifications lead to missed opportunities.

Instead, think of the ONE thing you want to have from a date. And be honest with yourself. Are you looking for a fuck buddy? A friend to geek out with? A good, but platonic conversation?

**Don‚Äôt look for:** A good conversation with someone who‚Äôs into dogs and who‚Äôs also watched Sense8 and who‚Äôs cute enough to fuck and they‚Äôre not looking for a relationship right now, but they might consider it if the stars align in your favor.

This makes dating unnecessarily difficult. And it‚Äôs selfish. Dating isn‚Äôt about looking for and getting what you want. That‚Äôs what jerks do. Have you ever felt drained and used by a person? Then you just got jerked! And **we don‚Äôt want to jerk other people unless it‚Äôs the pleasurable kind.**

# 3. Being too preoccupied with oneself.

Dating is like taking a walk in a huge eco-park. If one is too busy worrying about their undone shoelace, or the smudge in their boots, or taking Instagrammable shots to show friends how much fun or not-fun one is having, the entire experience is missed.

# 4. You‚Äôve been on too many bad dates and you need to stop.

You‚Äôre burned out from dating. You‚Äôve become cynical. And it‚Äôs starting to show.

Dating burnout makes you more judgmental and closed to new experiences. So you‚Äôre not in the [best mindset to meet someone new](https://psiloveyou.xyz/how-to-genuinely-connect-with-anyone-on-a-date-48f54ccece4f). You‚Äôre almost always subconsciously waiting for your date to trip on your red flag minefield.

Solution?

* Step back and do other things.
* Have some fun again.
* Go on a solo trip (or plan one if you can‚Äôt travel yet).
* Hang out with your activity group (hiking group, running group, yoga besties, etc.)

# As for my date that night?

I've decided not to see her again. I'm better off not being someone else's boredom fidget. I sent her a message, of course. (""Hi! Thanks for last night. I don't think we'll work out together though. Have a good day!"") I don't ghost. And I don't lie about having a good time either.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/op108p/4_reasons_dating_isnt_working_for_you/

I love my boyfriend so much and I would have loved to marry him. He is an amazing person, but I believe we hold each other back.  Seems impossible to improve simultaneously but somehow, it‚Äôs very much possible to depreciate simultaneously ???? As time passes, I feel myself slowly and unconsciously cutting off some emotions. It‚Äôs a defense mechanism I tend to do when I don‚Äôt want to get hurt no more. 

My boyfriend (24M) and I (24F) have been together for 3.5 years now and were best friends for like 2 years before that. We know how to have a good time together, lots of laughs with similar He is my second serious boyfriend while I‚Äôm his first. When we first met, I was struggling with depression + others and was at a really low point, mentally. I was needy and toxic; he was inexperienced and immature. 

I could go more into depth but basically, he‚Äôs a great and trustworthy dude and I sincerely love him so much, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like we should break up. We‚Äôve BEEN agreed that self-growth and healing needs to be independently done on both ends, but neither have enough time to make a genuine impact. When we are happy, disagreements are easy, but when old issues and/or mental blocks creep back, we can‚Äôt find a solution. We barely fight now but when we do, it‚Äôs the same DAY1 routine over and over again.
1) I explain why I‚Äôm upset ‚Äî&gt; 
2) he says sorry ‚Äî&gt; 
3) if I don‚Äôt let it go instantly, then I‚Äôll take solo time to think ‚Äî&gt;

I WANT my boyfriend to feel positively about life and himself more often than not.

He also drove from another state to see me and then visit his parents. aAfter the date things seemed fine?

39,op1wp5,1626910641,An analogy for why things sometimes end abruptly,"TL;DR - Basically sometimes you know that the person you're seeing isn't someone that can make you feel those emotions that you've experienced before. Instead of letting go, you try to force yourself to interact with them as if you were extremely interested. You think that if you treat them like a boyfriend/girlfriend, they would eventually be someone that you want to be in a relationship with, but that never happens. This leaves the other party hurt. I think this is the reason why people 'lead people on'. Its not malicious, they were having an internal battle with themselves.

**(I am horrible at writing. If someone can convey what I'm trying to say more concisely, please do. Is there a name for this behaviour\^?)**

Below is a vivid dream that I had that led to this post (its horrible I know, I'll hire an english major to re-write it lol):

*You're a man living in a hypothetical world consisting of rooms along a corridor.*

*In this world, all single people spend time in 'Room 1'. You've been in 'Room 1' a while, maybe a couple of years; you've had trouble meeting someone that is willing to invest in a relationship with you. One day, in Room 1, you meet a girl who is very interested in you and is willing to be that person.*

*You take this girl's hand and you go knock on 'Room 2'. Within Room 2 is the largest store of dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin in this world. As such, the room is guarded. You yearn for the contents of Room 2... you've had access to it before.* 

*The guard answers the door, and opens it to the extent of the chain.* 

*You: ""Hey. I've met a girl (\*pointing at her\*). You can let me in again.""*

*The guard looks at the girl up and down..*

*Guard: ""Not tall enough, too fat, weird teeth. No way in hell I'm letting you come through this door with her. Come back with someone else"".*

*He shuts the door in your face. After taking a second to process what had just happened, you get angry. You begin slamming on the door.*

*You: ""Hey! What the fuck do you mean someone else? This person is smart and kind and they want to be with me! You think they're everywhere? Fuck you! Why do you have these rules? What are they for? Fuck you! Let me in!""*  

*You're angry. You want the contents of room 2; the contents are the whole point of this. In a normal situation, people move from Room 1, to 2, to 3. Room 3 is the room where you engage with your new partner and do all the cheesy things that come with a new relationship. In room 3 you send each other good morning texts, hold hands in public, and talk on the phone even if nothing interesting happened.  You know you shouldn't but you're desperate. You devise a plan to trick the guard and make him question his assessment of this girl. You want to prove to the guard that the girl is in fact someone that is 'good enough' by proving that you can stand to engage in couple activities with her. So you grab the girl and you head for room 3. You guys stay in room 3 for weeks and do all the things that madly in love couples do...even though you are forcing every act. Eventually, you return to Room 2 and you knock on it.*

*You: ""See! You were wrong. If she isn't someone that can qualify to enter this room, then how come I have enjoyed weeks of interacting with her like she's my girlfriend?""*

*The guard just sighs and shuts the door.*

*At this moment you breakdown. Sitting on the floor, you pull out your phone and you text the girl that you've made believe you are heavily invested in, and you tell her that you guys aren't going to be seeing each other anymore.*",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/op1wp5/an_analogy_for_why_things_sometimes_end_abruptly/
40,op20zh,1626911057,"feeling anxious and guilty over this, is it a red flag if he wants to come over?"," 

I met him through FB dating and I was trying to stop thinking about a guy I met casually through my school because he was acting strange and eventually we went back home in his home country.

I developed a crush on him but I felt bad because he was giving me mixed signs and then he had to leave.

The first conversation with fb guy was promising and he seemed interesting, we met and he paid for my lunch.

He was nice and he texted me every day before the date. We talked a bit and overall it was fine but I didn‚Äôt feel a strong attraction in both looks and personality and honestly, I cannot understand his accent much.

He has been texting me every day or almost everyday and he said he wanted to meet again. I was open to it because I rarely feel super attracted after one date but he said he wanted to chill at my place or the seaside, he couldn‚Äôt at his own place.

I said I preferred to go for a walk and he was ok with it but then he said that day we planned he was busy. He keeps texting me everyday and the conversation feels...boring, very casual etc, we talk about stuff but there's no getting to know part. We don't talk about personal things aside from minor daily stuff.

He didn‚Äôt ask me out again and last time it was over two weeks ago, I am not staying here in this country for long and I may leave soon too.

I mentioned it because my plans keep changing due to covid and here it was supposed to be a temporary staying, he mentioned again chilling at home watching movies and tv series.

The self-inviting move by someone I barely met once seems a little too much...it would have been different if I asked him to come over but it seemed strange to want to chill at my house randomly.

Maybe he is trying to get laid or maybe I am biased because I am not into him  as I thought?

I would have accepted to go out again for walks and stuff, not spending money or anything to give him a chance but he doesn‚Äôt seem to ask anymore and chilling at home with someone I barely know is not appealing to me.

I feel guilty because he texts me but I am not sure if this is quality attention or if I overreacting because I want to break it off.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/op20zh/feeling_anxious_and_guilty_over_this_is_it_a_red/
41,op211r,1626911063,Dating is based on such shallow drivel!,"You meet someone you like and are expected to swap pointless conversations about the TV shows you watch, where you are from, pop culture and the interesting hobbies you stopped doing five years ago.

It's so god damn tedious!

All dating proves is that the majority of the human race are empty, shallow, shells that have NOTHING of worth to contribute to the planet other than CO2 emitions.

Even the ones who project as confident and interesting have just memorised a load of topics to distract you from the fact they have a borderline mental disorder. 

And have posted the three pictures they have of the fancy restaurant they visited three years ago. We all know you spend 90% of your time watching Netflix so why pretend?

You like to go travelling? Good for you. Way to sit right at the top of the fucking bell curve you average sheep.

You won't find out if your partner is intelligent and is willing and able to stand by you in a shit storm by swapping who your favourite Love Island contestant is so why the FUCK do we have to go through the same boring ass routine EVERY GOD DAMN TIME!?!?

Every time you fight to not get ghosted by staying engaged in the torrent of boring trash conversation only to find out they are as fucked up as the rest of us.

Then inevitably break up because neither of you were the exciting catch that you had to pretend to be to get that far in the first place.

Rinse and fucking repeat!

No wonder so many guys have commitment issues. You know why? Because going to a bar, playing some moves and sleeping with a woman who will leave the next morning is SOOO much better than dating.

Then what happens if you do find your way through the miasma of each others company? You can look forward to getting married and having kids..........great.

Dating and the torture of going through the dating process is like saying ""Instead of this prime cut of sirloin steak I'm going to try butchering a cow myself. But when I have gone through the effort of raising a cow and the mental scars of slitting it's throat and pulling it's entrails out I'll hand it to a factory owner and turn it into processed mince full of chemicals anyway.

43,op2d9u,1626912250,Rejected?,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn‚Äôt interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn‚Äôt get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response‚Ä¶ thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn‚Äôt think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me.  She didn‚Äôt specifically reject me or say she wasn‚Äôt interested but i took this as a rejection because if she was into me she would have giving me an alternative 

I told her i understood and I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn‚Äôt want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn‚Äôt need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn‚Äôt talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn‚Äôt know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird. 

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn‚Äôt... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest. I dony want to put anyone in an uncomfterbal spot.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/op2d9u/rejected/

46,op3cqn,1626915746,I'm M(21) why does F(22) give me such dry replies in text but the opposite energy in real life?," 

Why is this girl giving me dry replies in text messages?

This girl let‚Äôs just call her K (I have a crush on) told her best friend which then told me that she is really glad she meet me and she‚Äôs happy with how much closer we have gotten during the month of June and I‚Äôm a great guy.¬†

I remember one time when her best friend invited me to come and hang out with me and K right in front of K and I said yes and K got so happy and said hell yes I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôre coming and high five her best friend.¬†

One time we were going to a restaurant as a group of 4 and K called me and asked if she wanted to walk with her to the restaurant I stupidly said no because I already promised my best friend I would walk with him but her best friend actually got jealous and upset that she wanted to walk with me to the restaurant instead off with her since she was used as a substitute person to walk with because I said no. I would think her asking me to walk with her over her bf shows some level of interest.¬†

All these are positive signs however I won‚Äôt be seeing K for a while so I was trying to keep the momentum going by texting her but she‚Äôs been giving me dry painful replies like one lined¬† sentences and picking and choosing what parts of the text to reply too. The thing that hurts the most is that i always have to text first otherwise i won't hear from her in weeks. It just screams uninterested at me but then I don‚Äôt get why she said all that positive stuff¬† about me to her friend and even gets happy when I hang out with her. It seems like such a contradiction to me. I‚Äôve made all the texts about her interest since girls like to talk about themselves but still no luck. What‚Äôs happening? Why is there such a huge contraction in text then in person? I‚Äôm such a good texter as well I literally be having text convos that last 6 months with majority of my friends including other girls but for some reason I can‚Äôt last more then 2 days with her when texting. ¬†",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/op3cqn/im_m21_why_does_f22_give_me_such_dry_replies_in/

49,op3svq,1626917374,Was she ever interested?,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn‚Äôt interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn‚Äôt get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response‚Ä¶ thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn‚Äôt think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me.  She didn‚Äôt specifically reject me or say she wasn‚Äôt interested but i took this as a rejection because if she was into me she would have giving me an alternative 

I told her i understood and I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn‚Äôt want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn‚Äôt need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn‚Äôt talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn‚Äôt know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird. 

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn‚Äôt... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest. I dony want to put anyone in an uncomfterbal spot.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/op3svq/was_she_ever_interested/

55,op4a2n,1626919161,How to deal with a rumor?,"About 3 years ago I had a summer fling with this woman before I moved away for grad school. A couple months later she moved away for a job. It started off super casual but we started to like each other more and more by the end, and we kept in touch for the first month I was there and even hooked up when I visited home. Soon after that we decided to stop talking because of the distance and in order to fully be single in our new locations. 

Fast forward to this summer. My friends and I we're hanging out and they were drinking. One friend (S) asked me about that girl and the other (G) said that a different friend of ours (D) hooked up with her after I had moved. D had hinted at having interest in her when I was about to move but kinda played it off as a joke. S said that if D and the girl hooked up he would have heard about it. I asked G again later when sober and he said he heard it through the grape vine but can't remember who. 

Why does this matter? Well we both moved back and I was thinking about trying to hang with her and see where things go. I've always felt weird about sleeping with the same people as my friends. Some people don't care some do. 

Just not sure if I should ask her if it's true, or ask D if it's true, or just dismiss it as a rumor.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/op4a2n/how_to_deal_with_a_rumor/

We've been meeting up quite often, almost every week for the past 2 months. We mostly met up to exercise, but I've also asked her out for dinner and drinks twice, and supper once. I was the one initiating, but she agreed quite eagerly both times. Not sure if this makes my interest in her clear, or whether she's interested in me by agreeing so readily. 

We've also been texting a fair bit, and she would often start a convo asking me how my day was if we haven't texted for a few days. She's usually always online, but the frequency of her replies are somewhat inconsistent. Not sure what this means but oh wells.

Hoping that she reciprocates my feelings, but if she doesn't, I hope we can remain friends cause she's such an awesome person. Never done this before and it's soooo nerve-wracking to think about it!

62,op4u66,1626921187,I've noticed I've attracted more attention from girls wearing a mask than without one.,"Long story short, as the pandemic rolled in masks started to be worn, I changed up my clothing style and became more confident in that way but also less self conscious about my face. In the mean time, I've shaved my head and wore a cap most days and this meant I'm somewhat hidden but not quite. The only part of my face visible is my blue eyes and some nose. Honestly if you were to see me you'd probably think I look like Timothee Chalamet with the mask on and this is where my issues lies.

I've noticed a lot of girls sometimes just stare at me and start conversations with me instead of the usual vice-versa, it's easier to continue the conversation without the awkwardness I've had before.

Example, I was buying coffee and waiting a while, the waitress around the same age as me started the convo, we talked as if we knew each other on personal terms. Normally I wouldn't dream of talking to some random person let alone a girl about where they're going in the summer, who they're with, college etc you get the idea.

I feel like when this is a blessing and a curse for me, if I end up getting the waitresses number and we meet up without masks I feel like she'll see a different person.

65,op4xjk,1626921534,It feels like no one wants me and it makes me very sad sometimes,"I've been single since January. I needed time to recover from the relationship so i didn't start looking for anything serious until the end of March. I've tried nearly every dating app under the stars. It always ends up with either us matching and them never responding to the first text and unmatching, us talking for a little bit and the convo going dead, or us talking and it ends up in us just being friends . Since March, I've only met up with 5 people i've matched with on the dating apps. There's been only one person i've been successful with but after our 3rd hangout i asked if i could kiss him and he said no (so we're just friends and that's fine). I figured if i wasn't having any success with dating apps, i should get over my social anxiety and get out of my comfort zone and flirt with people in real life. Well i've done that, and it's failed miserably. Everyone has been taken. Also, i'm not sure if it's just where i live, but it feels like dating women is way harder than guys (for clarification i'm bisexual with a preference for women) . I rarely match with any girls on dating apps and it doesn't seem that many queer women are into hookups.  I went to pride and attempted to flirt, got rejected because i was too young, then tried to flirt with another girl and found out her age (she wasn't a minor but 18 is still too young for me). Also, no one ever approaches me. I always have to ask people for their numbers or ask them out and as an antisocial introvert it's absolute hell and takes me at a minimum 3 weeks to muster up the courage to ask someone's number which doesn't really work if you're probably never gonna see a person again unless you ask for their socials/number right in that moment. People say i'm super pretty and nice and i don't doubt i am but i wonder why if so, i'm always the one who has to ask for people's numbers etc. I've had so many rejections in the past 3 months it makes me wanna give up and wait for someone to just come to me. When i get super sad from this spectacle i just delete all my dating apps because in the same way being on social media for too long can cause you to get dopamine from likes, being on dating apps can do the same.

Maybe I just can't communicate how I feel. Or maybe I don't commit fully. I went to see her one day and had quite the cute coupley day. In a precise moment I remember thinking, ok maybe she is worth a proper shot. I'll try be there for her properly now and commit to this a bit more. Kissed her as I left the next morning and thought things could be good.

Literally like some grand cosmic joke at my expense, she went deathly quiet and didn't text for a few days. Then she alluded to something going on and needing time. I instantly knew something bad was coming. Then 2 days later I get a text to say she bumped into am ex and they're getting back together and 'sorry for the run around'. I was so stunned and blindsided that I just laughed initially. Couldn't believe it. The timing of me deciding to change and this happening just couldn't be worse. Especially as I'd just started my own business and am under crazy stress. 

Nearly 2 weeks pass and suddenly a lot of terrible thoughts have set in. Like anxiety, trust issues, lack of control or emotions... Sort of questioning everything. What did I do or not do? How could I have not known or seen this coming? There was 0 warning or mention of an ex. In fact I thought she was pretty taken by me and I had nothing to worry about. All signs pointed that way.

It all happened just as I dropped the armour for the 1st time in years. I'm 30 and seriously worry I'm now going to be more jaded and closed off than ever now. The last person I wanted to trust just stabbed me in the back and didn't give me a 2nd thought. I've never known of a woman to use a man for sex lol. I think writing this crap out will help me get rid of the negative thoughts at least. I am tough and it's not my 1st rodeo. I have a date with someone hotter and younger in 2 days but honestly I feel nothing. Foggy. Lost. I don't want to go back to my old ways of fucking random women every week, not knowing their names etc. Something's got to change.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/op5kw5/im_not_sure_i_know_how_to_love_anyone_anymore/

I reassure her that I‚Äôm happy to go at whatever pace she wants she just has to be honest and she brings up that she was never looking for a relationship on the app and didn‚Äôt expect to meet someone she likes this much. I never told her I have feelings for her just that I really like her and care about her, and she said cause she‚Äôs confused she feels so shit since we have feelings each other but the prospect of being in a relationship makes her uncomfortable right now. She asked for my advice and I said look right now if we end it it won‚Äôt make sense, you just said you have feelings for me how about we continue to see each other after lockdown and if something happens it does. She agreed and stated she wants to try instead of just giving up. She lives on her own so I‚Äôm thinking the anxiety and loneliness might be getting to her and she‚Äôs a little in her own head?

Never really been assertive with my romantic life, but lately I decided to talk to this cute cashier girl at my local corner store, there's been this tension (well at least my dumb brain was thinking that), long eye contact between us. 

So I started with a ""how's your day going?"". She said her day was slow and boring. *small victory* 

A few days later I asked her if her day was still boring , she gave a big expression of a frown and we shared a laugh. 

At this point after, I'm thinking ok, time to grow a spine and ask for her Instagram name. 

And I did it, she wrote it down on the back of my receipt. She accepted my follow request and when I saw her IG page,  I let out a big sigh and immediately regretted my decision.

She has 3 kids, and some pics with her and the baby father. I would ideally like to start a family one day with someone who doesn't have kids, but man 3 kids? The youngest just turned 1.

She's planning on joining the military against everyone's wishes, she thinks it's the only way for her to succeed in life even though she can go to college. 


She spoke to a recruiter without talking to me first and expected me to be fine with it. This is what really stung. before we said I love you I asked her if she was planning on joining the military and she told me no, so I went through it and committed to our relationship than she turns around and does this to me. 


She hasn't taken into consideration about how I feel about this whole situation, she assumed I would be happy seeing her for 10 days every 120 days and for a few hours once a month and that I'll be happy sitting in my room every day by myself. I crave physical attention, I've had my fair share of internet friends but nothing beats cuddling and watching a movie. 


I really love her but I can't handle this situation. I feel like I've been lead on, I don't support her doing this, I refuse to do long distance, and she won't listen to what everyone is telling her.

Long story short, my life went down the shitter, and that all ended with me going to a psych ward and figuring out I have PTSD. As of right now, it's been 17 months since the relationship ended. 

In those 17 months I have tried to date other people, but since I was dealing with PTSD with no proper counseling for most of it, I failed again and again because my own trauma kept getting in the way. I recently started seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist, and I've been doing much better. Even though my mental state was getting better, my love life was still nonexistant. I was an inch away from deleting all the dating apps and giving up completely.

Then I matched with a girl who I clicked with immediately. It was like we were two defunct puzzle pieces that fit together perfectly. We talked for a good 3 days straight, then yesterday we went on a date. We met up at a local park, played a round of mini-golf, then we sat down under a pavillion and went through the ""36 questions to fall in love.""

After that we went back to my car cause it was getting dark and starting to rain, and we just talked for a good while. The night ended with us sharing a kiss that we didnt want to end. We've been texting all day today and we have a 2nd date planned for this upcoming Sunday.

98,op7gzc,1626931600,"Just found out about the AI companion ‚ÄúReplika‚Äù, my thoughts on AI companions‚Ä¶.","I also saw this movie called ‚ÄúHotBot‚Äù (I KNEW it was going to have terrible reviews when I Googled it) which represents the final stage (what next stage could there be?), more advanced and realistic AI companion.

I am 25 years old, I‚Äôm a guy, I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend, I am a virgin, and A LOT of girls have told me I‚Äôm ugly. So naturally, when I find out about something like this, my mind thinks of it more seriously, like is this an actual potential option to not be completely alone? Yes, the idea depresses me, nonetheless. 

But, being that I‚Äôve seen 30-40+ year old men online claiming to be virgins who have never had a girlfriend, I figure since I‚Äôve already had such a track record for being ‚Äúugly‚Äù, and reached 25, I‚Äôm pretty likely to end up the same way. Especially since all other aspects of my life are broken and I‚Äôll probably end up homeless worst case, or best case, maybe in a decent paying career that is meaningless just like these dead end (but way below living wage, even fulltime hours) retail jobs.

So maybe I‚Äôll somehow end up in a decent career that I can live off of, but it‚Äôll probably be meaningless and/or get boring quick, even worse when having to serve authority above me and deal with BS company policies. My mental health will only get worse, but I suppose it‚Äôd still be way worse if I was homeless.

I‚Äôm not sure if I even have the mental or emotional capacity to be in a serious long-term relationship anyway, I couldn‚Äôt last 25 years of misery and 7 years of more particular isolation without further psychological damage. That time is gone, and I‚Äôm still getting older.

They say you‚Äôre not supposed to pursue relationships until you ‚Äúgot your life together‚Äù. Supposedly you‚Äôre NEVER supposed to actively look for a relationship, but realistically you don‚Äôt get ANYTHING in life if you‚Äôre not even actively trying to. Even worse when your natural lifestyle is inside playing videogames and shit and you just don‚Äôt seem to understand how social connection in general works. 

You can swipe on every single woman on Tinder (assuming the algorithm doesn‚Äôt detect that and automatically ban you for doing that) and get literally not one match, it‚Äôs so superficial and based off of pictures, before any actual messaging. 

Dating is like a competition (just like working jobs) which I get has an aspect of nature to it, but to me, that just kind of devalues relationships. It should be a naturally, organic, connection, right? Fueled by the brain chemicals or whatever the hell we operate on (Rick Sanchez needed to explain LOL).

I‚Äôve spent most of my time at home on the internet (aside from going to a meaningless miserable dead end retail job) but I also went to grade school/high school once, and what I experienced was a social nightmare, so I‚Äôve been in a ‚Äúphysical social world‚Äù, I guess.

In addition to that, in MORE RECENT YEARS, I got told I was ugly by a lot online, which made me feel even lower than I already did, especially because I was feeling hopeful that I might actually be attractive.

So, look at what I‚Äôve went through, and I‚Äôm 25 now, and there exist guys in their 30s, 40s, older, just like me. So seems pretty certain I‚Äôm already set in their fate, right?

I don‚Äôt know, surely there must be things they could have done better in their control, maybe they‚Äôre not telling the full story (since it‚Äôs so easy to lie and be believed online).

But I once asked someone ‚Äúmaybe women just tell me I‚Äôm ugly because they‚Äôve been abused and assume/fear I‚Äôm the same‚Äù (it‚Äôs not just that I‚Äôm ‚Äúugly‚Äù, they‚Äôre unnecessarily extra mean about it) and they said ‚Äúno that is probably not true‚Äù, which means that I really must just be ugly.

I‚Äôve been hit on by guys, even happened in real life. Upset me more because I‚Äôm not gay but it‚Äôs only guys who think I‚Äôm attractive?

I mean, I had a female friend who once wanted to do it, but I chickened out. A few LDR online (but really like that can count).

A lot of people say ‚Äúromantic‚Äù relationships are less important than ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù and ‚Äúfamily‚Äù anyway, so that implies ‚Äúromantic‚Äù isn‚Äôt special, or it is less special? So, if anything, wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù (as far as sex being considered important and special) be better than a ‚Äúromantic‚Äù relationship?

I‚Äôm very confused, I have no personal reference to understand. But I think in a very logical, precise way, otherwise it‚Äôd be too easy to fool me‚Ä¶.. 

I doubt I‚Äôm able to communicate my thoughts exactly as I intend to, it‚Äôs very hard to do so.

I very much wish I had a girlfriend sometimes. Yes, I get horny and just have that animal urge for sex, but I also crave the more emotional aspects too. Like, just cuddling and talking, being touched, haven‚Äôt even hugged a female since, 5 or 6 years, maybe?

It seems kind of ridiculous to think that I‚Äôm some kind of anomaly who just can‚Äôt attract any females (specified females because I‚Äôm not gay, even though I‚Äôve been desirable to males) but it obviously happens to other guys, who are even much older than me.

Maybe it‚Äôll happen ONE DAY, right? Maybe when I‚Äôm in my 30s, 40s, even 50s? Personally I find it particularly devastating to still be a virgin who‚Äôs never had a girlfriend at 25, definitely more so past 20s, but everyone says ‚ÄúAGE DOESN‚ÄôT MATTER!!!!!‚Äù 

To me, age kind of matters, because there‚Äôs like a magic with being younger, the whole young love I‚Äôll never get to experience now. Aside from that, it‚Äôs just simply getting older, closer to death (and we‚Äôre not even guaranteed to live another day) but we live in a society where everyone yells at you that it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter WHEN things happen‚Äù, even though they‚Äôre usually saying this hypocritically.

Maybe I could just have an AI companion and a real good fleshlight until that ‚Äúone day‚Äù but even that idea doesn‚Äôt strike me right, it rubs me the wrong way (no pun intended). Seems like it‚Äôd be unhealthy and worsen the ability to connect, even though I may never meet anyone to connect with anyway, but it could also just be far into the future.

Biology has time limits (I‚Äôm antinatalist so don‚Äôt want kids, but still have desires for sex and companionship).

For some reason having these experiences WHILE I‚ÄôM YOUNG matters a lot to me, even though so many people say it doesn‚Äôt matter if it happens now or 20 years from now. A lot of people also say you shouldn‚Äôt plan on enjoying life in general until ‚Äúretirement‚Äù which I think is absolutely ridiculous, because you just worked away all of your youth and most of your entire life, TO JUST NOW ENJOY LIFE?
