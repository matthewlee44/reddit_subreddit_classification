(f19) I’ve been seeing this guy (m18) for about two months now and I really like him. We met on hinge and have been going on a date per week typically.

We’ve recently talked about becoming exclusive but what does this mean? From my understanding I’m still not allowed to call him boyfriend, right?

This is just a weird in between stage I don’t really get - I was wondering if anyone has successfully moved into labeling their relationship and how long it took them to get there? I know he has some commitment issues so I don’t want to scare him off by rushing into things, but I do wish we were official personally as it would relieve some anxiety I have about what we are…

8,qsdy8n,1636731871,Need help dating as a guy with Asperger’s,"I’m 21 and have been dating for 3 years, some successes but a lot of failures along the way and it’s difficult to pinpoint what I’m doing wrong. In recent ones after going out two people said they weren’t looking for a relationship and wanted to just be friends but after pinpricking further one said I would “joke around too much in a nudging way” and it turned off them off. another one said “The attraction wasn’t there”. 

I could tell both were extremely comfortable with me and genuinely wanted to be friends but I just want someone to actually be attracted to me and I’m not sure how to do it. 

I’ve done some deep research on previous reddit posts regarding this topic and I’ve done all the things people suggest, such as being openly flirty and light teasing, and actually expressing your interest. One thing I do notice is that I’m really not emotional and bad at opening up; so for example if someone is doing something that bothers me I won’t open up and communicate which can hinder a real connection.

I’ve asked 3 people to describe me and they all said a variation of: really chill, friendly, and nice.

I’m mildly successful, have my own business, know when to cut my losses with chicks and definitely don’t go overboard lovebombing them after first dates.

I’m meeting nearly all of these people from online dating apps so I hope to god it’s just them finding someone better but it’s really discouraging to have had limited success. In the past 2 years I’ve met up with maybe 20 or so people, 5-6 seemed genuinely interested but faded after long texting. I’ve had sex with 2 and only one turned into a 1 month relationship who left me because she “lost feelings”.

Can someone explain how I should generally act in these dates to ensure a decent rate of attraction?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsdy8n/need_help_dating_as_a_guy_with_aspergers/

On wednesday evening i follow up on that question asking if everything is allright cuz she did't reply at all.

now on friday evening as i write this, she still hasn't replied to that, while being online numerous times (I dont check that often cuz i don't wanne be that guy but i couldn't help myself)

37,qsgjq5,1636739036,"I’m finally going to ask her out, and I’m hoping this post will hold me accountable","I’ve been suffering from some bad social anxiety for the past couple years. I’ve recently been forcing myself out of my comfort zone to get out more and interact with people. Slowly but surely I feel like I’m becoming somewhat normal. I think my anxiety is forever a part of me, but I’ve learned to give it the respect it requires meaning I’ve been taking the time to understand it and confront it. I’ve been figuring out how to identity when my thoughts are irrational which has been my biggest problem so far. All my anxious thoughts have been so prominent that even though I knew I had anxiety, I could never internalize the fact that my thoughts were in fact not representative of reality. As a result of my issues, I’ve had a hard time meeting people and opening up to them. My dating life has been completely empty for the last several years as a result. 

I’ve been toying with asking this girl out for the longest time, but I’ve been continually talking myself out of it. I’ve been really shy around her, so I felt like because I probably made a bad impression, there’s be no point in trying. I also didn’t know whether she was single or not, so of course I tell myself it’s not worth it to even ask her out. Then I tell myself she’s so gorgeous, so many other guys must be after her and she’s definitely not be into me if that were the case. She also lives in my building, so the last thing I’ve been telling myself is that if she’s not interested it will be awkward for her to have to see me around. While I don’t have any real signs she’s interested in me, I don’t care anymore. I’ve realized all of these things are ridiculous and irrational and I’m just holding myself back.

I finally feel like I have the confidence to do it, so I’m going to. I’m so excited. If I’m rejected it will definitely sting a bit because I’ve never really dated many people and haven’t ever really just asked some out like that. Despite that, I know taking the stride to push myself out of my comfort zone will be worth it even if I’m rejected.

I’m posting this for those who are in similar situations as me. Maybe I can inspire you a bit.

39,qsgk9p,1636739075,I’m in a tricky situation and could use some advice,"I’m in a tough place in life.

)Ok so I know I probably don’t have much of a reason to know what I’m doing, I’m an 18 yo Man, and I’ve got problems. 

DISCLAIMER, this is mostly a romantic life, self induced drama

For context, there is college: I. Am. Miserable. Here. I’ve already come to accept that, and I’m in the process of transferring somewhere else. But I can’t handle people here. I’ve been angry and sad every night for the last week. With all of that in mind it’s become a waiting game until next semester…(spring 2022)

Now for the main event. The girl. Let’s call her S. 

I met S at one of the lowest points of my life. My grandparent, who was very close to me -being one of the only people in the world I could trust to vent to- had passed away two days before I graduated high school. I’ve never fully processed my emotions with their passing, yet. Oh well. 

S is…unlike any girl I’ve ever met before. We were coworkers at a summer camp we both worked at this summer. We get along very well, and clicked so quickly. We would constantly be near each other (when we weren’t watching kids because obviously campers first). We would roast each other in that playful way you do when you like someone. We would talk every day, and still do. We did that little thing you do when you like someone where you bump into each other “by accident” (this was not one sided, she would instigate and reciprocate, I’m not just some obsessive creep)

Now, me being the bumbling and depressed buffoon of a man I am, I asked her out back then, after maybe three weeks of this^. As I’ve said before in other posts about this, I wouldn’t be here if that went well. 

She said she couldn’t, and of course , for sake of privacy, I’m not going to go deep into why, but I will say that she said something along the lines of “I can’t handle a relationship right now because of [previous bad experience with a man]”. I didn’t really get super sad about this (probably due to the overshadowing sadness from my passed loved one). 

So I said okay. I apologized profusely and she said it’s all okay. She thanked me for being a gentleman about it rather than being an asshole. And so we went about the rest of the summer still very close to one another. Now, and the risk of sounding projecting, I want to say that I still felt an undertone of her giving out vibes of still liking me, of that makes any sense. 

Flash forward 160 something days into the present. We still talk every day, admittedly via social media because I live in an entirely different state for the time being. It’s on Snapchat, yes. I’m A teenager so I’m allowed to.  Leave me alone. -Sidebar: We use Snapchat because I asked her for her number and she told me the whole “can’t handle relationship” thing then, plus it’s nice to see her and send goofy videos to one another-. 

We’ve actually grown closer, and she’s opened up to me more about things that trouble her. We’ve had some very heartfelt conversations and know we have each other’s back. 

To say I still like her would be the understatement of the year….

*I need to clarify that I am by no means friends with her just to be more than friends, one day. Not the case. I genuinely think of her as one of the closest people in my life, who I can trust to talk to or be there for me (which I don’t have very many of because I’m one of those stoic country). *

Now. I’m moving back home (where she is) in two months. 

What do I do? I’ve asked Reddit about this before on different rslashes, and here’s what I’ve gathered from other individuals (for whom I am grateful of): I’ve heard both sides of the argument. About how I can and will be putting our current relationship at risk by confessing feelings. About how being straightforward is more valued. About how I should wait for her?

-One that stuck out to me was would I be happy if she got a boyfriend. Would I really be happy for her or jealous and upset? Could I handle watching another man (or woman, because such is today’s world) have her? The short answer is no, I wouldn’t, and I am known to spiral due to internalization of any problem, even though I would be happy for her that she found (someone else)to have be there for her-

I will say that since the passing of the summer, I’ve realized that I need to be more direct with people, since I didn’t say all I wanted to my grandparent. 

So, fellow users, what do you think? How should I go about things? Should I wait and let her come to me? Do I try again and potentially fuck up? 

Help me. Please. 

Thank you for reading this far. I hope this post finds you well and in a good place. Have a good day!

Fast forward to several years later he ends up finding my social media and follows me on Instagram. However we still never spoke. I had surgery in January this year and I posted awareness for my health condition on my story for everyone to see. After years of not speaking this guy (J) messages me out of the blew and we really hit it off. We end up messaging each other back and fourth and we get on really well. This goes on for 3 months but all of a sudden it all came to a stop, probably because we were both busy with life. It’s been 6 months and we haven’t spoken since. I’ve been wanting to message him again but don’t know whether I should because it’s been so long since we last spoke. Before we stopped messaging each other he asked for my Snapchat to add and I left it for him to add me but he never did- so I just felt I should leave it. Should I just f*ck it and message him? Or shall I just leave it and take not adding me on Snapchat as a answer? I’m such an awkward person- I have no one to talk about this with:/",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsh41a/should_i_message_him/

Yesterday we talked and she confessed to me that she doesn't care about anyone's opinion, including mine. I asked her if that wouldn't make her an egoist and she proudly declared ""Yes, I'm an egoist, so what? Egoists win at life"". It was kind of unsettling me so I asked her if she isn't afraid of not finding love, friends etc. and being lonely, since people usually don't get along well with egoists, to which she confidently replied that not everyone is like me and some people are in fact attracted to egoists.

Shes single (I met two of her ex boyfriend in the span of the 2 years i lived with her) and hasn't dated anyone for the past 6 to 7 months, Although shes on dating sites and tells me about the guys that she talk to. Shes low key flirtatious with me and i have been the same but nothing physical happened untill a few weeks ago when we decided to go out. We both got really drunk and she encouraged me to touch her when we were dancing. Since i got the green light i started to grab her ass and boobs and kiss her neck. When i tried to make out with her she didnt let me. This happened throughout the night and we went home pretty drunk and she kept telling me to stop fighting my feelings and to let go. I thought we would have sex that night but i passed out on the couch and she didnt see me there so she went to sleep. I didnt see her for two more days because i went away from home after that because of an already planned trip. After that when i met her she clearly hinted to me how good that night was but didnt acknowledge what happened. I couldn't stop thinking of her after that night out so in the end i just vomited out my feelings. She didnt seem to match the same feelings I have and kept on trying to push me into the friend zone but the crazy part is she still keeps sucking me into thinking that i am more than a friend at the same time because of her actions and words.

From where I am coming from there’s really no such thing as casual sex. People will usually not have  sex with you if they don’t want a relationship with you. But from mu experience so far in the US and the things I’ve read so far on Reddit it seems things are very different here. I’m really tired of just hooking up. I really want a stable relationship.

83,qsloc8,1636753502,Moving on from a rejection,"I (27 M) fell for a friend. She is smart, kind and really beautiful. I asked her out and she said she didn't feel the same way about me. This was back a few months ago!

We stayed in touch, met a few times and I feel I handled the rejection pretty maturely. I needed space which I got and I moved on. I also eventually moved to a different city. She's definitely still checks all my boxes. But I know that she's not special and I know that there definitely are a lot of girls out there like her (again something which I've started to accept only recently)! But thoughts of her do linger around, though I do agree they are less and less frequent. I know with time they'll cease all together. I've experienced this in the past and it does get better with time (insert scene from BoJack Horseman here)

However there are times when she texts me (asking how I'm doing, etc.) or replies to my stories on social media. It gets me thinking and I start dreaming (Oh the sweet realities from an alternate universe haha)! In the past I've handled this by completely shutting the person off from my life, absolutely zero contact. But I was younger back then. Given that I'm older and more mature now I want to handle it accordingly and differently. I don't feel the need to completely shut the person from my life. I have two questions here -

1. How do I approach it? But is there a way to make myself more mentally strong and robust? I want to stop spending my time thinking and dreaming! (This question is practical and constructive)
2. Why does she seem to care about me? I've been in her situation too and I make it a point to give a cold shoulder even if I do care about the person in question. I don't understand. Is it for attention? Or does she maybe have feelings too but can't accept them/is unsure/can't do anything about it? (I know I shouldn't waste my time trying to find answers to this question, but would love to hear out how people approach this!)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsloc8/moving_on_from_a_rejection/

85,qslq7a,1636753650,Dating app innovations,"Here are some things I would like to see:

-A match/messages screen that lets you keep better track of who you have met, her you have gotten a phone number or snap/IG from, and a place to make a note about what you thought of them. This might integrate more with other apps or your contacts. Or it might just be within the app to help you keep track of your experience over time, even after you unmatch or whatever.

-A way for you to rate users you meet based on how much they actually look like their pictures or not. And then it would help them in the algorithm if they truly look like their pictures, and hurt them in the algorithm or kick them off the platform altogether if they are massively deceptive with their pictures.

-I don’t know if this needs to be a new app, or could be integrated with an existing ones, but for people who are mostly just want to hook up, there should be a way to rate how good people are sexually. Maybe even give feedback or recommendations/reviews. E.g., “Jacob made me scream so loud I thought his neighbors were going to call the cops, but he just had too many red flags for me.”

-Similarly, for people who mostly want to have dates, I wish there was a way to rate how the other person was on a date in terms of being interesting, a good conversationalist, etc. “Jacob wasn’t physically attractive enough for me, but he was one of the most engaging guys I have ever been on a date with” or whatever.

These apps so often make users feel disposable, and kind of allow us to treat others as disposable. There should be ways to share feedback for the overall improvement of ourselves and everyone else’s experience with this. Encourage everyone to try a little bit harder and be a little more honest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qslq7a/dating_app_innovations/
86,qslqh3,1636753673,How do I handle this situation?,"So, I'm 23M and I've been talking with a girl (20) for several weeks, we've met up a couple times, we have pretty similar interests and it seems like we're pretty cool with each other. We've been pretty open about most things and even kinda sexted a little bit, but no nudes or anything. She seems very into me and we have pretty similar sexual interests, libidos, etc. It seems like we'd be a pretty compatible pair.

I'm struggling because I have no idea if I'm like into her sexually or attracted to her physically, though. I've really only been with about 3 people and they've all been small, shorter than me, with petite, hourglass figures and smaller chests. I knew right away that I was into them, no question. She's on the heavier side, about as tall as me, with a very large chest. It's not that I'm completely turned off by her, but I just don't have any experience sexually with someone of her body type and I'm just worried that we'll start something and I won't like it or something and end up really hurting her.

I really don't want to hurt her feelings and I don't want it to be just a one time thing if she's looking for something more regular. I also don't want to just use her to ""gain experience"" or whatever, but understand that might be all that comes out of it for me. I know I'm not looking for a serious, long-term thing, but I'm open to casual dating and wouldn't be opposed if it turned into a long-term thing with the right person.

I'm just not sure how to go forward and don't want to just drop off or ghost her because I don't have confidence in the matter.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qslqh3/how_do_i_handle_this_situation/

91,qslvx5,1636754125,19F-struggling with guys/afraid of intamacy,"Okay so I know I'm still young and I shouldnt rush the process of dating and finding a partner. People usually say I should wait for when I'm around 25 or something but it still doesn't change the fact that I feel very lonely  and I feel like almost every guy in my life just want to smash me and do not see me for me.

It's been happening since I was younger and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong . I'm naturally thin and curvy ,and I have a bigger chest so I understand that some guys will see me this way . But how do you get a guy to see beyond that? To value you ? 
I'm starting to hate my body and now whenever a guy talks to me I get paranoid and anxious- because most of the time it's just a physical thing and when I start talking about history or something it's like they run .
The journey from being a teenager to an adult has been hard for me . I feel like the odd one out.  I feel sometimes feel like if I don't sleep with a guy- I will lose a friend , a conversation, someone who was acting like they were interested before . And when I flat out say no some guys will get unbelievably angry at me . It has ruined my self esteem and made me a very anxious around guys because I don't feel safe or I'm on edge because I already know what's coming.

98,qsmyxb,1636757272,"Well... I wasn't rejected by her, but she probably isn't looking at me in this way","So I like a girl. and we are friends? We chat sometimes and hang out etc. She acts like she doesn't think about me as a potential partner. And I really don't want to give up. I think it is too early to state unequivocally that she is not interested in me. I believe there is a way to make her likes me more and change her look at me. Ya know... I'm worth to give a try? Something like that. Or more likely ""she wasn't looked at me this way before, but now she does"". You know what I mean. 

  Why I think she isn't interested? Our conversations are irregular (sometimes we chat more, sometimes less), she has kinda closed/bad body language? (I need to hang out with her few times more to be sure), she can respond after longer time (up to hour, so maybe I shouldn't worrying about that) and her responds sometimes are... I don't know how to say that. They are short and it's only a response, I hope you know what I mean. But on other hand if our chat goes well we can talk for hours, without longer pauses. When we see ourselves at school I got mixed thoughts about it. She may look at me normally (as we usually look at our friends), and sometimes she has cold eyesight(?). Like she was looking at unknown person. I feel like it was balancing between ""good signs"" and ""you don't have any chances"". 

  I understand if she has high expectations, she isn't seems to be easy, and it's not bad thing cuz it makes me... motivated? I mean, if she is actually hard one it rather because she's worth to put effort in it. But at this point I'm don't sure what I should do. I really hope there is a way to change her look at me, have any ideas how can I reach my goal? I know, my post probably has lot of holes and don't make a lot of sense, but please, try to understand it.
