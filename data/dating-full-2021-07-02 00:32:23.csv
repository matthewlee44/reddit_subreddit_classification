She has 3 children, works nights, shes got a hectic schedule but we some how make it work by seeing each other a few times a week. As for me, I'm in my last year of medical school, so my schedule is just as crazy. A month ago, we made plans to go to my hometown for Weds and Thursday of this week. She put in to have the days off from work, asked her mom to watch the kids. I got us an airbnb and I was pumped. Then this past Saturday she got her schedule and apparently she never got her request for the day off approved or denied... and she also never followed up on it. So she said we could go Thursday or Friday of this week. I was cool with it. Since Saturday, I've been trying to nail down official plans and she's been very avoidant. I'm always the one that has to bring it up. We saw each other Tuesday and I said ""so whats the plan for this week?"" her response was ""I've been waiting for you to bring it up"".... We never really got anywhere with it, basically that it would depend on her moms plans.

For the past few days I've asked once a day ""so whats the plan..."" without ever nailing anything down. Today, her mom said she pulled something at work and now she has been resting all day. After asking how her mom was, I politely said ""please let me know what the plans are for tomorrow"". Now its nearly 9pm the night before were supposed to go and I've yet to have an answer. She hasn't texted back in a few hours. In all honesty, if she can't go... thats fine but I'm at the point where I'm annoyed that she hasn't just said ""hey... I dont think its going to work"".

Is it selfish for me to be annoyed at this point that she hasn't just been upfront about things? It feels very avoidant.

If/when she does finally say ""its not going to work"", I'll understand but I have a feeling I'll be bummed she wont be coming. Is it wrong to feel that way?

She has a great personality and I immediately started becoming infatuated with her. However, I'm feeling a ton of anxiety about us and it feels so soon for that.

She has bipolar disorder and has been going through a rough time in her life. I think it is a bad time for her to seek a relationship but she is alone and has almost no emotional support system so I sympathize with her.

Every other day she sends texts saying that she is feeling depressed, alone, wants to self-harm, or even wants to die. I have depression and I can understand where she is coming from but sometimes it feels like she only wants me around to make her feel better. Sometimes she'll randomly text me ""I don't think I should be alone right now"" and asks me to come over. I love seeing her, but I don't want to just be there as a coping mechanism.

On top of this, she was recently seeing a guy casually who provided her with some financial assistance and she is still talking to him. I know she is dead broke right now, but they were having sex and the fact she is still talking to him makes me uneasy. She also told me about spontaneous sexual interactions she has had with other men and it makes me worry she would cheat on me. She asked me if I would be comfortable with her having a sugar daddy if we were serious and I said no way. My ex asked me that too. Why do people think that is okay in a serious relationship?

But I refuse to kiss him in front of a group of strangers, while it was light outside and we were both sober, and I get told I'm prude and ignored for the rest of the night.

It seems so obvious to me that this guy was in the wrong here, but it has happened so often that I can't help but feel: is there something wrong with me? 

In fact, I pride myself in recognising red flags in people, as I am well trained and versed in this field of psychology, and I don't understand where I'm going wrong. 

I don't expect that every or even any man I meet on a night out will be The One. I couldn't care less if they never spoke to me again the next morning. But is it really too much to ask that, just as I do not force such expectations on the man in question, the same respect isn't given to me?

I would say this is all just because I meet many guys on nights out, they are often intoxicated or just stupid college guys (I'm in college too, don't worry), but it's happened with every guy I've ever met with and it hurts. I'm fed up of it. And the strange part is, I love to be single. But - as I say - just because I don't want a relationship doesn't mean I don't feel hurt when somebody I've been chatting to quite innocently the whole night turns and tries to take me then and there in front of half the cohort. 

I hate to generalise, so I will add that I'm sure this isn't ""all guys"". But it's all the guys I've ever been with, so maybe you can understand where I connected the dots.

There is this guy I have been talking to for a bit now. I am F24 and he is M29. I have known him for years but we were both always in other relationships. Recently we both reconnected to find out that we were both single. We started texting a lot and became a bit closer and then met to hang out in person. In the beginning, I was not overly interested but I grew to like him more. We ended up having quite a bit in common and I felt quite comfortable with him. At this point, I wasn't overly attached to the idea of him. As well as, there were some things (traits) about him that I couldn't see myself actually going into a relationship with him for. More time passed and I was going through exams at school so I was a bit distant as I was studying. He would message me often and would tell me how he missed me and wanted to see me. I explained to him I was really busy with my studies but after my exams, I would love to get together and I apologized for my absence. This is the point where I began to like him quite a bit more. We hung out again and had a great time we stayed out until the early morning and I had so much fun. About a week after this he began to text a lot less and he would respond slower and slower. I am very straight up so I asked him if everything was okay. He mentioned he was going through a lot at the moment and having a rough go. I let it go at that point. However, now we barely talk and he will watch my stories and now and then won't reply to my messages. As well as he will post stories out with his friends but then not reply. I like to think I am not naive so he is either very suddenly lost interest which how sudden it was makes it strange for me, he is actually going through something or he is playing games. The only reason I think he could be playing games (referencing back to the reasons I don't think I could date him) is because of things and ways he would act with his ex gfs. As in deliberately doing things to play mind games with them. So I wonder if he is trying to get back at me for being busy those few weeks and going MIA with studies. 

So you would think that knowing this I would be glad he isn't messaging me but I feel so hung up on him and bothered that he isn't messaging me anymore. I am not a person that plays games with people so I feel irritated and confused. 

Question :

My question is:

1. how can I get over him (tips/advice/experience) because he is consuming my mind 

2. should I text him and ask him to be straight with me or does that seem like I'm being too much because we aren't dating?

(28m) - midwest town of 500k.
Thought you guys would enjoy my attempts at dating. So I matched with this girl a couple months ago on bumble. She started asking me if I knew these random people. Like, sorry girl, no. Turns out she has an interview with my company. Anyways, we seem to hit it off. Then one day that week, I forgot something in my car. Walking into the building, who did I see? Ms bumble of course. We had masks and I didn’t realize it so it was a wave and hello. We laughed about it over bumble. I got the number shortly after and the texting went well. So after a week I asked I asked her out to the local zoo, it’s pretty cool. Then I got ghosted. 2 months later, I’m sitting in a company meeting and guess who walks in, lol. Btw, it’s a 10 story office building with a couple thousand employees so not that small.

I was going on dates with this girl. She asked me to join on a jog. Sounded fun so sure! Anyways, I got to the park and couldn’t find her and her description of where she was at didn’t make sense. Turns out I went the park across town and had to call her and drive the 20 minutes there.

Same girl I went running with, asked me to get a Swedish massage. I’d never got one before and wasn’t sure what she meant. I also felt weird about getting naked in front of strangers and her for the 1st time. My friends all are made at me because I didn’t go and they wanted me to get a handy because they are all married and want to live vicariously through me.

Another girl I met online, we really hit it off and had chatted on the phone quite a bit before meeting in person. We went out and enjoyed it and then went back to her place to watch a movie. Thing is, I get really nervous about relationships so then my stomach gets all topsy turvey. I also hadn’t kissed a girl before so I was extra nervous. Turns out I had to blow up her bathroom quite badly and I also had some gas issues. She was in med school so we laughed and she gave me some pretty strong stuff for my stomach.

Also very interesting to note when flirting happens. Like I wore my hair the same way, same makeup, same yoga pants and shoes but the difference was my top. I kinda gained some weight but luckily bless with always having a small waist so I wore a big cute sweatshirt the other day, and nothing. But today I wore a long sleeve crop top that shows my waist and shape and bam thats when I get all the comments on the street and stuff (which I don't mind event he raunchy stuff). But yeah again lots of girls despise men for hitting on them which in turn has caused men to do it less in fear of it getting called harassment but I've been feeling down on myself because I gained like 6 pounds but to get someone to come up to you just made me so happy the rest of the day.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,872966,public,self,I feel like i'm the only girl my age who likes being flirted on.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oc2gg3/i_feel_like_im_the_only_girl_my_age_who_likes/,all_ads,6

She’s a friend of a friend’s and we were set up for a blind date. 

I got her number last week, we exchanged a few small messages about out weekend then organised a date for 4 days later. We didn’t text until the night before the date, where I messaged her to confirm we were still on. 

The date happened last night. The conversation and banter was amazing, so after drinks I suggested we get some food - she agreed. We got dinner, continued the joking and chatting. We then went for a walk, held hands, and when it came time to depart, I said I had a fun time and would love to see her again. She said she would like that too. I asked what she was doing on the weekend, and she repeated what she said earlier in the night when we discussed what our weekend plans were - but she said she could do Sunday night. I said Sunday night would work for me, and I’d text her to organise. She was super giggly and awkward and an opportunity for a kiss was there, but we just went in for a hug instead. I then said to text me when she gets home, and we parted ways.

I didn’t hear from her for a while, so I messaged her to say I had fun, and to check if she got home okay. She responded with a ‘same here! and yep I got home all safe’. 

I didn’t reply, and its now late afternoon the next day. I’m thinking of messaging her:

“Hows your Friday coming along?

p.s. I’ve got an idea up my sleeve for Sunday night that could be a bit of fun - lets tee it up if that works for you?”

I think based on the fact that we had a good first date and discussion of a second, this should be fine to send? If the date was okay and we just parted ways then I would be more conscious, but there was interest! I’m also a bit nervous because we’ve used texting solely for logistics (except to talk about our weekend in the initial texts).

My entire senior year of college (2019-2020), I (22f) was in love with this guy (22m). I quickly found out he had a girlfriend. That didn’t make my feelings for him go away but I kept a bit of a distance and respected that. We became closer friends and I kinda felt like he would flirt with me sometimes but I was probably reading into it and he was just being friendly. Then in March of 2020 our college sent a group of students to participate in a week-long competition across the state and he and I ended up spending a lot of time together on that trip (his girlfriend didn’t go). The last night of the competition one girl invited him and me and another girl to her hotel room to drink and watch a movie and it was fun. When it ended everyone else was asleep in their hotel rooms and the rest of the group that watched the movie went to go sleep too. Except for him and me. He said he wasn’t tired at all and I said me neither so he suggested we just walk around the hotel. We were both tipsy and I still had a full drink in my hand. Anyway we walked around the empty hotel and ended up sharing the drink and getting kind of drunk (this was pre-Covid btw) and we just talked and it was really nice. I was still in the mindset of “I know I can’t be with this guy but at least we can be friends.” But then he invited me to come hang out in his hotel room and I, being drunk and lacking my usual inhibitions, said sure. I had forgotten my key to my own hotel room so I asked my friend to get it for me and they ended up hanging out with us and me and the guy never went to his hotel room after all. I was annoyed at the time but I think my friend saved me from making a big mistake. I don’t know if the guy was into me and would cheat on his girlfriend but I’m glad I didn’t make myself a home wrecker. But the thing is I replayed that night over and over in my head and wondered what would’ve happened if my friend hadn’t joined us. 

I tried to get over him. I got a boyfriend that summer and although I really liked him I still secretly had feelings for the first guy. 

I haven’t seen him in a year and I’ll think I’m over him completely but the truth is I’m not. I still have feelings for him, they just go dormant for a while.

i guess i need to tell you some details about me. Me (31m) never rly dated but i had one girlfriend for 1/2 year when i was 25y old. I never rly looked for dates because my mind gets occupied by things and persons im interested in and it always jumps to those topics. Im honest and a very rational person (studying a MINT Topic) and feelings are so danm irrational. Normaly im very soaciable and i able to talk to alot of ppl because im interested in alot of topics but i suck at flirting.

After 1.5 years of pandamic i had enough from my everyday life. I was gaming alot and kinda irresponsible. So right now i trying to get rid of my bad habbits (i.e smoking,  procrastination, alot of gaming) and i started dating earlier this year.

Due to the pandemic i decided to choose bumble (it got recommended to me by a friend). It went okeyish i had a few dates. I didnt expected much because i tryed tinder in the past but i wasnt convinced by those apps. But then it happend. I matched with a women and it went great. We facetimed for \~10h and wrote each other everyday. So i kinda fell for her before we even met.

Our first date went kinda horrible. I cant recollect alot but the liquor got to me and my selfdoubts got the better of me. The main thing i can remember was her disgusted face due my selfdoubts and how unattractiv i became and her comments on my jeans (out of date) and t-shirt (was my fav shirt which i wore in two of my profil piccs).

Honestly i didnt mind the comments about my outfit because there was some kinda truth to it. But the facial exprassion kinda boggled me. Writing became hard after the date. She withdrew herself completly and the answers were short and there was no effort on her side to keep up the conversation eventhough she agreed to meet up again but told me the wasnt interested in a relationship in general with anyone at that time.

I got some advise from a friend who is pretty succesfull in the area dating and he recommended that i should stop writing her after she admited that she would meet up again.

Its been a month now with no texting or anything. But my mind sucks and im catching myself thinking about her daily and im wondring if i should write her. But it seems kinda pointless because somehow i dont expect a diffrent outcome.

I guess i want your opinion about it. Somehow i have the feeling i just should get over it but somehow i kinda rly liked her. Maybe its just in my mind, dunno rly.

And i have a last question. Why are women (not all of course but those i met) interested in if i think im intelligent or handsome? Why do i need to compare myself with other ppl and whats the standard of this comperison? Some famous Scientist or Superstars?

Thank you for your endurance and im sry for any mistakes ( im not a nativ speaker)

Personality wise I do get along with most, and people do tend to view me as reliable or a good person but that never goes in a helpful way as it usually just leads to me being pushed into the useful friend role.

I am not afraid of speaking to them nor do I have anything against them. 

The problem arises after the first introduction. 

I am currently in my third year of university and I notice a trend of many females that I meet ditch plans or only try to befriend me to get some help with their work or to get something out of me. 

I have called many of them out several times that if they just want to get something from me that they should be blunt and end the conversation there and don't try to waste time. To which they don't respond to. 

I also try to go out of my way and message them to meet or make some conversation but they do not tend to do the same after messaging them a few times. I have to constantly start the conversation but I am also afraid that I am being too aggressive with my approach and being seen as someone desperate. 

I personally am not trying to get a date or relationship, just some friends and the female perspective of life. 

I think that I have held my values and dignity intact but I also feel that I am very disposable and not seen as anyone cool to hang out with.

I had never experienced the world of online dating until recently and I can only find negatives to it currently. We are living in a society where the internet and technology is beginning to rule our lives more than ever. I acknowledge that the OLD scene helps some people and has its success stories however, I believe there is so much potential for people to truly meet the people they long to have in their lives.  


I am not engineered like a lot of lads I know who are my age. I put this down to my upbringing, job and just general personality. A lot of lads I know are only interested in 'playing the game' or look for casual and one night events. I don't want to mislead people. I won't be connected to multiple people as I find it disrespectful to play with their emotions for my own gain.  
   
Everyone on this subreddit has the same goal... to find the 'one' for them. We are all different people and have different goals/interests etc. There are 7.6 billion people on this planet and there are many people who are looking for the same things we are. They may not be on reddit, they may not on OLD, they may be on the opposite side of the planet BUT, they are out there.   


My biggest issue with OLD is that it doesn't really give people a chance. Having signed up to multiple apps there are common themes. Every single app stops you from making a proper connection by requiring currency to see people who 'like' you or limit the number of users you can engage with. Every single app has a bunch of individuals who are using the app for 'a laugh' or for 'fun'. Every app has people who use it to boost their ego. I know we could never eradicate these problems. I know that they are present and will be due to the world we live in. My wish is that the people genuinely wanting a relationship will actually seek one instead of being reluctant. If you match with someone, please talk to them. If you think someone looks interesting, give them a chance. Best case scenario is you find your person, worst case is that you move on and find someone else.   


The worst problem is that WE don't give people a chance. As much as we can blame the apps, other people and the ongoing circumstances in life, we limit ourselves heavily. The apps are mainly focused on how a person appears on image and most users won't even look through someone's account. That means that if someone doesn't appear 10/10 instantly they get rejected. There is more to people than just the way they look. Personality is more important than looks to me. When selecting your interests you state what sort of thing you're looking for in a match. If you find a user with a few similar interests? MATCH THEM. They could be your future partner or they could be a great friend who opens new doors for meeting new people or having new experiences!  


I have spent the last few months improving myself further. I have passed my exams. I am progressing in a very good career. I have been socialising. I have started new hobbies. I have got even fitter by maintaining my gym plan and doing boxing. Exercise has been my way of dealing with the aftermath and I could honestly say I don't think I'd be typing this without it.   
I can't say I'm 100% happy as I do feel lonely or lost sometimes. I do feel an empty space in my chest that I want to fill. I do want someone there to talk to, to spend time with. I may not find that anytime soon but I want to keep searching. I have recently been told by someone they are worried about dating me due to previous relationships. Don't let your past hold you back. I am genuine. I want nothing more than to experience love again.  


The main message from this is that there is so much more opportunity for everyone. If we gave people a chance instead of judging them instantly we could have so many more people in happy relationships. If you do one thing today, search for the love you want. It's extremely rare that it'll just find you. Create the opportunities you want.

So, I felt like making this post to ask for some advice because I'm really confused (and also need to vent a bit)

I'm 23 M, who met a girl on Tinder (23 F). She started texting first and almost 10 minutes in, we started talking about nerdy stuff and anime in a really friendly way. She is a really good looking girl but what I felt was as if I had found a close friend that I didn't see in a long time, but in a way I've never experienced with anyone (I've never had a ""best"" friend)

So 5 days go by with a non-stop talk, because we had a lot to share and we both don't have many friends to talk to. Suddenly, she starts talking about her boyfriend (I didn't know she had a boyfriend, but she said they took a pause from their relationship) saying she doesn't want to go back with him because he's not good at sex, and then listed all his flaws. Then, she proceeds to talk with me about sex, what I like and stuff like that. I mean, we met on Tinder, I saw it coming, but knowing she shares with strangers personal detailed info about his boyfriend was a big red flag for me. And that killed all my interest in dating her as a potential romantic partner, however the fact that she shares with me unique interests that I cannot share with any of my friends made me think about keeping her as a friend (I told her about that, she agreed)

Saturday, we decided to meet up at my place (I picked her up with my car) and less than one hour before the actual meet up she started talking about fantasies of me kidnapping her, which I took naively as a joke (long story short, it was not a joke). We came home while talking non-stop as we did via chat (and she was visibly nervous). Suddenly, she says ""you're not really my type"" (which was a blessing from heaven, since I had no intentions to commit to anything romantic with her) and continued hanging out as if nothing happened. Then, she starts talking about the fact that she masturbates a lot to fantasies of being kidnapped and that she always dominates guys when having sex (which she regularly has) because she said they're not muscular enough (while I hit the gym regularly and I would say I'm pretty ""big"". In practice she doesn't have a complete intercourse with them because she doesn't allow anyone to have her other than her boyfriend). I've always been dominant and violent during sex expecially when in front of me I have a submissive person but I always try to hold myself from being ""too much"". So I said to her:""what did you expect from me?"". She responded by saying that she was having a good time with me because it were years that she didn't have an ideal date like this during which she could be so open with a person and that every time she hangs out with people she needs to drink alchol in order to be comfortable, but with me there wasn't this necessity because she was feeling comfortable being alone with me. Clearly she didn't respond to my question so I said:""look, speak clearly because I hate wasting my time"". Again, she didn't want to provide me an answer. After some time, however, she started physically teasing me and that led to making the thing I've metioned before sparkle in my mind and I lost it completely. So we had sex, the most amazing sex of my life (for real, like 3 hours went by) and soon after we finished she started crying saying that her boyfriend is not this good but that she also want to make love with him and wants his babies. However, while I brought her home, she still said we need to meet up again. But knowing how she reacted I said to her that first she needs to talk with her boyfriend and until then, we could not have more than a friendship (which she AGAIN accepted, saying I'm so sweet that I care about her)

Almost two days later, I've sent a message saying if she was feeling ok or wanted to talk about what she didn't say to me that night (hoping via text she would have felt more comfortable). However, she ghosted me. And it is almost 6 days. The strangest thing is that (for example) when I post stories on ig, she's the first to watch them (like 5 minutes after I post, at any hour of the day, she watches them as if she was constantly stalking my profile. She hasn't unfollowed me) 

I'm really confused about what she is experiencing and if I should let her be or try to talk about it because I feel she didn't tell me the whole story and I feel that throwing away everything because of a misunderstanding is really sad. I want her to be at least my friend (because I haven't felt this kind of connection with anyone and she's a really cool person) but if she wants to have something serious she needs to take her responsibilities and talk.

Hope you're doing fine.

I (M24) met a girl (21) at Tinder about 2 weeks ago. We quickly jumped to Instagram to keep on chatting. The conversation went smoothly and last week (Saturday) we went for dinner. Things went good, apparently. Once we got out of the bar we were in. We walked for a couple of blocks to her car. On our way there, we hugged and kissed for a bit. When we arrived at her car she offered to give me a lift home, so I agreed. Before she even turned the engine on, we started kissing again. Things escalated quickly. We were making out intensely(she was on top of me). Although she expressly said ""no"" to sex because it was late and she was a bit shy to do it there, she gave me oral. We must have been in her car for like 2 hours. We asked each other to let know when they got home. I did, and so did she.

This is where it gets weird. On Sunday, we didn't chat; she had ""liked"" my sleep-fine-kind-of messages, remember this was on Instagram. So I didn't push it. I talked to her again on Monday. It seemed to go fine, but I really wanted to take the chat over to What'sApp. She gave me her number and warned me she kinda took forever to reply... I said it was okay, since the conversation had gone very smoothly up to that point. However, once we started talking on WPP, I noticed she started taking a lot of time to reply. She would reply on Instagram within a 20-40 minute window or in hours if she was busy. Here, she takes mostly an hour or more. I don't expect her to message me every after 20 seconds, but it feels off somehow.

I was going to ask her out again sometime next week. She has exams next week, so I know she must be busy. I'm totally okay with that, but I feel she is not into me, and I don't want to have big expectations. Following the ""the sooner, the better"" mindset, I thought of asking if she's free this weekend, knowing she most probably would decline the invitation. She hasn't even replied to one of my messages sent yesterday at night yet. Thing is, should I plainly ask her if she wants to keep chatting/going out with me, to avoid any bullsh*t, or is it too straight-forward? I'd rather have her telling me she doesn't want to have anything to do with me, than me being in limbo. I'd really like to know what the heck is going on. Any piece of advice is useful.
