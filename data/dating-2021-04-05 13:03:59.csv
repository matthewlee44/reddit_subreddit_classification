0,mkqyjv,1617646198,Feeling relief after a break up,"My relationship just ended and I can’t say that I’m that upset about it. I for sure know it is what I needed. We had been on and off since the beginning of our relationship and I’m just so over it. It was way too much work. Bad energy and exhausting. We were both never going to fulfill each other’s desires for a serious partner and that’s okay. I think I’ve come to terms with the fact that it’s okay that two people don’t work out. It can be a learning experience. 

My next step is just learning how to be okay and strong on my own. As someone who has a tendency to long term serial date, I do not want to fall back into my old ways. I have to be committed to myself and my growth and development. 

Sorry if this is kinda cringe. I think I just need an outlet. Thanks guys.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mkqyjv/feeling_relief_after_a_break_up/

I'm a early 20s male and these apps have caused nothing but pain and misery. Going on these apps and seeing a grand total of 0 likes on each of these apps becomes absolutely relentless. I never saw my self as a particularly ugly individual, but at the same time I know I am not prince charming. On all these apps I tried to convey my interests like reading, art, yoga and it seems even that can't convince anyone to interact with me. I had photos of me smiling and focusing on me and as my time on these apps went on these photos changed before my eyes of some weird freak that clearly warrants an immediate left swipe. I don't get what I did wrong. I don't get what I could do better. I tried so many different types of bio just to try and show the interesting side of me but that isn't enough as well.

I didn't know what I wanted when I first ventured on these dating apps, I came out of a relationship where I got cheated on and immediately replaced.

6,mkrde3,1617647291,Should I take the hint?,"Some backstory:

I recently took a new job out of state and just moved here.  I reached out to a former coworker of mine I hadnt talked to in almost a year via email to ask her a question (she brought our department snacks/candy a couple years back from a business trip she took here and I wanted to have those again) and she gave me her number to text her.  Turns out she also just moved to the same state at roughly the same time as me, albeit in a town an hour away.

I used to live in my current city a few years ago so I know it somewhat well while shes never been here.  We texted back and forth for a bit and I offered to show her around town sometime and visit a few brewpubs because she likes going out to drink.  She said yes but only after things open up again which I agreed with.

A few days after this the time it took her to text me back increased until she eventually stopped altogether.  I waited almost 3 weeks to try texting her again and she apologized, saying shes bad at seeing texts  (she said the same when we talked more and sometimes it did take her over a day or two to get back so I didnt think much about it) and she reiterated that she still wants to get a beer together when things feel safe again.  I told her again Im totally ok with waiting and tried changing the subject but got no response.  

Its now been a full week since that last text from her and Im not sure what to do.  Shes admitted to being bad at texting multiple times but at the same time its starting to feel like shes not actually interested.  I kinda want to try texting her again but I also dont want to be the guy who cant take a hint.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mkrde3/should_i_take_the_hint/

9,mkrong,1617648130,Feigned interest on dating apps,"Most of the women I've dated (from Hinge) have no clue what they want and string me along with feigned interest. They act interested in me, text me, initiate dates, and sometimes even write me poetry. Yes, the last girl I dated wrote beautiful poems about us and then totally ghosted me.

Nothing is authentic anymore, it's hard to know what's true or real, everyone is trying to be the same 4 things. We methodically swipe right to find love. We match, and then keep swiping for something slightly better, as if there's always something better just around the corner. Online dating is a futile game; it's an endless loop of repetition and regurgitation of the same old stories.

I'm not bitter, but I see myself moving in that direction so I wanted to get some advice. Do I need to change my approach?

11,mkrsk4,1617648429,[Venting] The fuck am I doing wrong with all of my dates [26M],"I can't have this discussion with any of my friends, because everyone keeps calling me either a fuckboy or a playboy but they aren't seeing how this is emotionally exhausting me, and making me feel like crap.

I broke up with my SO of 7 years in October because we'd basically grown apart and had no attraction left, the ""period of mourning"" didn't last very long at all, and I began dating again mid-January.

Since then, I've gone out with about a girl a week, ten in total. I've got another one to see this weekend, and I say that because *once again* the last date I had led to *nothing* except for the physical. Jack shit.

I go into every date with the mindset of looking for a new girlfriend, because that's what I want. I don't want a ONS, hookup or FWB. I want a partner. But every damn time I put in the effort of getting to know them, of presenting myself, kissing them, sleeping with them, liking them, I've ended up being ghosted almost immediately afterwards. Like why go through the effort of having sex with someone if there's nothing of value for you there? And isn't it your obligation to tell the guy you're dating that you're not looking for anything serious, if that's the case? 

I've seriously begun to feel exhausted; *physically* and emotionally tired of always having to get my hopes up, dream anew, and go back to square one, over and over again. I know there's something wrong with my approach, maybe I'm not interesting enough, maybe our personalities don't match, maybe I should be more physically restrictive. But it's a dance, and if there's flow and feeling you just go with it, and I guess I'm just tired about the stream leading to nothing but a dead end so soon. Having written this, I realize I should just hold back on the sex until I know there's at least some affection behind it. I guess it's just who and what I am.

12,mkrvop,1617648657,Guy saying he thinks I want to stay over after I had said no - bad joke or a red flag?,"I (31F) recently joined a dating app and I met a guy (27M) who seems pretty nice. We first messaged on the app for about a week, then met each other in person. I had really fun time, there wasn't much romantic going on and I wasn't even sure if he saw me as anything else than a potential friend. We messaged every day after that and he asked me out for a second date and I was happy to go. Eventually we ended up to his place (since because of Covid everything is pretty much closed) and watched a movie. At one point we snuggled up a little, which eventually turned into making out. He seems great and attentive and keeps making sure if I'm feeling ok and when we proceeded into kissing, he was asking if it's ok that he does that. I found that to be really nice of him and it makes me feel safe around him. I have experienced violence in my childhood and I know through therapy that I have some trouble recognizing red flags in relationships. But with this guy I felt pretty safe. We also talked about why both of us joined the app and what we are looking for and both of us said that we are not looking for just a hookup.

During the second date, even before we kissed the first time, he said that by the way if I want to stay over, that's a possibility. He asked it again a couple of times during that night and said that it is safe to be there and that anything I don't want to happen won't ever happen. I felt it was nice of him to say that but every time he asked, I said that I think I'm still just gonna go home at the end of the night (we even checked the bus schedule together so I felt it was clear I was being serious). But then when we were making out, he asked again if I was sure I didn't wanna stay over and I again said that I'm gonna go home eventually, but that time he said: ""Nah, I think you actually DO want to stay over.""

I did say again I wanted to go home (and I think he asked it one more time before I left) and when it was my time to leave, he escorted me to the bus stop and asked when we could see each other again.

I did have a good time that night and making out with him was great and I was into that, but at no point did I truly consider staying over (I had stuff to do early next morning and I was on my period). I also felt that it would've been a little too fast, since we only first kissed close to the end of the night. It felt weird that he said that after I had consistently declined. I didn't think much of it at the time (I was kinda drunk), just felt a little embarrassed that maybe I had seemed too into making out with him. But it has bothered me a little bit afterwards and I've been wondering should I be worried that he does not respect my ""no""? I have difficulties trusting people, so I could be overreacting too. I'm not very experienced in dating so I'm wondering if I should be seeing it as a red flag (or yellow/orange) or just brush it off as slightly drunken horny guy talk?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mkrvop/guy_saying_he_thinks_i_want_to_stay_over_after_i/

14,mks3oz,1617649245,Since my break up I'm feeling like I'm definitely never find another woman like her,"She broke up with me months ago. More than 5 months that I haven't seen or talked to her. She was my first GF ever, and I'm 26. She was my first sex and everything.

I always struggled really bad with dating although everyone tells me that I'm handsome and fit. I have an amazing career and traveled the world already, but no one ever gave me a chance. I always keep hearing like I'm too good for the girls I try to talk (this must be some kind of BS but I'm so tired to hear). I'm really really afraid no woman that I find that amazing will bad an eye on me.

Since she was my first GF I tried so hard to show a lot of love and affection. I would cook, cuddle, we had amazingly sex, I always cared for her on the smallest details and she always acted like she was really in love and happy.

She left me after 7months together because her ex that had dumped her wanted to be with her again.... No need to say how destroyed I'm still am with this . I'm doing therapy and having a way healthier lifestyle, but I'm REALLY lonely due to this COVID madness. It's really weighting a lot on me and I'm barely holding on together.

Every girl that I try to talk to online on dating apps, Instagram or friends of friends, even asking them to introduce me or anything like that, they all have their SO, already have a kid or some sort of really heavy baggage that for me it's too much to handle and get interested.

I'm 26 and I always wanted to find a girl that I love with all my heart and I honestly thought I had found on my ex. Hell, she was the only girl to really get interested in me, she knew a lot about my desires, fears, issues and I knew hers, at least I thought I knew.

I'm really sad and seeing my friends marrying or having company in this COVID times, the girls don't bother to know me even just a bit and I know I have a ton to offer. I don't want to be someone's step father because I always dreamed to have my kids and my family. Also would have to deal with the father of the child and would significantly be an issue for traveling and stuff.

I don't want to be alone. But why it has to be so difficult? I'm looking for it and trying to be my best version always and I'm always getting rejected, left or dumped for someone else's... My self esteem now is basically negative and I can't take this anymore... I don't want to be alone, I just wanted to love and I guess it's life's way of telling me I'm worthless no matter how much I try.

Jerks and douches always have a lot of amazing women RUNNING after then... I just can't treat them like a prize or a game..

16,mksk06,1617650435,My girl pressuring me to shave?,"So this whole time I been feeling kinda okay about my body. Feeling comfortable about the way I look around my woman because she also helped me. Despite me gaining a little weight the complements never stopped. I felt like my woman really loved the way I body looked. 

I thought the body hair was part of it.... so the topic of shaving came up and it made me feel uncomfortable that she said she likes it when men shave there armpits and and also down there bwteen the legs. 

Ummm idk if I'm taking it to far but I said no? Like I don't like shaving.  I be down to keep it  clean for sure, Like I'll trim it and stuff. So then it wasn't enough that I let her know that I did feel uncomfortable and she know be insecure about the way I look. Never had to worry or think about me being too hairy because I thought she liked it and it's part of the package.

So trimming wasn't enough, I guess idk sounded like a good compromise well idk i guess not because I would still trim anyways. Then she starts comparing bringing up other men like her bro does it and how then Gen men shave down there and it's more common. 

So then I said that I'm me and that's just who I am. I'm a Hairy dude, me shaving down there would look weird unless I shave everything off because holey crap my hair does not stop from the top of my chest down to the tops of feet. 

Then that wasn't enough so she goes head and tells that it would look bigger down there if I shave...... Um yuh idk would you dudes feel uncomfortable with that comment? Idk let me know because I did. Kinda hurt my man hood a little?  Just...  f**k me who doesn't have Insecurities these day... 

To be honest I just feel shaving and trimming down there is a personal choice and you gotta love yourself. Find someone that loves you for who you are... I told her that I would love  her still even she just trimmed, shaved or didn't shave at all. 

Ugh should I just shave!?!?! I got such bad shaving  bumps/In-grown hairs? Idk it was bad,  i let her know this too and still she says its something simple and small that she is asking me to do.

22,mktja9,1617653049,Should I leave to be better?,"So I have a boyfriend who I just hit the 2 mark with, and he’s awesome, but I just have a lot of issues I need to figure out.

For starters, I have mental health issues. As I am growing up, i overthink pretty much everything, and I try my best to make it go away, but I feel like I still just have a lot of healing to do before I get where I need to be. Not saying that my bf doesn’t help with that, I just can’t help but overthink rather than try to enjoy myself with him sometimes and focus on the positives so I don’t think that’s fair. 

I also feel as I was growing up I didn’t have the best representations of love/what it looks like when you are fully committed, so sometimes I think I shy away/try to run away bc he’s showing me healthy love and that kinda scares me. I also got my heartbroken prior to us dating (which I was over) so idk if that plays a part in me just thinking I need to let him go bc he’s too good for me. 

He also has experienced life WAYYYY more than me and has all these stories to tell when I think I’m one of the most boring people ever. That makes me see him as superior. He is so sure of himself, which is something I envy, bc he carries himself so well and I feel like sometimes I project my negative emotions on him when I don’t try to. 

And then the icing on the cake, we started dating when I was a senior, so my parents of course kinda were in the mix with that, but my parents used to b toxic and they prohibited me from doing all the things I wish I could do, so I feel like as our relationship progressed, we just haven’t really been together the way we wish we have, and now we’re in a long distance relationship. 

Bc of all that, that makes me feel like I haven’t got to love him the way I wish bc most of the situations/obstacles we have were bc of me, and he even told me that’s okay bc that’s what he signed up for, but at the same time, I just have a lot of baggage I feel like I need to get rid of in order to “properly” love him and I feel like this version of myself isn’t good enough for him when I feel he deserves someone on the same maturity/mental/life level he is. 

I don’t want to leave him bc i feel like our relationship is just getting started and I truly do love him, but then also I get scared of the future as well bc I don’t trust myself and feel like one of these days I’m just gonna scare him away.

23,mktqoj,1617653585,What To Do,"    Hey Guys! Gonna dive straight in: I grew up without a mother because she was off doing drugs and was left with a father that beat me, abused me, and neglected me. I’m not gonna go into details but my childhood has left me with PTSD from as early as 5 years old. My gf just broke up with me because i was battling suicidal depression. She was a very good girl but I was always pushing her away because I didn’t want her to be very close to me when I decided to kill myself. I finally decided that I want to commit to loving her and overcome my battle with depression but at that point it was already too late.
     I’m generally regarded as a very attractive male. People always say I should be a model and I get complimented on my genetics and appearance fairly often. Not trying to brag but it is an important detail to note because people always assume it’s easy for me to get girls because of the way I look. Now my experience with my ex has left me even more emotionally scarred rather than healed and I’m trying everything I can to shake a deep rooted feeling of being unlovable. The fact is I’m in my early twenties and a feminine touch still feels like a foreign concept to me. Love has always been and only been a source of the biggest pain in my life. At what point do I just cave in and give up on love entirely? Well, unfortunately I have no quit in me which means I have extended my suffering here so I have no choice but to have blind faith that someday I will find love again. My reaction to the pain and heartbreak of my gf leaving me was to cut out all coping behavior like weed and alcohol, start waking up at 4:30 AM and living as healthy as humanly possible, quitting my toxic job, getting into bodybuilding, cooking every meal, and now building a modeling portfolio, starting a side hustle, and going back to college. I don’t know and have never heard of a human enduring the things I have and A) not killing themselves or B) not turning to hard drugs and a corrupt life. I find it that most, if not all females my age want a happy go lucky, open, fun, and stoner type of guy. I myself am more of a quiet, focused and reserved personality because of my experiences so I find It hard to see any female even giving me the time of day because it takes a while for me to gain trust and open up. So, anyone think there is any hope or any suggestions on what to do as far as finding a woman that will accept me for who I am? Maybe there’s even someone that can relate.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mktqoj/what_to_do/

I’d rather sit on FaceTime or hangout with my bf even though I should use that time to exercise or do some other things for myself. He seems to balance this way better than me (he has a social life, hobbies etc). My boyfriend recently said something about it, like how I am a part of his happiness, but he would be happy without me too. I completely respect that and think it is healthy. He also said he feels a bit of pressure because I might be relying on him for happiness. I don’t want to lose my individuality, but I find myself always thinking about him and get sad when he is too busy for me.

30,mkul9t,1617655936,I went on a date with an unusual guy,"Not unusual in a bad way necessarily just different than what im used to. When we matched we messaged back and forth for a little bit and then I was going out of town so he said he would text me when I got back to set something up for meeting. I never expect guys to follow through on things like this but he did. And we met up. And I kinda liked him. But the goodbye was a little awkward and didnt offer to walk me to my car like most guys do. And he didnt text me soon after like others do so I figured he prob wasnt into it. But I was, so thought I got nothing to lose and want him to know theres def interest on my part, so I text him and I told him to let me know if he wants to hang out again. He didn’t respond till the next morning but agreed and said we should do something the following week (after the weekend, which whatever maybe he was busy). I said sure and that was that, we didnt text for a few days. Again I didn’t expect follow through but sure enough he texts me over the weekend to set something up for the week. We agree on a day and again thats that, no more text conversation. I dont like texting, but guys that are interested always stay in contact with me even if just one text a day or something. But not this guy. I havent texted him either because I can just sense he’s not a texter (just with how short he is when texting to set up dates) so I dont want to be pushy. But its just strange and not sure what to make of it. Part of me likes it, like I hate the anxiety I get when im waiting for a love interest to text me. But this guy doesnt text me at all except for setting the date up so I dont feel any anxiety I guess because he’s been consistent with the not texting?

31,mkulkt,1617655957,Dating a Guy with Severe Anxiety.... What should I do?," 

I (26/f) have been talking to this guy (30/m) for a little more than 3 months. Due to COVID, we took the physical part of our relationship slowly (we texted for the first month before stepping up to in person and virtual dates). But I honestly never fell for someone like this; we agree on all of the important things, but we have enough differences where we can constantly teach each other things and keep things interesting. We both commented on how unique and amazing our connection is, and when I last saw him a few weeks ago, he even mentioned that he hoped I'd eventually come down to his parents' beach house with him, and in my head I planned on asking him to be official the next time I saw him.

He suffers from anxiety, which he didn't hide from me, but I definitely didn't know the extent of it. After I left his place the last time, his anxiety got triggered (not by me, he was feeling ill and that added to his anxiety around COVID) and it mentally paralyzed him, to the point where he didn't text me or anyone else for a week. He finally reached back out and explained what had happened, and I tried to be very calm and understanding (thanking him for trusting me enough to tell me, apologizing that he was going through that and assuring him that I was still in this with him). He texted me again the next day (which also happened to be my birthday, so I'm glad he made sure to reach out), but now it's been a week since then and once again I have not heard a peep from him.

I recognize that our relationship is very new, and not even officially a relationship yet, but we grew very close and were building something that felt really special to us both. I don't want to overwhelm him (I've only sent 4 texts over the week just reminding him I'm here for him and asking for him to reach out how he's able to--I've offered to call or meet up in person if texting felt too difficult--just because I care, am worried about him, and just want to know how he is). The last text I sent was 2 days ago. I don't know how to move forward from here--I don't want to give up on him because his anxiety isn't a deal-breaker to me. I have friends that struggle with it and I have mild-to-medium social anxiety myself, and I want to work through this with him and figure out how to be a support system for him or at least be someone he doesn't feel the need to run from. But I also recognize that he now might not be ready for the type of relationship we were building and/or he might feel really mortified that I had to see him at his worst this early on. It's also really frustrating because part of the reason I fell for him was he is an open, honest, and thorough communicator normally, and so it feels shitty to be essentially ghosted and not have a clue about what's going on. I would accept if he needs space right now, but I hate that I'm not hearing that from him, and it's hurting my feelings having this happen twice after going 3 months with no hiccups at all. Do I try to reach out again, or do I just hang it up for now?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mkulkt/dating_a_guy_with_severe_anxiety_what_should_i_do/

I am fairly awkward,  I hate dancing (there is only one dance/disco song I like - Rasputin, even then the Turisas version is better by a country mile), have a very simple style of fashion (I don't wear jeans and rarely wear button down anything), have a non-masculine voice, do not like cutting my hair(beard or otherwise), I don't drink alcohol (See Dick Van Dyke's interview with Dick Cavett as to why; in addition to the fact that it impaires your thinking and judgement), I am not very ""smooth"" (direct is best for me), I am fat, and happen to have a very ugly face. I have never really tried to seek women in the real world mainly due to turning 18 last year, so covid forced my diabetic ass to stay in doors; I tried Bumble, Hinge, and Kinkoo (a site for people who are into kink) - nothing, zip, zilch. So I said, ""The hell with those things, I will wait until I get vaccinated."" After receiving my first dose I got super excited that life would get back to normal, but my hopes were quickly dashed.

Sunday, April 4th, 2021: I was watching YouTube and I came across a video about the Super Straight movement made by D'Angelo Wallace, and his video led me down a rabbit hole; the rabbit hole led me to a video by the user ""Queer Kiwi"" which was about some gym-bro dating coach that was showing men how to chat-up women at University (College for us Yankees). Queer Kiwi said in the video that approaching women whilst they are trying to go about their business is bad, I agree with this, and instead one should approach women only at places where they expect it and she gave clubs/bars as an example.

36,mkv7xf,1617657621,Girl ghosted out of nowhere,"Probably a common post but just need some outsider input.

This woman and I were talking for nearly a month, consistent facetiming etc. We occasionally would talk about scenarios to embarrass each other, prank each other in public and what not. Everything seemed well and we went on a date, made out a few times and later that day I texted her about how amazing it was and vice versa. 

Now the day after the date is April fools. We text on IG and iMessage and both convos are well and I ended the convo along the lines of “I’m gonna prank you good” to which she says “I’m not gonna fall for it cause you told me now 😭”. I take a nap and wake up to being soft blocked on instagram, and no reply on iMessage.

I figure this is the April fools prank and I tell myself I won’t fold and give in on her prank. Later towards midnight I text like hey haha nice prank now wya you WON clearly. No reply.

I ft’d her twice that same night because we were supposed to watch a movie on netflix party, calls go through, not declined. 

I text her throughout the next two days like oh I’d appreciate if you said something this is a bit confusing.

In actuality it is, we had a GREAT date and even talked about going on future ones and then the day after we text fine and she vanishes randomly on April fools? 

I could understand if ghosting builds up, she texts dead for a few days, then vanished, but in the middle of a funny conversation? 

I even messaged on IG just to see if she’d read and she read the message no reply, i’m not soft blocked on other socials nor is my number blocked, however she isn’t replying. I obviously stopped hitting up so I don’t seem insane. I did say just be transparent and let me know cause it’d go a long way for me 

What on gods green earth could be happening fellow people? You would think a simple “I’m not interested anymore” or even a quick text to say something would be fine, but it’s so bizarre what’s going on and the lack of communication

44,mkwf00,1617660947,What ghosting looks like from each side,"This applies to women ghosting men but obviously it happens the other way around too. 

We all know, girls get way more matches/responses than men, in general. I can speak firsthand about this. Lets say Im messaging with a guy. He’s one of the at least 15 other active convos on my app. But for this guy maybe im his only current active match/convo. So all his focus is on me. We go on a date, its a good date. Guy feels it was a great date, convinced things will go somewhere. I as the girl have 2 more dates set up in the coming week. I go on those dates and really hit it off with one of them. Guy #1 gets pushed to the back of my mind while I continue to be at his forefront. Now I dont like ghosting guys so I will say something like “sorry its not working for me but good luck”. But many other people ghost. So the guy gets left wondering what the heck happened, why did she ghost me out of nowhere, because all his focus has been on me and in his mind the date had gone great. But from my perspective guy #1 was never my sole focus so its insignificant to me and I end up just ghosting as he gets pushed to the bottom of my list.

Fyi, Im not one to date multiple people at a time once we get to the point of having gone on a few dates, have kissed, etc. then I stop pursuing things with others.

The thing is, our date was only about 2 hrs long, he said that he had to leave so I thought maybe he isn't interested. Then towards the end he said he'd like to grab a bite sometime soon and I was like yeah sure once lockdown eases blah blah. Then next day he texts me saying it was great meeting up etc and would like to meet up again. I responded and I know that the ball is in my court so should make up plans lol.

63,mkyaf0,1617666488,I’m here to offer advice on dating and down to have 1 on 1 chats if anyone needs,"I’m [23 F] hear to offer advice on improving your online dating profile

I have seen a lot of low effort profiles or ones where it’s clear the individual might struggle a bit finding the right words for their bio. That’s totally fine, I’ve been through that and understand.

Dating apps actually worked quite well for me, and I would be happy to help offer some personalized advice. If you’d like, you can DM me and I will help you improve your profile, give you constructive criticism on techniques you’ve got, and point out anything I notice where you are particularly strong. I have discord and would be happy to help you out from a female perspective. I also can get a male perspective on any questions you may have an help you out there as well! 

If you don’t want personalized advice, here are a couple general tips!

1. Have a variety of pictures (not just selfies)
2. Open with a fun line or comment, not just “hi”
3. Have an open mind, you might match with someone you wouldn’t normally go for and click well
4. Avoid generalizing in your bio (avoid statements such as “since all women like...”)


Good luck in all your future dating adventures!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mkyaf0/im_here_to_offer_advice_on_dating_and_down_to/

Met this cute personal trainer at the gym. We watch each other when we're in the gym and he always comes over to give me pointers on whatever exercise I'm working on aha! He's high ego and a bit self-involved, but I think he's adorable and I love how knowledgeable he is about the body and sports and training. 

After a few times of chatting in the gym, he invited me out to play pool with some of his gym friends. I said (YES!) but the day of, he bailed so we trained at the gym together instead (Friday 26th). When we left, he invited me to his place - and I was a bit taken off guard, so I told him I had to cook dinner for my mother (true) and he peaced. I saw him on Sunday (28th) at the gym, but he was with a client so we briefly flirted and that was all we had time for.

I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE AND I AM DYING haha! I texted him last week to see if he had plans for Easter (he didn't and I didn't have the courage to suggest an activity T\_T). The city is currently in a lockdown so household visits/restaurants/bars are kind of out right now. I was thinking to invite him to play some basketball? I'm shit at it but I still love playing horse. Does this sound like a good idea? Am I missing some sacred dating rule about how it's been more than a week since we last tried to hang out and so I should throw in the towel?

65,mkyort,1617667721,Am I crazy for wanting to pause things and shoot my shot with a different guy?,"I've (22F) been seeing someone lets call Ben (22m) for about a month and half now. We have a lot in common and I've met his parents/he's met mine. When we are in person we can have good conversations and over text we are consistent with texting back and forth. I'm hesistant at this point to go forward with the relationship because I'm not super attracted to him (I know...) and it's very clear that physical touch is his love language and I'm just not super into it. To be clear he is a stereotypical attractive guy, just not quite my type. He's very sweet and I think someone else out there would be very lucky to be with him, but I feel like I should put a pin in it forever because I don't want to lead him on. One major difference between us is that he is very adament about staying in our home town and settling down here, and I just can not picture doing that because it's so expensive. I would feel trapped here. I think I am a bit more of a risk taker than he is and I want to move out of this town as soon as covid is better/I can move it a less expensive city on my own. 

This is where I need the ""am I crazy input?"": there is this other guy (22m) that I knew in middle school (I know ancient history) that I came across on instagram and it turns out we went to the same college/basically the same program/have mutual friends. He would remember me if I reached out to him and asked how he is doing. He's honestly he's one of the cutest boys I've ever seen. He's always been in the back of my head as an option and I feel like I should just shoot my shot, worst case scenario he says no and I can just move on and live my life. I don't want him to think that it's weird for reaching out to him after all this time though I'd hate to weird him out.

66,mkyrrf,1617667975,Where TF is this going?,"So. My boyfriend(40m) and I(28f) have been together for 3.5ish years. We’ve traveled a lot, spent a lot of time with each other’s families, and obviously have survived a pandemic. He moved in with me (I own my home) in October of 2019. He has never lived with an SO before me. 

We both have really good jobs. He comes from a really good family while my family and my past are very complicated. Neither of us have been engaged or married before and this is now both of our longest relationship. I had a dog before, and we got a puppy together last January. This last year has not been easy, but we have survived. Now, I have cPTSD, depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I have been in therapy for ~5 years. I am also on the correct medications, and they fluctuate depending on the season and my workload. 

With all of that being said, we’ve talked about a lot of things regarding the future. However, he has said that he is nowhere near ready for us to take the next step because I still have full blown toxic meltdowns every other month or so. I am fully aware of what happens, but once my body goes into full flight/freeze mode during a disagreement, I turn into a completely different person. I HATE it. The only way to avoid it is to recognize it before it happens, which takes practice.. and when you’re doing everything that you can to communicate effectively so as to avoid any sort of argument involving raised voices (one of my triggers due to domestic abuse) you don’t get very many opportunities to practice. When it does happen, I spend the next 2 days in a deep depression because it makes me feel like I’m not getting any better and like it’ll never go away and there isn’t anything that he can do to help, plus it’s not his job to manage my emotions. It’s a hard 3 day experience for both of us. 

He has known about my struggles with mental health since very early on, but it still seems to be the one thing holding him back from wanting to take the next step. It’s so hard to feel like I have to force myself through becoming healthier if I want him to ask me to marry him. I hate to sound harsh, but he’s not getting any younger. It really bothers me that he doesn’t seem to be any closer to taking the next step despite the obvious progress I have made over the time that we have been together. 

I can’t help but feel like I’m never going to be good enough, and that really isn’t great for my mental health. I’m currently planning a significant career change, so I really need to know where this is going, but all he can say is basically “not yet”. Part of me feels like I’m wasting my time waiting on this man, but maybe this is just how waiting to get engaged goes? Do I gtfo while I’m still under 30 or do I wait? I don’t know.

67,mkyyij,1617668557,Girl I’m Seeing Talking to Other Guys,"26M dating 32F. We’re not official. Working our way up to a relationship or so I thought.

We’ve already had sex multiple times and it’s honestly the best I’ve ever had. Can’t speak for her even though she’s said the same.

Had a gut feeling she was talking to other guys. She’s single. Beautiful. Yes, has two kids but they don’t live with her (it’s a complicated situation- not anything she’s done wrong). But told me that she’s not interested in pursuing anything further with me if I’m talking to anyone else. This is after about a couple of months of us seeing each other. Whatever. I respect that.

Fast forward to a few weeks later. I’m still having this gut feeling. She’s older by a few years. Figure it’s just a thing that she barely texts me during the day. Stuff like that. 


Tonight, Her mom FaceTimes her while we’re sitting in bed together. She never lets her know when I’m around unless she asks. Then Mom let’s it slip, “So, still talking to your ‘men’?” 

“I’m with (my name) right now.” She says.

“Oh,” her Mom answers, “I meant (my name). By men, I meant him and Jinx (her cat)”.

Not only did I get confirmation that she’s talking to other men inadvertently through her mother, but her own mom is in on it.

Here’s my issue. I don’t care if she was talking to or sleeping with other men. But just be honest about it! Don’t tell me to be exclusive otherwise we can’t grow and you’re fucking around. That’s what really bothers me. The sex is good. I just hate being lied to. 

Now, I’m just sitting here on her bed after that whole encounter went down. She fell asleep. Didn’t say shit about it. What would you do? Would you just forget about it and stay? Get sex out of it and move on? Or would you talk to her about it?

68,mkz2pu,1617668908,"How do I (21m) make sure that things don’t get weird between me and my former crush (22f), since I now have a GF (21f)?","

So there’s a girl (I’ll call her Meg) that I met over a year ago, and we became friends. Meg invited me her church many times, and I eventually started going. Before I started going, I asked her out and she said she wasn’t looking to date at the time. I started going to her church anyway cause I like it, but then Covid happened and it closed for most of last year. Last Spring I asked Meg out again (stupid, I know.... long story) and she said she sees me as a friend. 

Church opened back up last fall and I started going again. Around the same time I met another girl, who’s now my girlfriend. Only our close friends know that we’re together since we don’t post each other and stuff. Anyway, I occasionally see Meg at church, and we usually talk for a minute, usually just checking in with each other. This past Easter Sunday we saw each other and she asked if I went to the Good Friday service that we had. I said no and she was like “You should have went! You should go to our events and stuff like that”. Then she asked if I’d be interested in serving on the youth team and becoming one of the “youth leaders” because they need more people. She said that I’d be a good team leader and we talked about it and she invited me to their youth service this Wednesday. She said that she’d text me the details if I’m available.

I know that she’s not inviting me just because they need people, because she’s not the type to be around people that she doesn’t like just because they need more people on the team. Here’s the thing, I’m hoping that she’s just being friendly, since I now have a GF. How should I proceed so that she doesn’t get the idea that I’m interested? Or to stop her from being interested in the off chance that she likes me now? I feel like I’m overthinking things, but I wanna make sure nothing happens. I talked to my GF and she doesn’t mind me being around her, but she wants me to mention that I have a GF now. How do I do that without it being awkward or random?

76,ml0419,1617672119,"(18F) GF Might Be Embarrassed to be Seen With Me/Interact With Me (20M) In Public, Share You Thoughts Please?","We met through an online forum, and she is part of the managing team of the ""online communication system"" for our university (Discord/Slack/etc., not saying which specifically, but one of these).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my character usually involves trolling the forum and making jokes/being a clown for the most part.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, she was dating someone at the time when we met, who was also on the forum. Everyone on the server who was her friend who make a joke of changing their username to be one of her body part (for sake of example, let's say her name was X, so ppl would make their usernames/display names as ""X's arm"" or ""X's teeth"" or ""X's liver"", etc.). Now, me being the clown I am and wanting to reach, I changed mine to ""X's lover"". Clearly, this didn't sit well with neither X or other members of the managing team, and after some time, I ended up changing the username when one of the members of the team told me that it was pretty much harassment at that point and it was making X uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

Some time later, she ended up breaking up with the guy. Flash forward to two months after, when the semester is restarting, I start talking to X, develop a romantic interest in her, and start hitting things off. We are vibing well and essentially ""dating"" from the second week onward considering how close we were getting, but was not officially boyfriend/girlfriend yet. In this timeframe, I joked about how I would change back the username to ""X's lover"", and she mentioned that she doesn't mind it anymore because while her ex might be in the server, she did not care and that she was her own woman.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed this sounded odd, so I said I might change it in the future at a random time, but internally this was sounding like a bad idea bc I wanted it to be serious if I were to change it.

&amp;#x200B;

We officially started a relationship a month after we started talking. However, in the time between mentioning bringing back the username and after dating her, a few red flags started popping up:

* She seemed to be avoiding in public on the server. She would only be telling me to tune into her gaming streams on the server when no one else was on. But in other scenarios when other people would be on and I would try to interact with her, she would avoid me and offer really brief responses that wouldn't be more than an emoji (and most times, it wasn't even a response, it would just be a emoji reaction to my original message)
* She didn't tell any of her friends on the managing team that she was in a relationship with me and would tell me how that's a ""good thing""
* She set a reminder for me to get to class on the server, but quickly deleted it after it did its job. I suspect this was so no one else finds out she's interacting with me. Contrast this with another reminder she set for someone else, but that reminder is still there to be seen in the server, so clearly, the indication I'm getting is that she's avoiding interaction

&amp;#x200B;

While these were signs, I figured it was overthinking and assured myself that she was not the type to do something like this/had that shitty of a character. It was not until a few days after we started dating, that it really came crashing down. Her friend on the managing team who messaged me months prior to change the username, I kinda thought it'd be funny to message him and do like an inside joke where I'd say ""yeah, I'm keeping the username actually"", watch him get mad, only to find out I was actually dating her this time, and laugh it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, when I told him to ask her if she was fine with it, she told the managing team that I was just joking with the username and that I don't really mean the username. She also privately told me to keep a distance from her on the server, not make any advances in the server, and to basically act like we are complete strangers on the server. She also mentioned that any talk of relationships would basically be engraved in stone on the server, so she doesn't want that to happen. What really hit the nail on the coffin was when I asked why she doesn't just say we're dating - ""because they don't have the best perception of you.""

&amp;#x200B;

All of this cut very deep. I am not one to feel emotions strongly for the most part, I rarely cry, maybe once every few years. But this hit me like a train - I can still feel sharp pangs of pain radiating across my chest as I can feel myself lose oxygen and slowly slump back in disgust and anger and sadness and shame. I still wonder to myself what I could have possibly done that was so wrong to be abandoned like this?

&amp;#x200B;

She mentioned it was a conflict of interest since she was part of the managing team and her circumventing the rules for me would be abuse of power, but she could have very easily said something along the lines of ""we are dating, that is why I don't mind the username, so that can stay; but, if he is doing anything else against the rules or being disrespectful, feel free to ban/kick him out, and I will not interfere."" That wouldn't be abuse of power, and it'd good judgment on her part. AND I AM PERFECTLY FINE WITH BEING KICKED OUT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BTW. It just hurts to know your gf doesn't feel comfortable admitting to others that she's dating you. And it's not like she's shy either, literally anyone else on the server she says hi, talks very well, and send a ton of emojis and is very enthusiastic. But whenever I try to interact with her

&amp;#x200B;

After all that happened, that same day, we kinda worked it out, and she mentioned that she was not ashamed, has my back, and will not shy away from it. She mentioned that she didn't know I was fine with being this open of my relationship with her, and that she will be more open about it as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I trusted her, and everything was going along smoothly. She was mentioning that she's in a relationship on the server and to her friends, but a few days ago, she pulled an april fools romantically cute love letter prank on me, and posted ab her bf (me) having a fun time with it. I responded to the message, only to be not met with any response or acknowledgment or even an emoji reaction (even though she sent me a message ab posting it on the server). What really struck me as odd was that her same friends who she said she was telling them we were in a relationship, responded to my comment with surprised emojis in shock that I commented that. Soooo, I have no idea what she's been telling them or if anything she's been saying this entire time has been true.

&amp;#x200B;

She has not contributed to one good night of sleep for me since we have started dating. Either I have headed to sleep crying and depressed, or headed to sleep mildly feeling nothing. I give her tears of joy every day from being genuinely interested in her and in love with her, but I am starting to match her tears of joy with my tears of sorrow on a daily basis at this point.

I don't love her 100% anymore, and I sure as hell don't trust her words 100% anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR; met current gf (assume name is ""X"") on an online communication system (Discord/Slack/etc.) and changed the username to ""X's lover"" as a joke after other people had theirs as ""X's liver"" or ""X's teeth""; she is on the managing team of the server, so one of the other members tells me I'm harassing her w/ the username (her bf at the time might see it and not take kindly to it) so has me change it; she breaks up a bit afterward, and two months later, we're talking and vibing well; we hit it off and enter a relationship (the irony hahaha); she shows several signs of avoidance in public on the server by not interacting with me or telling any of her friends on the managing team that she's dating me or only talking to me when no one else was around or in her dms; I assume I'm overthinking and trust her character isn't like this until I message the original managing team member who told me to change the username to tell him I changed it back (as a joke bc it'd be funny when he realizes we're actually dating this time haha); she tells the team that I'm just joking and tells me to keep a distance and pretend we don't know each other in public on the server; I tell her how this makes me feel and she realizes it was bad and promises to be open and not hide it; she tells me she tells her friends ab the relationship and stuff and even posts something in the server referencing her bf (w/o a specific mention to anyone) and when I responded to the comment, her friends she said she was being open with shot me a confused look so I have no idea what to make of this or to trust her anymore; I am not one to feel emotions deeply, but this feeling of dread and sorrow arising from the situation is still stabbing me in the chest and sucking the life out of me, I don't know if I can continue doing this for much longer.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ml0419/18f_gf_might_be_embarrassed_to_be_seen_with/

I enjoyed it so much, I really wanna do shit with girls more often, but it feels like it’s not normal. Is it normal to enjoy hanging out with girls so much (especially ones with common interests) and is it a bad thing?

I know it’s a pretty weird question, but I felt like asking to get it out my system. I really wanna find a girl and do it again tbh",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ml0932/is_it_a_bad_thing_to_enjoy_dates_so_much/
79,ml0fkv,1617673148,How to show my interest?,"This sounds like a pretty obvious question, and I’m sure for some people it’s going to sound a little strange. But I’ve been having trouble picking up on if this girl at work is into me as more than a friend and I’m just clueless honestly. I’m struggling with the idea of just asking her out. And I know... rip the bandaid off, just do it and get it over with, etc. I understand that all of that is excellent advice. Unfortunately it’s just not something I’m gonna be able to do right now. My anxiety is just too much and I would rather just continue enjoying being around her as I am doing currently but still seeing how things go. 

So I was wondering if anyone had tips on maybe little ways to communicate interest on my part and then see how she reacts to it. Just like picking up on signals, I feel like I’m horrible at flirting as well. What are some little things that guys can do that indicate interest? This is a super basic question, I know. But that’s how clueless I am. I feel like I’m just awkward and not really letting on that I want to get to know her more and that I like her. 

Thank you for any advice you have!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ml0fkv/how_to_show_my_interest/
80,ml0pq0,1617674042,Actually like someone for once and now this!,"About two weeks ago, I (26F) went to happy hour at a nice restaurant with a guy (28M) I had been talking to since January.  

Background: We met on a dating app and he asked for my number. From there, we would FaceTime once and text often, basically daily, until I just decided not to text back one day. (After a month or so I was bored of our conversations and overall stagnation in the relationship.)

We follow each other on Instagram so this opened the door for causal interaction in the form of responding to or liking each other’s posts. One day (FINALLY) he direct messaged me and said “Why haven’t I taken you on a date yet?”... To which I responded that he was playing games, dragging his feet, etc. He quickly texted me and made plans for the first date. 

...and that first date went well! Or so I thought. Since I started talking to him, I got the idea that he was a nice guy, ambitious, family-oriented, likes to have fun...all that good stuff. He admitted that he isn’t shy but is generally a reserved guy. I wasn’t physically attracted to him at first but that changed after meeting in person. We spent about 3 hours together chatting and catching up. During which he mentioned another place “we should try” so I got the idea we’d see eachother again soon.

Well...the week following the first date we texted throughout until that Friday night he just didn’t respond. I haven’t heard from him in over a week however, his birthday just passed and I decided to send a text. He responded thank you with a smiley face emoji. I didn’t expect to be invited to his plans considering we just met in person, but I would’ve liked to hear about them or how we was doing. I’m trying not to be down about this but I can’t help but focus on how much I like him and want to continue getting to know him. Why would he say he had really great time and was happy to see me if he had no intention of furthering a relationship? That leads me to my next question: Should I reach out? I’m not afraid of doing a little pursuing or following up. I just don’t want to be pushy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ml0pq0/actually_like_someone_for_once_and_now_this/

In the morning and at night, that's it. When we do text it's a lot of content and we both address everything. I don't like to text all day with anybody, but it's just very unusual texting behavior that I don't understand? Maybe this is just how she texts? Although I find it hard to believe in today's world that we live in..I can honestly say she has texted me at most 3 times and they were like 4 or 5 hours in between.

95,ml1xip,1617677974,Am I being strung along?,"I’ve been dating a guy for about a month. I felt super intense chemistry the first date. Like I’ve never had a first date that good in my life. We’ve seen each other 1-2 times a week every week since. However, there’s very minimal texting in between dates, which I’m not used to. Last week, I brought up the question of whether or not he was seeing anybody else. He said “not like this” but that he had been on another date in the past week or so. He wanted to sleep with me, and I told him we would have to wait until we’re exclusive because I don’t want to put up with all the risks that would come with if not. I told him I wasn’t seeing anyone else and that if we’re going to continue I would prefer he wouldn’t either. He said he wasn’t ready to be exclusive but that he wanted to keep seeing me and that he sees this going somewhere in the future. He said he wants something with more substance but that he just needs to get to the where he feels comfortable. Which I totally understand, it had only been 3 weeks at that point. However, ever since we had that conversation he’s really backed off of it in terms of contact with me. We’re going out again in a couple days, but I haven’t heard from him since he asked me out. I don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t wanna keep seeing this guy if he’s just going to string me along and if he doesn’t want a relationship. He told me he’s open to a relationship but it all seems very vague. Part of me feels like he just is telling me what I wanna hear because he doesn’t wanna stop seeing me. What should I do? I know it’s only been a month, but we see each other multiple times a week and I don’t think it’s fair that I’m not seeing other people and he has been. I’m telling him exactly what I want. Should I bring up the question again? Also, his lack of texts in between our meet ups make me feel like he’s not really interested in something more than what we already have going on. Like he’s not interested in my day. But at the same time, if he doesn’t want to relationship, why does he keep wanting to see me?

99,ml29of,1617679060,Hiding or sharing your relationship online,"Before having any semblance of a relationship, I never saw the appeal in wanting to hide your relationship online. Seeing other couples post cute photos online, while you lie alone on your phone wishing that could be you, or that you could at least have the satisfaction of making other people jealous about your relationship. 

Now of course I can see the appeal in showing off your relationship. But I now definitely see why people would hide it. Me and my partner (of sorts) had some nice photos recently and I was dying to post them.

But alas, I didn't see the point. I had nothing to prove to anyone. Besides putting yourself online already exposes yourself to personal attacks and bullying or people just hyperanalyzing everything you post, I would hate for someone I care about to also be subject to that because of me. And if me not sharing my relationship makes others think I'm some lonely virgin then they're free to think that, I know it isn't true.

So yeah, now I finally understand something I never did before.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ml29of/hiding_or_sharing_your_relationship_online/
