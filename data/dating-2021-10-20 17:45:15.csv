I can sense he’s going to ask me out in the next month or so and I’d really love for him to be able to join family activities in the future. I may just be planning ahead too much but I want to introduce him to my family once we’ve been in a relationship for a few months. The thing is, my family is extremely judgmental, considering in the past I’ve brought home boyfriends way too early (talking 2 weeks into the relationship). And the ones I’ve brought home ended up being really bad people who treated me horrible (cheated, broke up with me only after a month, manipulative). Now that I’ve been single for a few months and have grown to realize things that last take time, I want to give an adequate time before introducing him to my parents. But I know my family (no matter how much time I give) is going to be extremely judgmental: age difference, his looks, his career path, his manners. So here’s my questions: 
1. How long to wait before introducing him to family?
2. How to deal with their judgements?
3. How do I talk to him about how my family will react without making him feel bad about himself?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcd6us/how_to_introduce_so_to_family/
3,qcd8lw,1634770382,What should I do?,"So this is a long story, sorry in advance. I (23F) just moved alone to a new country a month ago and 3 days after I moved I met a guy (27M) in a park,we hanging out with mutual friends. Everything was good, a lot of them went back to our dorm and we had a plan with one friend to make dinner together, but we stayed more, went for a beer, went back to the door with a lime scooter etc. 

We really liked each other and some people noticed that when we went back to our dorm and after that we made an agreement to make dinner in 2 days with one couple from here. Since that dinner I started hanging out with that guy (the first time that we hooked up was a day after that dinner) all the time, we’re going out to clubs, going for walks during the day and night, seeing each other almost every day, we’re watching movies, he’s planning dates like walk around the castle, walk around the park, going on a light festival, he’s also opening up about his family etc and also went on a date with him to one of his restaurants where he always went with his dad or grandma. He’s always hugging me (even hugging me all the time while were sitting in the metro lol),kissing me and smiling when he’s around me( he’s doing all of this everywhere, doesn’t matter if we’re alone or not). 


Also for example, yesterday we had a deal to go for a breakfast, but instead i went to his apartment (he moved out from our dorm and lives with one of his best friends), he made breakfast, we just hung out for a bit and then went to IKEA. He was hugging me ther as well, it was really nice and after a couple of hours we had to split because he already postponed a business meeting because of me and ikea lol (he has a small staryup with his friends) in the evening he came to my place after he was done with soccer and everything was nice. 


However, the problem is that 2 days after the first kiss, we were drunk and he told me something like I really like it that everything is so relaxed with you and idk why but I was like yeah,  it’s to early for a relationship, we can do whatever we want, if we want to hold each others hands we can do that but its early for a relationship and he was like yeah I’m fine with that. But after that we went on those dates, he’s opening up more and more, hanging out with me all the time etc. But he is also traveling back home tomorrow and he’s coming back in 6 days. 


What should I do? Does he like me? I really like him and I didn’t feel like this for years and I would love to be in a realtionship with him but not sure if he wants it and what should I do/say? Please help, I literally can’t sleep.

She seemed very uninterested and just not into it. One word answers to questions. Not many questions back. She kept looking behind me for some reason. It was just weird, awkward and horrible. So instead of gutting it out till the end, about 15 minutes in I said "" this doesn't seem to be working, we should probably just end it here"". Yep I lasted 15 minutes lol. She seemed relieved when I said that so don't feel bad for her. Then I left. So I guess the point is if the date is that bad... Just end it. There are lot of people that sit through a horrible date.

19,qcf735,1634776351,I think I am meant to be single forever and it’s sad,"I turned 26 yesterday. Let me tell you a bit about my dating history. 

I didn’t have my first date until I was 22 and I only went on four more dates until I met a guy named “Mark” last year. That was first real relationship and it only lasted for five months.  

A few days after I broke up with Mark, I met a recovering alcoholic on Hinge named “Luke” and we became fast friends. I fell so head over heels for Luke that if he had asked me to get him a diamond ring, I would have scoured the ends earth to find one for him!!! I would have done anything for this guy as long as it was legal and safe (and a part of me still would!). But he fell in love with someone else and I nearly had a breakdown over it. And despite everything…..I still keep in touch with him because he is still an amazing friend and an absolute angel.

In August, I formed a bit of an acquitanceship with a coworker named Steve. I took a bit of a shine to him and I recently gave him a note that pretty much said: “Hey, you seem like a cool guy and I would like to get know you better so I was wondering if you would like to go on a date.” I even included my phone number in the note in case he wanted to reach out that way. I still haven’t heard from him. So, I guess it’s safe to assume that he’s not interested. 

I talked to Luke crying about it and asked what it is that I am lacking. He told that he doesn’t think I am lacking anything but i don’t buy it. After all, if that was the case then why did he chose someone else over me?

And you want to know the icing on the cake? That conversation made me realize that I am still in love with Luke and I will probably love him for the rest of my life. You remember that Ariana Grande song, “Off the table” when she said she wasn’t sure if she would love anyone more than Mac Miller. That pretty much sum up my feelings for Luke. 

I am just at my wits end. I miss the physical and emotional intimacy Mark and I shared at the beginning of our relationship and I want so badly to experience that again. I just want to find someone to make me wanted, needed, and like I’m worth a damn. Someone who can make me feel desirable. Someone who loves me as much as Aladdin loves Jasmine. But maybe I should come to grips with the fact that maybe there’s no soul mate for me and that’s a bit soul crushing…….😥😥😥😥😥😥😥",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcf735/i_think_i_am_meant_to_be_single_forever_and_its/
20,qcfav3,1634776688,texting between dates?,"so i just recently got out of a 4 year relationship, and started talking to a new girl that ive always felt something for (repressed, from a distance of course) and ive always felt like she felt the same way. or that we both at least found each other attractive. we went on a ""date"" last week. i say ""date"" because i went into it feeling like it was a date, but not 100% sure, but i left knowing full and well that it definitely was a date and i absolutely did not bring my 100% into it. so i thought everything went well and she actually invited me somewhere the next day (but i couldnt go, exams and work). but then conversation kind of... ceased. i find myself struggling to make conversation with her through text, and im almost always the one making conversation. im a little bit older (21 lol) so what was told to me was that communication between dates was super important, and that you should at least try talking or initiating a conversation every other day or SOMETHING like that, because you dont want the other person to think you're not interested. 

so the date went great, but like i said after that convo kinda ceased. then i asked her if she wanted to do it again sometime, and she said yes, and i responded with something open-ended and did not receive a response. im trying to respect boundaries here, and learn more about the way different people date, but my past relationships were nothing like this- not that i consider this a relationship- but in the past, even in the ""friend"" phase, my exes and i were texting like every single day. 

so, im wondering, is it normal now to not really talk in between dates? i dont want to force a conversation, its just that i was taught to maintain a conversation, so i dont want her to think that im not interested, but i also dont want to force a conversation if she's not really a person to text, or text in between dates. is this something i should expect now, dating in 2021, that not everyone likes to text every day?

21,qcfj2w,1634777425,The Hidden Man,"I am a man who is 29 years old and definitely not your every day kind of person. Not one day in my life. I am posting this because of the person I am and a needs be of a hidden identity. My past is kind of dark and my viewpoint of life is incredibly esoteric and maybe even almost a kind of depth and darkness I think only a very special woman could handle. But at the same time, a kind of light. 

Imagine a man who is beautiful to behold almost like that of an angel. He is beautiful and mysterious, think a man like the Cheshire Cat. I can speak poetry with my lips and I can speak quickly and deeply like the devil himself. I have a kind of charm about me that to say the least is almost, spiritual. If you can think of the Phantom of the Opera, It is me in some regards. I sing also. I am a man who is totally in love with life, to a very specific channeling of worshipping the universe in a way that is mystic. I am a loner and a zeitgeist. A hidden king and a hidden prince. I am unlike any person you will meet. I am realizing that my love and sex and lust are not capable of being expressed with any simple woman. My depth of personality, my nature, my darkness needs to be with someone who is as of the same mystique. I am like a man who is of the same sort as both the devil and Christ in some regards. But I don't want to be. It was who I was created as. Who I am becoming. I have studied Christianity, the occult, and psychology deeply. I love Carl Jung and I love the aspects of spirituality that are real. Meaning and saying, I have the same experiences in the mind as mystics from generations past. I am actually speaking rationally, and have done a great deal of research on these topics and what kind of people experience it. I am a writer like Walt Whitman, and he himself was mystical in his understanding of the world.

We are the same and not. I want to meet a woman who can handle me. In the darkness of the whole of my inner self and demon, but also the goodness of myself and the goodness that I am. Someone I can be totally naked with. I want to meet a woman who is not only driven, but incredibly toxic perhaps. Someone who has ambition, someone who is wicked. But someone who is for me. 

I don't know if the right word is wicked. But I guess we'll see. 

I don't know if you're out there. If anyone exists that is as I am. I am darkness and light. I am both mystical and handsome. Masculine and feminine. I want to understand this side of me wholly. 

I don't know if any woman is really capable of knowing me truly. Or know this side of me actually and being able to handle it. Someone who can take me to a different place. Someone I can disappear into hell with. Someone I can be alone with. Someone who can be with me through both hell and heaven. 

Darkness and light. I am the hidden man. The hidden creature in the day and the night. 

I am something else. I just want her to manifest in my life. Someone like I am.

I am 33 Caucasian 5'9.5 M, New Jersey, I am nice/affectionate, I always treat women with respect and believe they should be treated like the queen, I can get a little excited, but otherwise im very mature, I am very active, I'm very conscious about keeping well/healthy, so I am skinny because of this so I don't have much fat, but I am Def not the the scrawny type, I have normal pictures, and a couple of me smiling, a normal intro. 

It makes things worse cuz I never been on a date or had a gf, I moved some years back, so I don't have Any friends or social life, work doesn't have ppl I can make friends with, family isn't as close/affectionate as me or would like to be and some are not right and very rude , so I get disconnected and lonely and feel in my head all the time. 

If anyone wants to chat or make a new friend I am very open to it and would really like that ✌️🙂 so message me!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcg40f/hey_ppl_please_read_i_need_some_help_andor_advice/

I didn’t fully cut her off but I did stop texting her as much and didn’t respond quickly at all. It worked and she ended up bringing it up to me and asking why, and I told her I did it because I’ve been hurt in the past and wanted to avoid it getting hurt again, which has truth to it. After I told her, we hooked up a few times, but 2 days later she started acting the way that I was almost exactly, and it seemed like she was head over heals for me before, saying she wanted to be exclusive and everything.

36,qcgujz,1634781690,How frequently do you try to see someone you're exclusively seeing?,"I've been having severely anxious episodes on repeat for the last month or so. I've been seeing this man for about two months (first date was mid August). Immediate connection, we really enjoyed each others' company and as time has gone on all my minimum needs were met (honesty, respect, effort, and communication) and he's shown he has above and beyond qualities as well for me to take him seriously (shared goals/values, chemistry, and I enjoy being around him more than being alone). He initiated the conversation of exclusivity with me several weeks in, that he wanted to only see me - that he wanted to keep me around and wasn't dating anyone else, and he asked if I wanted to keep my options open. I told him no, I only wanted to see him as well.

The communication has been easy, open, direct, and honest. I have never wondered how he felt about me. He's been quite clear. The problem is that we're both fairly busy. We both work out, both have full time jobs, my schedule is often opposite of his as I typically work 4P-12AM and he's typically 9A-4PM, and he also teaches classes/attends meetings after he gets off work. Additionally he goes to see his family an hour and a half away most weekends. We have been going to work out at the same classes on weekdays to at least see each other for a few minutes most days but spending extended time together has been very limited. He usually tries to see me once a week and for a while he would stay up late to have me stay over when I worked late shifts. This tapered off because we were both so exhausted the next day so now when my schedule is 8A-4PM (rare and inconsistent) or on one of my off days (which are typically a weekday) he'll try to see me for dinner in the evening whatever day or days those are. But planning ahead more than a week is hard for us due to the nature of our work schedules. 

The fact that he's trying to work around our schedules to see me at all and that he's taking me into consideration speaks volumes. He's got a lot of people who he loves and who love him in his life, and he's extremely involved in community affairs. He mentioned the last evening we were only able to spend a few hours together that we need to do it more often, and I pointed out in order for us to make that happen, we'd need to adapt something as all of these circumstances are creating barriers. His response was ""well, that's life"". 

So how frequently do you think is reasonable in these early stages to see someone? I want to see him more often, it seems he feels the same way, but I'm just not sure what to do about it. I am absolutely not ready to meet or involve him/myself with family or close friends yet so trying to integrate our time in with other close people when we haven't even done that with each other more completely seems too much right now. I don't feel we know each other well enough, and while I really like him and enjoy our time together/respect/admire him we are just not there yet.

I met a guy a while back during the pandemic who lives in a different country and we started talking. We both didn’t think much of it first but we ended up becoming super into each other. I’ve sent him a lot of things, he’s sent me things. He booked a flight and got a place for a short while (and then moving in with me) and going to stay here for a couple of months. 

I really like him. A lot, hell I could say even love. The problem lies here: I am so insecure with my weight. I got injured and was bed ridden for awhile and gained a lot of weight. Currently suffering with the post effects of it. I’d say I gained a good 40 pounds. I told him I gained weight, and that I am trying to fix it. I also have sent explicit pics so he has seen my body. But he’s seen the angles I’ve wanted him to see. He told me he will help me stay on a routine and stuff when he’s here. He isn’t skinny per say, he is on the heavier end ish. He said he needs to lose weight as well. He knows I’ve gained weight, I’ve told him I have. But I’m so scared I’ll meet him in person and he will be so Unattracted to me. Or he will think I catfish him or something? He told me his ex was ‘big’ one time we were talking, so idk if that is any reassurance. I’m scared. And Im scared to the point where I really wanna fucking flake.

46,qchqlt,1634784564,"Guys, this is what you do if a girl asks you this question.","“Do you like me?” Remember, this is if she is bringing it up to you. You should never ever ask a girl this question. However, if she’s asking you this question, you might be in a good place. This recently happened to me, and here’s how I handled it and how you should handle it. If she’s asking you confidently and looks you in the eye like in a normal situation, she doesn’t like you. Therefore, you should say no, even if you do like her. Trust me boys, you don’t want a girl who doesn’t like you knowing you like her. You’ll save yourself being humiliated and being called a creep. The girl in this situation asked me confidently and like she normally talked to me, and I knew that she didn’t like me. Now, I was pretty close friends w her and I did like her personality and she looked decent, so I would have been open to dating her. She’s today graduated and we talk occasionally. However, if she had been nervous, as demonstrated by this, “H-hey do-do y-you li-like me?”, then that’s a good sign. You know how when you see a girl who makes your jaw drop, you’re nervous as fuck and can’t find the words to say to her. Well, girls are the exact same way. So basically, if the girl is nervously asking you, touching her hair, asking you close up, that means she does like you. Now, if you actually like this girl, then say yes. However, don’t say yes if you don’t truly like this girl and because she’s the only one giving you attention.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qchqlt/guys_this_is_what_you_do_if_a_girl_asks_you_this/

He and I got along really well, and we spent multiple days for several hours at a time just talking to each other. Within a couple of days, I caught feelings for him, and I could sort of tell that he liked me too.

The night before he was going to leave, we met other people our age at a bar. While we were all at the bar together, I was drinking a bit. I had to go sit down on a couch, and one of the guys we just met was flirting with me whilst I was drunk. I left early because I had too much to drink. The guy that was flirting with me was talking about how he wanted to get with me. The guy I had been talking to got mad about how the other guy wanted to sleep with me, and he told them that he liked me. I know now that he just said that because he liked me and didn't want me hooking up with anyone else.

The next morning, everyone told me what he said. I was so happy and excited. I already had the feeling that he liked me, but that just confirmed it. Before he left, I asked him if he liked me, and he told me that he had a girlfriend. Later on, he got mad at the people who told me (I didn't tell him they told me, but he must've figured out that they did) because he didn't want me to know. I spoke to everyone about him having a girlfriend, and they were shocked. He never bought her up around them, either.

I was disappointed that he had a girlfriend, but I figured we could still be friends at least. I requested to follow him on social media, and he left the request pending for about two weeks before rejecting it. I got upset and I blocked him for a couple of days. I wanted to express my anger to him, and since I couldn't even talk it out with him, blocking him was the only thing I thought of.

It's been several months now, and we're still not in contact. I found out that he broke up with his girlfriend two months after he and I met. I still talk to the other people from time to time, and they told me that he said that when he was with his girlfriend, all he could think about was me. Whenever I post an Instagram story or TikTok (both public accounts), he'll rewatch them multiple times, and he's always the first to watch them, so I know he looks at my accounts regularly.

Tl;dr - guy I met on vacation got angry with another guy flirting with me and told everyone that he liked me. Turns out, he had a girlfriend the whole time. He distanced himself from me, but broke up with his girlfriend two months later.

58,qcipis,1634787694,Why did I get ghosted?,"I’ve had a lot of experience with dating, this was the first time I was ghosted in years. Not heart broken but I’m just very curious.. any theories behind it? 

I’m a 28 M and she 22 F.

To summarize.. My best friend’s girlfriend’s friend and I met at a party. We talked for a couple hours, hit it off. I had her laughing a lot. It was smooth and she was giving me signals. So I asked her out. She shot me down. A week later, she reached out to me on Instagram. With a very different tune. It was strange, but I said why not — She asked me out, I said yes. She ended up rescheduling, no big deal, I’m laid-back. I didn’t push it.. I said whenever we’re both free.. let’s grab a drink. We got together that weekend.. went out for a drink. We went back to my place and had sex for a while. Then grabbed another drink. Came back to my place where I tried to convince her not to drive home drunk at 5am. She eventually sobered up and left. 

We had a great time, we were laughing and enjoying each other‘s company. Spent about 12 hours together that day/night. She went home.. and the next day she came back over and we hung out for a while I was working from home. She had to take a cosmetology exam, and she thought it was the next day, turns out it was that very day so she rushed out to take it. 

The next day she hit me up and we were voice text messaging back-and-forth and then out of nowhere she stopped and ghosted me. I cannot think of a reason as to why she ghosted me. 

I didn’t over pursue. She would send me like five text messages for every one text message I sent. In the four or five days that we were talking, she was calling me constantly. 

I’m just a bit weirded out. Like, I’ve never seen a woman go from hot to cold so quickly. There were a lot of red flags from her. Too much to type lol. 

The day that she ghosted me she hit me up apologizing for falling asleep on me, in a very casual, light hearted way. I eventually responded to one of her messages asking how her test went. Then out of nowhere she unfollowed me on Instagram and never texted back. 

I texted her something like, “I was busy today, couldn’t text, good night.” Thought maybe the voice message wasn’t viewed. Sometimes I don’t view them and they’re erased. It was silly thinking, I know. I thought maybe it was a shit test.. so I waited like six hours. I never double text, and that’s the first time I’ve done that in years. That was two weeks ago, and I haven’t called, texted, nor reached out in anyway. I cut off all contact because I’m not going to chase. I unfollowed her on Instagram, as well. 

Admittedly, I do tend to over think things, and I went over the situation in my head a lot of times, and can’t think of one thing I did to ruin a potential relationship or fling. I know I probably won’t ever get a true answer on what specifically happened, but I figured I’d put it out there and see what people thought of the situation. I’ve moved on, started dating again. But I’m still curious lol.. she was a cool chick. Once a day I think back and I’m still perplexed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcipis/why_did_i_get_ghosted/

I went on one date, but I left early because I was very stressed out and couldn't eat. Growing up with a codependent mother who was first physically and emotionally abused by my father and then remarried to my stepfather who can also be very controlling and verbally abusive, I feel an enormous pressure to not screw up and have a crappy relationship. I am scared of becoming codependent like my mother and in general don't feel like I'm good relationship material. I've been battling with low self-esteem my entire life which is thankfully improving - although very slowly. I literally can't imagine myself being in a relationship and have convinced myself that I won't ever be in one or not until my mid 30s.

She also lives in the same dorm as I do. So sometimes I see her in the elevator with her friends. But this is when the strangest thing happens. 

She never makes eye contact with me and goes super silent and mainly looks in her friends directions and or the floor.

Most other girls I went for have at-least acknowledged me with a hey, eye contact and a smile. 

But she doesn’t even acknowledge me. I might as well have not ever been in the elevator. 

The first time this happened I thought nothing of it and I started talking to her. When she starts talking she doesn’t even  give me the best eye contact. But she is giving me long responses with her own personal input. And when the elevator reaches the floor she bolts out with  friends. This has happened twice now. I’m simply at a loss. 

I have 2 hypotheses. 
1. She is super shy and insecure 
2. She in fact did not find my jokes funny and or our first few interactions as fun and is trying her best to avoid me.

75,qcjxmj,1634792016,Am I being played?,"It’s a long short story… 

At the end of July I (23F) had been planning to move across the country to live with my dad. Also at the time I had recently had a falling out with my two best friends not to my fault. It was a terrible situation.

Cut to me joining Bumble to meet new people and meeting (M23) we’ll call him Joe. I wasn’t expecting anything long-term with me expectantly moving. For the next two weeks me and Joe would hang out very frequently going on dates and the like. My previous relationship ended in February of the same year, we had been dating on and off since high school.

I really enjoy spending time with Joe, more than I expected, and he is a complete gentleman paying for dates without me asking and being very affectionate and overall a kind person. We didn’t kiss until the second or third date I can’t remember. What I do remember is his respect for me and being a seemingly overall great guy.

Unfortunately a death in the family happened as well as the move falling through with my semi-toxic father, for the better. Suffice to say i had a lot going on as well as needing to find new housing. I had a let him know my new situation and after a while there is a period of silence and no contact. 

However since then we’ve been seeing each other very on and off. He would go quiet awhile without texting me and then we’d hang out and everything would being fine. We both work very different schedules, him often working the graveyard shift so I am trying to keep that in mind. We get along great and the chemistry is definitely there, I don’t think I’m making up in my head.

The times when we have hung out it’s always fun. Good conversation and great sexual chemistry. I really like being around him. But the lack of communication is getting to me… 

The last time we hooked up he didn’t text me for more than a few days so I sent him a message detailing how I value communication and if he’s not into to me anymore it’s totally fine, just to lmk and I hope he’s doing well. I only sent this message because previously had been so bad at communication I wanted to make my stance clear that it is something I value more now.

That was probably a week and half ago and I woke up this morning to a text from him…

“I’m sorry, I was going to respond the same day, but I ended up forgetting. I’ve been meaning to text you but every time I see and notice how long it’s been I feel guilty and embarrassed for even not responding. I’m doing alright. I started working out a little at planet fitnesses. I hope you’ve been doing well, I’m going to try to see you Asap.
Hope you’ve been safe too (:”

I feel so lost on what to think about this because it seems like we were getting close and we have hung out quite a few times now, I really do like him I thought he liked me too. 

What I’m most scared of is just being a back up that he only calls when he wants a quickie. But I consider myself a good judge of character and he has been very kind and not love bombing in anyway and not being super distant. I ponder he may just be bad communication. When we’ve hung out it’s never been straight to sex, there’s definitely foreplay (mental/physical) and I really just enjoy spending time together.

I’m looking for some new eyes on this and I would really appreciate any advice anyone has. I don’t really know what to respond to what he said. Thank you!

But it’s been seven years since I last saw him. Over the past year, we reconnected and got talking. So this texting continued for months. I always liked him and hinted at meeting up, but didn’t blatantly ask him out on a date because I already had asked him out twice and it never really went past the first date. Obviously this was seven years ago before we went our separate ways. This time, I thought that if he was interested, he would ask me out. 

Anyway, I hinted at meeting up and flirted with him multiple times. He also hinted at meeting up and seemed quite interested. Our conversations are long and deep and we get quite intimate, although nothing sexual. So months into this back and forth texting, he asks me if I wanted to go to California with him. I was surprised but we had been talking about how we both had been planning to travel to California and how covid had thwarted our plans, so it wasn’t too out of the blue. I tentatively agreed and said maybe we could plan our trip at the same time and meet up with each other there. However, here is where the major problem starts. He basically starts saying that he’s scared of Covid and doesn’t feel comfortable travelling on a plane, or even going outside. He wanted to get a private plane across the border (we live in Canada) and then rent a whole bus to drive us all the way to California. He also says that he won’t leave the hotel and just step out for only a bit once we get to California. He’s not even comfortable going out to eat. 

So obviously this is all so weird to me and I kinda back off in a nice way. He leaves it and we just continue talking like before. But he keeps asking and wanting to make a plan. I keep telling him I’d be okay going with him if we travel by plane. I even suggested he could travel the way he wanted and I could just meet him at the destination. But he wants to make sure we are both socially distanced the whole way and wouldn’t meet me if I have been inside a plane. Every time I try to meet him half way and try to figure out how we could possibly on this vacation, he keeps complicating things. If he’s just messing with me, it doesn’t make sense because he keeps wanting to chat and talk to me.

Very weird. Now I don’t get this guy. What is he trying to do? For details, he’s a bit socially awkward and nerdy and works in IT.

I don’t get this guy. Is he playing me? Is he scared to meet up with me and thinks he needs to use this trip as a hook to keep me interested? Is it a test?

We talked consistently and things were going really well but after a while she started making excuses as to why she couldn’t meet me even though we talked as normal otherwise. She then moved further away for a few months so we stopped talking while that was happening because we weren’t going out officially so I didn’t want to annoy her. She’s back now and things are the same, she keeps telling me she does want to meet up but the excuses as to why she can’t are coming again. I’ve told her on several occasions that if she doesn’t want to it’s absolutely fine and I don’t mind but just be honest with me but she insists she does and it just doesn’t suit but a lot of the time the excuses are very mealy-mouthed.

The most common thing is distance when I’m talking with girls who live far. I do well online but the distance is too far. I have had situations in person though, like this one girl right before the school year started said she liked me and wanted to get to know me more… the week before she got a boyfriend.

The next girl was this girl who said she had a lot of drama with her ex. She said she liked me but I could sense something was off. Turns out she was still fine with her ex and everything, having FaceTime calls with him for hours. How do I know? One of my bestfriends who she was flirting with told me.

The last girl I wanna talk about is this girl I met on Snapchat but she goes to a nearby school. I really liked her and we even agreed to go to her school’s homecoming. I thought things were going well… then she got a boyfriend. Then she asked why I’m not still going with her like I wanna sit there, third wheel while they’re matching and shit.

I'd normally text and just ask if he's keen or not so I can move on, but now I feel awkward about that because he's flagged that he's just ""so busy"", so I feel almost like I'm bothering him and maybe I should just wait the two weeks to see what happens...

I asked damn what y'all talking about and my friend was like nothing don't worry about it. I was planning on smoking with my boyfriend but I felt pretty uninvited so I was like okay well ima look for a lighter and I just went to my room to smoke by myself. I didn't come back to the living room. I just stayed in my room and was cleaning up. While cleaning up, I could hear them talking and laughing. A while later my boyfriend came into my room and was like wyd why u taking so long. I didn't want to start something stupid so I just told him that I just wanted to clean up my room a bit. He asked if I wanted him to chill with him for a bit and I told him nah its okay you can keep talking with my friend. I was trying to act chill but to be honest it bothered me. It made me feel some type of way and I can't stop thinking about it. I just want to know what they were talking about. Idk if it would be a good idea to ask my boyfriend what they were talking about.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcle15/feeling_some_type_of_way/

91,qcly84,1634799829,What age gap is appropriate?,"I 23F have been having good relations/flirty with my coworker 18ish/19M. I feel sick and I hate the idea of dating someone younger, due to trauma. Though I really do enjoy spending time together.

This is based on being assaulted by someone 20+ years my elder. However idk what to think, I’d never pursue anything on my end. I’m just looking to be told that the age gap is too much and i need to grow tf up. 

I would never traditionally date someone so much younger. Just based on what I know about mental maturity before the age of 25. But we vibe so well, and I’m struggling with this crush.

I don’t want anything at the time with my coworker, but for the most part I just feel sick to my stomach. What is wrong with me? The person, the man who assaulted me, was over 20 years my senior, I was 20 years old at the time.

I carry a lot of guilt and shame about the assault. And the thought of dating someone younger just reminds me of it. Whether or not they are mature and interested in me.

Please any advice would be appreciated, I’m struggling because I really like this coworker, but I would rather kill myself then perpetuate any kind of power stance that was put upon me. Thank you and I hope you have a good night.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcly84/what_age_gap_is_appropriate/

94,qcmaog,1634801258,Which of these are red flags early on? (Both late 20s age). I ask this because some are so subtle it’s hard to tell,"1) First date: saying you were cheated on 

2) First date: telling your date how you snuck a girl out of your parents house after a night together 

3) Not admitting to ghosting you for 3 weeks even after being called out when they come back 

4) Asking 3 times in 2 days what my plans are/how my week was but never responding to the same question (over text)

5) initiating meeting up but only when they have no other plans - so they never confirm plans a week in advance - they wait till they’ve confirmed plans with friends 

6) making the other party feel guilty of meeting their friends but in a very subtle way - not directly mentioning it but acting sad they can’t hang out after the movie and acting surprised even though they were aware from before the movie day. Then texting the next day to ask how the party was 

7) constantly on their phone when you meet - like any time they get a text they will reply regardless of an emergency or not 

8) mentioning you have a pretty face as a reason you cannot have possibly have read a big book 

9) they mention they’re “not sure you’d have heard of their profession” even though you’re both educated to the same level and it’s a very normal profession most people would have heard  of",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qcmaog/which_of_these_are_red_flags_early_on_both_late/

As a girl I agree that a guy planning a nice first date shows they’re trying. I would think guys like girls planning a first date because it shows the girl is interest in them too.

What I'm saying I am pretty much useless in the dating world like completely considering how low my qualities are there will always be someone better than me so uh how do I exactly deal with this? Am I doomed to just never be able to date?
