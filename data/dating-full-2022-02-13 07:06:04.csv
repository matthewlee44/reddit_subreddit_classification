It almost turned into a fwb situation but he ended up getting into a relationship with someone else. 
This morning he messaged me that he was planning on breaking up with his GF. He also messaged me after they broke up to lmk how it went. 
She took it pretty hard, was crying and accused him of cheating. He said he felt bad for hurting her. He also said he wants to hang out with me later in the week and I said yes. Am I doing anything wrong? 

——


Back in September this year I met a guy. We went for drinks once. We also hung out 2 more times and just made out and cuddled in my room. I felt like I was kinda pushing him to have sex but he said he wanted to wait a little bit more and get to know each other better. 

At first he seemed super into me and would message me a lot, but eventually I realized I was the one who was always messaging him first. However, he was always happy to talk and kept saying we should hang out again. He said ideally he wants to be friends who also have sex sometimes (even though we never got to that point). And I was okay with that. I felt comfortable with him and enjoyed spending time with him but don’t know if we really have a ton in common.

Eventually I got really busy with school and didn’t talk to him for a month and a half. He never initiated any conversation with me either during this time. But when I had a break from school I decided to message him again. He told me he had been dating someone for a few weeks and so we couldn’t hang out. I was kinda disappointed for maybe an hour but I got over it pretty quick. I told him to lmk if anything changes. 

Now this morning he told me he was going to break up with his gf because he doesn’t have feelings for her anymore. I said I was sorry to hear that and wished him luck. 

He messaged me later and let me know how the breakup went. She took it pretty hard. He wanted to do it in person but was forced to call her. She yelled at him and accused him of cheating. She was pretty hurt and hung up on him after 2 mins. 

I tried to console him about it because he felt really bad. And he asked to hang out with me next week. Is it wrong to hang out with someone so soon after they broke up with someone? Should I be feeling bad about this? I don’t really mind being a rebound for him because I think it would just be for fun and not like I have strong feelings for him.

So there's this girl at work whom I've known for a month or so. I started noticing that she stares at me and when we talk she keeps up this gaze as if she wants me dead lmao but I thought it's pretty normal to maintain eye contact while talking to a person so I didn't give it much thought. A few weeks go by and I started noticing that she looks at me from afar and when I catch her looking she maintains eye contact. This one time she just decided to come to my isle, stare and maintain eye contact for like 5 seconds and just leave. We have to wear masks at all times so it's very hard to figure her out. To point out another thing, she also kinda lurks around to where I would normally be. Another time when I was about to enter my workplace, I kinda bumped into her since I didn't see her walking towards me and we both startled each other. We said hi and all and she checked me out looking top to bottom and just walked away. Getting very mixed vibes from her. We haven't got to know each other that well, just a few convo here and there, basic stuff. I decided to ask her out one day and she kinda shrugged and said she has a bf(her voice spiked and she was a bit louder than usual) and that we could go out as friends.

We didn't have sex but just made out and spoke the entire night. One thing I realized is that he doesn't know how to initiate things. For context, he wanted to kiss me on our first date but gave no clues at ALL. He is an introvert and has a tough time expressing. We met twice after again at his place, didn't have sex, just got drunk and made out and spoke the entire night. I initiated meeting every time because I acknowledged that he has a hard time doing it. But he is a bad texter too and would reply a day or two after I asked him. This made me feel a little bad but I didn't think too much of it. 

He is out of town for awhile and I wanted to maintain contact with him. So we've been texting and I've had a call with him too. Everyone says that in these initial stages one should go all out and not hold back so i asked him if he was free on Valentines Day so we could do something online and he said he wasn't sure and would let me know. He doesn't particularly love V day, he thinks it's a cheesy and doesn't value it it much. Now, looking at his texting patterns. I feel like he isn't gonna text me about this. He is usually aloof to texts. For example when we met the third time, I had to double text him 'hey wanna go out' for him to reply to me. I feel like he isn't gonna text me and idk what to think about it. I know I'm assuming a lot but I just don't know if I should feel mad or empathize with his introvertedness.

I (25M) have been casually dating this girl (22 nearly 23F) for a couple months now. We’ve been on about 6 or 7 dates. Nearly all of them have resulted in me sleeping over at her house after the date, so we’ve been pretty intimate. We’ve also texted pretty much everyday since we started dating too.

She’s overall a nice girl who means well, attractive, got similar humour, shy but still social, has independence which I also like.

However I sometimes feel we’re at different stages of life. She likes to go out and have benders every weekend, and seems to act abit silly when she’s drunk (filming her male friend pissing on the floor in the toilets, licking a water puddle off the concrete floor outside a club). I wasn’t there but she laughingly told me afterwards. This alone was a huge turn off for me.

As off centre as I am and as much as I had a similar stupid phase when I was younger, I’m older now and I’m a lot more settled. I still love to go out, but without sounding arrogant, I sometimes can’t help but want someone abit more settled. 

I told my older sister (28F) my general feelings and she thought I was being harsh and nitty picky and that I should give her a chance. Mates in the past have also joked that my standards are too high.

To give some context I've been suffering from anxiety attacks and depression for almost a year and a few days ago i broke up with my girlfriend who I dated for 4 months.

I was on medication but due to bad side effects i had to come off slowly (about a month ago) and I was having trouble coping with my feelings. My feelings were constantly turning on and off like a light switch. When they're off I didn't want to be anywhere near my girlfriend even if she was trying her best to help. But when they're on I really adored her (more context: she was my best friend in the beginning and we slowly began to like each other). When I was on medication I was more stable, at that time I thought I liked her. She always said ""I love you"" but I couldn't tell wether i loved her or not - and if that's the case then its probably a no regardless of depression or anxiety.

I thought it'd be best to break up so I wouldn't keep messing with her. Even though she was supportive of my decision I feel like there's a huge hole in my chest despite knowing that there were times I couldn't feel a thing for her. After breaking up my anxiety got worse because I couldn't decide wether i did the right thing. She was an amazing person and I know that she's definetly someone id want to learn to fall in love with if i could. But there are times where I don't feel anything towards her. We could go back to being friends but I feel like that'd hurt more and it just wouldn't be the same.

And as I was walking back to close for the night. One of her best friends. As if an angel had descended upon me, asked if I wanted to join them for a casual hang out. Of course I said yes. So we went back to friends house and we played board games.

It was really fun and I did my best to not lock up and I just tried to be myself. I would catch myself looking at her a lot, specifically her eyes, they were just so mesmerizing. She would catch me looking at her and I would instantly look away. Which is like a normal interaction. But what really took me off guard was when she started doing it back at me, I wanna say she was almost embarrassed when I would catch her. Then the cherry on top. She did a small hair flip, exposing her neck, and looking right at me. Now based on a few body language videos I’ve watched, that means she’s interested. And it hit me like a ton of bricks when I got home. 

We didn’t say a word to each other about our date the entire time, we just hung out and laughed at the silly card games we played. I feel like there is something there, and I just had to share. 

We have yet to go on our date, that is on wensday this week. I’m wondering if I should ask her about it, like what she would like to do on the date, if she is still down for it and stuff. Probably right? Idk I’ll for sure update when anything significant happens.

(legal age of consent in my country is 15 years old). 

So we met on snapchat, I was adding random people I was talking to boys my age mostly, we became friends on there in early November of 2021 we weren't talking that much we sent streaks he often commented about how pretty I was and jokingly said things like ""oh I think am going to jail for you"". At that point I wasn't thinking that anything could happen between us. 

We started talking more in December I think and we had started talking every day all day by Christmas. That's when I found out he was living 3 and a half hours away, knowing me I couldnt even imagine what would come next because before I met him and at the beginning of talking to him I thought that for my age even 2 years age gap was enough so 4 years no way and also about long distance relationship I never thought I could handle it.

A week later he asked me to be his gf and he said that he knows it would be hard because distance relationships are hard but he really wants to try with me because he feels a connection he has never felt with anyone before and that he is so deeply in love with me. I didn't gave him an answer right away because I wanted to think about it. He said he understood and he will wait for me as long as it takes and that he will do anything he can to make me happy whatever I decide. 

The following week we talked on the phone all day. One day I remember he was at the internet cafe and a friend of his came and he asked him who he was talking to and he said ""the girl I was talking about"" and his friend said to me ""hi (my name)"", his friend sat next to him the played games and my bf talked me like he talked to me when no one was there. That continued every time he was at the internet Cafe with his friends. So after a week of him continuing making me smile every day, falling asleep while face time, talking to him on the phone everyday. 

I decided to tell him that I was feeling the same way he did and and that I wanted to be his no matter what everyone says. (I always thought about who I wanna be with I didn't wanna be judged but him I had never felt that way ever and it was the first time I really didn't care). 

Now he is waiting to be paid from his job to buy tickets and come see me propably next weekend. I am really in love. Only 2 of my guy best friends know about my relationship and it was hard to tell them because of the age gap. 

I am always worried about if it's real I get jealous a lot. I think about he is playing with my feeling and that he has another girl there but he really has never gave me a reason to suspect anything he is always talking to me on the phone or when he is with his friends through messages or photos. 

I really want people's opinion about the situation. I will try to answer as many questions as I can. I really tried writing everything but I am sure I didn't mention a lot of things.

So I was on the sub reading past posts and I should say that being born a black man is quite a curse on the dating market  . 
"" I am attracted to white men but I don't know how to get their attention "",  ""Do white men like - insert whatever race of women ?"", ""White men on this sub do you like -insert whatever race of women?"" . One of the most liked posts in this sub is about a black woman asking for pieces of advice to flirt with white men . Slow clap👏🏿...

And when there is a post about black man here what I see"" Why black men hit on me ?"", "" I don't like black men"", "" I don't find black men attractive"", "" I would never find black men attractive"", ""Why black men show me interest "" so on and so forth . 

Also the famous "" You like what you like"" or "" People have their preferences "" are sentences said 90% of the time by white persons aka the most desirable person . So they can't picture my problems . I am sure that there are guys that will be annoyed because of this post . I have never seen a white man being rejected in dating for his skin color nor a white woman .

I am a black man . I find all women equally pretty but I am more attracted to mixed race women, eastern european women and Polynesian women( Vaimalama Chaves and Irina Shayk are the most beautiful women that I ever seen . Not even a debate) .

But do these women like me ? Here the kicker, I am not desirable for them . I have never seen a russian woman or an ukrainian woman says"" I like black men but they don't show any  interest"". I have never seen a mixed race woman says "" How do I attract black men ? "" . I will never see a polynesian woman pursuing a black man . 

And please if you are going to say"" I don't date color"" you already fail the vibe check . 

-"" Are you an xbox fan ?""
-"" I mean yeah. I play all consoles"" 

That's how this answer sounds to me . I have never seen these  women actively chasing men who looks like me .

We went on 2 dates and were amazingly comfortable with each other right from date 1. On date 2 we already planned many other following dates. Climax, I got drunk black out on 2nd date and insulted him publicly. He blocked me, asked me to move and said its not going to go any further. 
After 2 weeks of apologising and giving him time. Yesterday I sent him money to share the previous date’s bill. I just wanted to move on finally. He messaged me and said that the money wasnt required blah blah and enjoy your weekend. I told him I wanted to talk to him for 5 mins because I had blanked out that night so wanted to know what triggered my behaviour because we were both very happy before that. He called me last night and we spoke only for 5 mins, he said I didnt need to apologise, shit happens sometimes and its okay. When I asked him did anything trigger my aggressive behaviour, he said he didnt want to narrate and talk about any of it but asked me to just forget about it.
He has unblocked me on WhatsApp after 2 weeks, this gives me a bit of hope. 
Should I ask him casually out after a few days, should I wait for him to may be text me or should I just move on? I genuinely like him and can do anything to convince him to give me another chance?

PS - I have already reflected upon my behaviour and I know it was shitty. I was reckless. But we are all humans and we all make mistakes sometimes and sometimes they are terrible.

I approached him and asked him for his insta. We've had a wine in this restaurant and talked and already at that time I felt like he is a different personality than I am. He was very phlegmatic and kinda talked to me like I was one of his dudes. But it was also kinda fun and in general I had quite a good time with him. 

Last night we agreed to see a movie at his place together. We were watching a horror and already during that he was snuggling up to me. And without consent he started slightly and carefully touching my butt and my boobs and I stopped him for few times of course but at the same time it was very nice to feel someones touch on my body and being caressed and kissed on the neck and he is also super hot and strong and very good looking - dark hair, deep and also kind dark eyes, muscular, exactly my type.

I took a shower and when I came back to bed only wearnig panties and his T-shirt (wasn't actually planning to sleep over but wished for it but I didn't want to look like I'm counting on it), he grabbed my butt and started moaning and saying dirty things and I liked the feeling of having my butt held (so I kinda pushed my booty onto his hard D) but didn't like the vibes I got from him: no questions if I would be okay with that, immediate dirty notes, kinda agressive, didn't ask me for my consent. 

I let him go down on me and it was very nice, I was so turned on by the view of his beautiful face in between my legs and he was kinda skilled as well. After that he said he's gonna fu\*k me now. I said no. He asked me why. And I said that when I have sex with someone, I get attached to that person, no matter if I want to or not. So I want to avoid that. We didn't have sex then. But he started to fu\*k me with his fingers and in the beggining it felt good but in a minute he started to be harsh on me. 

I stopped him and we had this conversation, when I told him how I feel and also mentioned that I'm sensing a lack of respect and that I felt used and kinda ra\*ed and that I'm really not looking for FWB, because it never brought me anything good in the past. He apologized and told me that I have to tell him whenever he does something I don't like. And he kept saying that he's sorry. I said that I need him to be nice to me and hug me and say nice things and take care of me and to realize that I'm a fragile creature. And he seemed to understand. I fell asleep then. In the morning he ate me out again and I gave him a BJ. But even though we've discussed things that bothered me and he seemed to understand I still have this weird feeling about him and get unexplainable vibes, which I had when I was in a toxic relationship.

During the mentioned conversation he said that he's not looking for a one-night-stand but also doesn't want to force a relationship. That it needs to develop naturally and result from the situation itself.

And my questions are:

1) Is it a good idea to keep seeing him when I don't feel good myself around him?

2) Did I fu\*k something up by letting him give me a head and gave him mine? I feel like even though there was no penetration I already got attached to him... Which incredibly pi\*ses me off. But I feel like it's too late already.. And that I'm trapped.

We bantered as I drove. I popped a statement before I dropped her off ""I would like see you again"".  She was using the playful tone and said ""I don't wanna see you again"" smiled and giggled and said goodbye.
I told her to text me when she was home at night. She waved to me sweetly as I pulled away from the driveway.

An hour later a message popped in ""I'm really happy to meet you today! Drive safe in the rain, see you again :)""

At night, she texted to say she was back home. We exchanged a few messages. The next morning, I texted her to make dinner plans to meet on Wednesday night. 9 hours later, I'm still left on unread.

I recently spoke with a befriended girl about dating and relationships. For a while she broke up with a dude, who did not care very much about her but was very clingy and won't let her do things alone. Not much later (1 or 2 month after the breakup and with 2 weeks dating) she found her current BF. I asked her how can she now that he's a good BF without knowing him? Her answer was, that she doesn't know it and that this doesn't matter at all to her. She also knows that he is not her SO and that she won't be with him for a long time. She said that for now he gives her what she wants and this is good for now. 

I never thought about it that way, but after I broke up with my ex, I started dating again and found a women who I really like, but has some side-effects (I don't  want to call them red-flags because I don't know right now if they are or not), I'm struggling with. I call myself as an overthinker and I try to do it that way. But I'm afraid I can't live with some of those side-effects (I'm not sure about that though).

And here comes the point why I'm thinking about this: I'm also a person who don't want to be alone anymore. My biggest wish is a relationship. And because of I don't have much dates and dating itself doesn't went well till now, I start to think about that. 

Maybe sometimes it is fine to just have someone, that fulfills your current wishes. My wish for now is a relationship so maybe it could be a valid way to just start a relationship and ignore some of those pain-points until it's not working anymore. 

I know this could (or moreover it will) result in some dramas, that let me feel like shit, but to be Single it also feels like that, and so you'll have at least some lucky hours.

I'm on bumble and it's not been going well. For at least the last 2 months I've been on it. 1 match with one conversation that fizzled out. 

But I met this girl at work this week, she's a customer. Late thirties Asian devorced twice with a child. We had the most thought provoking, in depth, intellectual conversation I've ever had with a woman. We talked about macro economics, stocks, crypto, generational wealth, and managing money in general. She talked about quantum theory and actually carried the conversation multiple times. 

I've never had a woman reciprocate that much in a conversation and her superior ntelligence was such a turn on. Mainly because I've never had a partner to challenge my intellectual questioning. I've literally never been turned on by understanding someone else's brain and I feel strange.

She's cute, a bit thicc in the lower end for me, with a beautiful golden retriever puppy. And I love Golden's especially blonde ones. And that exactly what she has. We talked about it's health and needing to be top noch because she wanted to breed her.

I'm a Nutritional Consultant in a Vet Hospital.

Now I guess I need to say women because I'd not like to have girl be taken offensively. Because I've seen that post.

I quickly found out she's a bit ,well to put it nicely, quirky. She said she adopted a stray dog and we talked about feeding it and basically said she only wants to do the minimum because ""if that dog died she would  skin it and make it into a purse"".😬😱😂

I have a tendency to overthink and it's ruined this really great situation with this guy.


Anyway, I ended things because I thought he was also seeing his friend and/or others. Mostly because:
- He mentioned that he drove down to see her for NYE/NY 
(but that they went to do x and x as a group of friends) 
- Talked about her a lot
- Showed me a video of them two together
- Posted a picture of him with her and her best friend on Instagram and removed all other photos 
- He asked me before NY if I had any plans and if I liked Strawberry Farms he then told me he had gone to the strawberry farm with her
- I noticed that he would get notifications from girls and then would go to the bathroom to reply to them 

So, I messaged her to let her know. And it turned out that she had a boyfriend which he informed and that he wasn't interested in her at all. 

It was a pretty shit move on my part and incredibly immature and I just wish I could grow out of being immature and doing stunts like this. 

I understand that we weren't exclusive and that it's fine to keep his options open, but I felt like I was spending too much time with someone who wanted something casual. 

He told me he updated his Tinder song (to an overlty sexual one) as ""I am open to meeting new people."" which is fine but that hurt, as I was only asking about his intentions because his Tinder anthem was sexually explicit and the only lyrics pretty much are: ""Am I inside you? Tell me if it feels good."" repeatedly.  He then went on about how he was celibate and did a lot of hooking up in high school and only hooked up with his last girlfriend (???). He asked if I was seeing other guys as well, and if I had ever hooked up. 

And when I said that it seemed like he was interested in his friend, he replied ""Hahaha which friend are you talking about?"" And that made me more insecure. Afterward we had another talk and said that he wanted to meet new people then and that he hadnt seen anyone else after. 

He then said that he had deleted his profile right after he had met me, which was false because he showed me my own Tinder profile on our 2nd date, and then clarified that he had meant that he deleted it some time after he met me. 

Like I guess he had said those things in the rush of the moment and meant that he had deleted his Tinder recently and that he wasn't ready to go exclusive yet. 

I thought we had a really great time, and we always spent the whole day together when we went on the two dates. He didn't really push my boundaries and always offered to pay for my meals, although I was entirely confused and felt incredibly insecure the whole time.

We had a first coffee date that left me pretty excited, I thought he was pretty cute. No physical contact, which is good for me. I felt physical attraction. Second date was at a bar. Again, no contact, not even handholding. This time I felt disappointed. After the date he texted me and said he was really into me (used the word Limerence) and asked if I felt the same. I was honest and said no, probably due to the fact we hadn't even touched and physical touch is very important to me. He said it's also important to him and he would make sure to touch me more in the next date.

Third date was at a museum. We held hands a lot and we hugged a lot too. At one point we laid down on a bean bag and just talked and held hands. He kissed my hands and stroked my hair... but didn't try to kiss me.

Now I'm not sure I like this guy. He's great, seems like the perfect match for me because we have so many interests in common and he's super sweet. But I haven't felt the spark I felt on the first date. Should I go out with him again and see if I feel a spark again, maybe if he'll be more forward? I'm so frustrated because he seems to be a great match for me and a great person, but he's perhaps too eager to please me, leaving me no opportunity to try to please him; when we agree I legit don't know if he's being genuine or if he's pretending to please me. He's not as bold and as forward as I'd like, which doesn't make me feel desired. Lastly, him revealing he feels limerence put pressure on me to like him back in the same way and although I'm looking for something serious, I don't like to feel pressured.

I assumed that was 99% a no, but I thought what the hell let’s go for it.

I definitely think she likes me. In the times since then when we’ve been at work together, she’s been smilier around me, laughs at all my bad jokes, and seems overall very interested in my conversations. I also notice her staring at me when I’m not looking all the time. 

However, I am confused about a couple things. Whenever I text her, she takes 3-5 hrs to respond, and she never initiates. Why is this? Also, why would she say maybe when I first asked her out? That is almost always a no, but ultimately it was a yes instead.

So I have recently been seeing this guy for the past month. He's the first guy I've really liked in 3 years that isn't just physical. We've gone out on 3 dates and he invited me over to his.

 We are always super giggly and talkative in person, so it seems in that way he might like me. However, on our second date he did tell me he's not looking for a relationship, so i mentally pulled back and then later that night he kissed me and told me he thinks I'm very cool. 

I am holding out on sex for a few more days cuz I'm treating PID.

I gave him head when I went over to his that he said 'was up there' with the best. (just for context)

He's the one who initiated most of the communication in the beginning, he'd text a couple of times a day and we used to have really interesting conversations.

Nowadays, it's kind of him sending me a vn once a day, and I've noticed that it's been hard for me to match his energy. He's also kind of put off seeing me/hasn't really initiated us meeting up again. It could be after I told him I couldn't have sex right then. 

I guess I'm just lonely and intellectually we are a match, which is so hard for me to find. 

Should I just stop seeing him before I sleep with him /catch feelings?

In the past, I was open to ONS and dated liberally, but usually 1 at a time and never cheated. I have been in casual relationships, but never tried actual polyamory.

I met both women one week apart, at the same party (pretty much). They know each other, i think, but are not close. I won't use real names, but let's call them Fleur (25, French, petite, introverted) and Sandra (23, Spanish, tall, extroverted). They are studying here in London for 9 months, then who knows.   
They both approached me at the party and I spoke with each one for over an hour (not simultaneously). I feel a romantic connection with both women, and I'm keen to get to know them better. I would like to be able to be close with both women, but I understand this may represent some problems long-term. 

I have been on first dates with both:  
My date with Fleur was cute, I took her out for some curry and then we froze our asses off snuggling on a bench at Trafalgar Sq. Lots of comfortable silences, as we were both hungover. I told her I had met someone else at the party, and I was planning on a date. She said, ""I don't mean to be rude, but I don't really care what you do"". 

My date with Sandra was fun, I took her out for some beers at an Italian cafe and we walked for an hour back to hers for more beer and conversation. I also told her I was currently dating another girl from the same course as her. She thanked me for being honest, and said she is not necessarily looking to jump into a long relationship. She said she is not into ONS, and as long as there is a real connection and she feels her boundaries are being respected, she is very chill. I got a goodbye smooch at the door.

Both ladies are 3-6 months out of long-term relationships which lasted years. They are both super classy, cultured, feisty and sweet: GF-material for sure. I am in regular contact with both and planning our next dates. 

Given what has been said, I feel like I've handled things ok for now. I've not come on too fast either, as I'm happy to build a stronger connection and some sexual tension before progressing things physically. However, I am aware that dating-rules in France and Spain are different to US/UK customs. Here, you can bang whoever you like before you have an official conversation about exclusivity. But in those countries, a kiss may mean you're already in the beginning of a relationship, and certainly you shouldn't be sleeping with other women (unless you have a specific arrangement). 

I know both women have \*technically\* signed off on me dating other girls, but I can't help but feel things are headed for disaster if things continue like this. If I end up sleeping with both women for instance, I can't imagine they'll be happy. 

My plan is to continue dating both and see how I feel about them. I want to continue being straight up with them, but at the same time, I don't want to be shoving their faces in the fact that I'm seeing other people.

We've only been on a couple of dates before and for the last one we both agreed for a coffee. 

 We met up at a coffee shop, grabbed ourselves some drinks and started to stroll around the area around it. It was all fun and chill so we entered a park and sat on a bench. I have to admit that the area we were hanging out in doesn't have the best reputation for being safe but I thought there'd be plenty of people walking in the park, just like during any other evening. 

 Nope. The entire park felt empty and no one passed near us for like 10 minutes since we'd sat on that bench. So I suggest that we get out of the park and near the exit 2 (probably) homeless men blocked our way and started threatening us. The guy confronted them but they just wouldn't back off so he pulled out a little kitchen knife and only then they ran away. I was so shocked by what had happened that I was at al loss for words. He then started to profusely apologize saying he was carrying the knife only for self-defence and that he didn't want to tell me from the beginning so that I didn't immediately freak out. 

 Needless to say our date ended there and I haven't spoken to him since (it's been 2 days). I'm still so confused but I don't really know if I should stop seeing him. I feel like he also had the knife with him during the first 2 dates and I was in danger all that time. But still he protected us against those 2 men. What should I do?

Talking about life and also stuff we're interested in. It was chilly so, no physical contact or anything, but good nonetheless.

I(F21) am a polyamorous bisexual person, in a committed 5 year long relationship with a monogamous (M21) straight guy. 

We have been open and he has been accepting of my sexuality and my discovery of it, which has led to discussions of poly relationships (that include me with another female) and etc. However, I am a typical 50/50 bisexual, and even though my past crushes have been female, I can't guarantee my future interests' gender-

But that's beside the point.

In essence, I don't want to hurt my boyfriend by continually asking him about this- it is who I am but my priority is staying with him as I do believe he is my soulmate. I would also like to experience a poly relationship, however.

In that vein, what is the extent to which I can bring this topic up to him? From what I've seen, people get really hurt when this is suggested, so I would like to get opinions from as many people (and from as varied a source) as I can.
