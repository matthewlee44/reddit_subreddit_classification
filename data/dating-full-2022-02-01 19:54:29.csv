I’ve been on the dating app “Hinge” for a few months now and I started talking to this guy about 2 weeks ago. 

He’s in law enforcement and seems to be very proud of it, which is fine. He’s made some interesting comments to me over the last 2 weeks: 

1. He made it a point to tell me his ex was lazy/wouldn’t put in a joint effort when planning dates, etc. He said she would tell him “you’re the guy, you pick.” He said he became distant because of it. Normally I wouldn’t think this was too weird but he followed it up by stating “50/50 is the rule.” I found this to be a bit forward considering we have never met. 

2. He felt comfortable enough to tell me he’s more or less against abortion. 

3. He sent me a picture of an award he got at work acting as if he received it that day, but I noticed it was dated 6 months ago. 

4. He asked me to check a law enforcement Instagram account (it has about 100k followers) because his picture was on there (he doesn’t have instagram.. or so he says) and he sent me a screenshot of the actual page name FROM Instagram but cropped to just the account name. I asked him why he has a screenshot from IG but not the picture? He said his friends told him to look. I felt he just wanted to brag about being on a “larger” Instagram account. It was just odd to me. 

5. He also never asked where I live or what I do for work. I find this weird.

I had a really strong connection with him, so we decided to move in together after 5 months.  He sold me an idea of who he was. Now that we’re living together, things have went downhill drastically. 

He is currently not working (his work is weather dependent) but should be returning in the next week or two. Since we moved in, he’s been at home. I work full-time. He stays up late (keeping me up) then wakes up in the afternoon the next day.

He is REALLY sensitive. I can’t ask him to do something around the house without him getting defensive and upset, saying I’m stressing him out. I really try to be understanding and I don’t nag him but it’s really starting to irritate me. I come home after working all day and nothing has moved in the house, the bed hasn’t even been made. I end up cleaning the house every week and he barely contributes. He sees me cleaning on my days off and I’ll find him sitting down on his phone. One weekend, I said I needed to clean the bathroom. He said to leave it for him to clean it during the week. The whole week goes by and he doesn’t clean it, so I end up doing it after work.

I’ll come home from work and he’ll go to the gym. I get annoyed because he had all day to go to the gym. 

He really nitpicks everything I do, to the point that I don’t trust myself to do anything. It shatters my confidence. I told him it was upsetting me and he apologized. A few weeks later he gets upset for no reason and says I always nitpick him. I apologized if I was making him feel that way and asked for an example in case I didn’t know I was doing it. I knew I hadn’t been as I had been biting my tongue. He couldn’t come up with one example. I feel like he just said that so I was the bad guy instead of him. He completely flipped it.

He also exaggerates when he’s hurt. I think he’s just doing it for attention. I actually caught him doing it. He sprayed a water bottle at me and some went in his eye. I pretended there was vinegar in it and he started freaking out and washing his eyes and saying they stung. I told him it was just water and he continued to pretend he was in pain. I’m finding it hard to empathize with him because of this behaviour. 

I feel like I’m with a child who needs attention and doesn’t understand what living alone or a relationship takes. Is there any hope of resolving this? Should I wait till he’s working again in case he’s depressed? I don’t want to just give up but it seems there’s so many issues already.

My boyfriend and I were talking about political and social issues the other day and somehow we got into the topic of sexual assault and he said something extremely concerning. Basically, he said that a r*pe victim is also to blame, along with the actual r*pist. He said he thinks the r*pist is more in the blame, but that the victim should have done more to get away. I told him that some people get scared and know they're unable to fight them off. He said that it doesn't matter and they should do everything in their power, whether it be biting their ear off or anything. I asked him how he expects a 13 year old girl to fight off a grown man and he said she should still try and if she doesn't then she's partially to blame. He even said that he told his ex girlfriend it was her fault that her older brother assaulted her because she should have tried to fight him off.

I almost left him over this, but he said that I would be leaving him just for having an opinion and that it was unfair. 

He's usually so sweet and perfect. I'm not sure what to make of this at all. Is this worth leaving him over?

just a little background info. I’m friends with this girl and she was with her  friend and her friend said i was cute and to add her on snap. i already did, and told her that and then the next day she started texting me. fast forward two months and we hung out for the first time, then she asks me to hangout again. we hung out everyday last week, and last friday we both agreed that we had so much fun that day. when we were hanging out we talked about how there was a rumor of us dating going around the school, and she said she didn’t know why people are so invested in our “relationship”. we never really talked about dating but have called each other cute and flirted a little. i wanna ask her to by my gf but recently i feel like things have changed or i might just be overthinking. we were supposed to hangout yesterday but something popped up and she wasn’t feeling good so we moved it to today. today she tells me that she is tired and overwhelmed but I can go over to her house today instead. I’m getting mixed signals, i was gonna ask her to be my gf tomorrow because she was talking about how she likes that it’s gonna be 2/2/22, but i’m not sure . 

when we hangout she’s touchy, we share our drinks and food (but i feel like  most girls do that) and we go on each other phones. We have never kissed but we were close to, and she called me cute today but doesn’t wanna hangout till later tonight so i’m just confused.

Me and her are good friends. We don't talk regularly (about 1x per week in text and see each other about 1x per month) We met through work (not working together anymore) and became friends. When we meet up we go to parties and hang out with her friends or some of old colleagues. The thing is that i really like her, so much so that i can't even sleep. There are some signs that she likes me like: 
Giving me the ""looks"" (cant explain it but the way you look at someone when you like them)
Playing with her hair around me
Breaking the touch barrier and also 1 time she grabbed my hand in a drunken state  to lead me to a club.
There are also some red flags like when we are in a middle of conversing she just randomly stops replying. And also telling me about a guy shes crushing over
And she really rarely initiates a convo
I have devised a strategy to win her: I invited to celebrate our friendship at valentines day (she immediately accepted without asking what we were going to do) but the celebration will be postponed because something came up (she warned me that it may ruin our plans but this ""something"" is not a bad thing or is definitely not a red flag). She told me that she will let me know when will be her next free weekend and now i'm waiting. The plan is to do really fun activities together and at the end of the day give her a gift i know she will really love. After the gift i will ask her out on a actual date and see her response.


So heres my question(s)
Go for the kill: tell her right away that i like her and potentially kill any chances of being her boyfriend and get over my feelings so i can move on?

Play it slow(plan A): wait it out until she reveals her free weekend and go with my plan, which im sure has a 25% chance of working (the problem is the ""wait"" part is really disturbing me because of my undying love and the fact that we rarely speak)

I suggested a date over the weekend, but she said she would not be in the city and proposed to meet on this Friday (sounds good to me). Since it was late and we were both sleepy, I asked for her number, which she gave very quickly, and we subsequently exchanged a good-night text.

She texted me the next afternoon, asking how was my day (positive!!!). We talked a bit and continued our conversation into last Friday, when she stopped replying to my last message (ghosted???). She texted me again this Monday and asked me if we would postpone our dates to the spring because it was too cold outside (lolll). I took that as an implicit way of expressing her disinterest in me, so I responded with something like ""i understand it ... I barely left my apartment last weekend"" and was ready to move on. However, she replied again and kinda carried the conversation.

I’m
24F and I’ve had a couple of very bad relationships when I was younger but have been single for 3 years. I tend to like a guy who makes the first move and someone who is confident. FYI I’m still at uni (a longer course) and I know that some guys from uni have like me in the past (I heard from
Friends) but they have never come
Up to me- either way they’re not guys I would be interested in. I just get upset because im at the stage where I do want a serious relationship and I do want to fall in love but nothing ever works out (not even close). The last guy I was going out with was for a few months and he was semi-ok (better than what I’ve had but no where near what I deserve) and it fizzled because he didn’t wanna commit. 

I just feel like good guys never go for me, which I can’t understand because I’m
Smart, successful, kind, well-balanced, bubbly, attractive, well-dressed and have a fit body because I workout 4-5 times a week. It’s just a bit frustrating because every guy I have ever been with just wasnt anywhere near good enough, not that I’m picky but genuinely they were low calibre (not treating me well, cheating, never having time for me, manipulative etc).


I have hope that I will find someone amazing one day, it’s just annoying. 

This weekend I went to a friends birthday party and his friend was there (who I know from mutual friends). He’s tall, dark, (very) handsome and intelligent. We had a lovely
Time at the party and talked and danced together. We are both going to another party in 10 days where he is going to be there. I do like him and want to get to know him more. I tried to hug him after dancing but it’s like he was taken back and didn’t reciprocate. I don’t really know what this means, he was also dancing salsa with other girls so idk if the dancing meant anything (although he danced with me the most). He also asked me if I wan single and told me that he’s been single from a long term relationship for over a year now. 

He is a low-key guy and doesn’t have social media and I don’t have his number. I don’t know what to do at the party to show him or let him know that I want to get to know him and that I am interested in him, even to meet for a coffee. I usually prefer the guy to make a move but not sure how to go about this or if he is even interested at all. 


I’ve had this feeling for a long time that good guys/guys I like who wanna be serious and commit just don’t go for me and idk why. The women in my life tell me that’s because guys know that they can’t mess about with me or that I’m out of their league but honestly at this point I don’t really get anything apart from drunken ONS with very very average Joes and dysfunctional penis

First date resulted in a depressing hookup. We went and got ice cream and things started out nice, but it quickly became clear that we had very little in common so she just invited me over to her place. I was attracted to her but there was an extremely minimal spark between us and as a result the hookup felt lifeless. I left her place at 1 AM and we haven’t spoken since.

Second date was an early morning coffee date. I actually felt some really nice chemistry with this person and we ended up sitting in her car for about an hour after the coffee just trading music. She even offered to drive me home and we planned a second date at a record store. The next day she completely ghosts me and I’m left confused and a bit depressed.

Third date was another coffee date, this time in the evening. This girl was very sweet and kind, but was clearly very nervous. She told me her friends made her bumble account for her on a whim, and that this was her first online date, and it definitely showed. We still had a really nice time as she toured me around her campus and the surrounding college town, but by the end of the date she seemed to be getting progressively more anxious and I didn’t want to risk extending the date for my sake, so I drove her home.

This has been by far the most dates I’ve been on in such a short period of time. I’ve only recently gotten back into the online dating sphere, but a couple years ago when I was used to an average of 1 date every 3–5 months or so.

I’m bummed none of these dates have really resulted in something special, especially after the second one where I got ghosted, but what’s your input?

I was really obsessed with her and not gonna lie, I was really pushy and that definitely turned her off and so I got absolutely no where.
So then I figured okay maybe she’s not for me and I sent her a text one day telling her my apologies and stuff and she definitely highly appreciated it.
So then when Covid hit, I tried worrying about other things and such and was overall just trying to get through the pandemic.
And then when I entered my senior year of high school, I definitely tried asking out some other girls and some were interested(but the downside is that they already had a boyfriend) and some were just not interested at all.
Heck, at my graduation party a girl even tried flirting with me(I Atleast think) and I never made the move in which I totally regretted haha.
But yeah, anyways at some point I even tried asking that junior year crush of mine for advice and she seemed pretty chill during the convo.
I even asked her how she was doing and um yeah.

And with all of that out of the way, I still haven’t quite dated anyone yet and actually tried to just worry about myself lately.
But yeah I’ve already graduated and have have quite the schedule.
So anyways I’m just wondering, would it be a bad idea if a 19 year old dated a 16 or 17 year old? because I kind of want to try again with this girl but at the same time I also don’t want to end up on the list of sex offenders.
I guess as long as I leave sex out of the relationship and also as long as we don’t get TOO romantic I might be fine.
But still though.

I'm a bit old school in my views, and for me personally, I (male) tend not to have close female friends. I have close male friends whom I catch up with regularly, I have female colleagues which I am friendly with and chat to while at work often - but for me personally, at 5pm when I go home, thats where it ends for me.  


Now, my girlfriend of about 4 months, seems to have a lot of male friends, and I wanted to know what would be considered normal boundaries for this. What would be considered okay to take place, and what would be considered something I should say ""hey, that, that's not okay"".  


Some examples:  


My girlfriend caught up with her ex housemate for coffee and a meal one night, she sent me a photo of them catching up and I asked who it was. The ex housemate was leaving the city and the ex housemates SO wasn't feeling well so she couldn't couldn't make it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend works away from the city a couple weeks a month, the rest of the time she works in our city. When she is rostered in the other town, she is also rostered on with barry, whom she also works with when she is in our city. When she is away from work, My gf and barry work together, and occasionally they see each other at the gym after work, and occasionally they grab a bite to eat.  They are both away from home for the purpose of work.  


Girlfriend caught up with some old university friends on the weekend. She sends me a snap chat of a lad (lets call him alan) inside her appartment. I ask who's that lol? She says ""that's alan, one of the uni friends I caught up for dinner with tonight, he wanted to to check out my new apartment'. My gf just moved into this place recently, and alan lives about 5 mins down the road.  


My girlfriend has a guy friend she regards as her best guy fried. they have been friends for many many years. He lives in another state. recently he came to our city to visit family. My girlfriend and this guy caught up together for a few hours to catch up. I got the sense that this is someone who she finds important, so wanting to appear enthusiastic about her friends, I suggested we do something together when he comes to town - My gf suggested that guyfriend might not be comfortable hanging out if I am there, as he is a shy kinda guy.   


I used to walk the dog that I shared with my ex girlfriend a couple of times a week. My girlfriend said that she wasn't comfortable with me visiting my ex gf to walk the dog. I understood how she felt, and how it would seem, and as such I no longer do it.  She brought up something she wasn't comfortable, established that this was a boundary for her, and we got on with life.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to do the same with my girlfriend, but I want to know what are acceptable things to ask for.  


My girlfriend caught up with a female friend from highschool, I got to meet her. a lot of things were discusse that day but one thing that stuck out, was her female friend (who has a boyfriend) mentioned that she also has a lot of male friends, and that her partner is aware of it, okay with it, and knows that she sometimes hangs out in their bed's and it's no big deal because she's never done anything wrong.  
That to me was really odd, and I would find that totally unacceptable in a relationship. I would never hang out with another girl in my house or her house alone, let alone in the bed! It's one thing to trust your partner isn't fucking the boys in the bed, but I think ultimately you have no way of knowing, so I'd expect to be able to trust my partner isn't getting into other peoples bedrooms in the first place. lol

How do I have a conversation about this with my girlfriend and establish where her personal boundaries are with her male friends.  I'm okay with her having male friends, just need to know where she draws her lines, and what I should be considering acceptable lines.  


I trust her, and I dont want to be controlling, I like the fact that she has a healthy social life and I am fine with the fact that she has friends of the opposite sex. I am secure in the sense that, these guys were in her 'orbit' prior to meeting her, and yet she has chosen to be with me - so i dont feel worried about them, as if they were people she'd want to be with, she'd be with them.

&amp;#x200B;

I know my personal stance of where I draw my line, might not be fair to impose on her. I personally do not entertain friendships with women. I am friendly, but not friends. As I am honest with myself and know that I'd try to have sex with them.  


My lines:

\- my female friends do not hang out in my bed

\- my female friends don't come over to my house alone, and likewise, I don't hang out at their place one on one

\- I wouldn't go for coffee with a female friend alone. If it was for a work thing, I'd let my partner know beforehand, lest I get spotted and someone has the wrong idea.

This really hurt my feelings, and this is why I don't feel super confident going into relationships or friendships, because if anything goes wrong it absolutely destroys me. I went on 3 dates with this guy and we spent a lot of time together on each one, like just talking. We would sit and talk for hours about stuff, like books and movies and philosophy and politics and music etc and we went to art exhibitions together. I was pleasantly surprised that we had a lot in common and we seemed a good fit for each other, but he was always pretty bad at texting. The last time we met was over a month ago, and we had been making arrangements to meet again when he suddenly ghosted me and hasn't texted me back at all. He hasn't even looked at my message. He liked my latest instagram post so I know that he is on the internet and it makes me wonder why he would do this. It's not like I am dying of heartbreak over him or whatever but what upsets me more is the idea that I have done something wrong to put him off and I can't help but feel really insecure and upset about it. 

I have never been in a relationship (I'm 19 and went to a girls school where I was pretty nerdy) and I don't know if I'm doing things right. I am frustrated because I just want to be appreciated, and I wanted him to feel that way too. I worry that maybe I put him off by being too domineering about intellectual topics and in all honesty I hate to admit this but almost every guy I have talked to that has stopped talking to me did so after they tried to teach me something and I proved myself to be on their level intellectually, not in a rude way or a one-upping way either. I just say 'oh yeah I know what you're talking about' and maybe expand or share my opinion. It just seems like guys are put off by that and I don't know why. Please don't reply to this saying I'm blowing my own trumpet because I'm not. This really is what it's like for me. I keep thinking maybe I'm just not cool enough or esoteric enough for him, or fashionable enough or whatever. Maybe he wants someone that does fucking hard drugs and lsd like him and not someone who is a loser nerd or whatever. I don't know. I just want to at least get an idea of what I did wrong. I was open about the fact that I have had mental health issues, ive been sectioned and been in treatment (eating disorder), and was still in more regular treatment when I met him, but that never seemed to interfere with our relationship. I am also not like super underweight either and was almost fully recovered when I did meet him.

I think as a high achieving woman there is a lot of pressure on me to be perfect, and it fills me with a horrible uneasiness thinking there's something wrong with me that he knows about that I don't. I just can't wrap my head around it. It honestly isn't his fault that I feel so bad about myself as a result, and I also feel bad for being so fragile about this since I thought I had become so strong after everything ive been through, but I guess not. It's my worst nightmare that I might have hurt him or made him feel bad in some way.

Every time I see him we’re at his house and we’re usually having sex… a lot of it. 

He told me he loves me and I have some love for him too but I don’t see myself pursuing a relationship with him because in my opinion we’re not compatible. We have very few of the same interest, different hobbies, he’s an extrovert i’m an introvert, etc. 

He’s tried taking me on dates before but i subtly declined because i just don’t want do that with him. He’s gotten me roses. He tells me things like “i’m so excited about the future and all the experiences we’re gonna have.” But on multiple occasions i’ve told him i’m not ready to commit to anything but he never seems to hear me. It seems like he just cares about where he wants this to go. 

He always tears up when he talks about how much he cares for me and how much he likes me. So this makes me incredibly scared to tell him that I don’t want a relationship with him. 

He’s a great guy and treats me with so much respect and love and i could totally see why someone would want to date him, just not me.

I honestly have no idea what to do, i’m conflicted to the point where i am thinking maybe i’m the one in the wrong and i’m just not used to this so i don’t know how to act.

I like him too!'. The dude was like 'yess!!!' And they were all cheering/laughing lol although I was laughing along with them.

For some background, I am a 19 year old university student and I’m going back on campus in a few days (as in-person classes are starting soon). I am 5’11, fit (I lost a bunch of weight), good build, and fairly good looking (most people tell me im very good looking but I think I’m decent). 

Anyway, this term I plan on going out more to parties and clubs to meet new people. I’m dying to have physical contact with a girl, I still haven’t experienced anything of the sort. My problem is, I don’t know how to take it past the talking stage. I have several friends who are girls and I’m comfortable conversing with girls at parties but it never goes past that, probably because I’m too scared to make a move in case they don’t feel the same way. 

I’m also not good at telling when a girl is flirting with me (one morning after a party when I had sobered up I realized a very cute girl was trying to hit on me and I was just being friendly back). 

My question is, how does one initiate the first touch? Do you just say “do you want to kiss”? Or is it more than that?

I can speak with confidence, I just don’t know the right way to word things sometimes. I’m also very avid on being respectful and not crossing any lines so I don’t want to kiss a girl without knowing full well she wants me to.

It doesn't hurt (maybe my ego) to just ask this person out again, but I guess I'll share anyway...

Me: 27F
Him: 35M

I had a first date with someone a few nights ago. We met off Hinge and chatted via app/text with most of our chatting being in the beginning of the week and tapering off by the end (since we were going on a date anyway). Had a few scheduling conflicts, but we ended up finding the right window of time and met up at a bar last weekend. We had about a 2-3 hour conversation about varying topics (from what we were working on, to exes and dating, to crypto and random stuff scattered in between) and I felt like it was fun and engaging. We had a good flow and vibed well. Near the end of the night I decided to check in with him to ask if he was having a good time and he responded with: ""I'm having a *great* time."" (non-sarcastically, I hope). 

Something shifted and I can't remember too well how topics changed, but it got a bit sexual. He asked if I wanted to go back to his place and I told him: ""I don't do one night stands anymore. They're meaningless to me and leave me feeling empty. I'd at least want to be friends and/or see the person I slept with again."" I think he agreed to that, said something about meeting his roommates when they come home, but then also joked about ""catching me at a bad time"" because I admitted I was pickier about who I date now. Somewhere in that convo, he mentioned he found me ""so sexy"" and then leaned in to kiss me. 

We left the bar shortly after that and went back to his together. His roommates weren't home, so I was just walking around looking at things and making light teasing jokes (like his giant pantry was pretty ""bachelor-y"" because there was just protein powder, medicine, and no food) Nothing truly insulting, I hope. I asked when his roommates would be home and he casually mentioned pretty soon. He asked if we wanted to go up to his room and so I did. 

Spent 20-30 minutes chatting and looking through his giant stacks of books in his room. Had some discussions about them (asked him which were his favorites, what did he think of this one... etc.) Eventually I asked if I could borrow one of them (a classic that I read in high school, but forgot all about) and made a joke that if we never met up again, at least I'd have left this date with a free book (but of course I was going to return it! I mean, he said it was his favorite, only after I picked it up and asked to borrow it though). 

Suddenly, we were by the foot of the bed, talking, making jokes, ya know. He came to hug me, began kissing me and then we were taking off our clothes. Half-way through taking off our clothes, I reiterated what I had said about this *not* being a one-night stand, because if it were then I would not be down for it. He said, ""yeah, if we did or didn't decide to be together--at the bare-minimum we could be friends."" And so two consenting adults had sex (I'll spare the details... I mean--I could elaborate, but that's for another subreddit.) 

After that, we showered together and then laid in bed naked just casually talking. We had about another 30 minute-ish discussion about something random (i forget) and I asked him if he was tired. He said he was, so I asked him for a ride home. He asked: ""tonight or in the morning?"" And I said ""tonight, I have a dog to take out (which is entirely true). I would stay the night otherwise."" But then I forgot that I asked him if he was tired so we chatted on again for a little while longer before I asked him to actually take me home because he was tired (I wasn't, but I didn't want to overstay my welcome.) 

When I got dressed, I made a joke about how we were just ""playing scrabble"" in case his roommates were awake and could hear me, and that there just happened to be a lot of 'Os'. 
Idk, dumb joke but whatever. 

Oh yeah, sometime during sex, his roommates had come home. I asked if they could hear and he said they probably could, but they wouldn't say anything about it. So I was like, ""OK why not."" When I came downstairs getting ready to leave, his roommates were dead-asleep on the couch. It was a cute sight to see two grown-ass men peacefully asleep next to each other and I was also a little grateful because I was thinking it could be awkward meeting them after fucking his roommate. 

He drives me home, we talk about what kind of music we liked. I was a little tired now, so I didn't really want to keep talking too much and didn't want to force conversation. So the car ride home was a little quiet. 

He pulled up next to my apartment and he put his arm behind my headrest. I was digging for my keys at this point, and I think I said something like ""Sorry looking for my keys"" (which were really stuck in some crevice of my purse now that I had a whole book in there). Eventually I looked up and saw he leaned in for a kiss, which I reciprocated and followed up with a hug, and he had kissed my cheek mid-hug (kind of in an awkward maneuver). I said: ""OK, have a good night."" I took about a second to open the door because it was a Tesla and it's not intuitive to me to press a button to open the door, but then when I pressed unlock and the door unlatched, I heard him say ""Damn."" So I responded with a ""what?"" 

He goes ""It was nice to meet you.""
I said, ""You too! Have a good rest of your night."" 
Then he ended it with a *""Catch you around.""*

I left the car right after. 

He waited for me to get past the gate into the complex before he drove away. 

So that was two days ago. No texts or follow-up dates were exchanged since then. 

Granted, he just started dating again and I was his third date. Got out of a long-term relationship (he was engaged to his ex) 6 months ago. 

I know this wall of text detailing everything probably wasn't necessary. Just that last part. But I think recounting my experience is somewhat therapeutic for me. 

So what do you think? I mean, I have his book. It's a little bit worn and yellow, so he could definitely just buy another one, but I just wanted to ask what your interpretation might be. I'm alright being friends, but I also am curious if this night sounded not very promising for anything romantic. I don't know if I really want to pursue this person seriously yet (I'm kind of figuring myself out), but I at least want to keep this connection going because I had fun. 

And I usually get to the second date. The person I go on first dates with normally texts me the day after or that night to tell me they had a great time and would wanna hangout again. It didn't happen this time though.

However, I have this huge secret fear that she will just ghost and leave me. I have no reason to think this is the case, she is very much into me and everything is going well. 

I think I feel this way for two reasons. First, I actually had a girl break my heart this way two years ago. I don’t miss that girl, but I still remember just how bad it hurt. That particular girl gave absolutely no signs, she just ghosted me one day before texting me “we need to talk”. It took me months to get over, and the worst part is that I’m not sure what I did wrong. I have theories, but it’s just as likely it was her than it was me. 

Second, I think I still struggle with insecurity. I was a late-bloomer in life and was a bullied outcast with no social skills during my early teens. No girls wanted anything to do with me back then, and I think I still carry a lot of the damage. I’ve built myself into an outwardly confident person, but sometimes I still feel like an imposter who people would call “weird” if they got to know me.

My ex and I( 22F) dated for 3 years while we were studying together in the same class in undergrad. We would have a lot of fights and things were not always fine but we would make it work. 2 years into the relation, I caught him flirting with another of his childhood friend. He said things like come to my house and would be upset when she wouldn’t respond. He also was planning a trip for just a two of them for a few days. All this just hurt me. When I asked him why he didn’t tell me about this, he told me I wasn’t fun enough and he’d prefer hanging out with her than me. 
I always felt like I was never enough for him and this made some serious insecurities in my head. We were also not able to ever have sex while we were dating, both of us were virgins and he told me something like: “ if a two year girl can get raped than why cant I penetrate into you”. Trying to make me feel like there was something wrong my my body. He would always appreciate other girls over me and never made me feel valued. After this, we had major issues and we broke up after a year.
We met after 5 months of our breakup and we made out with each other for almost everyday for 3 weeks.We did occasionally talk to each other in those 5 months, were we also sexted sometimes. After those 3 weeks, I realized I had never stopped loving him and I wanted to work on things and get back together but he told me he didn’t want to. He also told me why do you want to get back with me when I did cheat on you in the past! After that we went to separate places and would talk to each other almost every day.He also sent me a gift on Valentine’s Day but I wasn’t sure what he meant by that. We then met for an hour after 2 months, where he told me wanted to work on things and get back together even though we were away from each other.
I was really happy.
We then again had a huge misunderstanding and didn’t talk to each other for 3 months at all. We then met for a brief 3 hours as friends since we were going to different  cities for our further studies in a completely new country and thought we should catch up once before that.
He asked to kiss me while we met and told me he really meant when he wanted to fix things. We shared a kiss and then we he went on his way and I went on mine. We are now in the same country but in two different states very away from each other. We do keep flirting and sexting each other occasionally. He came to meet me a month back, and we stayed together for 3 days.
He has been hooking up with a lot of girls and I had been seeing a few guys myself too. We both lost our virginities to other people and were finally able to have sex when we met this time.
I thought I had honestly moved on but on the last day, I told him I wanted to work on our relationship and if not now then in the future we should try getting back together. He clearly told me he didn’t want to and that we are very different from each other.
I honestly have not been able to move on since then. I’ve just been thinking about him all day. He is on tinder and is happily hooking up with people.
I feel like he has far moved on from the relationship, however I clearly haven’t. Even though it’s been over a year and a half since we’ve broken up.
We still are friends and we still flirt with each other but I know he doesn’t want anything more.
I do not know how to move on and how to let go of him. I think I’m gonna love him for life even though I don’t want to. I honestly feel like he’s never been good or fair to me, but I somewhere can never let go of him. I cannot let myself get hurt and depressed again over the same guy.",True,True,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1156518,public,spoiler,I NEED TO MOVE ON.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sie0he/i_need_to_move_on/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,,

English is also not my primary language, so apologies if it's poorly written. I did my best.

I met a girl on Bumble, we chatted on the app for a few days, I asked her out for a walk the following weekend. Until then, she added me on FB, deleted her Bumble account and we kept chatting a little bit on FB.

Our first date on Sunday went very well, we went for a walk that lasted for 2.5 hours. At the end, before she got into her car, she asked for a hug. The evening, she wrote to me on FB that she had a great time and casually told me that she would be available on Tuesday and Wednesday. We set the date for the following Wednesday. Meanwhile, we kept writing to each other on FB. She proposed we do the date at her place.

Our second date on Wednesday was at her place, we talked and ate pizza. It was very nice. It was close to midnight when I left. We both had to work the next morning. Before I left, she told me something like ""By the way, if you had any intention of kissing me, now would be a good time"". I felt like a dummy but was happy she did that because I'm still very awkward and terrible at initiating the first kiss. We kissed and she gave me the short ride to the subway station. The next day, I told her I had fun and that we should do see each other again soon. She proposed Friday or Sunday. We ended up choosing Friday.

On our third date on Friday, we went for a walk, but it was really cold out. After an hour, we got into her car and went to her place. We cuddled on the sofa, then kissed, then had sex for quite a while. She told me I could stay for the night if I wanted to. The next morning, we had sex again. I'm not saying this to brag, but I'm pretty sure I've done a good job. We watched a few episodes of a TV show and then I left.

We wrote to each other in the evening, I told her I had a lot of fun and asked her if she would be available this week. She told me Wednesday could do. On Sunday, she even wrote me that if it was too cold out on Wednesday, I could warm her up in her bed. We sent each other a few other texts, but yesterday, the vibe kind of changed. It is hard to explain, but she sent shorter messages, fewer smileys, she told me she had to cancel for Wednesday because she wanted to quarantine before seeing a girlfriend on Thursday evening. I said no problem, that we could reschedule later and she only replied ""Yes!"". I asked her if everything was fine and she told me that everything was fine and that it was nice of me to ask.

Overall, it seems like she doesn't put as much effort into her messages, it's hard to describe. She only replied this morning to a message I sent her yesterday early evening. I know I'm not supposed to give too much thought into it, but it's just a general vibe I get. I didn't reply to her message, but this evening after her work shift, she sent me ""Heyyyy"". 

I can't tell if she's still interested or not. I can't tell if she's trying to play games or ""shit-test"" me or whatever it is. Should I stop putting effort into my own messages, so that hopefully, she fears losing me and starts showing interest again or should I call her out on it, like ""I'm getting a weird vibe from you since Monday.

When we got to the checkout line, she was the second person and there were two at the register, so it wasn't the best timing. 

I opened up with the line ""I was looking for some stylish clothing, but you're the only one who caught my attention"", but to be honest....I was really shy and probably strutted a few times and spoke in a soft tone.

There was also this woman who looked like my grandmother who was starting into my soul as I was flirting.

She smiled and me her name. We had a brief exchange of names and what were were looking at in the store, and if she came here often (which wasn't what I wanted I was just panicking and thinking of something to say).

After that, the next women went on line and I panicked. I didn't know what to say, so I just said generic things...... still panicking, I got caught up on my words and asked the same question again.

By that time the cashier called her up and I was thinking to myself ""FUCK"". Anyways, she continues to check out and I'm like whatever, and the cashier next to get calls me over. 

So I think this is my only chance, so leaned over and asked her if she wants to get coffee and she said no thank you.


What do you think I did wrong? And where should I go better next time? 


In my opinion:
1. I was shy and panicked when she was close up to the register, so I just spoke whatever came to mind.
2. I needed to keep the conversation going and give her a reason, before I ask for the number. 
3. I need to work on my confidence and not let people watching distract me from the goal.
4. My heat was almost beating out my chest.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1156531,public,self,Blew a chance in getting a number. What did I get wrong?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sieq4q/blew_a_chance_in_getting_a_number_what_did_i_get/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,,
