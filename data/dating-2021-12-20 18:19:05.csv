0,rl1at2,1640046023,Am I a bad person for falling in love with my best friend who happens to be a guy?,"I've had this guy friend for years, who always had a flirtatious personality. Literally all of his friends are women. Him and I have been friends forever, so I know that when he cracked flirty jokes it was never serious. When he got a girlfriend, things took a turn when we were consistently texting and he would say things like ""I don't trust myself around you"" and he'd invite me over to hangout one on one while she wasn't home. (This has never happened with my other guy friends by the way). My response was ""I have respect for both you and her, so we can all hangout together so she knows there's no hidden agenda from my end."" I'd also even ask to say hi to him after my classes, just as I do with whatever friend I have and I genuinely had innocent intentions, and he would say things like ""I don't want her knowing that I'm saying hi to you."" I'm like ""wtf? I'd never cross the line like that, I have respect for your relationship."" I developed feelings for him and I told him and ended the friendship purposely; I said ""I don't feel comfortable speaking to a taken guy that I have feelings for and I'm going to end the friendship now"" but he still kept trying to talk to me like nothing happened. He was cracking jokes like nothing happened and it fucked with my head. I still feel guilty for constantly engaging in texting with him and secretly falling in love with him. They broke up shortly after for unknown reasons (he wouldn't tell me,) and we got back in contact, and we hooked up a couple months after they broke up once and he ended up ghosting me forever. I feel like an absolute moron and homewrecker for some reason. I'm ruminating on what I could have said that could have crossed the line. I also feel like I hurt his girlfriend very badly. I also feel like I don't deserve a loyal partner in the future. In my own relationships, I remain loyal however I feel like I did something VERY wrong here. I have like an enormous guilt complex and I would never purposely want to hurt another woman. I'd like some opinions on whether or not I'm a bad person.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rl1at2/am_i_a_bad_person_for_falling_in_love_with_my/
1,rl1bq2,1640046094,"He raised his voice, I felt small","Hi. Came here because I cannot stop crying. 

We've been together a year and 6 months, and things have been going well until last week when he suddenly raised his voice at me. It wasn't me, I swear. We are long distance and my phone glitched so he kept hearing ear piercing noises on his end. He got annoyed because he thought I was moving my earphones or something like that and he has always been sensitive to loud sounds. I knew that and have been careful.

Last week, he has been sensitive because of some problems at work. He didn't take it out on me but I knew something was off because he sounded down and he did tell me he was going through a tough time. While on our call, the glitch happened 2 times and he told me he could not make out what I was saying because of the noise and he suddenly snapped. It wasn't a shout...he just raised his voice, it was one sentence and he said sorry multiple times. 
I cried. He kept apologizing. I cried and told him I felt so small and that I don't like being shouted at because I have traumatic experience with men doing that to me. I was so shocked because I did not expect that from him. At. All. 

So I am not sure why I am posting this. I am getting the itch to run away and just not talk to him but at the same time I know that is immature. This is the first time he ever made me feel this way but I am scared. I am terrified that I made the mistake of going with the wrong person again. I might need a therapist more than a boyfriend, I guess. I told him a thousand times I am damaged goods, and see? I am right. No one is never mad, no one can completely avoid not raising their voice yet I got so so scared I did not talk to him for 2 days. My brain kept saying: ""no one should treat you this way, not anymore, just go"" but I know he did not mean it at all and he eas going through shit himself.

I...am not sure if I just needed to vent but your thoughts are appreciated. I am so lost. I hate myself for being like this. We have been through a lot trying to deal with my past traumas but I don't want to keep pestering him with my garbage. Should I just end it?

5,rl1pgs,1640047242,Need outside perspective,"25m 
So I just want some input since i’m incredibly biased right now. 

Been talking to this girl for almost 2 months now. 1st part was texting and talking on the phone/FT a lot. Like 30+ hours without including texting. 
We’ve been on 5 dates now every weekend, at like 8 hours each on average in addition to talking on the phone obviously. 

Anyhow, things have progressed a little faster than expected. 1st and 2nd date were hand holding. 3rd date ended with a quick kiss. 4th date was straight up making out/petting whatever you wanna call it. 
Making out wasn’t something I planned on doing until we had *the talk* and defined whether we were gf/bf. We both want to hold off on sex for a little while (v card here), but making out caught me off guard a little. We both obviously enjoy each other and we talk about the future a lot. Is now an alright time to bring it up what to call us and make things official? I’m a little off balance with the pace here and need some outside perspective.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rl1pgs/need_outside_perspective/
6,rl1ucr,1640047655,Why do people say to talk to women the same way you talk to guys? I’m really confused.,"Please just hear me out, I don’t think women  are a different species, I’m not a misogynist or anything I just want to understand.

So I see here a lot that when I’m talking to women I should talk to them like they’re a guy as practice to get myself out of the mindset that women are different. The thing with that is it seems very wrong.

Like today I was at the gym and I saw some guy I didn’t know do something that was pretty incredible and I went up to him and spoke to him about it, and I talked about how ripped he looked and how good his body was. This lead to a full convo and he recommended me some supplements. Normal interaction right? 

So I was thinking if I could’ve don’t that if it were a woman without looking like a creep. Like if I said the same things to a girl I saw at the gym, honestly if I even went near a girl at the gym I would’ve been wrong.

I also consider this when I’m in class. I spend a lot of time trying to not make girls around me uncomfortable, I avoid sitting near women like they’re the plague. I also would never go out of my way to talk to one because she will immediately consider me a threat or at very least someone hitting on her since women deal with that a lot.

Sitting near a guy? No problem and a guy wouldn’t be on guard if I started speaking to him like a chick would.

I’m aware other dynamics similar to this exist, and I’m not sure if it really is a good idea to speak to them like their men when women have to think differently than men when dealing with men they don’t know. So why should I then talk to them like their men?

It seems like a set up for failure, but I know that’s an irrational thought.

Can someone please explain this to me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rl1ucr/why_do_people_say_to_talk_to_women_the_same_way/

There's someone who I've known for a little over a year who I kind of want to impress, and we've actually grown quite close. Sometimes (about 1-2 times a week) she gives me pats on the shoulder and puts her hand on my back when I make remarks about classwork or something funny.

I have never seen her give anyone else hugs, but touches others in the same manner. She has mentioned ""keeping distance during the pandemic"", yet has a pretty small personal space bubble. I don't know if she'll be comfortable if I start touching her back to show interest.

The most intimate touching she's done so far was when I needed help with a concept which required the use of our hands, and she took my hand and showed it to me. ( I did sanitize afterward, not sure if she did)

We’re moving in together pretty much within the next 1-2 weeks and we talk everyday and are very close.

We know a lot about each other.

She works a 9-5 job, and I own and run my own business.

Today my accountant asked me to put together my accounts for the past year, to include purchase figures, sales figures, and other costs etc. My accountant was going to fill in the final section for retail purchases to fully calculate the total profit overall.

As my GF was sitting next to me, I asked her to get her calculator out and add up each total for purchases and sales for each month as I was running out of time and my accountant needed it urgently. Then she added each up and gave me totals for each month. As there were only sales and purchase figures, the retail purchases were missing as my accountant was going to put this in as he has this info - so all my GF has seen is the total sales and online purchases.

What should I do?," I (M20) have been coworkers with this girl (F18) and we’ve been working together in October 2021. I liked her ever since I saw her but we didn’t really talk at all until Thanksgiving when we just started talking to each other and we hit it off well.  
since then she would talk to me every time we worked together and offer her help. At first I just thought that she was just being nice to me and that she didn’t like me in a romantic way but lately I’ve been second-guessing that.  
this Saturday she wanted me to walk her to her car and Sunday she offered to share her umbrella with me when it was raining so I wouldn’t get wet and it was nice. Today she asked me a weird question that if I thought she was annoying because a coworker told her that someone said that about her and I told her that I didn’t think she was and that I thought she was the nicest person at our job. She thanked me and said that everyone at our job likes me because I'm genuine and caring.  
It meant a lot that she said that but I get thrown off because she calls me dude a lot so it makes me think she just sees me as friend. She’s also nice to everyone else so it’s not that she’s just really nice to me. I’m also nervous to ask her out because if she rejects me I don’t want it to be awkward at my job (there's only 20 employees at our job and 15 of them are women) which would lead to me wanting to quit which I don’t because I like my job.

I'll make it quick.  I work 50 hours a week, Monday to Friday. Normally tired weekday nights. I like to recharge my batteries after work.  I also get up at 430am everyday so sleep is at a premium.   

My gf (31) and I (30), have been together approximately 2 years. All has been excellent thus far. A lot of give and take, mutual respect and trust.  I've never ever had reason to not trust her, I like everything about her. Talking about moving in together, etc. All that good stuff.

Recently, there has been a passing in her life that has taken a toll on her. A childhood friend.  I've been as supportive as I can, as I know what it's like to lose a good friend.  Another acquaintance she met yeats ago has surfaced more recently now. And she spends a lot of time with her, she talks about him at least 5 times a day, messages him all day while I'm at work, even wheb we are together. It's just constantly I heat his name.  I truly belive she wouldn't fool around on me.  But he's having a party this Thursday night.  Well, only a handful of ppl. Like 6, I think.  I dont thibk I can make it.  I odnt drink weekdays and I work Friday. She really wants me there, and I want to support her.  But I feel like this friend has been taking a lot of her mind recently. And I'm just not mentally or physically energized to handle that night.  Especially with covid. She dosnt work right now. He does, but still parties and drinks many nights. I juay can't do it.

I miss the feeling of loving someone and having that feeling returned…..I haven’t been on a single date since I broke up with my ex last year. But I am so so soooooo terrified to put myself out there again. And here’s why:

After I broke up with my ex, I made friends with a recovering alcoholic named “Luke”. Luke and I bonded over similar trauma, love for nerd culture, and music. We even wrote some songs together. I asked him he wanted to be more than friends but he turned me down with the whole, “not looking for anything serious right now” cliche. I spent a year and half being love with this guy…..but a few months ago he started dating another boy (he is bisexual).

My female friends say that i should move on because I deserve to find someone who reciprocates my feelings. And on a logical level, I know they’re right. Buuuuuuuuuuuuuut the emotional part me is terrified to do so because I don’t think my spirit can handle another heartache like this. 

And even before “Luke”, I had an extremely hard time attracting men because I am neurodivergent due to traumatic brain injury that makes me exhibit mannerisms that lead people to believe that I am autistic. So, what if I do put myself at there and then my search is futile and all for nothing?

52,rl5lb7,1640059164,"I think I’ve embarrassed myself by assuming a girl from work was asking me out, and now I have no idea how to handle it","
I’m gonna preface this by saying I’m pretty sure I have anxiety that’s gonna make me unable and to view this in a sensible way, so I’m likely overreacting here.

Basically me and a girl from work have been becoming pretty friendly. She’s one of those people that’s so attractive that you kind of write them off in your head as unattainable. Because I’d done this, and because we have a few mutual friends, I instantly felt at ease around her. I wasn’t worrying about anything, and when I started there we instantly settled into a kind of teasing, relaxed vibe with each other. I was attracted to her, yes, but it was never on my mind much, and she’s an insanely kind person who has a similar sense of humour, so I just always felt really at ease around her.

Over time we’ve gotten friendlier and friendlier. The last few weeks I thought it had turned a little flirty, but again, I didn’t think much of it. I just assumed it was the kind of joking, teasing thing ramped up a little. But a few things more recently made me realise we were starting to connect a little more on a deeper, emotional level, and the laughs were ramping up, and I found myself looking forward to seeing her more, and I realised I was developing a bit of a crush.

Anyway, the other day she tells me she’s gonna message me after work about something funny she’d thought of. I thought it was just that kind of ‘Aww remind me to send this to you’ type deal that never actually happens. But she ended up dming me (it was something we could have just talked about in person, which made me think she was just looking for an excuse to slide into the dms). We talked on and off for a couple of days following that and she kind of, in a way I thought was kind of joking but being serious too, that we should both go out and celebrate the fact we happened to have the same days off next week.

I kind of didn’t know what to make of it. I thought it seemed like she might be asking me out, but I wasn’t really sure. I just replied that it sounded like a good idea, and jokingly added she owes me a drink anyway because I covered a shift for her a week ago. 

After that she didn’t even open the conversation again. The conversation just ended. That was 2 days ago. I know she’s been active on social media and I know she’s not been overly busy, as we’re both off and she’s been replying to our work’s group chat almost instantly every time. 

Now I’m really nervous. I keep replaying it. Was she simply joking that ‘we need to celebrate the fact we’re off’ and I took it too far by implying we actually should hang out? At the time I thought the flirty vibe building, the excuse to dm me, the half joking hang out suggestion, all seemed to point to her having similar feelings as I do, but the fact she hasn’t even opened the message (but clearly would have seen what I said on her notifications) and went radio silent tells me I was maybe wrong and that she doesn’t want to actually deal with the fact I suggested it would be a good idea to hang out.

So, what gives here? Have I embarrassed myself? I feel like an idiot. When we next work together is it gonna be awkward between us when we both know that we kind of entertained the idea of going out and doing something together and then just dropped the idea completely almost straight away? Will she tell other people at work that I kind of asked her out? I’m just so scared that I’ve fucked things up and made her think I’m weird as shit, it’s either she got cold feet when things seemed to be getting more concrete, or she was never interested at all and noped out, or isn’t sure how she feels and kind of just ignored it instead, etc.

I honestly don’t know what to think. It was like she was giving me all these signs for me to bite the bullet and when I kind of did she decided to back off majorly. What do I do here? I won’t be seeing her for a while, should I bring it up when I do see her? Just ignore that it ever happened?

She even suggested that we delete our dating apps. Honestly I never saw that happening for me I figured with how my luck is they would always be on my phone. 

Then it all came crashing down. I half expected it to happen due to my past experiences, but the strange thing is this time it doesn’t hurt, it’s just left me numb. 

I’ve lost all interest in continuing to try and date. The woman I went on a date with before last said that it would be weird if I didn’t have any relationship experience by 30, well I’m throwing in the towel a few years early.

60,rl6pw3,1640062870,Feeling self conscious about people assuming I’m younger than I am.,"I’m 27 but often get mistaken for a lot younger. It ranges from 12-19, sometimes 21 if I’m lucky. I’m not short, I’d say I have a  average/medium height (slightly taller than most women - 5’7).

I’m naturally petite (I have a small frame and not much body fat). I understand the majority idolises this and it’s considered a standard but that doesn’t change my personal and very individual thoughts about it.

Of course I’ll eventually age and look older but realistically it’s not great for right now, in this moment of my life. I’m in my prime and I want to be able to attract a partner. It doesn’t help that I’m quiet.

I’ve always had a preference for men my own age, maybe a few months up to a year older. Lately I’ve noticed if (once they confirm my age) a guy my own age or slightly older hits on me, I don’t know how to accept their *”advances”*. I feel like an imposter weirdly. I keep getting opinions of my *”youthful”* look thrown on me, I’m starting to feel self conscious like I’m not datable or something.

I’m glad I’m not short but it’s as good as. Mainly men but some women do it too, are protective when it comes to me. They take softly and in a very kind way to me. It feels weird something because I know they’re younger than me.

How do I overcome this and start dating?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rl6pw3/feeling_self_conscious_about_people_assuming_im/

As of early this year, he developed an addiction towards women that exploit their bodies on social media. He stalks them thoroughly, on every platform they may be on... instagram, twitter, OF, reddit, tiktok, snapchat... that's all i know as of today. Sometime in march, i accidentally found a 2nd account he was hiding from me to specifically look at said women. A few days prior, which is kind of funny, we had a specific conversation about this, to which i said i'm comfortable with him looking at them, for i fall victim as well, occasionally mind you, however, i was completely uncomfortable with him saving these images as well as coming into contact with them. I would never restrict him to something that i'd allow myself to do, that's hypocritical. We had a massive fight over what i found in March, and the last thing i asked of him during it was if there was anything else he needed to share with me, anything else he's been hiding... and he said no. In the summer, i found a secret stash of pornographic images, drawings, and videos in a private folder on his phone, of which he had since his addiction began. This is the 2nd lie. There was no argument this time, however a thorough conversation, and we concluded that his addiction was a project we'd both work on, which means i stayed with him to help him. he showed me all that he saved, and a lot of it was disgusting, but he showed me honestly. when i asked if he has anything saved he confessed immediately. i saw this as credible, which is why i stayed. I asked if he could slow down and stop saving and come to me if he needed too, and he agreed. He was committed to not saving images/videos until this december. He has, however, been clicking links to OF and twitter for months on a day to day basis,which is not slowing down at all. I found he had been saving again and confronted him once more, continuously asking if he was anything hiding from me, and each time was no until i opened instagram and then he broke. I am now avoiding him and don't know how to handle the situation. he logged into his account on my phone to prove something to me, but i don't know what. He keeps saying he'll continue to fight for me but i don't know how much more i can take. i don't want to leave him but i'm just so sad at this point. i really need some advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rl6q5f/my_bf_17m_has_a_porn_addiction_and_repeatedly/

He even said if his dad doesn’t accept me, he can’t be with me. All year he played mind games, then he of course came back and apologized. Trust was also broken through things I found out. I cut it off the other day bc I feel like I give more than I get back. My birthday was saturday, he had a funeral for his old coworker through suicide that morning. My ex’s brother lost his life that way years back. He also got into a car accident which lead him to only being able to drive back n forth to work(and funeral) until it was resolved. He said he wasn’t going to make it to see me but would make it up. I offered to get him uber rides to me. He declined, said he will still make it up. So later that night he told me he hung out with his boy which he walked to. (they live close by). I understand the passing of the coworker impacted him but how would he hang out with his friend but not me? So, that’s what drew the line for me.

I had been going to a dentist that wasnt doing a great job and i would have excruciating pain come back. But since had been seeing him, when i woke up in pain Bf took me to same dentist but we werent sure if hed be of help.We left and i took pain meds to numb pain and we had lunch in that time. He left at 6pm to do errands for work and I had slight pain still. He texted me at 7:30 asking how my tooth was and i said id come to drugstore to get different medication since pain wasnt going away. Next time he texted me was 10:30 pm. It bothers me that he wasnt worried enough to check in on me earlier to see if my medication worked or how i was doing until a couple in hours later.  Then, when he texted at 10:30 i said i was in bad pain he said aw what can i do i said idk. He didnt bother to at least give me a call and talk to me. I texted him like wow bravo. Then he said after the last text he was an hour away and coming tomme but i said i was in pain and he couldnt call to check how bad it was?! he didnt even tell me he was coming until i sent that upset text. When he came When i said this to him he said he was running errands and was with people and still managed to check in but it doesnt look good for him to constantly be on the phone?!! it blew my mind. 

TL:DR After he came over and we argued he just left knowing i was hurt and arguing with him. How can someone who apparently loves me act like this? How about after arguing when he called and i called back and I said its obvious to me he doesnt care he said good then dont call me and dont text me?! He gors an hour away and texts me ehat I want? when he left i was still in pain and its not something that should be told. Im in pain and someone who loves and cares about me should want to be next to me. Especially when the dentist wasnt a good one and didnt resolve the issue.

In the 3 months I’ve been single I’ve met up with 2 guys from Hinge. First guy was cute but I’m not interested in anything serious with. He’s attractive and sex is great but he’s not particularly ‘the one’ for me. I can accept that we are just f*king around and having fun. 
The 2nd guy I met just this past week. He checks all the boxes- like I can not think of a single thing I do not like about him (albeit it’s only been one date.. so far, so good). 

Before anyone says “it’s too early to know” I KNOW. I’m just saying as far as a first date goes- I would be interested in getting to know the guy and seeing where things go. My issue: since our dinner and movie date last week, I haven’t heard much from him. At the end of our date he said “just one more hug I promise” and didn’t try for a kiss but people were around so he might have been shy. He immediately asked if I was free the next day which I had to decline because I wasn’t but offered alternate times.

According to most people “he’s not that into you” “you just met him, give it some time” 
Well after the date he texted me to make sure I made it home safely and the next day he called me to let me know he wasn’t feeling well but hopes that we can get together after Christmas. Other than that, he hasn’t texted me much at all which I find DEVASTATING?

I have intense anxiety at the thought that he may not be as interested as I am and possibly at all. I’m used to guys giving me immediate validation through texts after dates and I’ve never really ever had a bad date so this has thrown me off. That was a lot of background but why am I so anxious/nervous/un-validated(?)At the thought that he may not be interested in me?

What is it about me that relies so heavily on this strangers validation? Am I spoiled by the fact that many encounters work out in my favor and I’m just feeling it now and do not know how to handle it?

I am definitely going to set up an appointment with a therapist to get to the root of some of my issues but I don’t usually suffer from anxiety and this possible fear of rejection is killing me. I’m guessing I’m not as emotionally mature as I thought I was.


TLDR; why am I panicking at the fear of rejection from a stranger? Why do I rely so much on validation from men?

I recently downloaded a couple of dating apps because I'm open to meeting people, and also because it's almost impossible to meet people outside of friend groups now that I'm out of college.

With the intent of only adding to context, I'm also 6 ft and relatively attractive. I've had multiple girls express interest in me during college but I was either taken or too socially anxious. 

Now that I'm on the apps, I get quite a few matches but I find that most of the conversations I'm in die out in one way or another. I'm also not pushy and if i do flirt/hit on the girls, it's subtle (aka i don't use pick up lines or make sexual innuendos). I also try and get their socials maybe after a few days of talking, so I'm not rushing or anything.

I feel like he respects me but maybe he doesn’t really see me for who I am. I have expressed that I am growing attached and that it could be because we have sex so often and intimately and he doesn’t really have anything to say to ease that. He isn’t pushy with sex and he wouldn’t and has never tried to force me to do anything but I do wonder how I could benefit him if I didn’t give him my body. I don’t feel like I am as smart as him and I am scared that if I talk too much he will think I’m weird and not want to talk to me anymore. I hinted a while ago I’m starting to get feelings and he tried to let me down easy so I took the hint and stopped mentioning it but I just don’t know where to go from here with him. I really like him and he seems into me but some stuff throws me off about him. 
I know that people deserve what they allow and I don’t want to allow this but I feel like whenever I try to talk to him I don’t know the right way to word how I’m feeling without being overwhelming and I really like him so I want to say the right thing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rl86m4/i_wanna_talk_to_the_guy_ive_been_sleeping_with/

Now we barely ever text and he used to send me good morning text every morning- That also stopped. He does call me every day still but it’s still not like how it was in the beginning. We also haven’t had sex ?? This was suppose to be a friends with benefits relationship but it seems like all the “benefits” aren’t apart of it rn so I really don’t know what we’re doing.  I just don’t know if I’m allowed to bring it up because it is a friends with benefits type of situation but my mind doesn’t do well with inconsistency, I start to pull away immediately.

86,rl87n4,1640067971,"Are there any short, ethnic, average or ugly at best looking guys getting significant amounts of likes/matches/dates online? If so, how?","I've been trying online dating for years with no success.

I also tried talking to women in bars/clubs/malls but mostly I got one word answers, blank or worse faces, or ""I have a boyfriend."" It wasn't fun getting such negative reactions or feeling like I was ruining people's days just by trying to talk to them from the first word.

I've made and remade my profiles so many times. I've posted on Reddit for advice on my photos, asked family and friends, and even had a pro matchmaker tell me they were great. Same with my bios. None of this has gotten me any likes or matches.

I get complimented on my personality all the time but it doesn't manifest into dates and never has.

I'm just wondering if it's physically possible for someone like me to get dates online as a man. My sisters look like me and they get hundreds of guys. But for a man, it seems it's not okay.

Whenever I see a guy on here talking about getting matches he's almost always the Hollywood race, tall, and is told he's handsome. Or maybe he's short and another race but handsome. That doesn't help me.

Also for the record, when I say ""average or ugly at best"" I don't mean ""I hate myself."" Being objective about one's facial structure does not imply I hate myself or lack confidence. I really don't care. My cheekbones are not my identity. I'm just saying it as it is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rl87n4/are_there_any_short_ethnic_average_or_ugly_at/

Cant really find a job nor wanto with how things are going on so far and the fact none of the minimum skill jobs hold any purpose which as stupid as that sounds bugs me a whole lot. And so I find myself seeking out purpose via woman. Like hey if I got a woman to look out for, work with, because if not I’ll be alone thats a good purpose or drive to get stuff done right? Cause at the moment my lack of motivation to do much of anything is all but dead aside from necessity.

Now for the actual prt:
So besides all that and me thinking my goal is to find purpose with a woman I cant seem to find any? And I know its most likely due to the 8-10 different red flags up top in the bio but i mean I cant seem to find any in the sense of like “oh hey lets go ask that person out” like noone that gets the spark going ever spontaneously shows up no matter where I am. Even if they are dead drop gorgeous. (And no im not gay) although I am Canadian which may cause issues ngl. 

But anyways yeah sorry for the rant and sorry if it makes no sense but meh piece it together i guess XD.

So I was wondering, what exactly is my ex thinking? I know no one can read minds but for the women out there. What would you be thinking and feeling in this situation. Should I make it obvious and try to talk to her about it or give it time. Some information to narrow down the thinking: our relationship lasted half a year and it was good.

90,rl8o38,1640069692,Stop misrepresenting your looks,"Just felt like I would get my thoughts out on this one.

I'm sure guys do this too, but in my personal experience as a straight male I have noticed it happen frequently with women I have encountered online.

It will help you get to the first meeting/date, but I promise you it will not help you in the long run. It starts the whole encounter off on the wrong foot. Not only does it feel deceitful, you leave the person feeling let down, because you are less attractive than you portrayed by a substantial margin.

Instead of starting in a neutral position when you meet, you start from a negative position and have to work your way up from there.  Basically, you have to impress just to even get to neutral, and neutral isn't enough.

Keep this in mind everyone. Maybe someone thinks before meeting  you that you are relationship material for example, their words may seem to strongly portray this sentiment, but... you misrepresented your looks.  A certain standard of looks is important to a lot  of people. So, after they meet you, they downgrade you to simply hook-up or one night stand material, which I know a lot of you don't want.  Portray your looks honestly and meet with someone that is happy with that.

Peace and love.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rl8o38/stop_misrepresenting_your_looks/

I took that into consideration and told her to take her time. We've texted and flirted for the 3-4 weeks since we've met. So far I've let her know that I still wanted to see her again and that I haven't stopped thinking about her. She said she hasn't stopped thinking about me either.

At first, I didn't think anything of it, but as time went by, she started saying ""I'm not your good girl, daddy?""

She wants this in bed too and wants me to be very rough and tell her what to do.
