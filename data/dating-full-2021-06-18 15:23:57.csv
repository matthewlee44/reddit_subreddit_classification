Obviously I'm not always the most cheerful person, but in general I'm not feeling sad as often as when I'm dating or in a relationship.

On the other hand, being with someone is an exciting and beautiful feeling from the beginning, but gradually I'm becoming more stressed. I'm not feeling good enough, I start noticing imperfections on my body, my face and slowly I feel ashamed of my past, my hobbies, my goals in life and so on.

The worst part is after the breakup, when you're left with now useless information about the other person, that you can't get out of your head.

I met a guy on a dating app a month ago. We went out for one coffee date and talked for several hours. The next date, I visited his place and we hooked up. I knew it was a casual thing on both ends. I also knew he was leaving for a summer job in 3 weeks so assumed it would be over then. That said, due to our first date and the extent that we talked to each other pretty deeply I thought it would be more of a friends-with-benefits situation where we were actually friends who could talk to each other as well as sleeping together. 

However, after hooking up we did not really talk for 3 weeks. He texted later the same day to say it was good to see me. Then a week later I texted in a panic at night because of a bug situation in my house (we.... had discussed spiders so it made sense at the time). He texted back the next day and we chatted briefly but when he suggested I come over, I didn't answer because I was looking for a FWB and not someone who sleeps with you but doesn't talk to you outside of that. I didn't hear from him for 2 weeks and assumed that was the end of it. We were looking for different things.

Then yesterday, he texts out of the blue to say how are you, I wish I could have seen you again, I was just in a rush the past few weeks with moving and are you going to be around in August. (When he comes back.)

Now I'm confused because I assumed he was just in it to sleep with me and move on. While I wasn't unclear on the casual nature of things, I realized afterwards that I was looking for something more serious (either a genuine friends with benefits where you still communicate and support each other, or actual dating). I assumed I should move on because it was clear he wasn't providing that or seeking that. However, it seems like a lot for a casual fuck buddy to want to see you in 3 months and now I'm wondering if he does actually want to date me and it was just genuinely a hard time with his move.

I realize I could just ask him his intentions, but the fact is I've learned by now that people don't always tell the truth and often lie to themselves too.

Then we had our first date. It went well. He is a very talkative person, so it was pretty easy holding a conversation. He sat very closely to me all the time and smiled a lot.

The next day, I asked him, if he wants to meet up spontaneously. He wasn’t answering for several hours, in which I saw him online multiple times. 
I was very nervous then, fearing that he might be playing with me or not having interest in me. So I sent him a way too long text.

I then decided to register on as many dating apps as possible to maximize my chances and holy shit, almost all of the dating apps appear to be a robbery in the bright daylight. 

It feels to me that Online Dating is rigged and manipulated by companies for their own advantage to bring as much profits as they can and to fill their CEO's pockets to the full capacity.

This is because they either try to charge you for basic features or limit them too much in order to force you into the paid subscription which then is in most cases set at a ridiculous monthly price. To top it off, ALL of them implement various tactics to trick you even more into the subscription such as:

&amp;#x200B;

*  Suspicious profiles aka bots:

I have experienced it and most users who did liked me had 1 picture, their usernames are different but always end with a number and have set in their preferences that only users with a premium subscription can message them. 

How do I know this ? I was patient and eventually matched with them after a day or two. I have received 0 replies back from the women who didn’t limit their messaging to a premium members. Also, some apps blur profile pictures in a bad way so you can easily tell who liked you and match with them anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

*  Frequent Notifications:

This point is related to the previous one, once you complete your profile, you will notice a suspicious amount of notifications claiming that someone likes you, I even came across the instance where after I clicked on “Complete Profile” button, within the first few seconds I already received a notification. 

Of course, you would love to know who liked you, right ? Nope, after you click on the notification, it will redirect you onto a screen to purchase a premium subscription. From my observations, this can happen at different intervals, it can be every 10 – 15 minutes or a few times per hour and sometimes if you don’t use the app for a long time, they will slowly send a few notifications so that you will open the app again and start using it.

This technique is like with fishing, they put a worm on the end of their fishing road to tease you then hope that you will give in and eat that worm. Worm being fake profiles\\bots and by eating it, you MIGHT give in to buy a monthly subscription for a “better chances” of finding someone.

&amp;#x200B;

* Frustration Triggers: 

All of the apps are designed to frustrate free users and impatient people will have a bad time with it. It’s just the whole nature of using dating apps for free. If you look at it, the frustration triggers are things like limited amount of swipes, likes/super likes or amount of direct messages you can send per day or worse, a week. 

There could also be other features that will limit your use of the apps for a certain amount of things you can do and definitely there are even dating apps that require a subscription to use them. All those limitations frustrates free users and people who are more impatient are at the risk of paying for the said apps. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Fake Reality: 

Even tho there are many legitimate users on the dating apps, there are also a big amount of bots designed by developers to rule in users into the paid subscriptions, scammers who try to get money out of you as well as prostitutes advertising their services or OnlyFans “models” promoting their pages. With how internet and technology is, you can’t really be sure if the other person is real or not until to some degree they have a “verified” badge on their profile.

&amp;#x200B;

* Lack of innovation: 

Once Tinder and their swiping element have became very popular, most of the apps followed the suit with copying it which have resulted in a complete lack of innovation and every app being the same. Most apps now have swiping element besides direct messaging which again is very limited.

What that did was push organic connections to the side and replace it with the element of “if I swiped you, we must like each other”. I remember days when you could message anyone on OKCupid without any limits and get dates via more natural ways. 

Now, most features on OKCupid are hidden behind a paywall and the app have turned into another swiping bonanza like the rest of the apps that aren’t unique anymore. The only difference there is on Dating Websites/Apps now is which ones have better algorithms and ""gives"" you more matches. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Dating Apps are broken mess:

That’s right, I said it. From my experience many dating apps are atrocious and work very poorly. There are following issues with many of them:

\- Location\\GPS not working correctly which results in getting the same matches upon closing and re-opening apps again so you end up with repeated matches in the infinite circle.

\- User’s Preference settings not being applied correctly so you either get someone from too far away or from a completely another country than yours, showing people with wrong ages or things like looking for a person who wants kids but it will show you the ones who don’t want kids instead.

\- Messaging systems where you have to switch tabs back and forth for messages to re-appear again otherwise you won’t be able to message anyone. Broken inbox issue. 

\- I ended up receiving duplicate messages of the same thing within the notification system but when opened there was only one.

\- “Free Trials” that aren’t really free as they ask for your credit card information and count on that you will forget about it and they will be able to charge you a monthly subscription. This not only happens on dating apps but anything that offers “Free Trials” and I decided to include it on this post anyway. 

Here are the issues I heard from other user’s via Application Shop on the reviews section:

\- Registration and verification failures where you can’t either verify who you are or can’t register because the whole process is completely broken. This mostly I saw either on smaller or more dodgy apps.

\- Account working fine for a week or two then out of nowhere being deactivated/removed.

\-  ""Accidental"" account removals once Premium features were bought.

\- Having issues with refunds after buying the Premium features.

The amount of users is big enough to bring a lot of profit so they continue with all the said techniques to roll in new and unaware users. Don’t get tricked into buying a premium access to features or at least think over twice about it if it’s actually worth it.

No, I’m not trying to convince anyone to not buy a premium access to features but rather want to make more people aware of the issues that are related to online dating before they spend their hard earned money on a features that “boosts” your profile.

Remember, corporations and CEO’s exist to make business go round and make their pockets full of sweet money. They act in their own interest first and put their own user base last. If you look how Lootboxes and Microtransactions work in Video Games, it’s basically the same concept but replaced by the word “Subscription” or “Premium”.

As most apps being a blatant cash grabs for money, there are few good ones but still limited and that I myself would recommend to end on a positive note here, kind of like less of an evil approach if you will, they are:

Coffee Meets Bagel - I like the feature that allows you to see who have liked you and you can like them back and start the conversation, it’s a refreshing to see this for free

I'm in an amazing relationship with an incredibly sweet girl. We see each other 4+ times a week and nothing ever gets boring. She's incredible in person and over the phone, and we're excellent at communicating when any problems come up.

The issue is our texting styles are very different. I'm pretty long winded, and don't reply super fast. She, on the other hand, replies in &lt;2 minutes with very short texts. It's been this way for awhile, but for some reason it's getting to me?

Like I said, in person and over the phone, we're absolutely awesome. But over text, I overthink myself to death. We call much more often ever since I mentioned this to her rather than texting when we aren't around each other, which of course during the calls helps a ton with both of us since we both tend to overthink.

In other words, how do I stop overthinking my awesome girlfriend's short texting?

anyways, i'm a little scared that if we separate, no one will want to enter my life knowing i am a 20 year old with an infant &amp; i am a little overweight. i was 120 before i got pregnant, now i'm 150 and have nothing much else to put on the table besides the fact that i am a kind/decent human being. i have some interests, but i'm not really out of the ordinary or unique. also, i'm not ugly af but i'm also not a solid 10, so i guess that doesn't help my case either. 

obviously i don't need a relationship to survive, but i've been with him since we were both 17 and he's the only person i've been with sexually. i'm used to being with someone constantly. regardless of there being no romance/dates, it's comforting to have him around because i'm not alone.

a friend of mine recently got into a committed relationship with a girl my age who has a toddler, and a bunch of his male friends do in fact talk shit behind his back saying things like ""idk why he would do that to himself"" or ""it's not even his kid, why is he with her"" and several other hurtful comments. i get it, no young man in his twenties wants to be tied down, but they ESPECIALLY don't want to be tied down to a girl with a child from a different guy. 

i guess my point is: TRUTHFULLY, do guys around my age really see girls with children as people to avoid? i need anyone who responds to be as brutally honest as possible so i can get a good idea of what my future will look like.  i do expect difficulty with dating again because if i do happen to find someone who enjoys my company &amp; wants to reciprocate love, i need to be able to trust them around my daughter.

I know a good amount of people will disagree but I just think I can change someone’s mind.

First, I’m making this post fresh after seeing a comment on a “Nice Guy” post. Basically he was talking about how women sleep around and he wants a girl that doesn’t sleep around with some added vitriol about women. One of the highest upvoted comments was, “He only feels that way because he can’t get anyone to sleep with him” and all the replies were people ragging on him and calling him a virgin. 

Idk if it’s just me, but as an 20 year old virgin who is trying to fix that, it’s kinda offensive that when people see sexist they immediately go to virgin. I can’t get anyone to sleep with me either, and I don’t think it’s fair to lump guy virgins in with him. This retort is so common here and on other dating subs on posts like that. It’s used in other ways too.

When I see a guy mad about fuck boys or something spewing hate, i always know I’ll see a comment saying something along the lines of, “You’re only mad and cause you’re a jealous virgin.” I’ll be the first I admit, I’m incredibly jealous of fuck boys. I’d kill to be as attractive, as confident, and to be able to sleep with as many women and experience all the crazy sexual things they get to. But I don’t reroute that jealous into hate. Like do you need to label every asshole guy a virgin?

And the kicker is I’ve seen so many guys talk about how they don’t want to be a virgin and then someone will say, “You’re obsessed with sex” or “Women aren’t a notch on your belt” or my favorite “stop complaining about being a virgin, there’s nothing wrong with it and you’re desperate”. Like what do you expect? Other guys tell us we’re not men for being virgins, women will jump to call a sexist a virgin implying that I is bad, and both will then try to say that sex isn’t important and there’s nothing wrong with being a virgin while simultaneously kicking us while we’re down.

Just something to think about.

Tomorrow was our date, and I'm just gonna write it off since she hasn't responded.

Since she said yes to the date, I messaged her my phone number, but she just seemed to completely ignore it. I just thought it was a common thing to exchange number if you're meeting up in case something comes up. Although I think it was better practice just to give my number instead of asking for her's or giving mine and asking.

Long (and definitive) post.

This is the most confused I've been about a girl.

A month ago I (26 M) matched on Tinder with what I would consider my ideal type of girl (based on looks, social status, personality, age, common interests, etc). 

We have a bunch of things in common. She's leo, I'm libra (two zodiac signs that I learnt are very compatible), and the only reason I bring that up is because she asked for my time of birth (to check up compatibility for a relationship, it seems).

We used to chat 24/7, first on Tinder, then on WhatsApp. And even though shes a moody girl, our conversations were very pleasant, and she would send me pictures (of her cats and herself), long voice notes, videos, etc. Signs that she clearly into me.

She always seemed interested in how my day was going, in how I was doing.

After 3 weeks of texting, we went out. Last friday, actually. We met at a Crepes joint near her house.

The date went well, I guess. But to be honest we were pretty nervous cause', you know, it's always gonna be a little awkward meeting up for the first time with someone you met on a dating app.

In all honesty, as I was pulling out my wallet to pay for the food (I insisted in paying hers - it was $10 total, btw - because the day before she told me she didn't have any money; she accepted the gesture, but told me she does not like that because it feels ""like a commitment"", which is something I agree with, but at the same time I think not having money shouldn't be an excuse for two adults to have a good time), I felt defeated for some reason. And even though I confirmed to myself that I'm into her, I don't know, I felt somewhat frustrated. Like if I blew my chance.

Anyways, as we were outside ready to say our goodbyes, she told me: ""Let me know if you wanna hang out next week"", which caught me off guard because I'm ALWAYS the person asking the girl out for a second date after the first one.

I was so surprised (I was looking for a cigarette in my jacket) that my reaction (""Ummmm. I guess we could next week??"") might had translated into a ""Nope. I'm good"" in her eyes.

I got back home and asked her if she got home safe. She asked me the same. I then told her that I had a great time and asked her if she wanted to go to the movies next week (this week) or just simply hang out around her neighborhood (something she proposed after telling me she was outta money). She told me this:

""Yep. I need to figure out my schedule because my turns (she works as a house teacher) are shifting this week. It all depends on that"".

To which I replied:

""We can figure that out next weekend"".

Next morning, nothing. 

She sleeps very early (and therefore wakes up super early), and I would always wake up and see her messages, picking up the conversation from the night before.

I thought to myself, ""Now that we went out, maybe she wants some space"", because she did ask me, two weeks earlier, if I was ""possessive"" or ""jealous"". I said ""Nope"".

Sunday. Nothing. 

But, at 18:00 I sent her a message, but something seemed off. Now I'm carrying all the weight of the conversation, making all the questions. She, on the other hand, super cold. No voice notes, no stickers, no nothing. 

She got back to me at 00:05 after I confessed something very personal about my situation at home with my parents, and when I asked her: ""How come you are up this late? Haha"", she never replied, until yesterday, almost five days later, but because I texted her. After some small talk, I asked her if she had to something this weekend, cause, if not, we could hang out. She told me this: 

""I don't know yet. I've been busy with work as of late"".

I'm so confused by this. If she made her mind up about me the day we met (not meeting her in-person expectations), why would she tell me ON THE SPOT to hang out next weekend?

We follow each other in Instagram, and she sees all stories. From personal (and recent) experience, girls that want nothing to do with me after dating either stop following me or never (and I mean never) see my stories on IG.

What should I reply to her?

I want to tell her so bad: ""You can be straightforward. If you don't want to hangout, it's all cool. I understand"". But I don't want to come off as desperate. Cause remember, she did ask me if I was ""possessive"".

Is this some sort of test to see if I'm clingy? 

Is she getting off with this?

I just want to move on, but I can't without a confirmation on her part.

I’ve been working overseas the last 8 months or so, complicated set up but I spend some of my time in the UK and was deployed overseas for a set periods of time within that 8 months. I knew this was my last trip overseas in this job and due to not having much of a personal life i called it quits. Ideally in the next few years I’m looking to start a family so I’m easing off my career a bit.

I became close with a male colleague who is on a residency contract at my workplace and as he knew this was my last trip and it would have been inappropriate at work those other times , he asked me on a few dates. We’ve got on well as colleagues and there was always a spark between us.

I was hesitant and first but I thought to myself I’ll go along and see how we go. We had a lovely few dates and treated it like dating normally in our home countries. Just before I left we got closer and slept together. I’m usually slow with this stage but we’d known each other through constantly working together and it felt right at the time.

All of a sudden he seemed to be concerned I was going back to my home country and that he would be out there for a few more months. He specifically mentioned that I’d have more choice of men back home statistically. I became quite offended at this as I generally don’t date unless there’s a spark and not specifically looking at this time. He then became distant after this and also made a comment about how I’m an independent woman and clearly enjoy sex. Again I was offended and it was more the circumstances that rushed us on. We had a conversation we would stay in touch and he had mentioned previously that he would visit in a few months time. 
Since coming back I’ve tried to reassure him by just checking in that I’ve arrived home and that I didn’t just sleep with him and see it as just that. We’ve texted but it’s starting to dwindle off. 

Should I just forget about it? Seems a shame as we had a nice connection and the romantic in me wants it to work out as I’d love to see him visit and enjoy some experiences in the city I live in. 

I have a gut feel he is not looking to stay in touch as it is too complicated. He mentioned he had been hurt in the past.

So we've been dating for 10 months now, but lately I feel like I'm unhappy with the relationship and how it's going. I'm used to the routine I have with him and I'm used to him as a person in my life, but that's it. 

In the beginning, we didn't share many interests, we didn't have the same humor or share the same values and future plans in life, but I ignored that and we somehow still managed to have fun. Now,  we still don't, but I understand that I shouldn't have ignored those things.

We've had disagreements before but a month ago we had a serious talk about his narcissistic tendencies and martyr complex. He showed a change in his behavior, but nothing major. 

(I don't know how to do a link here yet, but you can find my post on my account in r/relationship_advice)

After the talk, I let time show me if he'll change more, but that was it. The only thing that changed were my feelings for him. I've noticed I'm not attracted to him as I was and his behavior mentally drains me tbh lately. I can't say I'm in love with him anymore. I don't even know if I was in love at all before that, but I loved him as a person I guess and quickly got accustomed to him. It's just a routine going out with him now. 

He, on the other hand, has said he'd do anything for me and that he really loved me. He even said he was planning on marrying me in the future. That's what makes me rethink my decision sometimes. What if I lose a guy who actually loves me? What if I'm doing the wrong thing breaking up with him? But when I think about my future, I don't see him in it, or more precisely I don't want a husband that behaves like him. 

I know he'll take this break up really badly and that will make me feel bad because he knows how to be sweet sometimes, but I think I have to do this because I feel like we're going in circles with the disagreements and fights.

This is my first serious relationship and I've never had to break up with someone before. I need advice on how to do it, how to start and what to say so it can be quick and as painless because he's a pretty temperamental person and hardly takes no for an answer.

Possibly getting back together in the future. Will be in his hometown soon - not sure if I should ask him to meet up. We're on good terms, I miss him, and have some miscommunications to clear up. Hoping to see where he is at. But if seeing him will make things worse, I'm okay not to. Please skim the post if you have a moment for more context.

Dated about a month, lots of compatibility in what we wanted out of the relationship and life. It was intense and moving fast since all the pieces were in place. As it got more serious, he pulled away. Gave him space then asked why. He thought he was ready to get that close again but now that it’s actually happening, he realized he still needs to do some healing from his last LTR of 3yrs (she ended it 5mo prior to him meeting me). He wanted to marry her after undergrad. He said he felt he couldn’t give enough and build something right now, but said I'm someone very special and so is what we have, scared he was going to regret this. This convo was driven by many fears on his end - it was a really hard, crying convo for both of us. He meant what he was saying - it wasn’t an excuse. I told him I agreed with him that I don’t want to be in a relationship he’s not ready for, even though I really liked him and this was really sad.

Issue was we never talked about where from here - taking it slow, breaking up entirely, friends instead, taking a break… every time it started to come up he got very confused and sad. So I thought to give him a bit more time. We stayed in touch for 2 more months, intimate once. He rarely initiated convos unless there was a reason to (like my bday), but the mutual feeling of support and love never quite went away. After about 2 months of trying to figure it out, feeling burnt out and unappreciated, I knew it was time to stop and instead focus back on me. This wasn’t going to change in the near future. So I just stopped texting him and we haven’t spoken in 3 weeks. Since, I’ve accepted the BU and done some reflecting. We had something very special but I know better. Though we may reopen this relationship in the future, it's up to him to.

Now - I will be on vacay in his hometown (where he is spending summer with his family) in about 3 weeks. We discussed hanging out when I’m there, but that was right after the breakup. I have a feeling he’s not doing fantastic right now. I think I'm in a place now where I can see him and be mostly unscathed; yet I still have my reasons for wanting to see him. Me being in his hometown gives a good excuse to reach out. We did once have those plans, I really enjoy his company and miss it to an extent, but don’t want to hurt him further, possibly hurt myself, and make this messier. I don’t know if it’s been enough time. I'm very curious to check in with him to see where he's at - but I don’t want to fulfill that curiosity at the selfish expense of our feelings.

I think there was some miscommunications since our breakup - I could have worded things better. Me saying to him I don’t want to be in a relationship he’s not ready for, that I don’t mind being single unless the relationship is mostly benefiting my life; I think he felt further like he is not enough and rejected. All I was trying to say to him is that as much as this sucks, we both deserve reciprocation and that I’ll be sad but okay. I was hoping by seeing him to possibly clarify things depending on the vibe. Since and including the breakup we have mostly texted and that is a breeding ground for miscommunication. I don't want to bring this up out of nowhere via text, I would rather do it in person. Seeing him face to face would be refreshing and much needed for both of us to take a temperature check as to where we are at presently, I think.

All in all the whole situation is delicate and I care deeply about him. I am okay not seeing him and leaving it as it is, but would love to. I just don’t know if it’s worth it. I don't want to be selfish. If I was to reach out to him, I think I would message first with a “in your hometown, thinking of you!” kinda thing to see his vibe before proposing meeting up.

I normally never react and just figure the person is busy.   


I read on Reddit how a lot of people get ghosted, the innocence that leads up to it, how people feel things are going great and then... nothing.   


I wanna share this story because it reminds me to stay in the positive light of things and to not take things too seriously.  


I have been messaging with a man that lives about 80 miles from me for over a week. I really like him. This feeling rarely happens before I meet a guy so I am super curious...  We are meeting irl next Tuesday.  


Daily, we message for hours back and forth with long breaks as we tend to our days. The texting started, as always, sliding into the sexting category. I kept it light, I do not send any nudes of me ever, I do not want any dick pics and he has respected that (so so surprised how many men think I want to see their dick before I even meet them. Just gross, guys, gross.)  


I got a little risque - for me - in sexting him Wednesday morning. He asked me to send him a nude, I just ignored it because I have already said once I wont do it. He was sitting in a care home tending to a relative with declining health , said he enjoyed the banter and had to get up to walk around to ""cool off"" with me getting more risque/descriptive. We chatted back and forth and then went about our days. No evening message from him. Hummm. I message at 10pm, he gives me a half assed response and tells me he is falling asleep, ttyl. Okay.....  


Nothing from him Thursday. By noon Friday, nothing.   


Imma sure I am getting ghosted. Because I got risque? Would not send a p\_shot? I dont know why actually but I am pretty sure I have been rejected.   


I send a text at noon on Friday, ""look, if you have changed your mind and moved on, just say so. I'm a big girl, I can handle it""  


2 hours later I sent a message to his OLD account saying, ""wow, I have never been ghosted before but I get it, I got a little wild. Thanks for the lesson, sincerely. Take good care of yourself.""   I did not unmatch with him. I went about my day.   


So just now, I get a call from him. His relative is not doing well. He only has 1 person to communicate with about this relative and that person was with him at the care center. His phone ran out of battery yesterday, he slept at the care center, he did not need his phone for anything. His last senior relative is dying.  He tells me it may be a few days before I hear from him, stops me from apologizing to him for the leap I took, saying he knew what it looked like and would have probably thought the same had roles been reversed.  


I feel a bit stupid for going straight to ""I fucked up and he is ghosting me"". Opens up a new area of personal growth for me, for sure.

We met on Bumble, which I had to delete because I needed a break, but have kept in touch through Snapchat and texting.  

I like him so far because I found him attractive from what I recall of his profile and he seems consistent and polite.  As in sends those good morning and good night texts every day, and asks how my day is going.  And he seems interested through things like him yesterday complimenting my Snapchat story selfie or congratulating when I share great news.  

I’d say I’m feeling a spark in that I’m always excited to hear from him.  The only concern I have is our talks being small talk-ish.  Like he and I seem to want the convos to continue but we don’t have much to say except asking what either of us are up to or how our day is going.  On the other hand, we are able to build off sometimes over things we share doing (ie what we ate, what movie we are watching, what I toured on my current summer trip, etc.).  And I’d say one good thing is he and I feel kind of comfortable on our own to bring up exciting news unprompted (ie “I caught up with an old friend today”).  And when I mentioned meeting up once I’m back from my trip, he said he’d love to hang (with a smiley emoji) and will have to see the vibe, but he thinks we will get along well.

I’d like to give meeting a chance and hope that maybe overall the connection may strengthen once we meet up in person, but thought I’d get a second opinion from the people of reddit on how the potential for us connecting after we meetup may be.

Some back story...

I said I'm asocial and I kinda like it... I don't speak to people much, I work from home (Even before the covid), I have a few friends, they're very old friends of mine (mostly from highschool and elementary school), we only play games online. Sometimes they meet up and ask me to join and I always say no. They know me so they don't make it a huge deal, sometimes they even come to my house and forces me to come with them, etc. But that's not the problem...

The problem is I've never dated a woman, it didn't bother me before but it does now. And by now I mean, since 2-3 years. Yet, I never even try to date a woman because I always think 'What would a woman want to do with me?' Though, I'm an above average looking guy, maybe even good looking. Many people surprise when I say I didn't have any girl friend before. But I'm short (174cm), and also many people on the internet say, it's not a bad height! But I can't help it... I feel so short and it really bothers me. I guess that's mostly about my inferiorty complex. 

Anyway let's get to the important part... 

Why am I writing all this, now? Well, I joined a sculpting class last week, (I do digital sculpting for living). To be honest, my main goal was to meet with a girl there while also improving my sculpting skills. And it happened.

Normally, I go there on Tuesdays, I was busy and I asked if I can come Friday instead of this Tuesday for just this week and the teacher said okay. When I got there there was no one around, I sat and started sculpting. After an hour a girl came. She said hello, sat next to me and started drawing. (She was a newbie and a hobbiest, normally you do drawing before sculpting). She started the conversation with me about my sculpt, she was very talkative and very into my works. I show her the things I done digitaly, we talked about my job, her drawings etc. And it felt really good. When the course finished I was very sad, because I go there on Tuesdays while she goes on Fridays. In my mind, I immediatly accepted that I won't be seeing her again and I was really sad, because she really was a nice girl who talks like she cares (also she's beautiful but I really don't care much about the physical traits of anyone other than myself but it was a plus for sure). BUT! While we were chatting I said to her, normally I came here on Tuesdays. And the next Tuesday, she showed up! I wasn't really expecting her to come, of course I'm not sure if she come on Tuesday for me or not but she was there! Again she said hi and sat next to me and we started chatting again. I said 'weren't you supposed to come Friday' she said 'well, I was free so I felt like coming' and giggled. After some time, I was sculpting a basic face while standing up, she commented on the eye of the sculpt and came next to me, (I mean really next to me, her body was 4-5 cm away from me and she started working on my sculpt while I held it. There was some contact there.)

Now before that point, I thought, she was a talkative, friendly girl who just wants to talk with me. But after that, I started to think maybe she likes me? I don't know what to do about it! Should I ask her out or something? If she refuses, my friendship with her will be ruined. IF she accepts, I literally have zero idea what to do next, also remember I said I'm insecure with my height. She's like 1-2 cm shorter than me and that makes me feels so bad. 

I really enjoy spending time with her and I guess she enjoy spending time with me, too. But I also feel like she's waaay above my league...

I've been on some of these dating subs throughout the week. I wanted to express some things that I know several others have as well. 

Firstly, if a friend comes to you for advice on a man/woman, please don't give advice based on how YOU currently feel about dating/relationships.  Give Advice to your friends based on what you believe, and not only what you listened to on a random podcast, read on a blog, website, book, etc. Listen to what they are telling you, and try to give advice to your friend that is logical and that will actually help them. 

**Friends Giving Advice on Dating:** 

* **Stop telling your friends that nice gestures are red flags or creepy.** If a man/woman says they love your friend after a week, then yes that's creepy! Otherwise, really ponder if the stuff the other person did for your friend was actually creepy or a red flag... and really ponder over what a red flag actually is. 
* **Stop making everything a red flag.** 
* **Don't be jealous i**f your friend is seeing someone who is better than your own partner, and so you sabotage it with the advice you give. 
* **Try to figure out how your friend has actually handled the situation** with the person when they approach you for advice (i.e. did they lead someone on already, have they had sex already, have they moved too quickly themselves, etc) Your friend may not be honest with you initially. Make sure they are being honest about the situation and how they've been in the situation before making judgements. 
* **Try to learn more about the man/woman through your friend** prior to giving advice. If your friend is only telling you dribs and drabs and then expecting you to give advice, ask more questions first. Get the full picture. 
* **Do you want your friend to be happy?** Is your friend happy because of the man/woman they are seeing? If so, don't say shitty things about the man/woman unless you have a VALID reason. 

**Men/Women Dating**

* Every dating situation is different. 
* **Stop comparing the current situation** you're in with someone, to a friend's' experience with dating or a prior experience you had. This is someone new lol. 
* Realize the speed at which you are moving, before telling someone their speed is too slow or too fast. **Maybe you're the one dictating the speed**, and the person is going with the flow? Don't fault the person immedialty. Maybe it was your fault as well? 
* **Don't** say you like someone if you arent sure yet. 
* **Don'**t say you like someone, they make you feel safe, I've never been this happy before etc, if you're still on dating apps and haven't had a conversation with the person about being exclusive. You're lying to the person and leading them on. 
* **Realize a dating situation can still be healthy if it moves quicker than an average relationship** at the beginning. Sorry for being honest! I know plenty of couples who were so hot and heavy off the bat, and have a healthy serious relationship or marriage now. 
* **Communication:** As soon as you develop different feelings or thoughts about the person you're seeing  (positive or negative) talk to them about that. Don't ghost them until you muster the courage to end it. Speak to them as soon as you can. 
* **Honesty:** Be yourself. Don't go on a date and put a facade on. You'll either be rejected or the person will be interested in your fake persona, and then be confused when the real person comes out. Also, if you're seeing someone for a week or longer, but still want to see other people/stay on dating apps, tell the other person what YOU want. If the person doesn't accept it, it's not the right situation for you, if they do, great. It's better to let the person know ahead of time, in case you meet someone or want to meet someone else. 
* **REAL RED FLAGS**: Racist, Sexist, Homophobic, Rude, Violent, Abusive (in any form), Maniuplative, Controlling, Trying to have sex on the first date even though you're not ready, Freaked out by them, They tell you a very sketchy story about themselves or something they are involved in, talk about themselves and don't ask you anything, etc. RUN RUN RUN to these and I'm sure I missed some too. These are actual red flags. 
* **Gestures**: If someone gets your flowers for example, don't overthink it. Think about why they got you the flowers? Was there something you said that made them get the flowers? Were they trying to cheer you up about something? comfort you for something? or isn't it just nice? Flowers don't mean I LOVE YOU. They're flowers. There's flowers in people's backyard gardens. We're not talking about a ring or jewelry ( that would be much if it was a new thing) 
* **Nice Comments about YOU:** Again, don't overthink the comments unless they are extreme. In which case, talk to the person about the comment they made. If it's too much and you are interested in the person still, tell them that and tell them why it was too much. If they try to argue, that's certainly a RED FLAG. If they accept it, see if they make the same comment again. If they do, make a decision on the situation. If they do after you've been dating for several months, is it a red flag anymore? Probably not. Also, have you said the exact same comments to the person that they're making to you? If so, the person isnt too blame and neither are YOU. You're both in a nice moment. 
* **Personal and Traumatic Details they Share with You:** We're all human. We've all been through highs and lows, some have had higher highs, and lower lows than others. If someone tells you about something horrible or traumatic that happened to them (which was not their fault) Be compassionate, understanding, kind, and warm to the person. Make them feel comfortable. They are already comfortable enough with you to share something super personal, show empathy and compassion back. Don't run away, don't tell your friends how screwed up it is, don't be a prick! I've read some unfortunate posts on here about people opening up to someone about something traumatic that occurred in their life, and about how horrible the persons reaction to that news was (ghosting, leaving after being told, etc)  If you arent able to accept that people have trauma but are OK with ghosting people, treating people like garbage, etc... you shouldn't be dating. I'm not saying you have to stay with someone or continue seeing someone if this makes you uncomfortable, but don't we all have our shit? 

Sorry for the vent/rant post, but I've read so many accounts of people getting ghosted, screwed over by positive experiences with dating, etc. I'm not saying everyone has to like the person they go on a first date with. Don't get me wrong.

Just please don't string people along (that you date in person) , don't take bad advice, listen to your heart and what feels right for YOU, be communicative with the person you're seeing or dating. If you've gone out on 3+ dates with someone, there's clearly interest. If not, what's the point? Why are you wasting both of your time? Therefore, if you think things are moving too quickly, communicate with the person about that! see what they say in response, and that will tell you a lot about if the situation is right for you. If you are interested, but there are things you want to say about stuff regarding the situation besides how fast or slow it's moving, please be honest with another person. Do not end things with someone and lie about what it was, but more importantly, do not put the **blame** on them if you want to end something for your own secret reasons ( i.e. you want to see other people, you lost attraction, you lost interest, etc) 

It will still suck for the other person if you say those honest things if they ring true to you, but it won't be as bad in the long run for them. Blaming them for something ending, is not only unfair, it leads to confusion and in some cases, hurt. It's borderline abusive to be honest. 

No rules in dating. What I wrote is from what I've experienced, and what I've read on this sub and other dating subs on reddit. It's my opinion, and you do you (you will regardless but I just wanted to put this out there) but just remember that we're all trying to figure life out. No one is perfect. Don't end things with someone you like or have interest in, because you think that them being a good person is a red flag. It's not.

I'm a virgin, I've never asked a girl out and never kissed anyone etc.

I've lived a bit of a weird life, I was bullied a lot at school and dropped out and then proceeded to home school myself for 4 years so I missed out on a lot of socialization during that period.

I did pretty well at teaching myself and was able to get in to a good college and then law school, graduated with degrees in economics and then law summa cum laude. I lived at home during college, commuted long distance, and didn't really socialize much, though I had a few friends etc.

After a lot of job interviews, I finally managed to get a really good and well-paying job in law which I started a few months back and am enjoying. For the job I have moved away to a new city and am living by myself in an apartment.

I'm at an impasse about how to approach pursuing a romantic relationship. A drunk girl friend of mine convinced me to start a bumble and tinder last week and I've had a few matches but I feel a bit weird about the whole thing and haven't really looked at it since last weekend. I would prefer to go about things more naturally with someone I know instead of some random pics on an app but I really have no idea how.

I'm about average height (5 foot 11) and about average weight (skinny-fat but not overweight). Honestly I've always had a bit of a complex about being ugly and I've never really attempted to groom or look good before getting my job this year, I'll put some pics in the comments so you can judge.

I feel like I need to sort this out asap before I get any older and even more pathetic.

Honestly, I think this guy is the one for me so I’m reaching out less to vent and more to ask for advice on being a supportive partner. For a great many reasons, my BF is kinda having a shit time emotionally. There is serious family friction, he’s been studying full time, and I’ve been supporting him since I work full time and have a decent job and he’s a student.I recognize that this is a tough time for everyone, but lately I’ve been noticing when he struggles with his mood (either depression or stress or dealing with family drama) he often gets snippy and will lash out at me randomly. I don’t mean anything abusive, but I’ll be affectionate and helpful and he’ll kinda act like a teenage boy. Getting mad about genuine mistakes, minor issues like me closing the cupboard too loudly, etc. I try to be sensitive and compassionate and just kind of toss it up to his emotional scalebeing out of balance. He regularly acknowledges he’s been a jerk or when I do get pissed after working a full time job, cooking when he has class, and just trying to relax, he knows he’s wrong and will apologize. For me this isn’t a deal breaker so much as a bad habit that I want to address. I’m looking for advice on how to be attentive and patient without being a doormat and how to read these signs as a cue for me to either quietly support him or outright have a conversation about what’s going on.

Note - he is an absolute gem of a human being and we are so similar and the love is clear. He’s had to deal with a lot of unhealthy relationships and he’s acknowledged himself that he’s working on processing his emotions better because he doesn’t want to lose me.

In the years since I had my first relationship for a few months that was awful overall, but it served to show me what I should look for in a relationship. I was finally emotionally ready to date for real.

Since then she’s with a guy now and she seems very happy and a part of me wants to be glad she’s happy but I am jealous as a motherfucker.

Every time I see her post on social media it’s just an aching reminder of what COULD’VE been. Now I’m just holding on waiting to see if she ever gets single again which makes me feel like an asshole because it’s selfish as fuck.

We still maintain snapchat streaks, and what’s always been weird to me is that a few years ago when we were flirting things got *ahem* steamy, and to this day she has them saved. I’m probably reading too far into this but if she was truly over me wouldn’t she at the very least unsave them?

It’s just hard to live with the fact that I 100% could’ve been with her and not knowing if it would’ve worked is killing me inside.
