0,pqvyl0,1632004180,What I’ve gathered about dating: Sharing My Lessons,"Here’s my advice to women dating men:

• Men ONLY care about your looks and sex appeal.

• Men do NOT care about your finances, your degree(s), your career, your career aspirations, your net worth/status as long as you look good to them.

• Men will approach women they find attractive and have friendly interactions with her.

• If a man is concerned about anything other than your looks and sex appeal - he’s not into you.

• 90% of a man’s attraction to you is from your looks and your body and how much he wants to sex you.

• 10% of a man’s attraction to you is how easy your personality is for him to get along with. No man wants to be at war with his wife or want to come home to drama constantly. Be easy to get along with.

• Women, do NOT treat your man like he’s one of your girlfriends, which means no sharing girly gossip with him. If a man prefers to gossip with you instead of doing physical/sexy stuff with you, he’s just not that into you.

• Men of means are happy to take care of you financially as long as he finds you attractive.

I have successfully finished a fun 12 hour second date with a lovely girl. We talked a lot and kissed at the end. We were very personal and open. We have so much in common with enough dissimilarity to find each other interesting and not be a carbon copy. 
What can I expect from here? 
Generally after a successful fun and engaging second date, what’s going on through her mind? We played this game “we’re not strangers” super fun and at the end it said write a note and send you’d partner home with it.

5,pqwost,1632006872,Feeling alone and can't handle it,"M(22) I have alot of self love and value in my myself as I overcame alot of things growing up. I've set myself up to be the best person I can for myself and someone else in the future. I just graduated with a Bachelors, I'm starting my career and finding new hobbies. However, I feel theres something im missing.

I keep myself busy with work and with hobbies, I've been teaching myself how to play guitar the last 2 years I just reached my 100th song i can play as I've picked up more recently the last few months. I have a great family and have a great group of friends we dont hang out often as everyone has work but we make the most of our free time. But once I'm sitting with myself and the only thing on my mind is the emptiness of static noise I break down.

I've tried online dating for a year now without anyone I match with taking a chance on me, I always end up in the ""let's just be friends becasue theres someone else"". I look at all my friends with their steady relationships and I can't help but want to feel the same way, to feel wanted and to have that special connection with someone.

I prefer online dating becasue I just dont see myself ever randomly approaching someone on looks alone especially if theres no signals that she wants to be approached. However I know I'm a fantastic guy and I know the person and relationship i can offer someone and it hurts knowing that i havnt been able to have that opportunity. I keep thinking about what it was like being with my ex (not thinking about her exactly) but thinking about having a bestfriend that always wants to see you, someone who loves you back. I miss going shopping for flowers, planning cute dates, singing someone a song on guitar, sending cute love songs to someone, dancing in public, going on trips, but most of all I miss looking forward to seeing someone.

I know one day that someone will come around but the uncertainty of when just kills me when it's just me and silence in my head.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqwost/feeling_alone_and_cant_handle_it/

8,pqx63m,1632008735,Break up or stay?,"I started seeing a guy [29] mid last year, been together for 1.5 years. He always proclaimed he hated social media. 2 months ago I saw him on Instagram while we were in bed together and he thought I was asleep. But out of the corner of my eye, I noticed all these girls in bikinis and saw him sending them DMs, couldn't see exactly what the messages said. Anyway, I didn't say anything because I wanted to know for sure before I jumped to any conclusions. I waited till he was fast asleep, then went through his phone to find out he had 4 Instagram accounts: 3 of which he used to message these bikini Instagram influencers. The messages were all along the lines of how hot they were and if they would like to make some money. Most of them never messaged him back but the occasional one would reply back and name their price to which he would pay and they would send a photo or video in exchange. Once I had hard evidence, I woke him up, and told him to pack his things and leave my house. FYI I live alone and he stays over at mine almost every night. He was in tears, said he was sorry and that it was a bad habit he had acquired and he'd been doing it for 6-7 years. He said it was wrong and he shouldn't have been doing it. Backstory is I used to work in the adult entertainment industry on weekends in addition to my office job prior to meeting him but due to covid lockdown, the industry shut so at the time we met, I was just working my office job. I was open and honest with him about my past because I didn't want it to come up in conversation and be a surprise and if he accepted that about me, then we could be happy together. Once things lockdown lifted for a brief 6 months, I had an opportunity to go back to the industry; and I was tempted because of the money; but I chose not to because he had said previously that it would make him feel uncomfortable. He never tried to control me and never told me not to go back. He even said that he didn't want me to put my life on hold for him if that's what I wanted to do. He was always very understanding and never treated me differently after I told him which made me even more attracted to him and why I decided not to go back in the end. He persued me for a very long time. I certainly did not make it easy for him but he showered me with flowers, gifts, notes, spoilt me on my birthday taking me to fancy restaurants, cocktail bars, and a beautiful hotel. He always and still does cute little things to make me smile. Pour me a glass of wine, write cute messages and notes, watches educational videos on how to cook and make cocktails so he can make me dinner and drinks (he has never ever cooked prior to meeting me before in his life), gives me foot, back rubs and massages, etc. When I finally gave in and said yes let's be together, we were both very happy. He always made me feel special. But then finding this out has made things very difficult. I have lost all trust as it just makes me wonder what else he's hiding. He assured me that this was the extent of it and he's never changed the password on his phone the whole time I've known him. He leaves his phone near me whenever he comes over signalling to me that if I want to go through it I can. But I just don't believe him. And even though it's not physical cheating, I just feel like if he can do this online with random strangers then he can also do it with people he knows which could then lead to this happening in real life down the track. I told him that it wasn't the act of messaging these girls that was the issue, the issue was that I opened up to him about my past and sacrificed the weekend adult entertainment job and the extra coin I enjoyed because I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable; yet he couldn't give this one habit up for me and lied about having social media accounts the whole time saying how much he hated them. I really want to move past this and give this relationship another try but I don't know. I keep fixating on what has happened. Should I break up with him or should I give him another chance? And if I do give him another chance, how do I stop fixating on the negative past and my distrust towards what has happened? What steps do I need to implement in order to learn to trust him again and/or hold him accountable so it doesn't happen again in the future?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqx63m/break_up_or_stay/
9,pqx6vt,1632008818,Could use a bit of help figuring out what might be going on here.,"Ok, first off I am not a social person in the sense that I understand other peoples social motivations. I can read people fine, it's just the social stuff is my blind spot. Anyway I have a co worker who prior to quarantine gave off the vibe of being asexual and mousey.  Now that I am back at work she seems to talk with me more than she did before. Mind that before, i was just a guy who sat with one of her friends during lunch at work, and she and I did not talk directly further than one of us telling a funny story or something during lunch like the rest of the table.  Anyway 2 other girls at the office along with the other girl and I walk during our breaks and I'm not sure if I'm being considered a work friend or if she is considering me as a friend, that last one being someone who could become more than friends where a work friend is the equivalent of being in the friend zone so to speak.  During the walks she seems to focus on talking with me more than the other two girls and has confided in me about some of her personal issues when it's just her and I walking.  I'm probably not describing it that well, but that stuff wasn't much of an issue. It's just that I tried to test things the other day and went for a walk when I knew it was raining, minor rain that picked up a few minutes after leaving the building. It was just her and I and I thought she'd opt to use a side entrance to make the walk shorter, but she stuck around as I made the full walk, leaving us both soaked and I've noticed she's been getting closer to me during the walks.

Not gonna lie, this quarantine has seriously dulled whatever skills I had before when interacting with people. Toss in that I have a shining knight complex when it comes to this woman, because to me she is small, vulnerable, and generally the type of person that I'd try to protect if shit went postal at work.

Should probably mention that in the looks department I'm lackluster at best, but my wit makes up for some (I swear I'm a big brain when it comes to most other things 😅) and if I had to put a number on myself I would say a 4.

10,pqx75x,1632008850,Opinions regarding women im dating,"Hi, I'm 27M and have started dating a 27F woman we have been on two dates so far, both have been dinner (I personally don't really like dinner dates and prefer activities but struggle to find a time when we are both free which isn't around dinner time lol)

What throughout both dates I get the impression that she isnt that interested and is comfortable like she likes my company but that's it. We have made no physical contact really apart from hugs, she laughs at my jokes and asks me questions about me etc but doesn't give much eye contact.

In between dates text wise it has mostly been me texting and iniating and she doesnt try to keep the conversation going that long most of the time, I know she is talking to other guys too which is fine I am too (women lol not guys) but she seems to always be on the dating site and rarely messages me. I messaged her recently and say Hey Miss POF (POF) being the dating site and she said hey Mr POF, i said wuu2 and she said the same as you ;) I said I'm chatting to you and she said and a million other girls ;) 

She doesnt always reply to my messages even when she is online. First date I paid for the meal and she insisted on getting the desserts, second date she wanted to split the bills. 

Before the second date she also said she is free the week after too as she has a day off, so at the end of the second date I said see you next week and she said OK. 

I am confident that will see each other again for the next date, but I feel her lack of initiating over the phone and seeming like lack of interest on the date coupled together make me feel like I need to definitely stop pursuing as if things were to stay like this I wouldn't be that interested. 

After a second date also she was also online on the dating app lol seemingly always on it, just feel like normally or with my other dates and women chat after the date or they at least message me after the date or something, but feel like if straight after the date and maybe most other times she is chatting to other guys and not much with me at all makes me feel like it isn't worth pursuing to me just baffles me a bit why she would want to continue seeing me if this is the case.

What are your thoughts guys? I know I am definitely not going to  initiate any texting until she does now and then still match her interest  because otherwise if this continues it would be like banging my head against a wall lol.

I also feel I will become less interested by pulling back like I am, because personally with me I'm normally kind of going all in if i like someone and having fun etc, so if she wouldn't match my interest like she doesnt seem to be I will lose interest definitely.

13,pqxaiy,1632009227,Did this girl F(20) lead me on for attention and ego boost or did I M(20) read the signals wrong,"Did I M(21) read the signals wrong or was this girl F(20) leading me on for attention and validation

Would you consider this being lead on?

I’m not sure if I was lead on or I was reading the signals wrong from one of my collage mates 

1. Like one time a romantic song come up and she whispered in my ear that the song  has potential to  describe us in the future. 

2. One time she even come to me and was like I’m the only girl that can make you listen to juice wrld cuz what we have is special.  But I tried to use juice wrld to make a flirty joke the week before and she give a disgusted look. 

3. Then she even opened about her depression and suicidal thoughts to me and said I’m the only person she’s ever told 

4. Then when we were working on the second physics exam I must have been like this is so nostalgic cuz we meet on the first Phsycis exam deadline so I was like do you remember the date we meet on. I swear this had to be on purpose she was like I can’t remember because we have never been on a first date. I don’t think she could have misunderstood my question that badly. 



5. Even one time wen watching a movie as a group she was dangling her foot and then decided to lift her whole leg  up which blocked my whole screen of the movie and she was like I’m sorry I’m sorry.  I just felt like it was on purpose. 

I was getting ready to ask her out on a date but then I heard some bad news 

My friend  calls me and he was like he was talking to this girl the other day and on the phone she was like there’s this guy that I use to like but I don’t like him anymore if you can guess him I will tell you if it’s right and then my friend said my name and she was like straight away nooooooooo and put up some weird face expression and was like don’t get me wrong I don’t hate the guy but he’s so annoying at times and he’s such an overreactor I could never date him. 

There were definitely other factors that made me think I had to no chance 

but I just can’t understand why she was flirting and telling me her  deepest secret and  especially the song the way she whispered into my ears. 

Now I’m avoiding her and ignoring her and she’s telling everyone I’m mad at her because she refused to go on a walk with me which is so far from the truth she’s making me seem so petty. I was going to ask her out at the end of a walk but she didn’t even come and I learnt the info from my friend that she would ever date me so I decided to cut her off and not set up a second walk. 


At the end I really feel like she used me for validation and attention as she would come to every time she wanted to be uplifted and be like you don’t think I’m stupid etc. She also used me for exam help. I have a feeling she enjoyed this whole experience and probably knew I liked her but just wanted to get an ego boost especially because before uni she didn’t know many males 

It really hurts I really did care about this girl but the way she trashed me on the phone it’s unacceptable and I can’t stay there for her even as a friend

21,pqy32s,1632012393,"Complicated spot, she's not ready but advances things. Then pulls back, afraid.","To summarize a very long and complicated history.

Backstory: known each other 15 years. Was engaged in 2009. Lost child, it broke us. Couldn't fix things for five years. Split for another 5. I found out she was struggling in an abusive coliving situation with an abusive ex and kids. Moved 1000 miles to help her get the kids and independence. ( Because I don't want her to lose her kids because being a mom is what I always wanted for her ).

Now: I've been here about two months. First day we went out. And later that night she literally broke down for five hours ( no exaggeration ). About how awful things have been. And how she's hasn't had a chance to be herself In 10 years. How abusive and just awful luck she has had since she left. And just praised me for who I was and couldn't believe I even came there to help her when no one else she knew ever helped her.

We made the deal to focus on her kids first above all. Get her out of that situation. I would always be open and never take advantage of her. We carried on but over the few weeks things changed. We are adults now, perfect chemistry. And honestly can see with the benefit of hindsight how much we inspired one another's personalities. Both taken with one another. Both interested in making things work one day.

Event: I'm honest with her and she knows I want to build a life with her. And she's honest about loving me. But she's Soo down on herself like she's a failure. Says she's not ready or feels like she deserves to be loved. She's afraid. But time and time again slowly advances things and pulls back. Until one night, we had sex. We slow danced, she has us embrace in front of a mirror and she kept asking how we didn't fix things. Or how great we look together. Then pulled me aside and asked me if she was what I truly wanted. And of course I said yes. Then the next day says she's sorry. Says she shouldn't have done that and should go back to being friends. She's not ready.

I tried talking about it a few weeks later, since we talk all the time and I'm the one helping her with things. And she just tells me she's not ready. Shes afraid to be loved and doesn't know how to move forward. Just wants to be friends. Says she trust me and believes me but doesn't know how to push forward...

Question: but where does that leave me? Or how is it fair? I didn't advance things. But emotions have been shared. I understand she wants to get her life figured out before commiting. But I can't just move on, date people with these emotions on my mind. And if I did I would feel like I'm cheating or something. Or that I'm betraying her and just ditching her. But at the same time she doesn't want anything, not even to be touched. I don't know how to handle this. She's 100% the one. I'm the person who works to build things with people, but she doesn't trust anyone and wants to do it herself.

Even worst when I try to treat her like a friend, she gets mad that I'm acting differently towards her. Recently she was in the ER for 9 days and I was literally the only person who came to see her and kept her company in video calls.

Women are objectively more shallow than men. The reason so many women complain about dating isn’t because they have had a hard time it’s because the demographic of which they are all attracted to is not giving them attention. Women are hypergamous and date above their looks. This is why hate for women is justified.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqy4f2/women_are_by_far_more_shallow_than_men/
23,pqy82c,1632012973,I’m not funny ….,"…or goofy. I just cannot make women laugh or do goofy kind of things on first dates or even with women i am very comfortable with and have been in relationship for months for that matter. And I feel it’s just who I am. I will take part in goofy things if you initiate it but that’s about it. If i look for advice anywhere about first dates or what girls like or what I have noticed in my school/university as well is that funny and goofy is actually what women like. 

A bit of context, I am M24 who recently moved to the states and I am trying to put myself out there more often to have more experiences and also hopefully find someone. But I feel I always strike out in the first date or even before that when trying to have a conversation before the date. I am not very good at flirting either and probably wait way too long to break that touching barrier on dates as I am always overthinking about boundaries which I sometimes notice are very far ahead from the point I hesitate to cross. 

I am very comfortable with my personality/looks and I don’t hesitate asking women out straightforward when I find someone attractive. I have been on a couple of dates recently, but they never go anywhere. After the first dates I end up feeling like it was good, we had some nice conversations for a couple of hours and there was no awkward silences but that isn’t enough to get me onto second/third dates and I think it’s because of my lack of ability to make dates fun, goofy or something like that.

Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqy82c/im_not_funny/

I’m also actually really shy and quiet, but I’m tall, in shape and usually dress well and get a lot of attention (I think just because I stand out a bit). His friends were also always trying to hit on me and he always seemed really shy and nervous around me. Anyway, he recently moved away - just before I was about to finally ask him out - so two weeks ago, I texted him asking if he’d like to grab coffee sometime. I figured he’s shy, maybe intimidated, I have to make the first move and voila we will finally go out. To my horror, he never replied.

I recently found out from a mutual friend that he actually just lost his job and had to move in with family. That’s why he left suddenly. 

I feel so badly for him, especially because if he did like me (which I’m pretty sure he did), I probably just made him feel even worse. I’m trying to move on already. Obviously, he has more important things to worry about, but I can’t help still hoping he’ll eventually get back to me. I liked him so much. And if he actually wasn’t interested and I completely misread the signs - oh well. But I hate that he could actually like me and just feels too ashamed right now to even talk to me. And I’m afraid to bother him again - I don’t want to harass him if he’s not interested or just make things worse.

I wasn't really doing anything special, I just talked to her normally about things and listened to her problems. Eventually she sent me a nude, and we sexted for a while (my first time and I Have to say it was fun!). She said some pretty bizarre things during our conversations though, which I won't divulge necessarily, but suffice to say there were some big red flags (one thing she said was that the last time she talked like this to someone she got pregnant!).

Since it is close to impossible to check boxes on all kinds of interests, it has also become ok to find multiple people to share different things to do with, and get that instant gratification the company provides.

Fwb, situationships and casual relationships also exist for any needs in that area.

Rinse and repeat.

34,pqywb0,1632015680,Girl not over her ex," 

31m met a 29f online. First date was great, we had great energy throughout and talked for hours, and found we had a lot in common. She mentioned her ex, but just a passing reference tied in to a conversation we were having, so I shrugged it off. When she got home she immediately asked for a 2nd date. Later sent her available days, when I gave her one she picked a place.

So she's interested I thought.

Picked up where we left off to start the 2nd date. We talked for 4 hours at a bar, most of it was great. She mentioned her ex again, and revealed that she had only been single for a couple weeks, maybe a month. And that relationship had lasted 4-5 months, and she thought they were going to get married. Red flags started flying in my head and the vibe shifted a bit. Nothing terribly awkward, but we weren't going 100mph anymore. She was a little cold and shying away from being affectionate, there was no kiss. I was really surprised because for the most part we were hitting it off and she was being very warm and showing every sign of interest. Anyway, 15 minutes after I left she texted me again saying she had a great time and wanted to do it again. I set up the 3rd date..

3rd date was a couple nights ago and it was a train wreck of awkwardness. I don't need to go in to detail, it was just way off. We went to an arcade and it was very loud in there, so talking was difficult. After that I drove her to her car, conversation picked up pretty well but she had to go. She asked me to walk her to her car. They were jackhammering just around the corner so again we couldn't hear each other well. It ended with another awkward no kiss ending.

So I finally confronted her. I asked what the deal is and if she is interested in me or not. If not to just tell me so I can move on, that I'd be okay. She let it out that she's having a hard time getting past her ex and has been having a hard time dealing with life post breakup. And that she needs to move slower than usual. And she was worried that the date was so awkward. I explained that her mixed signals have confused me and I didn't know how to respond, which made things awkward.

She proposed a 4th date to ""see if things can be relaxed again"". I countered with a phone call which she accepted. We can't really do it until Tuesday, so I'm just kind of stuck in limbo until then.

Idk what to do. I've never been in this situation before. Normally I would just cut my losses and start over but I kind of like her, and she told me she likes me. We were vibing in the beginning and have a lot in common, and I'd like to explore that if possible. My life is pretty stable and I'm usually pretty grounded, but this whole thing has been a roller coaster of emotions for me with the hot/cold.

35,pqz3b9,1632016473,How to start dating after college with no experience at all.,"This will be long, please bear with me.

I am a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug this summer after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and introversion/slow to open up.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, you just dont meet many people your age after school it seems.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

Slow to open up. I have a hard time being flirty with girls before I am friends with them. I dont want to use the term demisexual (as I am not that), but I can relate to those people and that idea of needing to be close to someone before moving a relaitonship beyond a friendship. I also dont want to use the term friendzone, but it honestly feels that way most of the time. We become friends and then after some time, I think about asking her out as I start to develop feelings, but she only sees me as a friend. I have lost quite a few friends this way and frankly I dont want to lose any more and I feel broken because of it.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"". I have been also told that I am too genuine for my own good.

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

Getting out more - over the last month I have gone out to the local ""downtown scene"" with friends on a somewhat regular basis. Trying new restraunts, shops, etc. and generally getting out more. Though, I just feel too young for that croud (surrounded by young families mostly), and too old for the college scene that exists.

Meetup - none exist in my area for things I am interested in, so I made one. A short hike to the top of a popular hill for the sunset and astronomy viewing. No one showed up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

Thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqz3b9/how_to_start_dating_after_college_with_no/
36,pqz6mr,1632016843,My Last Bumble Date Ever,"This post may be a little long but I promise you, it’s one of the worst and best first date stories you will ever read! 100% true story.

I (28F at the time) had moved to Tennessee in 2018 and was only there for a month or so before I started using Bumble. I had been on a couple of first dates that didn’t turn into anything before I started talking to this man who had just moved there from Ohio, let’s call him Byron (20’sM). It was only a handful of days that we were messaging when he asked me if I wanted to go watch the Browns game at a local bar with him, his friend, and his roommate. A public place with a group of friends seemed like a low pressure first meeting, so I accepted. He asked if I wanted to meet an hour before the game at a brewery right next door to the sports bar, so that we could get to know each other one-on-one, before meeting up with his friend and roommate.

I get to the brewery first but wasn’t waiting long when he got there. He looked like he did in his photos, a little shorter than I had expected, but height isn’t a dealbreaker for me. The conversation was the normal getting-to-know-you stuff but I knew fairly quick that it wasn’t a particularly great connection so I wasn’t thinking it would go anywhere. What sealed my decision on that was at some point he found something very funny and when he laughed it was SO LOUD and his face turned into something out of a cartoon. Huge, top and bottom teeth showing grin, eyes wide open about to pop out of his head type of laugh. I remember myself sitting back a little bit in surprise at the outburst of laughter and thinking “Well that’s a no.” I have a strong want to never feel embarrassed by the person I’m with. And his crazy, loud laugh made me want to turn to everyone at the brewery and announce that we weren’t together. 

After about an hour of us talking at the brewery he said his friend texted him from the sports bar and was saving a table for us to watch the game, let’s call her Brittany (20’sF). I wasn’t surprised by this because he did say we would be watching the game with his friend and roommate. When we got to the bar, Brittany and I instantly hit it off. She was so welcoming to me, giving me recommendations for good food and drink in town since I was still new to the area and we had the same sense of humor so we were cracking up in no time. Byron was mainly watching the game, which was fine since I’m not a huge sports fan and had Brittany to talk to. 

At some point, Byron goes to the bathroom and while Brittany and I were talking she asked me how I knew Byron. I told her we had only been talking for a few days on Bumble and this is the first time I’m meeting him. She giggled a little and said, “That’s funny, I have been talking to him on Tinder and this is the first we are meeting each other.” I WAS SHOCKED. He had invited 2 women out on a dual first date under the same guise of watching the game with his “friend and roommate” (Brittany confirmed he had told her the same thing). I felt disrespected for Brittany and myself for being asked here under false pretenses. It’s alright if you want to date other people but at least be honest about it. Did he think we were that dumb or that he was that slick that we wouldn’t figure it out?! 

Before he got back from the bathroom, Brittany and I both agreed that we were having a great conversation, so we exchanged numbers to hangout again. When Byron got back to the table we didn’t say much to him. I started texting Brittany under the table to ask her if she wanted to leave and go grab a drink at this bar down the street where I had heard a cover band playing 90s hits. I was prepared to tell Byron that we figured out his game and that he shouldn’t deceive anyone in this way again, before letting him know we were leaving. Brittany and I had our tabs open at the bar so we both got up to close them out. While waiting to close out at the bar, Brittany turned to me and said, “Yeah, I might be into him if it wasn’t for that fucking laugh.” I burst out giggling, “That fucking laugh, right?!” I knew then that I had made a friend out of this weird experience, at least. 

We get back to the table after closing our tabs but Byron looked like he was waiting for us to get back and said that he needed to go downstairs (we were on the second floor of this bar) to grab his friend who had just arrived. I had assumed it was this roommate he had told us about, maybe that one thing he said was truthful, so we waited because people were quickly taking any tables that opened up. He came back with his friend, let’s call him Billy (20’sM), and Brittany and I start talking with him. He was so nice! He worked as a nurse, loved ciders like I do (I’m allergic to hops, so can’t have beer. It sucks.) and he and Brittany were giving me cider brewery recommendations in town. He even got me a Washington Apple shot because he bought everyone else a round of beers and I had mentioned I grew up in WA. All of this was going on while Byron was just watching the game and not really talking too much. 

Brittany leaned over to me while the guys were distracted by the game and asked if we could actually stay because she was liking Billy. I told her, “No problem, I’ll be your wing woman and keep crazy over here entertained.” After that whispered check in, while I was talking with Billy he said something that had made my “gay-dar” go off. Just wanting to give Brittany a heads up, I leaned over and mentioned that she may strike out with Billy. I said I could be wrong in my assumption though so we agreed just to leave it and see how the night went. 

A little bit after that Byron goes to the bathroom, again. Brittany then turned to Billy and asked the same question she did me, “So how do you know Byron?” Billy said that he and Byron had been talking on Tinder and this is the first time they were meeting each other!!! Brittany and I whip our heads towards each other with this knowing look of utter amazement that we were in an unbelievably, crazy triple first date situation! We just kept laughing hysterically because we didn’t know what else to do! Billy probably thought we were kind of crazy but hadn’t asked about the outburst of laughter. 

Right when Byron got back to the table, Billy left for the bathroom. Brittany then turned to Byron and said something to the effect of, “So, Billy told us how you guys met!” And Byrons face dropped and instantly went white. He then stood up and starts clapping and cheering at the game but I looked and nothing was really even happening on the field and no one else in the room was cheering. I think he just wanted to not be in that awkward moment. Brittany then looked to me with a smile and said, “I’m ready to leave now.” We said our goodbyes to Billy who got back not long after Byrons cheering and Byron barely even looked us in the eye as we left. Looking back, I wish I had clued Billy into what Brittany and I knew and asked if he wanted to come grab a drink with us. He was such a down to earth guy and easy to get along with. I think I just wanted to get away from Byron as quickly as possible.

Brittany and I went to the bar with the 90s cover band and they were appropriately playing “Bye Bye Bye” by *NSYNC, which we sang very loudly together and had such a fun end to the night. It’s been almost 3 years since then and Brittany and I are best friends. We are both happily in committed relationships and I’m so excited to be in her wedding next summer! 

I’ve always wondered, what were Byrons reasons or motives for setting up a triple first date? Did he want to get the first date out of the way with the three people he was talking with and then decide who he wanted to see again? Or was he hoping for some foursome action if we all got along together? Maybe he was wanting to play the odds and hoping to go home with at least one of us that night.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqz6mr/my_last_bumble_date_ever/

I’m assuming my friend thought I meant we were just friends because he told me this.

“Me and her used to chill together, we hooked up a few times and she is crazy in bed”. I of course didn’t want to hear this but now I have and I don’t really like her as much anymore.

43,pqzul7,1632019588,"If a relationship doesn’t work out, move on. Trying to win back an ex is a waste of energy and opportunity, and will usually yield the same results","One of the biggest myths that many buy in to is that there is only one special person out there for them. This limiting mindset leads to neediness, a willingness to please, putting their partners on a pedestal, and other self-sabotaging behaviors.

If the relationship doesn’t work, someone in this frame of mind will waste precious time and opportunity on their ex, who either rejected them, or just simply isn’t compatible.

This flawed belief of ‘the one’ leads to fixation on an idealized, fantasy version of their ex, not the real person. That person’s negative qualities and the issues in the relationship are overlooked or ignored, because romantic hopes are being projected onto them, instead of realizing that things ended for a reason.

Do not buy into the myth. There is not one single soulmate for everyone. Based purely on population numbers, there are a multitude of people that you would connect with. It’s tragic to see this opportunity traded in for fixation on an imagined, idealized version of someone.

The best relationships come when there is mutual prioritization. Trying to convince someone to take you back will typically yield the same results. For whatever reason, they felt they didn’t need you in their lives at some point, enough to cut things off. Even if you manage to win them back, they still inherently do not value you. Once the infatuation fades again, the same issues will typically come to the surface again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqzul7/if_a_relationship_doesnt_work_out_move_on_trying/

56,pr06xs,1632021041,What really is the issue?,"I’m a (30f) with a 5yo, who was dating a guy for the last 5 months. 2 weeks ago he broke up with me. For some reason I can’t seem to understand why with the answers given. Usually when he would call, he would have to go sooner than I’d like so I had a tendency to want him to stay on the phone longer. Or recently when he was sick, I still wanted to talk after he said his throat was hurting. So on the day he did the breaking up, he complained of that. That he can’t take me doing that when he feels tired to talk long that sometimes when he calls, it’s just to hear my voice, not to talk for hours. He also said he thought about my child. For him, he wants to have a family and seems to accept my little one who I waited 4 months before they met, but he wants to completely be that father figure. And I understand but I tried to explain that it would be unfair to exclude her father. He claimed anything concerning me having a child is a minor reason. 

We have so much chemistry when we are together. He acknowledges that all the time. But when we are apart the communication was difficult. He doesn’t really use his phone to text or even use social media. I like texting and enjoy long phone talks. He was not born in the US as I was and his dating experiences are different in the sense that he’s experienced the most with me. As far as being loving goes. He says he felt pressured to say I love you. I told him that he never had to say it and I would happily dial back. 

Well….last week he had me come to his place. After I was spending my days trying to cope. Of course I went. It was like nothing happened. Like no breakup happened. 

2 days ago I show up to his place and he was so happy. Each time I have seen him, he says he loves me all through the day, compliments me, cuddles, just all the things you would expect.since I met him he has said that I am the sweetest, most beautiful, confident, awesome girl he’s ever been with. Today before getting home I just wanted to understand why….if you feel so many ways about me why can’t we be? He has seemed so conflicted in his feelings. Said he has imagined us married over and over. But that he doesn’t want to feel like he made a mistake 5 years or so from now. But about what? It doesn’t feel clear to me. He even said tonight he knows he’s going to to regret his decision. How can he say all the things, do all these things with me, and still not want me? Yes, I like talking to my partner a lot especially at first. I understood where he was coming from and have gotten better about it. Idk if maybe the cultural differences play a part? He also would say he doesn’t care about traditions. We really do have the most explosive chemistry…the most I have ever experienced so early in. He told me not to blame myself. But I am mad at myself. I shouldn’t have gone there this time. It hurts to be wanted by him but then not enough for a relationship. Why is he so conflicted? Other than me having a child and that small communication hiccup I just don’t get it. He knew from the start I had a child so if that was the reason then it’s more hurtful. Would rather him have said it from the beginning.

Once you read that, it will make more sense.

Anyways, we were having sex, it was all good and it was mutually initiated which was nice. We’ve been going at it for a good 15-20, she’s going down on me, so when she’s done, I pick her up to turn her around to lay her on the couch, legs in the air and all, and I see a weird look in her face, so I ask “what’s wrong” she says “nothing”…. Now I’m a guy so I know what nothing means.. it means something. So we stop, I don’t want to force her… so we’re just there staring at each other butt naked, and she says, “wanna lay down and cuddle for a bit?” I’m like, “okay?……” so we’re spooning and we’re just laying there… so I ask her what’s wrong what’s wrong, she says “let’s just lay here for a bit”, and then about 2 minutes later (keep in mind we’re still butt naked) she starts singing a song and then says, “okay so we go to bed?” Like is this girl fucking serious?????? so now I’m annoyed because it’s already rare that we make love (maybe once a week since we don’t live together), and for the last 2-3 times, there’s been something like this to happen, so
I’m kid of frustrated. So she asks me what’s wrong, so I tell her verbatim, “I just don’t like how most of the time when we make love recently there’s always something that turns you off, or how you suddenly decide you want to go to bed when we are in the middle of having sex. Being intimate with you is an important part of this relationship and the constant rejection lately is taking a huge toll on me, and I just want to be as open with you as I can about my needs”

Well……………. That didn’t go well.

Instead of “I hear you, and I’m going to work on this, and I want to share with you what turns me on what turns me off so that next time we don’t have this kind of awkward encounter, I’m sorry and I love you” and maybe we’ll continue.

See what I got back was, “OMG you’ve told me this already get over it, Jesus Christ you ask for so much from me and it’s exhausting” so I asked her, “what do I ask if you?” And she can’t give me an answer because she knows that the only things I actually ask her to do is to make time for us, which is apparently asking for too much. I tell that I would appreciate it that my needs are met, as I do my best to meet here, and her response… “ya but my needs are normal, be honest with me, move in with me, get a joint bank account with me” and my response was, “and having sex and being intimate with your partner is not normal?” 

Now instead of talking about it, she gets up get dressed and storms off and goes to bed, and then says I was yelling at her, which is very silly because I 100% wasn’t, she just says that to justify storming off and not facing the conversation where she may have to work on changing.

She then says, “well maybe this just isn’t working then!!!!”
So when I don’t meet her needs, she literally threatens to break up with me, but when I tell her my needs aren’t being met, instead of telling me that she’ll meet them or at least try, like I’ve done for her,
No she tells me “then we should break up if you’re no happy” What the hell is wrong with her?

Sending them a message expecting a reply because, hey, they matched with you. Then you decide to send them a message, perhaps a cheesy joke, or some kind of remark about something on their bio, anything to break  the ice. Then, 1 hour goes by, nothing. 1 turns to 2 which in turn becomes infinite. I'm not here to complain about it, I just find it strange. I just can't comprehend how the mind of someone who does that work. I'm just wondering if there is something psychologically wrong with them and they just can't communicate with the person they matched with or something?

81,pr2adg,1632030510,I Had Two Dates With This Girl and Met Her Parents Both Times. Is that a Red Flag?,"Some months ago, I've met  this girl on Tinder that i really liked, but it had one major problem: we both study in the same college ( she attends nursery classes and im an industrial designer student) but we currently live in diferent cities ( as classes were only online during the pandemic, she went back to her parents house, thats in a city 40 minutes from where i live). So as we had this hard time meeting, we talked online, made video calls, etc etc.

But, in august, she came to my city and we had our first date, as her parents brought her ( obviously they had not stayed with us, they went minding their own bussiness). But by the end of the date, i left her on a meeting point where she would find her parents car and go back home and I called my uber, but she called me and said her parents insisted on giving me a ride. As they really insisted, i've accepted the ride besides feeling  weirded out for meeting her parents on the first date.

Ok, now let's jump to today. I went to her city to visit her ( the uber was not as expensive as a thought) and our plan was to go somewhere to talk and eat. As I was in the uber, i was thinking in a million ways that I could tell her that i would not want to meet her parents during this second date in a polite way,  I arrive and she invites me to her apartment. ""Ok, now thats a twist, only me and her on the apartment"", but, as she opened the door, who was there? HER MOTHER. Gladly I was wearing a COVID mask to hide my face of confusion and despair. She started talking to me, and out of nowhere she started giving  me a major mother speech, talking about their family, some overprotectly stuff, etc etc (it took ten minutes or more). So after that, i went with the girl to her balcony to talk, but her mother went there sometimes ( read: a lot of times) to chat with us a little. As it was getting late, and i was about leave, her father arrived and just complimented me ( thanks for not giving a speech). And to put the cherry on the top of the cake, her parents said this: "" now lets see if you will come back""


Now the question: Am I wrong to be totally weirded out by meeting her parents? Was this a major red flag that I should pay attention to? Or it is totally normal and i should not worry about it?


Even though ive been talking to her since may, and mostly online, i felt she jumped a lot of steps by making me meet her parents.

84,pr2jtu,1632031796,Do women know ahead of time that they aren't responding to messages when they give out their number.,"So I'm not going to whine and say is trike out with every girl. Because it's a ration at best. But one question dawned on me. 

I have gotten phone numbers a coupon of times, when I text either no reply or they just stop answering. 

I know for a fact  that they have me their number b cause their profile cues will appear on ""friends you should know"" on Facebook. Now Often it becomes a non issue one they don't respond.  I just move on but the curiosity still sits.

My question then is: do women do this on purpose. Do they already come primed to give out their number and not respond? 

Why not be clear and state that they have no interest?

When I dotn want to attempt anything with a woman I either make it clear when we first meet. Or I follow up with letting them know I'm not interested through text (just trying to be clear and alleviate the process)

Illuminate my mine ladies.... What's the point of this?

I hate small talk and I know it’s not my strong suit, so I just can’t find the guts to step forward and try it with someone.

I’m kind of conflicted bc she seems like a good person, she’s pretty cool personality wise, but physically she’s not my type, and it’s not that I’m not attracted to her, I just usually don’t like girls like her. 

I was talking about it with a friend and he said I don’t have to make any decisions and it sounded like she just got out of something fairly recent, I’m not looking for a serious relationship, and so I would love to have a FWB and just experiment sexually with her. For some reason I just don’t see anything long term with her bc I just don’t feel that spark, I don’t feel nervous around her, and I’m pretty indifferent to whether we keep seeing each other. 

I figure she likes to party, as do I, so next time we go out we can get drunk have sex and I’ll just lay it out for her, and judging by the situation she’s in (seems like just out of a relationship) I’m guessing a FWB would be something she might be interested. Like I just want someone I can cuddle with, have sex, whatever, while I figure myself out more and get some more sexual experience.

96,pr478u,1632040617,How do career obsessed people find others who understand?,"When I looked at the calendar today, I realized that I could not for the life of me remember a single thing that happened to me in the month of August. All 7 days of the week have melted into a blob. I can't tell you what I did this Monday and Tuesday. At all. I can't tell the difference between days anymore. The only way I could tell the passage of time these last 2 months is that I would go to my girlfriend's house on the weekends. 

I broke up with my girlfriend today and went out with some friends for drinks afterward. I was reflecting on the relationship and I thought of how long we were together, almost 3 months. I started a new job 3 weeks after we met and every single day between then and today is one single blob. I cannot tell you a single thing I did in August. In my mind it is July. Some past events feel near but turns out they actually happened in June. I am a drone. I code, I read, I eat the fastest thing I can to get back to more work, I put off showering until after work. I can't fall asleep at night because I feel guilty for not putting my ideas into action at that moment. I won't brush my teeth until after I've reviewed any comments on my CR's from last night and then I vigorously push out another CR. God forbid I don't make a CR by 5pm, someone might not see it and I'm fucked until next standup. When I finish a task, I feel relief but it only lasts until the next one. If I'm done with my tasks (miracle) I feel obliged to work on the side to get ahead. Only one person can get promoted a quarter. It needs to be me.

This is my week: Monday is when I need to push out code ASAP so that if it's blocked, I can fix it asap. Tuesday I make corrections or additions to Monday's work and wallow in too many meeting. Wednesday is my oh shit day because time is running out. Thursday I'm on damage control mode if I'm behind, and at this job I'm always behind in one or thing or the other. Friday I scramble to push out code before people leave for the weekend.

I had assigned a dollar value to every day spent socializing instead of working. My next promotion's raise (based on the salary band where I work) will be somewhere around \~50k. It could be high as 100 or as low as 35, but let's take 50k for a conservative estimate. This promotion takes 1-2 years. If I do it in a year that's 50k more I make in my next year. But I need to study on the weekends, I need to code like I breathe. 52 weekends in a year, 50k more from the promotion next year, that's $500 in lost opportunity cost I spend per Saturday/Sunday just to fuck my girl! Here's a worse number: If I retire at 65, and if the market does 6.5% over the next 39 years, that $500 will become $3105. That's over $3000 in NPV cost I'm sacrificing, sometimes twice a week. I'm a first-generation immigrant. Both my parents are remarried with no kids. My grandparents are broke as shit. My stepfather has cancer, my father is getting old with no savings. I feel a responsibility to use the opportunities available to me to do everything I can to succeed.

When I'm blocked at work, I do a side project. When I finish a piece of the side project, I read a book. I've developed a nervous tic of blinking or grinding my teeth if I'm tired. And I'm always tired now.

I don't like what I've become. Today was the first day since my second week of work that I felt really calm. I didn't understand what was happening to me until I saw my friends and I could laugh again. I've become some kind of robot. I immediately booked two separate vacations in the next month. I can wait a few months for that promo. I can't do this anymore.

I felt like my ex became the lazy one not contributing any effort but I think now this job has sapped me of any mental energy to devote to anything else.
