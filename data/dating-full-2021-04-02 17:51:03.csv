For the past two years I have been single and in a sex dry. On top of that for the last six months I’ve been craving for any sort of emotional and physical connection. 

Recently I started to date someone, this person is kind, gentle and even funny at times. Things escalated quickly and we end up in bed too soon. Now we’re even in a relationship and it’s been less than a week. 

Here’s the problem: I don’t like this person, I find them aesthetically unpleasant or even worse, smells rancid and even their breath is a bit disgusting at times. To make the situation worse I’m embarrassed by the mere fact of being seen in public together. 

Now I seriously don’t know what to do in the sense that probably I had unrealistic expectations about the kind of person I could be in a relation with and I might be equally unpleasant, so this person is the best I can get. 

Neither I can make my mind on whether I should stay involved because even this is better than nothing at all or it’s better to end things now because this person, and no one, deserves to be taken as someone who’s only just better than nothing.

We met few times more  with some work or shopping together etc. We also talked about having sex with which she got very excited and said but I'll have to be comfortable with you before doing that, lets start with a kiss first! 
So we went on a date at a bar, drunk together and while coming back we kissed inside the uber, it was a simple kiss not much of intense kissing, after coming home she texted kiss was smooth, it was good.
After few days I got to know that she didn't got turned by the kiss or being close and touchy, soo she's not sure about the sexual drive.

When I go to work, I constantly have to hear from my co-workers about their wives and kids and be reminded of how single I am. When I go out in public to do clothes or grocery shopping and see all the couples holding hands and having good time; or even when I turn on the radio and hear nothing hit songs of love and sex.

I have so much going on in my life that I'm thankful for but I can't seem to fill that void. It aches. So much.
He was my first love. We met when we were 15. (We're 22 now)

We dated for months in 2015and then his family had to shift. Later on, we reconnected via FB and started dating again in 2017 tho we were in opposite sides of the country. He said he loved me too much and wanted LDR. I just wanted him. 

But like 6 months into the relationship, he broke up saying it was too much for him and he couldn't take it anymore. 

He also sent me a soft toy he had since his childhood Saying he'd be back for it.

I cut off all contact. He then came to my town to visit me saying he had to see me once. We spent a week together going to movies, having ice creams, lunches and also going to the zoo. But then that's that. 
The last thing he said to me before leaving was 'We are perfect for each other. It's just that the timing is wrong. We're meant to be.'

I have so many things to say to him but I guess I never did. We tried staying friends but it was too much for me. With time we grew apart. He still wishes me on my birthday. I didn't last time so he sent me a text ""Hey Wish me it's my birthday."" He has said things like he'll always be the same person and will love me so. It was his birthday this week. I texted him but he was drunk. So after a short convo he asked if he could text me the next day. It's been a week already. And no texts. 

I just want to get things off my chest like so many times when I felt cheated I couldn't and didn't say anything. I let my feelings take control. 

It's just hard to explain. 
He'll always be my first love. 
But my head goes AHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGHHH all the time.

I go to the same location that is literally across the street from my job. I usually go right after I get off work at around 6 pm. 
Now yesterday I noticed this guy staring at me from inside his car in the parking lot and we made eye contact for like 3 sec.
Now I didn't think too much of it because I've stared at people before and I think it's a normal thing to do. I mean I thought to myself maybe this guy thinks I'm pretty and he was checking me out??? Lol 
The thing is that he waited in his car for like 5 minutes trying to figure out my next move. I felt that he was still looking at me so I just pretended to be on my phone and waited inside my car waiting for this guy to get off his car and leave . 
Please keep in mind that I have social anxiety, so I try to avoid humans as much as possible. And honestly I don't even know when someone is being friendly or weird. (yes, I'm that crazy lol) 
It was pretty hot outside so he got off his car first  and as he was walking towards the gym he turned around and gave me a dirty look. 
5 minutes later I get inside the gym and the first thing I see is him in the hallway as if he was waiting for someone. I tried not to look at him and I just ignored him and I made my way to the treadmills. 
Now the strange thing is he followed me to the treadmills and he used the one right next to mine.(there were other lines empty so I don't know why he used the one next to me). I had my headphones on and I tried not to look at him for 45 minutes lol
It was probably the most awkward 45min of my life. 
He was sweating and left before me... 

Long story short, the next day (today) I was on my lunch break in my office (my office has windows and I can see the people that get in and out of the office) and I saw him walk towards my job and when he got in he asked the receptionist if we cash checks. 
Now we obviously don't cash checks because we're not a check cashing place....

I'm in my late 20s, and I've still never had a real bf. I've only ever been on one date when I was 16, and it was only a date because his parents said so. It was super awkward because his parents would only let him go if it was a double date, and his friend's date didn't show so it was me, the guy I was with, and his childhood best friend. We went to watch a movie, I somehow ended up sitting between them, and my date had the popcorn so I spent the entire movie with this other guy I barely knew reaching over me to get popcorn. It ended with me having to break into my own house due to a busted front door (key wouldn't turn to unlock it. Was an ongoing issue for us, so I learned how to pry open one of the bedroom windows and climb in) There was never a second date, but we were friends throughout high school. He was a year older so graduated, and didn't speak to me until after I had graduated myself. This put a sour taste in my mouth so our relationship, friendly or otherwise, ended there. Recently, she's come out as transgender as well, and is in a happy relationship.

To add to my relationship failures, there was one other guy who was my only ever ""boyfriend"", if I can even call him that. We were friends in middle school, had mutual crushes, and eventually a mutual friend got us to decide to ""go out."" At this point we were in high school and went to different schools. The ""relationship"" consisted of us occasionally texting each other, but never anything bigger than that. Never saw him, never talked on the phone. Just text. We lived in the same town, so it wasn't long distance or anything. Eventually, he started texting me about girls he had crushes on etc so I decided to just end it at that point. I very much interpret that as me being the only one ever in that relationship.

Now,  over 10 years have passed and I'm still single, and getting increasingly lonely. I'm not sure what it is about me that turns boys away (other than that I am overweight and probably not attractive physically but trust me, that is a lot harder to fix than it sounds i've tried). I don't really have friends, because I am socially anxious and awkward, and just overall uncomfortable in situations where you typically make friends, therefore there are never ""mutual friends"" that I could date. I don't drink, so I don't hang out at bars to meet people there. I went to college, in a major that is primarily male, but the demographic was entirely ""guys who are reclusive and not interested in girls"" and ""one of the few who are interested in dating, so they already have a relationship."" Meanwhile, people outside my major just saw me as a nerd, or unattractive. How on earth do people like me find the right guy? 

I guess what I'm asking, is how do you get comfortable dating, and how do you find guys to date when all factors seem to go against you?

I'm also a bit...hesitant? because I am currently living at home with my parents (financial issues) in a location I hate and do not want to live in long term, so I'm hesitant to date someone here if its going to tie me down to this location. But with how my life is currently going, there is no telling when I WILL be able to move elsewhere, and I'm worried if I wait too long to date then my chances of actually finding someone are just going to disappear entirely.

I really like where I live and I bought a property here which I'm beginning to homestead but I'm getting dangerously lonely doing this by myself and I'm willing to do almost anything by now to bring a woman into the picture.

Unfortunately my dating experience is negligible. The last time I dated locally I was 13, she had approached me first, and went on to convince the entire high school I was psychotic. I was falsely accused of various harassment several times throughout high school and eventually learned to avoid girls entirely as a survival skill. Since I graduated I've had two LDRs with slightly older women in different states, the first of whom broke it off when she visited and hated it here, and the second of whom expressed early reservations about moving but we broke up over covid reasons before we could visit. I returned to OLD after that only to find it utterly unusable as these apps learned to profit from lockdown.

Lately I've decided to get out of the house and try dating offline but all the spaces are full of dudes. The only exception I have found has been a specific coffee shop, but the few women who are in there seem to be on some kind of official business and not open to socialization. It's almost like single, sociable women are mythical creatures that don't actually exist, all the women I see who aren't married and who speak to me are doing it as part of their job duties (barista/grocery clerk/etc) and don't go beyond that.

Any number of people have told me I need to leave Alaska but I feel I have too much to lose by doing so. I won't give up my land, if I leave it certainly won't be permanent, and most importantly I don't want to move somewhere and find myself in exactly the same situation. Further, as evidenced by my prior LDRs, even if I moved somewhere and found someone it would be unlikely she'd want to leave whatever warm climate she lives in to move back with me.

On my course (which usually has numbers up to 100 students) there are 15 people, only one of which I've met and made friends with. There are absolutely no social clubs. I joined a sports club, which stopped training in November.

I have no success on dating apps, it consistently goes like this: Match with someone, hit it off for 2 days then never hear from them again. Please don't waste your time with the whole ""profile/text game"" thing. You can't convince me to download Bumble again. I want to meet real people, trying to entertain strangers over and over again and expecting something to happen is insane and demoralising.

When I leave the house, all I see is couples on dates, teenagers having fun and families together. I feel like I'm being actively punished because I didn't find someone before this 12 month ""2 weeks to flatten the curve"" started. What exactly are single people supposed to do? Die alone? Because I sure feel like I have absolutely nothing to live for. I don't even have motivation to get out of bed, let alone finish my degree. 

And before you ask yes I have a therapist, and I exercise regularly. I have washboard abs. No amount of self-improvement can change the fact that there are seemingly zero opportunities for me to have the kind of relationship I want. Considering the only attention I've gotten is from a polyamorous sex addict who I used to work with (and I'm not even attracted to) I'm strongly leaning towards dropping all my Christian standards just for meaningless sex. It seems pointless to even have principles in this life when it's impossible for a young person to even date in a healthy way, let alone start a family like our parents and grandparents had before our time.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,694026,public,self,"Another ""how am I supposed to meet someone"" post",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mius0h/another_how_am_i_supposed_to_meet_someone_post/,all_ads,6,,,

When it comes to topics like height or skin color, I find that many shrug off concerns as “biology” or “preference” as if height and skin color are lifestyle choices. I get that we all have a preference for good looking people, but I don’t believe we have some biological code for skin tone attraction or height. There are many reasons why height and certain skin tones can be seen as attractive, but those reasons aren’t ever pointed out due to any conversation about them being shut down by the top comments of the thread. Nobody here is saying you have to date people you don’t find attractive, but I think it good to have these conversations about why we find certain traits attractive over others. You don’t have to participate in these conversations, but I feel it’s rude to shut these concerns out completely. There’s nothing we can do about social preferences in the present, but the idea of attractiveness changes over time, and those who have concerns about social issues of dating should be genuinely met with good faith.

I really want to find my partner and I'm putting myself out there through online dating because my social life is lacking a lot esp due to Covid but online dating has been mostly terrible. I'm able to find dates easily and the first or seconds dates always end in a kiss where we both express being into each other but the after math of those first two or three are never fruitful and leading to something stable, something always comes up on either or not our ends and I'm back to looking again. Outside the successful two dates, my experience has also been getting ghosted, just them not being into me or me not being into them, being catphished, realizing we want different things the more we talk etc etc. 

Today I have a date and I used to be happy around this time but nowadays I'm feeling a depression setting in before the date. It's like I'm annoyed about getting ready and dressing well and putting in the effort when chances are it won't go anywhere anyway. It's this feeling of burnout for doing the same thing for the last 3 years hoping things will be different each time. Match, talk, meet up, things don't pan out, rinse, repeat. I was thinking of cancelling this date but it feels rude because he's a decent guy and we just had a phone call finalizing plans before this depressed feeling set in. I think what triggered my feeling was that we are deciding where to go meet and we still haven't decided and I just don't have any energy to go back and forth about where to meet up, knowing chances are it just won't work out anyway.

A friend and I are starting a dating and relationship podcast. We are both at pivotal times in our ""dating careers"". Both B. and I just had major relationships come to an end, moved out of the homes we shared with our partners (don't worry, the dogs came along), and moved in together.

Why not share it with some pals or anyone that might be curious. Why not listen to what other people experience? Why not talk about unspoken subjects and normalize the world of sex?

Our goal is to share, discuss, laugh, cry, get angry, get over it...

A segment of our show will be dedicated to crazy dates stories that we crowd source from a crowd.... in which we do not have yet - so that leads me to YOU! 

If you have a crazy, whacky, funny, thrilling date story that you feel like sharing, PLEASE SHARE!

Had a bad relationship that set me back a little bit and gave me some good ol' anxiety, but I'm working on that too. 

After that relationship, one year ago, I decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and actually put in the work. I started working out, I corrected my posture, started smiling more and eating better. I got a job, making good money, and I can honestly say that I look good (I'll never be a super model, sadly you can't work out your face, but it is what it is)

I know I'm not perfect by any means and the pandemic hasn't been the best for meeting new people, but I honestly feel like it hasn't really helped at all. I'm kinda fine with it, because I do feel better even without getting more attention from women, but I'm curious as to what aspect of me am I not seeing that's unappealing. It's just been the same normal being ignored, or them refusing to hang out, or similar stuff. I've even been ghosted a couple of times

I'm not in a relationship atm but I'm scared that my future relationships won't last or my future bf would be upset that I won't have sex until I'm married. And by sex is mean vaginal sex. I am completely fine with oral and petting (complicated, I know). 

Just to be clear, I want to have sex, but I won't. 

The main reasons why I won't have sex:
1) I'm catholic. I don't believe everything the catholic church says (I'm pretty liberal) but I do want to wait until marriage.

2) I am HORRIFIED of getting pregnant. I come from a strict asain family so getting pregnant outside of marriage would lead to so many problems for me. Not to mention my family or I would experience some kind of backlash from extended family or social groups.

3) I guess if my future partner is okay with not having sex before marriage, it would reassure me that just spending time with me is enough. If that makes sense.

So I always assumed that I was boring and average looking and that’s why girls never showed interest in me, but I’ve kind of realized I’m not that bad, but the confidence boost is kind of negated by the fact that I’m now realizing all the girls who were probably interested in me who I just ignored because I didn’t realize. 
         
I tend to go on long lectures about history and literature, which I assumed made me boring (and tbh it still kind of does), and I tell jokes and wisecracks a lot (which I thought made me annoying). So around the time the first lockdowns began I was telling some jokes in class when a popular girl who was laughing at a lot of the stuff asked what I thought about her, and for the first time in my life I realized that a girl might be showing interest me, and I immediately started shrugging and stuttering like an idiot. 

Obviously I’ve had a lot of time to think over the summer and I began to realize a lot of times girls had shown interest in me and I just had no idea what was going on. One time at lunch a friend of a friend began leaning on and grabbing my arm while laughing at my jokes. For some reason I just assumed she was a handsy type and didn’t think it was weird that she sat by me in the first place instead of with my friend. Once at a basketball game sort of the same thing was happening with a different girl when she put her hand on my thigh and literally said “Do you know who I like?” And I said the name of a male teacher and began laughing. She frowned at me and then started ignoring me. That one really makes me cringe because I really wouldn’t have minded dating her. I could share more stories but it would be more of the same.

I also lost 30lbs over the summer, and a couple of female friends have gone out of their way to say I’m cute. Needless to say I’m a bit more confident now, but as I’ve wisened up to this it’s brought it’s own baggage of regret.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,694326,public,self,Being very dense any time a girl has a crush on me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/miz7of/being_very_dense_any_time_a_girl_has_a_crush_on_me/,all_ads,6,,,

I just decided to surrender. To give up on dating. Clearly I wasn't meant to find anybody and clearly my ""person"" doesn't exist aside from in my imagination.

I would rather not be wrapped up in someone else's bullshit.

A is being so silent past week. Felt like keeping a distant from us. So we have talked about that for couple of hours.

But thinking about everything, now I feel A can be gay. He had depression and fitting in issues last year (as he told) also A is muslim. So i thought are those fitting in issues cz he is gay or bisexual and it is not approved in his community?? I dunno..

Guys, can gaydar be accurate? We cannot ask it from A any sooner until he is comfortable of telling us. But was I wrong? Why is he keeping a distance from all of us?

I asked her if she wanted to grab a drink, which said yes to and secured her number. Due to our schedules we couldn't meet up for over a week so we texted a little (not much as I don't like texting too much after I've secured the date). Again the texting was all joking and back and forth banter. 

Anyway we meet up at a bar and she's very good looking (tall, amazing body - easily a 9). I'm reasonably good looking (6ft, fit, good career etc) however she's definitely a league above me in terms of looks. Anyway the date is going great, again we're both talking shit and then I jokingly say that I bet she was a clubber girl when she was younger and that I could see her wearing short dresses with big heels. She laughs it off and I don't think anything of it. We finish off a couple of bottles of wine and we go to another bar and make out for next couple of hours and she's really into it. At the end of the night as we're waiting for our cabs, she says that she thinks I have the wrong idea of her and asks why I said what I said earlier. I explained that it was just a joke and that I don't actually think that (which is true). I feel like she's satisfied with my explanation and we both get in our cabs and go home. 

Over the next couple of days we text some more (not heaps) and I secure a second date. A few days after I ask whether she wants to come round my place and I'll cook us dinner. She quickly responds with this: 

""Hey. I have had a think and I’ve changed my mind about seeing you. I felt quite disrespected at the start of the night on our date. I felt as though you  made assumptions about my character without really knowing me. You were quick to judge and I didn’t appreciate that. Even if the comments you made were said in a joking way I still think it’s uncalled for. I did have a fun night with you but putting that to the side I have to respect myself""

I send back this: 

""Really sorry to hear that and I apologise for making you feel that way. I was joking when I said that and I wasn't judging your character at all, however obviously I stepped over the line with my comment. You're a really lovely girl and I'm sad that things didn't work out between us. Wish you all the best xx""

She then emoji ""loved"" my message and we haven't spoken since. 

My question is, is my response correct or should I have tried harder to convince her that I'm not like that (which I'm really not)? My current plan is to leave it for a month or so and if I'm still single I'll send her a message to see if she wants to catch up.
