I've tried dating sites. They don't work. I hardly get matches or messages.   
\-Maybe it's because the sites algorithms are shit.  
\-Maybe it's because every friggin site demands the users to pay to see who likes you. (And since people generally don't have money, they understandably aren't willing to pay. Frankly, it's messed up anyway that you've got to pay to see who likes you.)  
\-Maybe it's because my profile is bad? I have shown my profile to my friends though, and they've said it's ok, so not sure about that one. I suspect some people like my profile and some don't, obviously. That's fine with me.  
\-Maybe it's because I state outright that I don't want a relationship, not even a short kind. Like, maybe people are afraid that they have a hook-up with someone, they'll develop romantic feelings for that person, and want to try a relationship with that person. And if I'm saying outright ""I don't want a relationship"" most people don't wanna go out with me because they wanna protect themselves from the potential heartbreak.

Likely all of the above.

I'm afraid of hitting on anyone in the meatspace. I'm scared people would find it bothersome. I don't know if that's true or if it's just my imagination. In any case, finding company online has felt like the only viable choice.   
Perhaps I should just be brave and try meatspace anyway. (yyyyyikes)

All of this would feel less bad if I could spend more time with my friends, but they're usually busy. Either with work, school, or depression.

If you wanna give me advice, thank you, and I appreciate the sentiment. But you don't need to give me advice, 'cause I've already heard all the good ones. I've taken them in to account as best as I can. I posted this just 'cause I wanted to vent.

Me and my GF have been dating for around 5 months now, but we’ve known each other for way longer. I trust her dearly and I know that she will make smart choices.

Usually I’m not concerned about situations like these as she has pointed out before how she thinks how certain celebrities are hot and that’s respectable cause everyone has celebrity crushes.

However this event occurred while my GF and her friend were attending another frat party at my school while I was with my frat brothers and while there she confessed how she found one of the guys really attractive.

And even then I wasn’t really concerned as it’s not really abnormal to see a person and admit they are good looking. However she kept on going into telling me how she didn’t “act on her urges” whatever that means and that she feels somewhat jealous at times how her single friend can talk to all these guys. She then continues to confess how she’s had dreams about this guy before and she feels guilty because she would never be a cheater. 

I believe her and I really appreciate her telling me but I just kinda wish she stopped at the “finding him attractive part.” I really want to believe I’m not the jealous type as I don’t mind her going to parties by herself and even talking to other dudes in general, but it’s just that this one dude seemed really profound to her.

My good friend from high school was a popular guy. Good genetics and a fast metabolism really kept him successful in the dating game as a 16 year old football player. But after he went to university, he really struggled to land dates... let alone a relationship, and the more he opened up to me about his confusion in this, the more i understood why he was single. I hated that I could see it, but that there was no way to express that to him without offending him deeply.

Now, people should never 'change' for someone, or rely on superficial elements to carry them through the dating process, I am in full agreement of that. **However, if you have standards for your partner that do not reflect your own habits, efforts and behaviours... dating is going to be really difficult for you.** Over the years, his expectations for a partner has never changed, and whenever I suggested he open up his options more... his answer was;

*""I'm not lowering my standards, I know my worth"".*

So... what are his standards? Well, first and foremost, only blondes, NATURAL blondes...preferably ones that have similarities to Margot Robbie - his dream woman. Must be really fit, slender, stylish, well read and well travelled. She must be successful enough to make bank (80K+). She must be a great cook and have exceptional hobbies as he finds that attractive. She must also have a kind heart and have a good family. He wants someone he can be 'proud' to have on his arm (in his words)... oh, and under 25, he is 31. Apparently he needs someone who isn't tired and bitter, or something.

How does he measure up next to these standards? Well he's a nice enough person I guess, polite and punctual and picks up the bill for us whenever we go out - he has some decent traits, from a friend perspective. But whenever my boyfriend and I go over to spend time with him, we notice things in his space that are frankly an understandable turn off for MOST women, let alone women that he would give a chance. Dirty laundry is just flung everywhere, theres usually a crusty sock in a corner or balled up and stuffed down the side of the couch and his bathroom counters are caked with dried soap slime. His couch is sunken in due to broken springs. There are leftover takeout boxes littering the fridge. He doesn't know how to cook, so he orders most of his meals from a delivery service. He pays $20 for a haircut, and it shows. He is completely out of shape and has gained about 40 lbs since 2009 and hasn't visited any countries aside from Hawaii with his parents. Most of his clothes are from an era we've long moved past (quiksilver, burton, abercrombie) and many of those clothes have holes in them or are way too small. He has been stuck for years in a dead end finance job where he is constantly overlooked, although based on the fact that he wears these old DC skater shoes to work everyday with his frayed oversized dress pants scraping along the ground... it doesn't surprise me that he's not lined up for a promotion.

All of this isn't to say that he doesn't deserve to find love, but if you are only looking for love with a particular set of qualities that you don't represent in any way, shape or form... dating is going to be a painfully disappointing and miserable experience. I learned this myself when I thought that what I needed from a man was gifts... and i'm embarrassed to say that I used to judge a man on his ability to impress me with material things. Thankfully I grew out of that by 21... but some people don't want to give themselves a good hard look and bring themselves down a notch or two.

Who do you know in your life who has unreasonable expectations? When was a time YOU had unreasonable expectations.

I’ve met this girl about 4/5 months ago and as of 2 months ago we agreed on the whole relationship thing.
We’re exclusive and happy, everything is going great.
Except that i feel like we’re sexual incompatible, we have sex maybe once every 2/3 days. And it only happens when she initiates it. When i try to make a move she just steps back.
On top of that is our sex quite boring and predictable, since we have a heigh difference (5’5 &amp; 6’7)
Are some positions undoable.
And when positions do work usually she tells me to not put my whole dick in cuz it hurts her stomach.
We already talked about our sex before and we agreed to both initiate more and do it more often. But that lasted for a week and now we’re falling back in our old situation.
I truly love this girl, i see a long road ahead with her. 
But being sexually unhappy makes me wonder if i’m willing to take that road.
I don’t wanna talk with her about this yet, i do not wanna make my problem her problem aswel i feel like i would hurt her by saying it and that would be selfish.
I never thought about seeing other people, but lately i feel the urge to have sex with someone else and fulfill my needs. But the thought of having sex with someone else disgusts me.

We went out on a date to a restaurant, which went okay but not amazing in my opinion. Despite that, she seemed excited to meet again. 

For the second date we went on a walk/hike at a park (my suggestion). I didn't really account for the weather because it was really cold and windy that day, but she still showed up and we talked for maybe 2 hours. She asked me questions about my dating history and asked if I'd ever dated outside of my race. I said no, and asked her a similar question— to which she responded that she had. 

Most of the flirting I did was verbal since my hands were freezing and I didn't want to put my icy hands on her lol. She did do this thing at one point where she was trying to walk on a fallen log, and she reached out for my hand saying that she couldn't do it by herself, so I helped her across (she could have easily walked around it btw). Aside from some occasional bumping-into, the only other physical contact was a parting-hug. I didn't try to kiss her because my face was cold and my nose was runny, and I felt like that would've been a bit gross. 

At one point I asked her if she was ready to go since we had made it back to the entrance: she said she wanted to go for another lap but was worried that I might've been cold since I mentioned how cold it was. Of course I said ""No it's fine"" and sucked it up lol, so we took another lap and decided to leave before it got dark. 

We chatted for a while at the gate, at which point she started to say ""I'll talk to you later"", but then realized we hadn't planned another date and then she asked what I wanted to do next time. Originally we agreed to go cycling and we left the park, but then I remembered that I was having a minor surgery done that week and wouldn't be able to do any vigorous exercise for around 10 days. I texted her and asked if we could maybe go shopping this weekend instead since it'll be light activity and then do cycling the week after. She has since agreed to it, but is keeping it tentative right now in case I feel like I need more time to recover. 

Long story short, I get the feeling that this girl is interested in me, but I guess I'm trying to understand why lol. Everything I say is funny to her, she thinks I'm smart, and she's excited about whatever I suggest we do next. I'm sure she's got tons of swipes on her profile, so I know she could find somebody better than me. I'm also worried that I might be misreading this somehow, and that maybe she's viewing me as a friend. I mean, she refers to our meetings as ""dates"", but I'm scared that if I try to make a move on her she'll look at me like I'm crazy.

Idk. tl;dr: Pretty woman likes me and wants to keep going on dates. I'm finding it hard to believe she finds me physically attractive, so I'm worried that she just thinks I might make for a good friend or something.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162663,public,self,Not sure if girl sees me as just a friend,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t53cro/not_sure_if_girl_sees_me_as_just_a_friend/,no_ads,0,,,

Lil back story 
I am a (19M) and my gf is a (19F)
I’ve met this girl about 4/5 months ago and as of 2 months ago we agreed on the whole relationship thing.
We’re exclusive and happy, everything is going great.
Except that i feel like we’re sexual incompatible, we have sex maybe once every 2/3 days. And it only happens when she initiates it. When i try to make a move she just steps back.
On top of that is our sex quite boring and predictable, since we have a heigh difference (5’5 &amp; 6’7)
Are some positions undoable.
And when positions do work usually she tells me to not put my whole dick in cuz it hurts her stomach.
We already talked about our sex before and we agreed to both initiate more and do it more often. But that lasted for a week and now we’re falling back in our old situation.
I truly love this girl, i see a long road ahead with her. 
But being sexually unhappy makes me wonder if i’m willing to take that road.
I don’t wanna talk with her about this yet, i do not wanna make my problem her problem aswel i feel like i would hurt her by saying it and that would be selfish.
I never thought about seeing other people, but lately i feel the urge to have sex with someone else and fulfill my needs. But the thought of having sex with someone else disgusts me. Even right now my eyes are starting to tear up because it came this far that i have to write this and get an outsiders perspective.

I hope you can be understanding about my situation.

* Preferably have similar sense of humor and we can talk a lot.

I’m a 27F and went to the bars with some friends a few weeks ago. A guy who is a 30M came up to me and we went to somewhere a bit more secluded to talk. He told me I was the most beautiful girl in the room and thought I had a great vibe. I told him it was too loud in there, so he could take my number/Instagram and we go from there.

A bit of a rewind, I’ve been online dating on/off for the past 2.5 years and it has been awful. In January, I was dating someone who was slowly ghosting me until I asked him why he’d been distant and he said he met someone prettier and cooler than me and it honestly just hurt. He didn’t have to say all that. That led me to delete all my dating apps and honestly stop dating for a while. I had NO intentions of dating whatsoever.

Then 30M approaches me and we start talking and we vibe SO WELL. I’m shocked because I’ve never met someone in person like that that I vibe with. We went on a date around a week ago; he paid, we laughed, had a wonderful time — at the end of the night, I hugged him and he kissed me. It was very passionate and electric.

I asked him to grab a drink with me two days later and we had a great time again. We made our and got a bit steamy in the back of my car, but nothing sexual happened.

I was excited, told my friends about it, and one asked me for his Instagram. We were both looking and I noticed he followed some more people (I have ADHD and numbers stick out to me) so I went ahead and hurt my own feelings by finding out that he followed a ton of new girls. I knew he met them on hinge because a while ago, I matched with a guy on hinge and he follows me/all these girls. They’re all single and way younger than me (21-24 years old).

I noticed that the 30M was liking a lot of their pictures. I get that we aren’t dating officially, but I just felt a bit led on. He made me feel like he really liked me, but I obviously am not enough if he’s searching for other women. Not trying to sound jealous, but he didn’t like any of my pictures, which makes me feel like he’s trying to get their attention.

Anywho, I deactivated my Instagram (for personal reasons, not this) and 30M texts me with “Hey I saw I’m not on your insta anymore? Did I do something to upset you?”

A part of me thinks he feels guilty. Especially because he knows I’m very kind/tender hearted. I sent a short reply just saying I deactivated my Instagram and he replied with “Oh that makes sense, now I feel lame for asking”

P.S. I got sick and he hasn’t asked, but he’s been telling me all about his mom and her issues as if he wants emotional support from me, but won’t give it back. Anywho, I really liked this guy, but I also am at a place in my life where I know what I want and I don’t think I want to run into another issue where a guy finds a girl he thinks is better than me and tries to break me down because of that.

So I’m a bit mentally and emotionally checked out, but also felt excited for the first time in a long time… as a career driven woman, I really don’t have time to date and I already have such wonderful friendships and I don’t know, I would just love some advice. 🥺",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162667,public,self,A guy (30M) came up to me (27F) at a bar and I gave him my number.

romantic relationships don't come very easy for me but i am considered a pretty friendly and progressive guy that generally gets along with everyone. i'm a couple years out of a serious long term relationship that ended very painfully (due to previously mentioned religio/cult), haven't really dated around much since then. i only really try to keep something going if i feel that there's equal interest from both of us. i don't really like chasing or pining after people since i used to do that a lot when i was younger. had a couple of flings that ended up fizzling out because they started dating someone else, which is something i've gotten pretty sensitive to since it's happened a couple times in a row.

anyway, i matched with this girl on a dating site, she lives about 3 hours away but we hit it off in chat for a couple of weeks. chemistry seems to be there, after some time i invite her to coffee the next time she's in town, a bit later she says she's met someone and would like to see where that goes and understands if i don't want to keep chatting anymore. i tell her i totally understand and genuinely wish her good luck and leave it at that, fully expecting to be done and moving on.

a few months later, i had a pretty public mental health crisis, and she sees it on social media and messages me asking if i'm ok, and we begin chatting again. we hit it off, but i'm a little cautious because of what she said last time. when it becomes obvious she's not in that relationship anymore she says she wants to take me up on that coffee, and we end up hanging out all day, immediately comfortable with each other, breaking the physical touch barrier pretty soon into our date. we're kissing and cuddling etc, nothing sexual. we both say we had a great time, but not wanting to rush into anything, but really enjoy each other's company. 

we continue happily texting and messaging each other over the next couple of weeks and try to figure out our next date. when we finally hang out again, things seem great - and at the end of the night she tells me again that she has a tendency to rush into relationships so she doesn't want to kiss goodnight. i'm fine with that, we're both ok parting as friends. she gets home and texts me that she does enjoy her time with me but wants to keep things platonic between us for now, though she still wants to hang out. i tell her that i understand. 

we still talk, but i can feel something has obviously changed, and it feels to me like she's not interested in me anymore at all. like i'm back in acquaintance status. this isn't something i hold i against her, since i can't dictate how people feel about me and admittedly you can see from this post that i like to ramble and can sometimes be a lot. i get it. i still respond to her, and try to maintain a strictly friendly relationship with her, which is pretty easy considering our distance. the time between our responses to each other becomes longer and longer and the relationship (friendly or otherwise) seems to have run out of steam, and run its course

at this point we're still texting politely here and there, not as much as we used to, and i want to respond and tell her thanks for the time, but right now, i don't want to be in any relationship where we're not showing up for each other, either as friends or as partners. clearly our priorities are different, so i'll just go do my thing, and you do your thing, good luck with everything etc

i go to message her all this and i see on social media that she's really close to another guy on valentine's day and i decide i don't need to say anything at all and delete/unfollow her from everything.

i didn't block her number but she messaged me last week saying she's thinking about me and asks how i'm doing.

Another thing that caught me off guard here was when we were leaving it was just me and her and 2 other people and she didnt motion for the hug goodbye, seemed to be a little awkward about it but it wasnt a big deal. I texted her to ask if she wanted to go out again, and after a day she said sorry it was a super chaotic weekend and she was sick now. Prior to this though, she had told me should would be down to go to a certain restaurant ""another time"" which led me to think she was interested in spending time together and not just being nice. However I decided to tread lightly cause it was hard for me to read now. 

I saw her a few days after she told me she was busy, and she was very friendly, talked to me a lot, and stared at me like the entire class period. She invited me to a party but it ended up getting cancelled. We didn't text for a while but this week she was very friendly and texted me a bit. When we were walking back from class, one of her friends asked her to wait up but she kept walking with me and then we encountered a couple more of her close friends who she kind of ignored as we walked by. Seemed like if she wanted to dip she couldve multiple times lol. When we parted ways she kinda looked awkwardly for a second when she would normally hug me, and then I just hugged her instead lol. 

I'm into her, I thought she was into me but it's a little hard for me to tell now and I don't want to push it. I was going to ask her if she wanted to go out on a date, but idk if that's too formal?

Fast forward to about a week ago when he messaged me saying that he was “officially officially single”. So obviously, I go to Facebook. It was still a fresh break up but he just changed his status to in a relationship with the same girl a few days before he messaged me. 

He claims that when he messaged me the first time, they broke up for a short time and got back together. But now he says that he got tired of her shit and that she was too controlling so he ended it.

So. I, whos never had a romantic relationship and had only one or two dates previous, landed a date. Just a cup of coffee and I intend to take it like meeting a new friend. Non-romantic. And even if we do not find chemistry, I hope I can at least gain a new friend.

We've never met before but we have exchanged pictures and she lives relatively closeby. We've talked over chat and while I know some things about her, there's still a lot to know. But I'm not a prying type. I'm interested, sure, but I'd imagine she'd want to first meet up and get a live impression of myself and thus she's been slow to share things. Which I understand, statistically women risk a lot more when meeting someone new.

At first I thought I'd have problems finding icebreakers to initiate conversations but on further thinking, it's better if the converstion flows naturally... which I hope it does.

Which brings me to the subject of her comfort. So, is there anything I can do to set her mind at ease upon our meeting? I know, ""just be yourself"" but I'm concerned I might miss some social cue or something. For example,  Im trying to grow a beard, but right now its short and all over... should I shave?

From my part, I open up to new people fairly easily but I find myself getting tonguetied if I form a crush on someone. I may have tendency of sharing too much about myself - or so I feel, nobody has explicitly told me so.

we had the breakup, and i said i could continue dating cause YOLO, who cares, etc. but she has had a bad LDR experience. once again, i knew the cards weren't in our favor. i was pretty sad and she felt like she lead me on. i would describe her as feeling bad/guilty that day. she wanted to check in and chat/be friends, but it just felt unfulfilling and forced to be doing that-- not to mention prolonging the pain. so i told her it wouldn't be a good idea, despite her pleas. (listen-- i really did want that, but i needed space)  we kissed goodbye, and i told her i was being stupid, and we could talk whenever she wanted, however, i think she wanted to respect my prior wishes.

so months later i dmed her how she was, and she didn't open it, just left it on sent. it's still just sitting there while she watches my stories 🤨.

i know how to interpret this, but i also don't since she was the one who wanted to keep in touch. i dont know if she's ignoring me to respect what i told her previously. im not trying to win her back or anything but i just would like to catch up, cause i think i overreacted and i do want her in my life.

Is it a big deal to you? 

Lately I’ve noticed quite the opposite reaction. I was out dancing with my group of friends last weekend (3 guys and 6 girls) and I met two girls. One of them told me “you know it says a lot about you that you’re friends with these hot girls. They really trust you.”

On Instagram I had two similar situations…

I planned a date with a girl and she left me on read. I posted a few stories with me out with girls from my friend group and this same girl commented “omg this looks like so much fun” then she dm’d saying “heyyy that was so rude of me not to respond! I’m sorry! I’d like to see you soon, I understand if it’s too late.”

Another girl I was talking to on Instagram was hesitant to go out with me too. I went on a dinner/shopping date with two of my ‘girl’ friends and I posted some pics of us all sharing a fish bowl and another one of us trying on hats &amp; sunglasses. The Instagram girl said it looked like I was having fun and ever since she’s been eager to see me, even after I left her on read for a week. 

I’m super close with my friends. We tell each other everything and spend a lot of time together. There’s been times I’ll share my bed with a few of them after a night out or cuddle with them when they’re cold. I never hook up with them though, it’s all friendly, but I can see how that level of friendship could make someone jealous. 

So my questions for you are: do you care if men are hanging out with a lot of girls? Does your opinion change once you get in a serious relationship with them? How friendly is too friendly?

Getting dates has not been that big of an issue for me lately. I asked Reddit to help me out with my dating app profile and got some really amazing tips, so getting a foot through the door has been a lot less gruelling despite being a solid 4-5/10. The issue to me has always been going to the next step. It always seems like despite ending a date with a kiss, or in a lot of cases, having sex, the other person (I'm straight) just falls off completely and I end up getting the whole ""it's not you, it's me"" speech.   


I always make sure that they're comfortable in any situation (I'm a long-time lurker of this sub, and some experiences really made me aware of how creepy it can get for girls). I took the habit of asking the other person after a good date if they would like us to keep seeing each other (because a good date for me doesn't mean that they personally had a good time), and despite consistently getting ""yes"" as an answer, they just turn around a day or two later...or sometimes they just ghost me. 

I know I'm not a conventionally attractive guy, and I know that I am not perfect, but all these experiences just make me feel really ugly both physically and personality-wise. Do these people go along with what I say for pity? I can take rejection, but I suppose what I'm trying to say is that it hurts feeling led on despite making sure that bases are covered.  


I have my own life going on, I'm in grad school while being a full-time professional; I have my hobbies like learning piano and literature(among other things), and I'm in driving school right now. Despite all that, it just feels incredibly lonely and draining.  


I know that dating is hard for everyone, but I can't help but feel like there is something wrong with me; everyone around me is in a committed relationship and time just feels like it's about to run out.

Maybe that's also the reason he's the first guy I've ever slept with.

But just recently, I was sexually assaulted by a guy at work and Im having a relapse (I was assaulted as well 2 years ago) so everything is not fine with me as of this time.

Maybe I should have taken a break months ago, but I was stubborn and kept going on dates with women from online dating apps. failure rate was so high, but determination kept me going.   


Well about two weeks ago that desire to find someone was overtaking by exhaustion of the process I guess. So much ghosting, so much dates that felt great and led to rejection. I'm just feeling pessimistic right now. I tried to slow down, but I realized it was too late and I needed to just stop for a bit. I've been getting like 5-6 dates a month it seems, but hardly any 2nd dates. I know that seems good for a guy, but it begins to feel like nothing will change.   


I went on the last first date I plan to do for now from online dating. It actually went really well and I have a 2nd date planned with her. She is unique. Most relaxing date I have had. I'm struggling because I feel pessimistic about the outcome.   


Id rather meet people in person for now and maybe get to someone a bit before jumping right into dating if possible. Maybe I need this month off.   


What have you all done when you reach this point? I'm seeing a therapist soon thankfully. This week its not just the dating, but also feeling some existential stuff too which is hurting my motivation to improve myself.   


For one I want to get myself geared back up to go on dates with the right mindset, but I also kind of dig this women I saw yesterday and hope I can manage this burn out well enough that if we do have potential it wont be wasted by me being emotional unavailable.

I knew he had a GF at the time, but broke up shortly after. Had a good time and once I flew back to the city I work in (diff country), we’d been talking non stop for three months straight.  Everything was good, smooth and very positive - although it started off in the worst of scenarios. We made plans to go on holiday together during summer and he even got tickets to come and visit me (2nd-6th March).

Everything started to shift 10 days ago when during one of our calls he started to raise issues and concerns as to why it wouldn’t work, like being long distance, being in two different life moments - which he knew of since the beginning and said multiple times during that call that were not current issues but potential future issues. We agreed on “seeing how it goes” without pressure and making anything official, everything was still a test as we were trying to get to know each other and understand if we could work. Those next ten days (until Monday) were hell for me, I was very anxious and I don’t know if I was reading too much into it but felt like something had changed. 

Fast forward to two days ago, also two days before flying to visit me, he said he was going to meet his ex as she had messaged him. He disappeared for the whole evening and the next day called me to explain how the meeting went: she wanted to tell him that she had found out about the cheating and knew was he was up to with me. They also kinda got off etc (which was not an issue for me, as we made it clear that we were not exclusive but just getting to know each other more and more seriously). Well, he told me he realised how much of a mistake everything was, that he shouldn’t have cheated and should’ve at least told her, that he regretted embarking on this thing with me as he doesn’t think he wants anything serious and is realising it just now and feels sorry about the situation. He’s sure he doesn’t want to get back with the girlfriend and is sure he it wouldn’t work with me and doesn’t think he’d be up for trying slowly.

He said he was thinking whether he should still come to visit or not as he was still game, as we had many things already booked and paid for and said he’d leave the decision to me.  So I said to come and to take it lightheartedly, as a holiday to have fun and enjoy our time. From this moment I still had my doubts that he’d have come, and indeed first he was negative about the weather and then was like “I know it’s not mandatory to fly there and back but I’m gonna take a covid test just to be sure” and apparently he tested himself twice - first one was negative, second one was positive. So he decided not to come, 12h before flying, basing himself on this covid test. 

On one hand, I believe that he has strong public health morals as he’s a doctor, so that he tested just to be extra sure not to spread things around, but on the other hand I’m thinking that (1) it was not necessary so why creating an unfortunate situation (2) that he could’ve faked the test or got a pic from a friend. 

Anyway yesterday after he gave me the news, we were on FaceTime for 5h and he seemed to be genuine about it, apologising, being like “fudge what do I do for 7-10 days stuck at home” but at the same time not trying to find alternatives to the mess, like postponing the flights to a later date. However he was like “well we’ll still gonna see each other in 2 weeks when you come home”, so I was hopeful and positive. 

Today however, for the first time in 3 months, we haven’t spoken and it’s already weird as it is. Then, I know for a fact he’s been active the whole day and has been offline just this evening, which makes me believe he’s not at home. Tried to play it cool and tried to ring him to “check on him” and as expected he didn’t pick up. This is very fishy to me. 

I know that each thing I mentioned could be legit and plausible, but the sum of it all just makes me feel like I’ve been played with and makes me not trust him. 

I don’t understand if this is a U-turn, if he’s just confused and needs time/space, it was cold feet, if it’s all legit and should take things for the face value I was given. Should I expect some ghosting? What’s your view?

TLDR; Met a guy, he cheated on ex GF with me for some time and quickly broke up with her. Been talking 24/7 for 3 months, made plans to visit me and go on holiday and then all of a sudden he send mixed signals, sees the ex and cancels the trip last min because he’s positive. Cold feet?

I (30F) don't have a whole lot of dating experience. I've been seeing a 37 year old man for about 4 months. First four dates were great. Things got a little weird after that and he said he no longer felt ready for a relationship and wanted to take things slow, he mentioned he was tired of having relationships that fizzled out after a year or two and wanted to make sure his next partner was his life partner.

Despite saying that he would continue to invite me out, and would text me during the evenings to ask how my day was and tell me about his day. Fast forward and he wants me to start having sleepovers at his place that would last the entire weekend. Friday evening to Sunday evening. He even told me I could leave a bag of my things there. He's tried a few times to get me to meet his friends but I've always blown it off because I didn't see the point in meeting his friends when what we had going on seemed casual. At one point he told me he wanted to see me more often and not just on the weekends, and would say things like, ""I wish you were here."" and that he didn't want me to see other men.

I still spend most weekends at his place, and I've noticed that he is much more affectionate these days while I'm over there. Last Friday we both went to a concert and he was disappointed I didn't go home with him after the concert or hang out with his friends while I was there. He also said in order for him to want to take things to the next level I would need to meet his friends and get along with them as this is very important to him. I told him I would put the effort in to meet his friends.

I feel very confused, because the signals I get in person and the wanting me to meet his friends lead me to believe he wants something more than casual. But lately he never texts anymore or asks about my day. Don't get me wrong, I have no interest in texting all day everyday, but I really enjoyed having a short exchange during the evenings.

When we first were dating she went out for dinner with a friend ( no problems there ). About a month later I find out that her and “Jim” were on and off for a couple years but never committed to each other. She explains to me that it was a very bad time for her and he didn’t treat her very well etc. Jim had found another girl and my GF was angry about it but says she has moved on. This was all two years ago. 

I have noticed she brings up Jim quite a bit and texts him occasionally. I confronted her about this about how it makes me feel uncomfortable. She acknowledged it and she would try and do better and said she would not text him when she is with me and she would tell me if she was going to see him. He came over to her house to grab something but I didn’t find out until 2 weeks later. (She lives at home so I’m not concerned about cheating) I asked her how she would feel if I were to do the same things and she said she wouldn’t like it and be uncomfortable but she would trust me. 

Fast forward to last week. I take her out for her birthday dinner and everything is going good until she says “This is so much better then my last birthday, me and Jim did this, this and this but it wasn’t good and I’m glad I’m here with you”. The more I think about it I am thinking why is she bringing him up again when she is with me? A few days later, we are planning a trip together and the first thing she does is pull out her phone to text Jim.

Basically me and this girl have been dating for 5 months now in university, its been really amazing and we really click on all cylinders.

Shes an engineering major, and sometimes I can't help but feel like I am bringing her grades down, due to the time I spend with her. Sometimes we just spend the whole weekeend together where she doesn't study or do any work, and I feel like she falls behind because of this. I voiced my concerns and she said that it was all on her and that I wasnt affecting her.

But I think I am, because this is her first relationship, and before this she was getting straight As in all her science and math courses. Now shes barely flirting with Bs and Cs.

Im considering breaking up with her because I feel so much guilt over this. Her family is really poor and her getting an amazing job in engineering would mean so much for her family. I don't want to hold her back because I want a relationship.

I don't know how to create the environment for a crush anymore and it seems like dating apps are the only way to meet others but I have a huge complex for guys just ""swiping right"" on everyone, like how do I know they actually find me attractive? This is because my ex admitted that he did this and only went on the first date because I messaged, granted he then dated me for a year but still he never made me feel beautiful or attractive. It was a bit toxic but it was my first relationship and I thought not being appreciated was normal. 

I want someone to actually choose me even when they've seen me in a different environment, instead of a profile on an app. What do I do?

Long story short, we matched on tinder and talked for a little on there. We found out that he was acquainted with a close friend of mine and moved our conversation to snapchat. We talked for about a week on snapchat before him and our mutual friend were at an apartment kickback together and invited me there.

I went to the apartment kickback to meet him in person for the first time and we hit it off. We talked on a balcony alone for about 30 minutes until we moved to the couch and his arm was around me. We hung out for around a total of 3 and a half hours which was filled with nonstop talking and flirting. We found out that we have a lot in common and he seemed awesome. Before we parted ways he said, ""I will definitely see you again."" Ever since, I looked forward to seeing him again and I loved talking to him + he said he felt the same.

Fast forward to last weekend and he invited me to another party. I was super excited to see him again and put time aside to go although I was about to have the busiest day ever the day after. I went with our mutual friend and right when we walked in he said hi to us. After that, he disappeared and was pretty much running around the entire party. We didn't have a single conversation that night, except for his friend trying to be my ""wing man"" which really didn't work out. Something that I thought was weird was that whenever I would go to a different area, he would then magically appear, but still ignored me. Plus, I didn't want to spend my entire night chasing him around. I ended up getting a little bothered and had a friend pick me up. It's weird that he invited me to a party to barely acknowledge me.

The next day I didn't talk to him at all until it was later in the day; I had a very busy day. He asked me if I had fun the night before, and I did not know if I should've told him the truth so all I said was, ""Yeah I had fun."" I debated being straight up with him, but I wasn't sure if I would seem ""dramatic"" if I told him no. 

We're still taking every single day, but I feel kinda weird talking to him now, especially because I don't want to waste my time entertaining him if he's not interested in me. I don't know how I should approach talking to him anymore.

I'm new with talking to guys and relationships, so I'm honestly clueless at this point. Maybe it could be the same case for him...
