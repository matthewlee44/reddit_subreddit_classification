Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room.

I’d really appreciate if a woman or someone that understands women enlightened me on this.

With every girl I’ve dated, she always has like a gaggle of 3 or 4 back up guy friends that want to sleep with her. Now I know people are going to try to say “oh they don’t you’re just insecure” shut up. We all know they’re game and we shouldn’t pretend like we don’t just to keep the girls that do this looking innocent.

I wouldn’t care if it was just one girl, but it seems like pretty much every single woman from ages 20 to 30 pull shit like this.

So I (M,24) recently had to go get some new glasses from the eye doctor. And at the front desk was this new woman who was new since I’ve last been there (this was NOT the eye doctor herself). She helped me pick out glasses and we had a little bit of small talk about my job and hobbies and the work she does. I enjoyed it and we had a little bit of playful banter.

So fast forward to yesterday and I went to go pick up my glasses. I walked in and she greeted me by name, which I almost never get. When she handed me my glasses she also handed me a fairly nice coffee mug (not that fake plastic shit, like good quality, plus it was free) and said that I’m welcome back anytime just to hang (it’s a small place, not a chain store)

X lives miles and miles away from me. We've been texting for almost three months now, no calls. Is that a red flag? Probably. But the introvert in me uncomfy with calls too. We send pictures, occasional voice memos, but that's about it. The chats are great though—the banters, the flirting. 

He works full-time which takes most of the hours we can actually talk (Time difference issues) and when he's off, he's also busy with chores and hanging out with other people. I am glad he's the type of person who is present in the moment, with his loved ones, but it just sucks for me who's not there. 

I am unsure, too, if the plans to meet were just flirting or real planning. And I am more unsure what are we and I am afraid to ask to put labels on it, because I am afraid:
a) How this relationship will turn out if my insecurities and uncertainty always cloud everything; and
b) If he says he does not want to label things. Because that would be mean I would have to either compromise or have the guts to leave.

They’re literally going bezerk, it’s like they’re absolutely terrified that their potential partners may be as little as 10 lbs overweight. Like it makes me feel kinda scared for humanity. There’s nothing wrong with having preferences… but their behavior is almost psychopathic. They are absolutely OBSESSED with finding the tiniest partner imaginable. 

It’s such a guy thing… to be worried so much about what their partners look like. I’m starting to come to this realization that, like… guys really aren’t all that important anyway. Yes, I’m fat. Yes, I long for a companion. I’ve wanted a boyfriend since i was like 11. I’ve always been a chubby kid, and guys always kinda avoided me like the plague. Not even fat guys liked me in high school. 

What does it matter anymore? 

If men refuse to love you because you have fat on your tummy instead of your hips, butt and thighs (most men aren’t really attracted to boobs anymore) it’s like… why even bother with them? There’s so much more to worry about than what women are supposed to look like. There’s so much good music to listen to.  There’s so many hobbies you could have. I have a lot of things to do. If you won’t love a woman because she isn’t thin, then like… it honestly just says a lot about YOU instead of me. 

I don’t want to have to change myself physically to find a partner. 

I don’t want to make myself smaller so a man will like me. I’m not small. I don’t have a small personality. I am eccentric, I’m wild, I’m high energy.

I don't want you to buy me things or listen to my favorite songs or introduce me to your family. I don't want you to wear nice cologne, or compliment me or give me heart warming smiles. 

I just want you to realize how f***** I am. From trauma. From my mom making me feel extremely guilty very often when she bought me things. I just want to cut the formal bs and get straight to the part where you cuddle me. I don't want you to do nice things for me. I don't want effort. Just comfort and compassion.

No one is going to hold me and shield me against the self doubt, paranoia, suicidal ideation, wondering if my friends hate me behind my back. No one is going to be tender towards the hurt part of me. The part that bleeds. I'm expected to be stable and healed before I engage in a relationship. Before anyone will ever want me.

Almost 23. And I’ve got 3 friends. When I was 19. My mother sold our house and Bought a place in the big city about a 1 hour drive from our home town. It’s still close enough for me to catch up with friends. But the thing is when I made this move most of the friends I had slowly drifted and now we don’t even keep in contact anymore. I used to have a fairly abundant social life. (Given most of these friends were probably fake) but in saying that it gave me something to do and some excitement in my life either way because I was able to attend more social events and things like that. I chose to move with my mother because I couldnt afford to rent at the time and I wanted to be closer to my family anyway. It’s now been 3 years since moving. And the 3 friends I still have I hardly ever see. One of them still lives a social life of abundance. And is usually hanging with other crowds that we are not mutually friends with. The other 2 seem to be in the same boat with virtually no friends. The problem is I try to catch up with these guys when I can but most of the time they aren’t that interested in doing anything or seeing me. They just live in their own little bubble as do I but we talk everyday over social media and things like that. If we lived closer I’m sure we would catch up regularly. But because of the distance it’s quite rare. It’s depressing. I’m a fairly busy guy. I have a career and work full time. Trying to save for a deposit on a house. I workout frequently and I’m in great shape. And I know I’m on the right path to success but I just feel my social life is really lacking. Weekends get so lonely. I rely on tinder and other dating apps to meet girls. Because I feel I have almost no other way of meeting them due to having no social life. Sometimes I feel like finding a girlfriend can solve this issue as it gives me someone to hang out with. I’ve dated a couple girls since living here which made me feel less lonely temporarily. But they didn’t last. it’s hard when relying on dating apps as I am able to get one night stands easy enough but to find a girl I would actually like to settle down with is very tough. I also would like to make new friends but I feel at my age it is very hard. Most people have their circle already figured out and don’t just welcome outsiders like myself.

I (20F) met this guy (25M) a month ago, we’ve been on 3 dates already and had sex the first date. It was weird, the connection was instantaneous, he brought up that if I was open to to something serious after Sex during the first date because he was looking for that. I just said I’m open but I would really like to get to know the person first. Sex is amazing, the chemistry is crazy. 

The second date it was so wierd, we were so ourselves, no awkwardness, I even was peeing in the bathroom and he wanted to come in to talk, because I was taking my time lol. He said that even though we don’t really no each other it feels like we knew each other for years. I felt that too!

Regardless I’m trying to pull the breaks. I don’t want to go too fast, I don’t feel like it’s love bombing, it feels like actual friendship. Still skeptical, it’s too soon to see this is stick.

The third date we were having sex and I was just thinking about saying I love you over and over in my head. It was more climaxing thing, but damn I really wanted to say it. I really like him obviously don’t love him yet.

Well he’s in the navy, and he went out to sea today, he’s gone for 3 weeks. I don’t mind, I work in accounting and it’s going to get busy in August, I got finals, and many birthday parties I have to attend. So this is really good timing. 

Other thing is I am a huge gift giver , just ask my ex all the gifts I gave him, hell ask any of my friends, I’m the type of person that can not come empty handed to a house. 

Well anyway, he showed me his nerd secret obsession with coins lol and he is turning 25 while he’s at sea. I got I’m a cute coin- nothing excessive.

I wondering if this wierd though, like giving him a gift so early. 

I also really want to start blurting out I love you during sex, I don’t care if we are not official, I just have the tendency to say that. The urge is strong 

Sorry for all the irrelevant details- this is kinda like venting for me.

This guy (M25) and I (F23) have been talking for about two months now.  And we’ve met like 3 times by now.  Our first meeting was end of June because I’d been out of our home state on vacation for most of that time.  He has always consistently texted me.  We send good morning and goodnight texts regularly.  He used to double text me his good morning (and still sometimes does) if I procrastinated responding to a previous day’s message.  Even when I traveled back home from the aforementioned trip he texted me safe flight and to let him know when I made it.  Basically whenever a convo ends he’d pick it up even with just a simple how’s your day going or asking or sharing about one of our days.  Another thing that stood out is him always going out of his way to reply to my Snapchat stories saying I’m cute or pretty (and everyone I showed that too said he’s pretty into me if he responds to all my stories).  

I was the first to suggest grabbing coffee when I’m back in town the first time.  We both mutually planned in advance.  At the end, he said he can’t wait to hang again and apologized for being chatty due to nervousness.  And when I said I didn’t even realize he was nervous he said he definitely was because of how pretty he found me.  We maintained talking every day but I reinitiated by telling him days I was free.  He promptly planned a lunch meetup with me, and we both talked a lot while eating and walking around afterwards.  He even quick hugged me and told me to let him know when I get home.  We again would text every day.  It was a few days after he revealed something that would be a dealbreaker for a relationship to me that I said I want to be fwb/casual daters.  And there was basically understanding for wanting both physical and emotional intimacy but without strings attached, and that if either of us caught deeper feelings we communicate.  Another thing that stood to me is when I told him we should kiss/make out before considering sexual stuff down the line, he told me he wanted to kiss me during the second time but didn’t know how I felt.  

Anyways things probably changed a week after that.  Something happened in his family that he couldn’t go into detail about.  I decided to give him space when he first revealed, and I was surprised when the next day he continued with texting me good morning, and for the next few days he was trying to keep convo going even though it was obvious he had little mental energy.  I remember having to ask him if he’s ever going to be able to hang and making it clear I understand if not but want to know how to proceed from here.  He said “maybe later this week just to give me more time.”  And as the week progressed I again initiated by telling him days I was free.  But again he enthusiastically agreed and properly planned hanging at the movies.  

His behavior at the theatres was particularly confusing.  So we were sexting for the first time that week, and talked about making out and feeling each other while we were cuddling during the movie.  At the theater, it was me that initiated the cuddling.  But he didn’t feel me during it as we teased over text.  He also seemed dull, but he did apologize for being low energy-explaining how he didn’t sleep or eat well before coming.  And would chat a lot during the movie about what was going on.  And he walked me to the car and initiated a kiss at the very end, but  turned out to be only a quick peck.  And again told me to text him once I got back home.  And again we still text regularly, and in fact just a week ago he again replied to a Snapchat story about my selfie being very pretty (making me assume and hope he still is physically attracted to me).  

Now today after sexting I basically chose to ask about willingness to hookup in person.  The sexting seemed enjoyable and to go well on both our ends.  He said he’s definitely down for hooking up  in person.  I addressed how he didn’t feel me or make out last time despite our prior text convos and prefaced that is why I wasn’t sure how he felt about hooking up in person.  He was just like “Haha idk I just was a little off that day sorry.”  I decided to hint by telling him I’m available this coming weekend and following weekdays or week after next.  And that I’ll have to check my schedule when I start working my new job.  He responded “I can't this Sunday sorry. I need to start working too” (in reference to job hunting-yes mind you he doesn’t even have a job yet at the moment) and he didn’t acknowledge the coming free weekdays.  But he said week after next is probably best.  All he said is “ok no problem” to a message about protection if we get to doing it.  I concluded with “Ok sweet lmk when you want to do it or hang next and we can figure details and all” to basically leave the ball in his court.  And he said “ok sounds good” and then changed the subject.  Despite his initial enthusiasm while we sexted, he came across as dry and not too keen to me and one of my friends who saw this convo, when it came to me discussing actually hanging again and doing it in person.  Thing is, he sometimes texts in detail and sometimes texts short and to the point, but the latter doesn’t always strike me as dry. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you!  I’m basically wondering if the fact that he initiates texting but has never initiated the times we hung out a sign he’s just using me as an ego boost of a backup to someone he’s more interested in.  But would someone using me as an ego boost really excitedly make proper plans in advance, text consistently, and ask abt my day and keep proper convo going throughout?  Could his shift in energy have to do with things he’s dealing with in his life?  Or is it just that maybe his tone can’t be read properly over text and I should just see if he keeps being consistent and follows through on meeting up again?  I’m really into him, tho in a casual dating/fwb sense (since I don’t see future compatibility), but I’m wondering based on all the info about past and current if he really is into me (like attraction wise) the same way or not.  How should I proceed from here really? Is it worth assessing his perceived change in energy too?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,929548,public,self,What to make of guy who always initiates texting but you’re always initiating meeting?

Tonight after our date, my girlfriend noticed something was wrong. I told her that there was some stuff in my past that was hard to talk about. She asked if I killed or r^ped anybody. I was a bit taken aback by the latter, but I said no because I have not raped anybody and she said that then anything else could be worked through.

Early 20 something man or woman has never been in a relationship before. Hits the gym all the time and puts themselves out there only to strike out. Becomes jaded and just gives up on dating.

Now I'm not sure if this is because these people listen to a bunch of these narcissistic podcasts about ""winning"" the dating game, only to find out that none of this shit actually works in real life or if it's something else entirely.

But come on! Get your head out of the sand and open your eyes! You're in your 20s. The world isn't going to end tomorrow and even if it did there is still going to be men and women living in the world. 

Every one of these people has such a doom and gloom attitude that I seriously think what they need is therapy, not a relationship. 

I'm directly addressing any of these people who read this post now. If you enter a relationship with anyone looking for happiness while thinking absolute dirt about yourself then you will never find the happiness you seek. You'll always be forever chasing the phantom of your own fantasy and never catching it.

Work on yourself first. Your mental health more than your physical health because like it or not, hitting the gym every day and training yourself into the mortal incarnation of Adonis or Aphrodite will not instantly turn you into a relationship magnet.

Now if doing exactly that is what changes your opinions of yourself and makes you happy with yourself than all power to you but for those of you who this doesn't work for I have one thing to say.

Seek your happiness in something else.

Grow your skills, take up something creative where you can see your progression. Learn to cook decent meals for yourself and others. Join a community for your hobby and talk with people about it.

And if all else fails. Talk to a bloody therapist because whatever issues you've got going on won't be magically solved by dating someone.

The world out there is sucks. It's full of shitty, manipulative people who don't give a shit about you. It's full of governments and corporations neck deep in shady shit that we don't even know the half of. It's a world where only the top 1% who are born with silver spoons in their mouths have anything handed to them on a gold plated silver platter. The rest of us have to sweat, and struggle, and claw, and fight our way to anything. Education, careers, relationships. It's all a constant battle that we have to fight every single day.

It's a world where giving up *ISN'T* an option. And if you give up on anything and everything just because you can't get a boyfriend or a girlfriend at f***ing 20 then you need some serious help.

It's disappointing to see people my age (23m) just flat out giving up life and love because they can't get a date. I didn't have a girlfriend until I was 21 and that relationship recently fell apart so now I'm back to being single again. I've waded into the dating pool knowing that I'm probably not going to get anything for quite a while and I've been proven right. Has it made me give up? No. Because I still want to find a girlfriend that I can take on dates and do all the things I did with my last gf and maybe even settle down with them.

Wrong. At least wrong for me.

I have no idea where to meet girls, I have no idea how to talk to girls, I just don’t know how to interact with them. Especially if they’re attractive.

I’ve tried clubs and groups but I just feel like girls don’t want to be talked to. I’ll try and they just don’t want me to be around them. Guys seem open to making new friends but girls just seem like they don’t want to make friends with certain guys.

I don’t want to be pushy or seem like a creep so now I’m at a point where I don’t talk to girls unless I’m spoken to first. But that doesn’t work so I have to approach girls I want to be friends with, but they don’t want to be approached but I have to approach but…. And so and so forth.

But she is not constant with her emotions about us. In one moment she says she misses me and likes me, in the other she seems cold and distant. She has an avoidant attachment style; 

At the same time I'm amazed by this other girl's personality and emotional maturity (girl #2). We click very well personality wise, our humour matches a lot better than mine and girl #1's, she is smarter and in general matches me better. But her body doesn't turn me on not nearly as much as the other girl's.

I don't like not being able to rely on girl #1's emotions, I feel like I can't express myself completely or else I'll scare her away. And I hate feeling 'trapped' like this, because I don't want to lose the sexual part with her, the kissing and cuddling, but I can only have that on her terms, only when she feels like it, and if I show interest she'll tell me to let her chase me instead of me chasing her

Girl #2 has a much more secure attachment style, I never feel nervous when I'm around her, I feel comfortable. But I'm afraid I'll never be physically attracted to her as I am to girl #1. I think we'd still have good sex, but I'm afraid if it happens that I'll be with girl #2 while thinking about girl #1

I have came to the realization that my fiance has incredibly unrealistic expectations of how relationships should work. My fiance wants to go on vacations, purchases new cars, buy boats, and live in a house without having me work more than 40 hours a week and without working herself. My fiance is disabled and she doesn't work at this point. I am blessed enough to have a good paying job in which I am able to pay for one or two vacations a year and save money while paying all of our expenses. However, I am not able to afford purchasing a new house, a boat, and a car without working 60+ hours per week. My fiance says that she gets lonely when I work too much. 

However, she still wants luxury items. I told her that realistically, I will have to work more to achieve this. I have began to resent my fiance because she has high expectations without having the ability to meet them. I have come to the realization that women and men both have unrealistic expectations when it comes to dating. What makes me resentful is that I have a good job, a degree, am 5'10 with a muscular build. Whenever I previously tried to date, I could never find women that were similar. 

If I found a woman that was educated, she worked 60+ hours a week and we never spent time with each other. If I found a woman that was healthy and exercised a lot, she had other bad habits such as drinking and smoking. If I found a normal educated woman that worked 40 hours a week and was educated, she was insecure and bored with her life typically.

There is no shortage of women willing to have sex with me because I have a degree, a good job, and relatively tall and I am muscular (good looking). However, I used to think that there was a woman out there for me that matched my success and personality that was healthy and wanted a long term relationship, and that wanted to feel the intimacy that I desire so deeply. I now realize that many women are looking for support like my fiance and many women that say they want relationships are really saying, ''I want my expectation of what I believe a relationship should be like.'' I now understand why men cheat because I don't see the point in continuing to try to find a healthy relationship at this point. I would rather just sleep around with other women and men.
