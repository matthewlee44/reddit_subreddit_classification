Everything was going well but now ghosted with no explanation.

I have felt like her interest level has dropped in the last 2 months, and she has given me indirect hints that she is not interested in dating me. Hints, like inviting her best friend on the last two outings (which I didn’t mind) but back to back and maybe on future events, is what raised the red flag, and super late text replies (clearly showing me I’m not her priority). One of the strange things she did when we first met was to “hide/restrict” me from viewing her Instagram stories. I found this out because when we go out, I see she’s posting on IG but I don’t see it from my end, so I follow her through a burner account and found out about it. It’s weird she would do this, but I try not to think about it too much. No, I haven’t / didn’t get a chance to bring it up directly to her.

My last text to her was a month ago (before valentines day week) asking her a question to which she has still not responded yet. However, she does post on Instagram stories when she goes out and even watches my stories within minutes. Today I noticed she unblocked me from viewing her IG stories directly. 

A close friend of mine has helped me realize that I need to just forget and move on – which I am kinda ready to do at this point after a month of no communication. On the unblocking situation, my friend says she probably doesn’t care about you anymore so she unblocked me. However, my problem is deep inside I have not really “confessed” or told her that I like her and would like to see if she’d be interested to go on an official date; in other words, still seeking closure.

From my point of view, I blame myself because I have been nothing but good to her – a basic “good guy” who likes to take the tab (yes, she does insist on paying but I have a bad habit of taking the full bill/tickets ALL the time) and give gifts (chocolates, jacket, etc.) from time to time. Yes, I know all the alphas out there are going to teach me not to be a good guy anymore. I have watched a lot of YouTube videos this past month about it. Yes, I have realized I definitely went too hard with this nice guy character and learned from my mistakes for the future dates of all the do’s and don’ts. It’s because of these videos, that I was disciplined enough for this 1 month when I didn’t send her a follow-up to my last text/question to her. Instead just lived my life showing her I have other things to do than chasing her.

50% of me says don’t text her anymore due to self-respect and how rude she has been to me by just ghosting me / while still viewing my IG stories, and other 50% says I need closure since I have not yet told her how I feel about her (even though clearly she and her friends probably know). 

My friend suggested giving her a deadline until the end of this month (March 1st) to see if she texts back. If she does not, then give her one last shot - text her asking “Hey! Haven’t heard from you in a while. Just checking to see if everything is good? There’s xyz happening on this date, would you like to go?” If she completely ignores me, then I move on. If she tries to make excuses and says she’s busy, then I move on. If she says yes, then at the end of the night I tell her what I feel and go from there. My hopes are she will not ignore me this time, but she might make excuses.

Hey, i'm that guy (25) and i'm actually still living at home and i dont have a job right now and im in shame with my past ngl.  
I was very ambitious as a child with a lot of drive, very extroverted person etc.

But then i fell into depression  i think, i stopped going to school and missed a lot of classes etc but i still got my highschool degree. I was kinda only playing video games and not caring at all.  
After that I did  a one year university for my parents but then stopped cause i rly wasnt motivatied at all and still in depression and i really feel bad for them..  
After that i kinda was into getting ''pro player'' in a video game which almost worked out but at then i realized i wanted other things that i missed out like (going out, party,have sex etc), then i went to education abroad and i was a totally different person, like i was when i was younger,  kinda everything i wanted, going out, having party's, sex, having a lot of friends, having my own home, i even got a gf there in a short time even doe i never had one lol.  
Then i came back and instantly got a job,  after 1month i got fired (i very pretty unlucky tho :/) but still and after that i was very down again and did not much for a whole year..  
Then i worked kinda part time under my dad as kind of important delivery man but there wasnt a lot to do so i really didnt get pay much means im kinda broke now :/  


But since 2022 i changed, i'm very abitious again and a lot of drive and motivation and goals, i really want to be successful and never get into any depression shit again.  
Im very actively seeking for jobs and probably i found an educaiton where i get well paid, and its decent for the future.  


The thing is i really dont want to get into relationship right now and focus on myself and i was just looking for some casual things over dating apps which i found but then somehow there was a girl i had such a weird good feeling looking at her profil idk how to explain it she had kind of her charm (and no i didnt fall in love (yet?)haha), and she has same interest than me and i used some icebreaker on ''lovoo'' haha and she texted positively back

Single for about 10 years. Handsome, apparently, 6ft and socially skilled. On dating apps for as long as they've been around. Been on about 40 first dates that haven't gone anywhere.

My male friends say that they don't get it- they say that I'm very good looking and I have good social skills so it makes no sense.

My female friends have said the same, with one saying that ""women are silly for not dating you, they don't know what they're missing"". 

I've also had various female acquaintances- who are married or in relationships - outwardly flirt with me and go out of their way to make intentional physical contact. Of course because they're taken it would be wrong of me to escalate it - but, crucially, this has NEVER happened to me with a single woman.

I have had drunk women come up to me on the street to tell me how handsome I am, and to ask if I am single, but on the times that's happened their friend has intervened and says something like ""sorry about that, she's drunk"", before ushering her away. (Also, in case it wasn't clear, I'm definitely NOT interested in taking advantage of drunk women)

For context, I (24M) was always the nice friend, the guy girls would come to for advice but wouldn't consider anything more than a friend growing up. I didn't get a lot of attention from women and wasn't considered particularly attractive.

In the past few years I've moved from Europe to the US, gained some muscle, improved my grooming and begun a new 'prestigious' career and it feels like my situation has shifted entirely.

Now, in the past year alone I have probably been asked out 10+ times by women, I get hit on fairly regularly, and my coworkers joke when a woman my age comes in as to whether she'll ask for my number or not. Please know that I don't say this to brag or be conceited at all - as much as all the attention is nice, I'm also a little reticent when strangers treat me this way as I remember how things were when I was younger and feel most of this newfound attention is just superficial or because of my accent. I know full well I'm very lucky and that a lot of guys don't even make it this far.

Recently, a longtime friend (25F) from out of town confessed she had had feelings for me for a while. I wasn't sure what my own feelings were as I had only ever considered her a friend, but I was open to the idea and invited her to be my date to an event this past weekend. She seemed super excited and plans were quickly agreed. The weekend went well, she got along great with my current friend group and my friends were later congratulating me on 'finding my person'. The thing is, when the next day we started talking and really opening up to each other, and I confessed I had feelings for her too, she no longer seemed nearly as open to the idea as she previously had. She didn't say no outright but it was one of those times where it just felt implied.

My issue at large is not her - we have been dear friends for a long time and will continue being so regardless of what happens. My issue is more so that this is a recurring issue in my life. People flock to me now, but whereas previously the only thing I had to offer was my personality, it seems that my personality very quickly fizzles anything out and nothing deeper comes of it. I could very well post pictures of us on social media, keep up the façade with friends and pretend to the world that me and whoever are together and things are going great but it all seems rather vapid and useless at this point. It's not that I have a lack of options, per se, but that I feel starved for real emotional connection. I feel like people like me for the image I present or for what I can offer but not for who I am as a person.

Ultimately friends/family have long made excuses for me: ""She wasn't the one / she just wasn't a good person etc."" but ultimately with a continued pattern like this it is absolutely me, not them at this point. It almost feels that in improving myself I have destroyed my personality without even knowing, and I'm not sure if it was worth it. Oftentimes just in reading a stranger's story things immediately stick out, so hopefully someone here is able to give me some home truths.

She(F22) and I(M22) met at our job. we started talking on way back to metro after leaving office and during lunch hours.

After around a week ,3rd wave hit and it was complete work for home for 3 weeks …during that time she left the job to study for the professional degree she is pursuing(i am pursuing the same degree) and went back to her home town.
I didn’t have her number and it felt like a creep to get her number from the company records so i e-mailed her a meme, she replied in text and we got on calls from that day on. 

We clicked immediately and have the same nerdy interests .  I’m sure she likes me (gives me compliments and flirts) but there is one issue . She says says that she will come back to the city after the exam for job .. which will happen at least after 1 year. 

I don’t know what to do , i have read that long distance relationships don’t last very long and i am scared as i feel that basically what i am doing is delaying the pain of breakup( now or in 2-3 months).

He always talks about doing things in the future on dates including this one

Today he said-I have not told my friends about you-didn't explain why and I didn't ask I thought it was odd and took me off guard. But am I being crazy I mean i have met his family....and that went well he said they liked me

He told me how he likes taking his children to basketball practice/games because he gets to talk to other parents. On another occasion he mentioned “basketball mums”. I suppose it’s usually mums who drive kids around so most of the parents be socialises with are women?

I recently found out he has an activewear fetish. I’m that, he likes women in activewear. Last time I saw him, when we took his dog for a walk he mentioned how when he sometimes runs at the park near his house, there is a group of mums from his kids’ school who also train there as part of group fitness class. And about half of the class knows him and waves at him hello when they see him.

I cannot help but feel jealous when he tells me this. And I’m trying to work out if he’s just being honest or is he trying to make me feel jealous on purpose?

My ex wife moved on within a matter of months and had openly said she fell out of love with me years ago. I came out to her only 6 months ago, and she was supportive, but it’s grown so tense between us. 

It’s so hard to see someone I truly loved… move on and become so god damn defensive over EVERYTHING I say. I won’t even yell, raise my voice, and try to collect my thoughts before hand. She doesn’t care anymore, and that’s just how she gets when she talks to someone new. 

A few years back she had an affair with someone at our job. She completely changed, and only recently told me she slept with him. I feel that I just had to forgive her, and move on. I never got over it. I tried to bring it up the other day, as a way to better understand my uncomfortableness around her, of course she got defensive. “I’m sorry, okay? Idk what else you want me to say?!”- as she yelled. 

Of course I want her to be happy, why wouldn’t I? I just didn’t think it would be in a matter of months. Every time she opens an account on anything, she finds some internet weirdo. I’m not sure if it’s due to loneliness. Maybe it’s because finding someone new takes you away from your reality and almost makes you feel whole? Idk…

So I’m in a house where I feel utterly alone. I’m terrified I’ll never find anyone again.

then we went and got something to eat again (like 5 am at this point, i’m in spain so it’s normal), he let me take a bite from his cheeseburger. and he was supposed to leave at 6 but then we ended up talking a whole other hour and he just kept asking me questions. it all flowed with him so naturally and atleast in my end we got along great, i felt like i could be my weird self and he matched it. then when we left we hugged and said it was a pleasure to meet you. all in all it was a 10 hour date, of just walking around and talking.

i know it’s like “DUH he likes you” but i’m not sure because before we met up he was like “i’m here mainly to make friends or whatever” and that he wanted to talk with a foreigner. so i’m not sure if this was just an education for him and we’re just friends now or if he liked me, because if it were me i’m not hanging out with a friend for 10 hours when i could be sleeping. also should i ask him out again?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162271,public,self,does he like me or am i friend zoned?

(To give you a background of where I'm coming from)

I'm a guy who values deep relationships and connection. 

I don't engage in hookup culture anymore. Girls my age just want to have fun and I have different priorities. 

I own a business, take care of my health, etc.

I'm a good looking guy (not to sound like an a$$hole. People have told me my whole life) but I struggle with finding girls to actually have a relationship with. 

Most girls will just want to hookup with me, etc.

As the title says: I've been slowly working towards being with a good friend of mine for years. I care about her so much, and I would love to be with her, but... I'm also willing to give up if it means she will be happier without me. This is besides the point, sorry lmfao. Anyways...

 I have reason to believe we are into eachother:

1. We have been spending more time around eachother than ever before. 
2. If there are open spots at a table, she will always pick the seat next to me.
3. We went to the movies alone
4. We've been texting A LOT. We are both the person we text the most. 
5. She convinced me to go to a dance last night (February 26th)
6. She wanted us to stick to our dinner plans with us together, not with our other friends. 

Let's talk about the dance: I am a naturally shy and awkward kid, so dancing isn't necessarily my thing, but I tried to feel the music and just be... goofy? After awhile I just felt myself change, and I was having a good time actually dancing a bit. She too would dance a bit. Then it comes to the final slow song of the night, our friends left, every other person there is slow dancing with their partner. Then there was us. Just standing. 

Keep in mind, up until this point I was trying to find ways to make any sort of move, but my spirits were lightly crushed the moment we walked through the door. She went stopped to talk to another girl real quick, and I just barely heard the following conversation (F for the Friend. S for my friend): F ""Hey! You look amazing! Who's this?"" (Referring to me) S ""He's a friend"" F ""Yeah? Are you sure?"" S ""Yes""

They then said their goodbyes and S caught up to me. In my mind I was screaming. The pain was immeasurable. 

But... back to the slow dance: Already feeling disheartened, I decide to say, ""I feel like we should be doing something"" 
She replied with, ""Would you like to dance?"" 
I said, ""Would YOU like to dance?""
She responds, ""I asked first""
I cave in, ""Sure. If you would like to""

In that moment she wraps her arms around my neck. Me not knowing how to slow dance asks her where my hands go. Without hesitation she hastily brings my hands to her waist. We smile as we look at eachother, dancing. But that conversation I heard when we first walked in stuck with me. I feel like I could've done more to make her experience better, but my nerves and thoughts prevented me. 

I wanted to make moves. I want to believe the feeling is mutual. At the same time: I don't wanna mess things up. I don't want to ruin our friendship. I don't want to make her uncomfortable. I just want what's best for her, not me. 

I don't know. I'm lost in my thoughts. Any help/input is greatly appreciated. 

Extra info: We often playfully hit/push eachother. I'm the only one in the friend group that she bullies (In a playful manner)

TLDR; I really like my friend, and we've gone to events alone (movie/dinner/dance). We are a lot closer than we ever have been. At the dance, we finally danced together. Magical moment. But a previous conversation I overheard was calling me simply a friend.

Many years ago, I went on a date with a med student. Well technically he graduated so I guess he was a doctor. And you would think that might be like…kinda a green flag in terms of normalcy I suppose.

And talking online everything was fine. After weeks of chatting we agree to hang out at his. Which is a trek from mine. And it’s like hoarder hell. But he did warn me, I just didn’t expect it to be as bad as it was. Still, it was his parents mess so I didn’t blame him just figured huh okay guess we won’t be hanging out here again.

We go to his room to watch a movie. And fuck bro, the movie he picked should have been red flag number two . It was that fucking Katherine heigal movie where she falls in love with a spy. Like the most utter garbage you could pick. Yet alone own! On dvd!! Wtf lol. I’m all for ironically watching shitty movies, preferably under the influence of drugs But… aaaanyways I get through that hell and somehow my horny ass is still willing to make out.

As we are making out I see a piece of paper taped to his wall…..

On it is a list.

Of every woman he has ever been with and every sexual act he had done with them. For example;

Anne Marie : Came on face
Sarah : Creampie Sex
Laura: Make out

I was freaked out and asked him to take me home (because I didn’t want to spend $150 on a cab home.)I know I know, my life should be worth more to me than $150. What can I say I wasn’t thinking straight.

So he drives me home and it’s dark at night. We get on the highway and he just starts freaking out and crying about how he fucked everything up and his face is murderous.

He’s driving like a manic and I’m tense as fuck trying to calmly direct him away from killing us both.

I somehow make it home alive. Obviously. And vow never to date again.

I've never been in a relationship before so I didn't know what is considered ""normal"", this is the first time I've even gone on more than one date with someone: I started dating this girl that I met on a dating app. After about 3 months, at the end of the 3rd date (we'd gotten physical by that point), I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she said she liked me but she said ""let's just see where this goes"". I asked her that because I really like her and also at the end of the 2nd date she talked about how she got out of a 2.5 year relationship a couple of months ago and prefers long term, monogamous relationships over flings.

It's now been about 5 months total and we went on a 7th date on thursday night since she was in town (she lives about 45 mins away and drives over to come see me when we go out). The plan was to go on this date and then go to a sports game saturday night. At this date on thursday we had dinner and then went to a bar at her hotel where we had a couple of drinks.. so my honesty started coming out.

* At one point she asked what I specifically liked about her and we started talking about things we like about each other and she said she felt like I only wanted her for sex and that I never asked her personal questions. I said at this point she must have realized that I'm a pretty direct person who knows what he wants, so I said that no, I wanted more than that, I said I didn't even bring protection because I never ""expect"" to have sex with her. I said I wanted her to be ""mine"" and as a man that of course I didn't want to see her with other people. I said jokingly that I'm ""selfish"" like that and that instead of seeing other people she should see me. She said I should be seeing other people since we're not exclusive and I said that I was seeing someone next weekend and she said she was about to say ""I hope it goes well"" but then caught herself. Then we switched subjects.

**Nsfw warning (this might not even be relevant but I'm not sure so please skip if this is too personal):** After that we went up to her room where we had non-penetrative sex that was very enjoyable. She got pretty turned on and said she wanted to have unprotected sex because she was on birth control but since I've never done that before I said I didn't trust her enough to do that. **At one point she stopped me and told me she wanted to be fwb and we shook on it. I regret shaking on it because that's not what I want and instead wanted to say that no I'm not shaking on that but I did.** I left by kissing her and telling her I'd see her on saturday and she said yeah. When I got home I was buzzing with happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning I started realizing things. I realized how weird this all would come across if she doesn't feel the same way. It's a feeling like I would be ""trapping"" her in this relationship that she's not into as much as I am. It comes off as desperate and wish I wouldn't have said any of it and would have just played it cool. Saturday morning I get a text that says:

&gt;Hey for tonight's game I don't think I'll be available to go. Would love to come with next time!

So I messaged her back a few hours later once I thought it through:

&gt;Yea sounds good maybe another time

I feel like such an idiot. I know she cancelled because she also felt weirded out. I know for a fact that if I had just never asked her to be my girlfriend or said anything about committing that maybe she would have brought it up at one point. I took her from wanting a long-term, monogamous relationship into just wanting fwb to wanting basically nothing at all. So my plan now is to go no contact for about 3 weeks. I feel myself getting way too attached to this girl and I know she feels it too. I want to give her space even though it is difficult and then reach back out in 3 weeks time saying ""hey sorry things have been crazy lately, what's up?"" or something like that.

When I was 9 years old, I was over at my cousin's house. We were playing video games or something when when the doorbell rings, and in walked the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. After introducing ourselves, I thought to myself ""I'm going to marry this girl one day"". That night her and I hit it off. I had never liked a girl like that before, and we had an instant connection, as much as 9 year olds can. I remember two weeks later seeing my cousin again, and telling her ""I think your friend likes me"". She said ""oh yeah, I think she definitely does"". But I was 9, and my cousin and her lived 30 minutes away, so it's not like I was going to ask her out or anything.

We got a bit older, 12 or 13, and I would see her every now and then at my cousin's house. We would text each other sometimes, and you could tell there was still a mutual crush. But again, we were young, it's not like we were going to start dating or anything.

The summer I turned 15 things were different. Now we were at the age that when two people like each other, they date. I spent every weekend that summer at my cousin's house, and her friend would be over often too. Every time we were together, you could feel the sparks in the air. I knew that I had to do something. One night, the 3 of us had set up a tent in my cousin's basement. My cousin ran out of the tent because our parents were drunk and partying in the kitchen. Her friend and I stayed in the tent. She shuffled right next to me. We talked about our schools, and if there were people there that had crushes on us. She told me that I could get any girl in the world. I could feel more than ever that she was in love with me, **but I didn't make my move**. The moment just didn't feel right.

It was okay though, because a few weeks later my cousin had a few of her friends over. We were all watching a movie, and the girl I loved was sitting beside me. She kept shifting closer and closer to me throughout the movie, basically laying on me by the end. At one point, she even started rubbing my back. Surely this was as good a moment as any to make a move, put an arm around her, something. **But I held off**. I knew what I was doing, I was just biding my time.

That summer ended early, and we started the school year texting often. Not about our feelings, but about bullshit. It trailed off and I can still remember the feeling in my gut I had when I came home one day that November and saw ""In A Relationship"" on her facebook. But I didn't panic. I knew it was just a highschool relationship, she'd break up with him eventually and I'd have another chance.

And I was right! When we graduated high school, she became single, and was going to be attending the same University as me! Finally, no 30 minute distance between us. I took advantage and met up with her a few times for coffee. She had no problem accepting these coffee ""dates"", so why didn't I try to escalate it further to maybe going for dinner? Just waiting for the opportunity...

It came in the form of a camping trip. A week long event with my cousin, and a few other friends, including the girl of my dreams. At first, she didn't seem interested in me. She seemed more interested in another guy there actually, but she turned him down when he asked her out. One night, she was feeling really bad about it, and took off by herself. Everybody ignored her, but I went looking. I found her on the beach by herself. We sat there under the stars, and I let consoled her about her feelings of guilt, and her doubts on whether or not she'd find the right guy. I told her that she's an amazing person, and that there's every reason for a guy to want to be with her. **But I did not make my move.** She was distraught, it wouldn't have been appropriate. Or so I told myself. 

The trip went so well, she was talking about going to parties with me when we got back, she was sending me texts of random shit. Clear that she was interested. **But I didn't ask her out.** The only thing I could muster up the courage to do (almost a month after the trip, after the momentum had died) was to ask her to meet up for another boring coffee hangout, which she didn't even bother to answer.

I beat myself up over it for a while, I thought I might've screwed things up. But then a gift from the universe. Months pass and I sent her a text wishing her a happy birthday. She responds by inviting me over to her new apartment. Not me and my cousin. Just me. **But I did not make my move.** I simply replied ""Yeah sure, I'll come over someday"". I knew I screwed this one up not long after the fact, but we had a history, surely another opportunity will arise?

Since then, she found a boyfriend (a guy who looks strikingly similar to me, and started dating about a month after she invited me over to her apartment). She's been with him for 4 years now. I've seen her 3 times in those 4 years.

I have dated other women in that time frame. I've been happy with them too. You'd think after seeing other women, and 4 years of little contact, I would have moved on from this girl. But I haven't. Not even close. I to this day, still beat myself up for never speaking up. Never making my move. For continuously putting it off. And every time I think I'm over her, she pops up again in a dream, and reminds me all over again what I missed. I don't doubt I will find a girl one day, possibly marry her, and find happiness with them. But I know that I will never find one as good as her.

So to anyone who is unsure of asking the person out, or revealing your feelings for someone who is close to you. Please do it. Learn from my mistake. I've been rejected. I've been dumped.

I feel like every heart break, lack of success and even successful encounters have their lessons. Most dates leave behind something to learn from.

Even when having my heart shattered I thought ""well she's now forever gone, but she did leave me an extremely valuable lesson on what to do better next time.""

One guy on here wrote about how one time he was on a date with this woman, and she simply asked him ""want to come back to my place?"" When he heard that, a bell went off in his head like 'oh shit, it really is that simple of just simply asking.' And since then, he now asks women to go back home to his if the date is going well... and a lot of times he gets a yes.

I've learned how important it is to respect ""windows of time."" If a girl likes a guy, she'll give him a few dates to turn a flame into a fire. And if he doesn't make moves, boom friend zoned.

I've always learned that if someone is interested, you will know. If she's not, you'll be confused.

I've also learned that even though dating is a skillset, there is a portion of it that is simply out of your hands. I'm pretty sure everyone has had a cold streak even though they were skillfully trying.
