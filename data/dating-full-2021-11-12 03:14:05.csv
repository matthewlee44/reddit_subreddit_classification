  22M asexual homoromantic (diet gay)
I am not actively looking/dating, but one day I still hope to meet someone and it got me wondering a few things.  Especially after reading a lot of posts from this sub, I’ve noticed sex and “sexual compatibility” seem to be a hot topic.

     As someone who doesn’t feel sexual attraction, would this be a deterrent in dating from an allosexual perspective?  Knowing that the person you would date doesn’t/can’t feel sexually attracted to you?  I still feel romantic attraction though (i am not aroace).  I’m sex neutral, it doesn’t do anything for me and isn’t a motivator, but I realize that for most people it is.  If I were to start talking to a guy would it be ok to not reveal this about myself, or would that be selfish of me?

Also, hypothetically, if I had dated someone for long enough, and they asked for sex, would it be ok of me to ask to see a copy of their STI bloodwork to make sure they’re clean?  Or is that bang outta line of me to do lol.  I’m not one to assume all allosexuals are promiscuous however, *especially* in the gay community, using people for sex and casual hookups are extremely prevalent.

Would really appreciate some opinions on all this ! Figured this sub would be better than most subs I visit assuming the majority of people here are allosexual/feel sexual attraction.  Plus it has a lot of people.  Also for any ace spec people here who have dated, are you upfront with letting people know or do you try to avoid it at first?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125667,public,self,Views on asexual partner?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qs26zj/views_on_asexual_partner/,no_ads,0.0,,,

The communication was amazing in the beginning, then it shifted, then I told him that it was problem and he fixed it for a bit and this happened.

He texted me abruptly yesterday saying “hey, we need to talk later.” No good morning babe or how are you...just the “we need to talk”. I asked him what time we can and texted again to see if we can have this talk and this morning he apologizes saying he got busy and he should have spoken earlier. Cool. Today, I tell him to please not waste my time and to talk to me before the end of the day and he says he’s sorry and he doesn’t mean to be doing this. I tell him well you have until the end of the day and he says hes with a friend and it wouldn’t be until late night and that is when I gave him “the talk”.

I told him he made me feel so much joy  and how I thought we truly could have been something special. Still, it isn’t what I deserved.

They provide a great social experience and allow the relationship to move forward. It's just that I don't find first dates (or second dates or even third dates) as the big romantic things I thought they would be in high school.

In high school, I thought asking someone out was the absolute most advanced thing you could do to anyone in the world of crushes. When I had crushes I would form these big plans of talking to the other person and then ""asking her out"" at the end. I imagined it would be this big whole romantic thing that everyone would see and could land me on the top of the social heirarchy and could determine whether I'm destined to be with the other person forever. But I never did because I didn't have the guts.

3 years later and now asking girls out has become too damn easy for me. I can literally just message any girl (or anyone I'm interested in in any way) and ask if she wants to meet up, arrange a time and place, meetup comes, we chat, meetup goes, done. For some reason I just don't feel very romantic when I go on these first dates (or second dates or even third dates for crying out loud). Sure I do enjoy them but they just don't feel like the super-romantic events I pictured them to be in high school, and I just don't feel the same super-intense romance I felt in high school when I had a crush.

Well, the answer is very simple: 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐝𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐳𝐨𝐧𝐞 and you are just waiting for things to happen. You are dependent on the luck of meeting someone through a social circle and you secretly wish to like you and take the initiative to talk to you first.⁣  
⁣  
I have been there myself for quite a long, and I can promise you that if you DO not try to step out of your comfort zone you will never be able to socialize properly and attract the woman you really want and deserve.⁣  
⁣  
By developing your social skills you will see major success in your dating life, as well as in other parts of your life such as developing your career and your social circle community.⁣

Go out, grab a coffee from your favorite spot and have a small conversation with the employees, try to build a relationship with them. Start small, one step every day. Add five minutes of conversation with strangers every day.⁣

Yes, it is not about what you say but how you say it. Bring excitement into your voice tonality! Ask simple basic questions about the background of the person you meet, be a good listener and try to find common interests so you can develop a small/basic relationship with them.

After getting a bit of experience, start using statements instead of questions. A simple example might be to make a guess of what she is doing for a living, so instead of asking the question: ""so, what are you doing for your living?"", which is basically an interview mode, you can go like : ""You look like a lawyer/fitness coach/ hospitality professional, I bet you work in place ""X"".

Also, watch TEDx talks!⁣

Think about when you are highly confident and why.

Is it in your working environment? or when you are home and talking with siblings?

Bring awareness of when and why you are confident in these situations. Understand the topics you are passionate to talk about and repeat them in every social interaction you have. Copy-paste this same confidence in every situation you are in, in other words, copy-paste your peek state!

This should have been a huge red flag but he also lived 3 hours away for work and came back to his parents home on the weekends so I just thought he was just busy. Last week, I invited him over to mine. I made him dinner, got his favourite beer, made him apple pie. We played video games for a few hours, had sex. We talked and cuddled for a bit, kissed him goodbye. Later on, I looked at my phone and silence. No courtesy text that I enjoyed tonight or anything. Next morning, nothing. I know people are going to be like well just text him but after that I just had a strong gut feeling that he just wasn’t into me and texting him what’s up would just be a waste time.

So I met this girl at work about 5-6 months ago that talked to me 1st, which I know should sound normal, but I can tell there was some nervousness/ awkwardness in the ways we both talked. fast forward and we both have asked questions about each other eventually into more personal stuff in which we would both be like ""idk why I'm telling you this"", and I asked to hang out with her outside of work a few times, which after the 3rd time, ended with a long text saying how she is in a relationship and if my intentions were dating that she's mostly looking for friendship but that I'm super cute and fun to be around ( I assume that was just to make me feel better). after a while she talked to me about how she was having problems with her bf and I would say how something that happened definitely was a red flag but in a neutral way. I went on a small family trip out of the city for a week and when I came back she said that they broke up, but still live together as roommates, and that if I go on another trip like that, shed be down for tagging along. after that we went out multiple times, smoked in her car,  even went trick or treating with my little bro and her sister in my neighborhood. there's so much more that I don't want to go into detail about like that I come out more and we vibe a bit, but the main thing is that we barely text, which when we do its not much and usually takes a while to respond, and I'm usually the one who start the conversation. Even if she's not a big texter, I'm seeing very little oomph other than small things when we work next to each other or meet while walking. 

END OF EXPLANATION

sorry if that was a lot. I don't have many people to talk to about this stuff that wont go blathering, and I am extremely shy to start stuff other than when we vibe or have the courage to start something. any advice in if I'm just SUPER FRIENDZONED or that she is just as shy as me and that I need to just man up to this situation?

Btw I usually explain stuff terribly and get misunderstood by how I explain things because ADHD,. but I mean well, I just want to see other peoples views on this situation other than me thinking that I should just not try and discourage myself.

Me(18) and my bf(19) have dated for a few months and we in a ldr but the thing is we dated like a few weeks after his breakup and he was in a 1 year on and off long distance relationship with his ex who cheated on him and he was planning to give her a second chance but it didn’t work out and they broke up. We were friends and like a few weeks later we dated and I was aware of his relationship so I was kinda scared of being a rebound coz I have been one before but then his ex contacted him a lot of time while we were dating and he shut her down and blocked her. I trust him and the relationship is good.

Im not a gifts person and idc much about them. Id prefer spending time with my bf rather than receive a gift. So, my bf has offered to buy me stuff throughout the relationship like “I wanna buy you a snack” “I can buy u an earphone” like he works and is a student so he can afford it and offers and I have always told him no thanks coz I didn’t see the need to and I just didn’t want him to waste his money either. I was planning to buy him a gift for his bday which is in a month and I have been planning it and I wanna sing him a song too. Okay so like a week ago I was bored and told him to buy me ice cream and I was jk coz he wasn’t online and I was just spamming him then he said he will buy me tmrw and got serious about it but then I told him I can eat it myself and the next day I went out and ate it and he said he wanted to buy me with his money then I just told him that if he wants to buy me then just buy me dark chocolate and he said okay I will. 

And it’s been a week he hasn’t and tbh I have been overthinking about it now coz there has been times when his previous relationship was brought up and he told me he bought her a few gifts and back then when he didn’t work and didn’t have money, he’d tell his mom he is ordering himself food but instead order for his ex. And Now Im comparing it with what he did for his ex. I feel so bad coz all he said was okay Imma buy you and he never said anything else and while he bought stuff for his ex and I just feel so bad. It’s not about the dark chocolate, it’s just I think maybe he don’t care as much and don’t want to put that effort? Coz there has been times where he didn’t have data and we couldn’t talk and he didn’t recharge his data right away but i took him like a week or so until he did and it has happened a few times and I always wondered why he doesn’t just recharge his data like it’s not like it costs much or he is broke. I just feel like maybe he don’t want to “waste” his money on me and I feel horrible. Maybe Im just not worth it to him? I just have been overthinking and comparing it to what he did for his ex and I feel so bad.

TLDR is below.

I've (27F) been on four dates with a guy I met on OLD over the past few weeks. Since we started talking, he remained consistent in communication, notifying me when he couldn't talk for whatever reason, which I really liked. I never doubted his interest in the beginning and felt very secure/confident in talking to him.

* **First Date:** He was chatty, attractive, charismatic. At the end of the date, he asked me for a second date. The next day he brought it up again and we ended up planning the second date for a few days later. On both the first, there was pretty much no physical contact initiated by him, except for a mutually awkward hug. 
* **Second Date:** Same as first. It went well, I felt very connected, safe and secure in our communication. Still no physical touch, no compliments, no flirting. I grabbed his arm at one point during the second date but when I let go, he let me and kept distance in between us. Again, he asked me out right at the end of the second date.  

Going into the third date, I felt pretty sure he liked me and I was sure I liked him. He kept up the same length/frequency of texts in between dates. But, a few things were bothering me, he still never really flirted, never engaged in physical touch, never complimented me and did not tell me explicitly that he liked me. He mentioned to me that he is always honest but did not like compliments/flirting because it felt like it was too much. But, he mentioned that his love language was physical touch, so I figured he was just a slow mover.

* **Third Date:** He planned a somewhat objectively romantic date, with a sunset hike/drinks and a dinner. There were several romantic/good moments for him to make a move but he didn't. At the top of the hike, we sat together on a bench. I thought he would reach for my hand or put his arm around me, but instead after a minute or two, he got up and started walking around (almost restlessly). When I asked him to sit down, he said he wanted to stand up and he was good there. Needless to say, that put a sour taste in my mouth. Made me feel rejected honestly. And I was starting to believe he did not like me/wasn't interested in me romantically. So, at dinner, I brought it up to him (assuming this would probably be the last date). I asked him if he liked me, he said yes. I asked him if he was physically attracted, he said yes. He said he thought we were compatible on paper. When I asked why he hasn't tried to touch me at all, he said he might be missing a ""romantic spark,"" he wanted to respect my boundaries and wanted to do things properly than he has in the past (which were mostly hookups and no LTRs). As we were leaving the third date, I ended up reaching for his arm because it was cold. He immediately linked our arms together and put his hand on mine. Then, after walking around for a bit, he attempted to kiss me. I let him but it was weird timing for me.

The next morning, he texts me and says he'd love to see me again. We have a discussion about the romantic sparks and he mentions that he's felt it at moments and it's growing, but he's not sure yet. I agreed to another date because I thought that was fair for only a few weeks (and 3 dates).

* **Fourth date:** We go to a movie/dinner - he does not physically touch me at all or try. I touch him once on his back. So, now I am convinced he does not like me. My emotions are almost numb at this point. I am ready to end things.

Next morning, he texts me and tells me he didn't make any moves because he was being cautious cause of what happened on the third date. Then, he tells me that he realized that he should've tried to touch me on the hike but he was scared of what might happen. Scared of things not working out in the long-term, afraid he wouldn't have time for a relationship, scared of circumstances making it a long-distance relationship in the future, and suggested he might have emotional bonding issues.

Up until he mentioned the emotional bonding issues....I was willing to give him a chance and see where things go, as it's been a very long time where I felt I had a good connection to a guy and felt the guy was honest/open and good at communication. But, him bringing this up casually worries me. I have a fearful avoidant attachment style so I can understand, but it's something I am very aware of and work on trying to be better at because I want a relationship. I believe he has been very genuine and honest this whole time, but his uncertainty is making me think I need to let this go. Should I give him a chance or move on?

**TLDR: Guy I'm dating told me his anxiety and emotional bonding issues are preventing him from being physically close (and probably emotionally close), touching me, etc. I believe he is a genuine guy and he has been as open as he possibly can, but I'm starting to feel like it may not be enough in the long run. But, it only has been four dates and a few weeks. Should I give him a chance or move on?**",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125692,public,self,Guy (29M) said he's scared about being physically close to me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qs70yg/guy_29m_said_hes_scared_about_being_physically/,no_ads,0.0,,,

One night that he had to go out to talk with her again...they ended up having drinks together and he calls me drunk saying how much he needs me.  I felt annoyed and disrespected and I decided to drive over to his place to break up with him.... but we made up...

Yesterday he called me to tell me his children are requesting for him to take the wife on their $20000 a week vacation to St. Thomas where they basically live on a boat. Because they want to see how the parents will get along together. 


I've been here for him...and he's been there for me. He's a good man but I feel like my boundaries are being disrespected. 

Feels hard to leave him because 1) he's helped me get away from my abusive ex husband. He paid for my divorce. 2) he's supported me financially &amp; has invested in me......3) we've gone on vacations together...he wants to go on another in December before their family vacation.

A few weeks ago I started speaking to this girl on a dating app, the conversation was flowing really well, we was flirting and chatting &amp; really enjoyed speaking to one another. We arranged to meet up and she was up for it and so was I. Fast forward to the day we were suppose to meet, hours before we scheduled to meet she said she wants to run all her errands beforehand so she can spend the rest of the day which I completely understood. We scheduled to meet around 5ish, so as the time was approaching I sent her a message and tried to phone her. My message was ignored and phone not answered. I thought this was a bit strange but I just assumed she was still busy. Few hours pass by and I still hear nothing from her so I call her again. Still, no answer. At this moment , I presumed she no longer wanted to go out. Funny thing was she was viewing my story on Instagram and Snapchat so it’s not like she wasn’t on her phone. The next day I call her on a private number and she answers but I disconnected before saying anything, just wanted to make sure that her phone wasn’t broke or anything. Since then I’ve still heard nothing from her and few days after this I just decided to block her as I didn’t want to waste my time any longer. 

2. I was speaking to this girl for a couple of days and we agreed to meet up but since she couldn’t get any days off work we just decided to meet after her shift. Bare in mind she lives over an hour from me so I had to travel to see her which I didn’t mind. Fast forward to the day of us meeting an hour before we was scheduled to meet I sent her a message saying I’m leaving my house and I’ll see you in the next hour or so, she replied saying she can’t wait. An hour later I arrive at the postcode she told me to meet her at and I get a message from her saying “cba meeting I’m tired”. This obviously frustrated me and I tried to call her or message her saying I’m outside but I got no answer. Afterwards I just had to send her a long message saying how’s she’s a shit person etc. I drove back home essentially wasting two hours of my life and two hours worth of petrol and blocked her later. 

3. I was on a dating app and this girl popped upto me ,the conversation was going good and we agreed to meet the same day. I thought this was a bit unusual but since it was a weekend and she told me it was her birthday I just thought it’d be something to do. Again I drive an hour just to see her we meet up and she asked if I could buy her electric for her house and she’ll transfer me the money since she doesn’t have her card, I didn’t think much of it and did so. She then said she wanted to go home to change shoes since her feet were hurting her. She lived in an apartment so I just dropped her off in front of it. I dropped her home and I noticed she was gone for a while so I decided to call her but the calls weren’t going through which I thought was weird, I tried to message her on the dating app but noticed she had blocked me on that. From then I understood what happened and just decided to take another L and drove home, sad &amp; alone.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125711,public,self,Three separate incidents of girls playing with my emotions,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qs8oqt/three_separate_incidents_of_girls_playing_with_my/,no_ads,0.0,,,

He was supposed to be back in Ireland before Christmas but that gig got cancelled. He told me on Monday that it will be January before he has time to fly to Ireland to see me because of his busy schedule he doesn't have two days off work in a row until then.

He asked would I fly to the UK to meet him before then, he is essentially a stranger to me so I don't think that would be a safe/wise action for me to take.

I had really deep feelings for her but she did not want to be in a serious relationship with me (or anyone), she was honest and upfront about wanting to keep her options open and had only ever been in open relationships before dating me. We both knew we had a loving and very deep connection but she said  that she wasn't in love with me. She even admitted to me at one stage that she slept with her ex while we were still involved with each other while we were separated overseas. I was never involved with anyone else while we were together as I did not want to be with anyone else at the time. She was quite open when it came to dating and relationships but one of her rules was that she didn't like her partners to get involved with her friends or family as she had been betrayed in the past. Despite this we still continued to see each other and I  even travelled overseas to Amsterdam to see her. 

While I was there I met one of her long time friends (lets call her Jess) who I immediately got along with really well. Even the girl I was dating (Sally) was actually excited for us to meet and knew we would hit it off. Me and (Jess) had so much in common, were like old friends and we even hung out one on one a couple of times. But Jess lived in Paris and eventually had to return to her home. Even after she left Amsterdam we still messaged each other and called a few times. It was very plutonic at this stage. About a month later me and Sally had a fall out, stopped dating and decided to have a break from each other.  I found out she was brushing me off to secretly pursue other people behind my back and decided we should just be friends. Jess (from Paris) and I continued to keep in contact nonetheless as she was planning to move to Amsterdam and she actually proposed the idea of sharing a place together (even getting a dog together) as we got along so well and were both looking for a place. When Sally found out about this she called me and was very angry. She said that Jess was her friend first and she didn't want us to get a place together as she wanted to keep the relationships separate. I asked Sally if I could at least still be friends with Jess as I really liked her as a person and didn't know many people since moving overseas. She hesitantly said she was okay with this. After this Jess and I still kept in contact for quite some time and it wasn't long after this that we started to have feelings for one another. Unfortunately the friendship never progressed into anything more though as we both knew this would upset Sally and Jess was too loyal of a friend to hurt Sally.  I often think that I dated the wrong girl and sometimes wish I met Jess and was dating her instead. Jess also really wanted a loyal and committed long term relationship just like me and her and I had a really nice friendship that definitely could of blossomed into something more. 

Is it wrong for me to feel this way? What was the right thing to do in this situation? If me and Jess did get together would Sally have a right to be upset?

I saw him a few days ago. He was a bit startled when he saw me. He was polite and we had some chitchat but I could detect no signs of romantic interest, or physical attraction or whatever. I later sent him a link relating to something we talked about and he left it on read.

At this point I really feel that I need to respect his wishes and move on. I think I'm getting there, but I still have these very vivid sexual fantasies about him, including when I masturbate.

Sorry for the long post and possible typos, writing on my phone here. :)

I’m (F34) seeing this guy (M33) for about a month now. He super liked me on Tinder and although he isn’t my “typical type” there was something about him (some common interests) that made me really curious and so I swiped right on him.

He immediately started chatting with me and after a while suggested we’d meet up to talk more in person. I wasn’t available the day he mentioned so we ended up meeting another night for drinks and had a really good time, although there was a bit of a language barrier from my side (i have a decent level in his language but I’m not fluent) and extra nervousness because of it. We talked about relationships in general and he told me having broken off with an ex of 5 years less than half year ago but being ready for a relationship and open if the right person came along. I’ve been single longer after a long, serious relationship (and some situationships) but on the same page about being emotionally available should the right person appear in my life. He also told me he super liked me because my bio mentions that and that I’m looking for a real connection.

Anyhow, we ended up texting a bit every day since, both of us initiating quite equally and since I couldn’t meet up again the following weekend as I was out of town, I reached out to him to suggest another day the following week. I had a chill dinner and drinks in mind at a local restaurant, which we did but we also ended up drinking quite a lot, going out to several clubs and in the early morning to my place. We didn’t have sex although he definitely tried but fooled around until I had to ask him to leave because I was a few hours from having to wake up to work lol the night all in all was super fun though!

Since then we texted a bit here and there but he was out of town the following weekend and his replies took hours. I totally get that if you are on a trip there is no need have your phone glued to your hand, but I couldn’t help my anxious, over-analysing self to spiral down with thoughts of him now surely slow fading on me (I know, my issues and I’m working on those). Eventually he replied though and all seemed well, but he wasn’t initiating more hangouts.

This week I reached out to him to suggest an activity together on a specific date, but he had a work thing so he asked to hang out the same night instead. I didn’t mind and kind of wanted to continue where we left off the last time so I invited him over to my place. He arrived almost 2 hours late (he did text me 3 times during to update me and apologise for the delay), and I did tell him not to come if he is not interested in seeing me but he swear it wasn’t that and said he really wants to see me so I said fine. He finally arrived and we watched a movie, talked and cuddled and eventually had sex. The sex wasn’t earth shaking, but then again the first time with a new parter it hardly ever is for me. (: he was looking at me in the eyes intensely the whole time, but was “weirdly” quiet during the sex (whereas I don’t hold back with making noises when I enjoy but neither am I like overdoing it). After a while of me on top I asked him to do me from behind which he then did for some minutes but he then just kind of stopped and I asked him surprised if he came (I wanted him to, my partners pleasure is important to me although I don’t care if he comes or if he doesn’t, as long as the sex is otherwise enjoyable to him). He said yes, but I could see there was nothing in the condom. I just shrugged it off and we cuddled some more at least an hour after until I again had to ask him to leave nicely because I had an early morning the next day. He had suggested he’d stay over the night but I had told him in advance that for me sharing my bed and sleeping with someone new is super intimate and I’m not comfortable doing that until I know him better and he seemed cool with that.

He texted me once he got home, but I haven’t heard from him since. It’s only been 2 days but because of my anxiety I’m thinking again that maybe I don’t hear from him again. I know I could text him, and I’m all for equal relationships and don’t want to keep tabs, but I just want to feel that he truly is interested in me and showing it by seeing some effort (something that my previous long term partner wasn’t doing, that’s why I’m so adamant about it, I guess).  I know 2 days is nothing and I should just leave the ball to his court now, right?

I have a nice life and friends and try to keep myself busy, but when the anxiety hits I can’t help but think that maybe the sex was bad for him? Or maybe he didn’t like the way I look naked? (I’m in a fairly pretty 5,6 ft and 145 lbs, take care of my hygiene etc. so I don’t think that would scare him off but who knows..)

I am very new to the dating world.. just lost my spouse last year and only in the last few months have felt safe in venturing out.  I've had a few interactions, none of them ended up like I'd hoped.  One hookup, then the all too common ghosting.  One person, I idealized and put so much hope into and it didn't go anywhere.  Another started fast and burned out just as fast.  I'm finally able to close those chapters and put them behind me.

I'm getting ready to go on the 3rd date with someone I wasn't sure about, and am still discovering.  I had doubts.  But, this one feels different.  It started very slow, he asked what I wanted, and genuinely cared about my responses.  Both previous dates have been sweet, cautious, genuine.  The first meeting was just for the purpose of meeting in person briefly to make sure we were both still interested.  He suggested a public parking lot for my comfort and safety. He pulled out his telescope and showed me the planets visible that night, followed by a walk around the neighborhood where we stopped near a spot he likes to visit when he wants quiet, meditative.  Goodbye was sweet, quick hug and immediate suggestion to plan another night. 

Second date, dinner.  Easy conversation, he was enthusiastic, interested. Genuine.  The night ended again with a quick hug and immediate suggestion to make plans for the weekend.  We're seeing each other again Sunday, a walk and what I hope will be another day of discovery/exploration.

In between dates, I have a good morning text every morning (just got one while typing this) and one sometime during the work day, just to say hi.  Good conversations at night, goodnight text before bed. I mentioned I love sunrise/sunset photos, he sends his own photos and when he doesn't have one he's taken, he searches for one to attach to good morning text.  If he's going to be out of pocket, he makes sure I know he's not disappearing and lets me know when he'll be back so I don't have to wonder.  No pressure to do anything but get to know each other.  My anxious attachment style has been problematic in the past, but he is handling it proactively without being prompted.

This one started slow and continues at a slow, steady pace.  No pressure to jump ahead, just being present and investing the time to really get to know each other.  No guessing about whether he's still interested, no games, no rushing towards more or setting unrealistic expectations.  It feels comfortable and tender.

I'm not the most patient person, and I've made some real messes previously.  I find myself really wanting to care for this new person and nurture whatever we are building.  It's a different feeling.  Peaceful and hopeful, but not getting too intense too quickly.  Before him, I would have never opted for this, I would have chosen intense, passionate, fast, but then I am.always left to cry at the aftermath.  

I like the butterflies, and the anticipation of just seeing him again, spending quiet time with him, and not worrying about where it will go next.

No real question or reason to post except that I just want to put it out into the universe that I'm appreciative of this gift, even though I started with so much doubt.

One thing I find annoying is the target our relationship puts on our back. A lot of people such as friends and family, and even the occasional stranger treat me with condescension or pity, telling me I can do better. My parents are even like this.

I don't agree with them at all, but I'm wondering how to get people to stop disrespecting our relationship and not treat me with such pity. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.
