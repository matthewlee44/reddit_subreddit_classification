0,nm8k9n,1622125332,I agree that most guys do not want random sex and want a genuine relationship,"It's funny because my old girlfriend was super abusive and cheated on me and it was because she wanted to have sex but never said so and actually acted and said the opposite as she wanted to wait

So in that situation I'm a guy who lost out for being respectful and not pushing for sex

I've had two other steady girlfriends and a bunch of flings and I have yet to have PIV sex but saying that usually ends up with people disrespecting me and losing interest despite the fact that so many women say that they hate that men lead with sex

There are also a lot of women who seem to be turned off if a guy it's not acting sexual.

It's a weird conundrum because whether it be biological or social a lot of men probably at the part because doing the opposite like I did led to them being cheated on or made fun of

It's easy on girls side to judge this but as a man I don't because trying to be yourself and not conform to society usually leaves you ostracized and people look at you weird


I've had tons of girls and guys believe me because I am pretty sexually selective. And that is because most men in specially big black men are expected to be super aggressive with their sexuality

I hate The stereotype and I hate it as both a black person and a man because it's not true and I have actively suffered for acting the opposite and it gets a little frustrating when you keep hearing this pedal


I told my friend who was having God troubles that the reason why she can't find a good guy is that she keeps picking the ones who are starting off sexually and hoping that she can change them

There are so many dudes who are willing to date her seriously and wait for sex but those dudes aren't exciting to her. All she sees is all the guys in her circle which are the ones whom she allowed to do so


I've had two women cheat on me and even I know that not all women cheat but judging by my experience I should be able to justify that type of thinking because that's who I was around.

I'm being sarcastic on that last one but it's the same principle when I hear so many women say that men somehow lead with sex and that's all men.

I had some conversations with new matches last night and I caught myself, unintentionally, being a little “too” me, meaning I didn’t alter my behavior to come off as more appealing. I just spoke as I’d speak with any guy friend.

I dug it. I felt a bit liberated. It was a nice break from the nerves, pressure...anything that might be felt when engaging someone new. 

This isn’t me selling my “innovative, progressive, and empowering” approach to dating. It’s just how I was feeling last night. I’m a hundo sure that this isn’t the move if you’re on a mission for marriage. I’m not actively trying for a relationship and I doubt there are any proposals in my DMs because of my relaxed attitude.

And if Reddit thinks I just let her go and just focus on yoga, I think I agree with Reddit on that one. But hey, I can't help who I have my eyes on sometimes...  

My dad suggested reaching out to my instructor and asking her if she would pass my number along, but I don't know about bringing someone else into the ""relationship"" so soon.

10,nma7br,1622129955,Am I(20) asking for too much if I want to be with a girl that isn’t fat?,"#THIS IS NOT MEANT TO FAT SHAME ANY GIRLS. 

I’m 20 year guy in college, I’m friendly, kind, volunteer a lot, a hard working, I’ve already secured a job for after I graduate. I’m around 5’10/5’11 I have a okay face, I think I’d be a fun guy to date, I mean I’d date me at least. 

When I was a little kid until early high school I was pretty fat. I got bullied for it felt like shit, had incredibly low self esteem the whole shebang. At around age 16 I developed an eating disorder and I think I didn’t get over it until I was around 18. I then got fat again and then I started learning more healthy ways to keep the weight off. Now I’m down to 165 after eating really good and putting on muscle. I get told I look in shape and I don’t think I have an awful body. I’m not overweight at least.

So I said this whole story because part of my reasoning for wanting to get in shape was that I wanted to be more attractive to women, and I guess I am but the only girls that I ever get likes from or match with on dating apps are fat girls. I’m not particularly attracted to them, but it seems like that’s all their is. I know I’m not some super in shape 6’+ Adonis, but I didn’t think I was asking too much to be with a girl that also cares a lot about her physique and health.

Am I able to get that, or are girls that aren’t fat out of my league until I get into really good shape.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nma7br/am_i20_asking_for_too_much_if_i_want_to_be_with_a/

12,nmao3w,1622131220,At the verge of my breaking point. Boyfriend puts no effort in to see me.,"I’ve posted to quite a few places because I really need help on making the right decision. Should I try to fix this, I will do anything to make it right. I will be responding to all comments. Ask away. 

So my (f16) boyfriend (m17) and I fight a good bit. He’s pretty mean to me and I try my best to stay nice but i struggle. He hurts my feelings A LOT. I totally understand that both of us can be in the wrong, i don’t disagree with that at all. I am not claiming to be in the right. 

My boyfriend and I won’t hang out for a week straight and it hurts my feelings. He won’t even budge to make plans. I mention it and he will say that it’s my fault because I didn’t ask. It wouldn’t be a problem if we facetimed, but he hates to facetime, because I won’t show my face completely. But he always calls his friends everyday over an xbox party and there are no faces shown. So why can I not show my face. He is totally okay with going a WEEK without speaking at all. Just text. That’s it. I have a feeling he just doesn’t care to see me. He can go days without leaving the house and having no human interaction. I like to see people. Both of our love languages are physical touch, so I don’t get why he doesn’t want to see me. I stopped texting all lovey dovey because I would rather do it in person. Then he gets angry with me if I “text dry” It’s like he only wants to be in the relationship to text eachother. But i want more. He doesn’t want to see me often because apparently we fight more, we still fight even if it’s just texting, we actually fight more if we don’t hang out. He also doesn’t want to hang out often because I “text differently” right after we hang out. Like more dry ig? He gets mad if I text any way he doesn’t want me to, so why can’t we just hang out? 

So between the time we hang out, there is no speaking whatsoever. 1 week without speaking to the love of your life seems crazy to me? One week with no interaction besides texting. No words, no hugs, no eye sight. 

I told him how I was afraid when we both started to get busy in the summer (work and sports) we would only be able to hang out for 2 hours every 3 days. He said “so what, it’s better than nothing. it’s not like we need to hang out everyday.” He then sent me a tiktok saying that hanging out every day is something to not do in a relationship. It hurts my feelings. I wasn’t asking to hang out everyday. I was nervous that we wouldn’t hang out at all. He doesn’t even care. He’s thinks it’s okay that he doesn’t want to hang out with me, but that means that I would have to text him every 3 minutes. It’s insane. I don’t think we should have to text all the time. We are not in a long distance relationship. I need physical interaction with him.

TL;DR

17,nmbbte,1622132974,Am I such a bad catch?,"When I hear women talk about their preferences, they often say, they want a vulnerable, emotional available man who can show weakness. They say, they reject men, who show of stereotypical traits. Especially the mental-health-awarness movement has intensified this: ""failure is normal"", ""dont value youself upon your income"" or ""every person deserves to be loved"". And off course: ""as long as you love youself, you will be loved"".

I think its the opposite whe it come to Dating.

Despite learning a lot in school, I barely passed High-School. Psychiatrists told my parents, they diagnosed a low intelligence in me. I will likely to be underperforming academically respectively in the job market. After I finished high school, I started working first to save up money to start college. 

I began college but failed after two years. I needed to go back to my old work place, to pay off some dept and save up enough money again to start over, which I did. Unfortunately I failed again. In the end, I dont why exactly I failed. Like in high school I needed to learn a lot to pass exams. The longer I stayed in college there more complex the topics became. I just couldn't understand them though I used all my free time to learn about it. Today (31) I am still paying off my student debt to be more flexible again. Nothing fency. Fast food Industry. But I try to be happy with what I have. 

With 25/26 I started actively seeking romantic encounters because until then I never tried and no women ever showed interest in me. As soon as I told a woman my educational background they rejected me. I tried everything. I asked women out directly, I registered on online-Dating plattforms and vivsited Single-Events. But nothing worked. 

Last year I got a little bit frustrated, since I am living now for so long in (romantically) isolation. I tried an experiment. I changed my job description on all these sites to something like Lawyer or CEO. I Immediately got a lot of matches. 

I didnt know what to think. I never thought I would be negatively judged over something I have no control over (my intelligence/my academically success) or where I have tried my best. I no constantly think negatively and I have this had in my voice that I am that man no women wants. Then off course I tell myself, this is no true. But on the other hand this experiment spoke for itself. And off course my experience outside the online Dating world, where women would lost interest in me whenever  I told them about my educational past. 

Since I am so confused now, I thought I would ask Women directly. So is this really true? Do women judge minimum-wage man differently? Is imperfection, failure and thing like not passing an exam unattractive? Am I such a bad catch?!

However, my parents (who aren’t married, they’ve cohabitated and raised me and my brother together) strongly disapprove of him on the grounds that he isn’t Christian enough.

28,nmckul,1622136286,My GF dumped me on Tuesday...but...,"After dating a few months my girlfriend dumped me. I wasn't exactly blindsided since she had been very cold and distant the past few weeks. Past couple weeks I had helped her around her place, installing some curtain hangars and helping her move some furniture, but she wasn't exactly affectionate and the sex had dropped off. She was finishing up school and a friend visited her for a few days last week so I figured she was just busy and exhausted and wanted to give her some space. Maybe she had gotten a little to familiar and sick of me. Well my guess was right. 

Nonetheless I liked her and I felt very hurt, sad and kind of used. I took some time off work just to spend some time with myself to mediate, rest and get re-centered. I went for a walk, did some exercises at home and lit some incense. Last night going to bed I finally felt like my emotional malaise was beginning to lift just a bit. 

Then this morning on my way to work I got a DM notification on Instagram. It was from a very attractive woman that I met a couple years ago who asked if I wanted to have dinner and catch up. We had chemistry but timing wasn't in our favor a few years back. Must've been some weird form of kismet because there's no way from social media that she heard I was single again. I said yes and she was so excited and appreciative that it completely caught me off guard. My ex was kind, but she never really showed a lot of excitement when I'd come over or ask to see her.

I’ve never had the balls to do that ofc... but i also know that i’ll end up alone if i won’t do that cause, come on, a lot of girls don’t approach.

But i want to clarify: that’s probably in my country, but guys HAVE to approach. If a girl likes a guy and it’s a mutual thing but nothing happens, then it’s the guy’s fault... why? 

I know girls approach guys, but they look like gods, that’s why they approach them. I even have a better physique, i’m more fit but still nothing works for me cause my face sucks and my hair are falling rapidly.

It’s like on dating sites: i thought i would have met some cool people there ( not just for a relationship) but girls don’t even reply or simply go for the handsomest guy on earth cause they can",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmcq9i/dating_as_an_ugly_guy_is_hell/
32,nmcupg,1622137005,My [28 F] partner [31 M] is constantly discussing the wrongs that have been done to him in his life. How do I help him without becoming depressed myself?,"He had a bad childhood. He’s had friends betray him and some have success now. When relationships end, there’s barely any good left, it’s “usually” he someone hurting him and then wants revenge. He will go on long rants about the person and how he hates them. He seems much more vengeful than he does hurt by the people that hurt him. 

He has a very odd expectation of people, yet at times he doesn’t really honor things other people want or even find a way to compromise. 

What’s the difference of him venting verses just being an pained asshole. He seems like his asshole ways are supposed to be accepted because of his pain. He barely views things as “miscommunications” but almost others being the one that’s insensitive or ignorant. 

He comes to me to pour his feelings on me, but when I do with mine, he says he’s got his own stresses and I should discuss it someone else. 

He also seems upset I can’t relate to his pain and told me he wishes I could. Interestingly enough He can’t relate to the happiness I share with my family.

He pushes my logical thinking away, but I use it to help him realize he’s no longer dealing with the issues in the current.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmcupg/my_28_f_partner_31_m_is_constantly_discussing_the/

she even gave a few heads up she'd be willing to go out, a few weeks ago I did ask her, something came up, she started texting less and taking longer to reply. the 2nd time I asked her she said yes come the time she started flaking and making excuses, basically she was playing games.

I then came to the conclusion that's it I'm done not gna text her, chase her ask her again, give her no attention, move on purely work relationship.


since then. 2 weeks she's been texting me morning, night, days, at work she was very flirty I barely reciprocated, I barely respond and when I do it's short and to the point 

anyways, this past week I was at work when my buddy called me saying hes in the area for lunch, do I wna hang out as he has 2 hours free between meetings, I said sure why not leme ask my boss. I asked my boss, she, the other colleagues over heard, and despite me denying it over and over she and they kept saying its a date, hes got a girlfriend. After denying it for an hour I gave up. started accepting it and asked the boss for ""nice lunch places to take someone in the area""  


I went to a diff part of building where my friend but also the girls close friend works, she says I hear uv got a hot date, who u tryna make jealous wink wink.  I explain truthfully its not, she said maybe you should go along with it, see who it exposes, I said alright I'm gna do it 

the girl I like comes in, she's like hes got a date, I wna know her name, I said no. she looks at the other girl and says jts me, were going on a date. I ignore it and go back to my place.

come back from lunch, she's now all in my zone, asking where I went what did I eat, what did the girl eat to figure her out. once that finished, she kept talking about anything and everything, hit my arm, n then come her shift end she left without saying goodbye for the first time ever.

I went down to restock, her mates there, saying I take it its going well then, maybe this will make someone reply quickly..(how does she know!?).

I go home,  I get a text from the girl,  girlfriend update please,  I leave her hanging. Next day her mate texts me saying she's convinced of your date, said it sounded like you had a really good time, and she wants to know all the basic details of the girl, how she looks, personality traits, star sign etc, she also says maybe you should have another fake date or too then break it off.

I reply to the girl saying what do u wna know , she said name, height, hair colour, how we met, where we met, I responded with a similar hair colour to hers, Gemini(that's what she is lmao) and personality pretty much similar to hers but not exact, won't give name cuz she's gna stalk her

she instantly responds saying she won't,  maybe she will hehe and Gemini is good cu thats what she is and she's great.


I dont respond, I feel bad, since then she's been on whatsap a fair bit, she's usually once a day person. I'm guessing she's checking my response or not.

so ANYWAYS. what do you think is going on here? is she jealous? whats her deal? what's her friend's deal? is she playing cupid? 

do I leave her hanging for a couple more days cuz scarcity will mess with her mind, how do I play this.

After she went home she said that her wrists were still hurting and was mad at me for hurting her. She also told me in the past that I grabbed her wrist too hard.

I was kinda scared of being single and lonly. But right of the bat I picked up a girl at a party. She is my age, so naturally she has two kids ofc. And I just can't belive my luck! So this is a home run right? 

So I think  what determines if this succeeds or not is going to be my relationship with her kids right. I get to know them, and surprise surprise they love fotball just like me. Just like all boys do, talking fotball and playing fotball. Easy squeaky Japanese, u got this in the bag m8.

Picking her up, picking up the kids, its like im having a new family. Because im getting so along with her kids, im her man. She curves up to me in the sheets, and says; god I cant imagen losing you. 

She has a vacation booked, that was made before I meet her. In Italy, I drive her to the airport etc. She says she doesn't want to go, she wasn't to be with me bla bla bla. 

Thats the last time I saw her. Next day I call her, straight to voice mail. I send a txt, I love you I need you etc. No answer, thats a bit strange? Did the plane crash? 

Two weeks later, shes supposed to be back home now, I drive to her house. Just to make sure she is safe, nobody's home. I walk in the back yard and look into the living room. The remote controle is exactly where I placed it the day I drove her to the airport.

I'm picking up my phone to call the police, and my brains says stop. You dont really know her do you? 

8 months later im going thru my routines stopping by the gas station for work etc. Behind the counter look who it is! Its her, I just couldn't belive my eyes! 

I walk up to her and ask ""Where have you been?"" She starts talking alot of nonsense about losing her phone. And finding a new man. Im like what?

Being told (in my case) that you’re sooo special and amazing and he wants you forever, princess, here is a bunch of expensive shit you never asked for. Hearts all over the fucking whatsapp conversation. When you meet in real life he says “I hope you never left me, i am so scar-red to lose you!” 


You’re overwhelmed and exhausted cause dating sucks, and you learn to accept the compliments and special treatment which still never feels entirely earned or comfortable...


And then he fucking drops you. The interest dwindles fast and the plunge is fucking painful. Why? Who knows! Maybe he got bored. Back together with an ex. Found a better object of obsession? But he suddenly stops texting you. Whereas before, he sent you pictures of everything he did from waking up to being on the job, riddled with hearts of course, he now sends you a dry ass text at 3 pm. “Goodmorning.”

At that point you are trying to answer the affection and meet his intensity, in a way, and you reply with hearts and questions in a way that would normally seem juvenile and stupid to you. You feel butterflies now, because how could you not, when he basically sends entire flocks of them into your face all day long.


But you hear nothing from him! All day. There you sit with your stupid hearts and “I miss you,” and you feel duped. It gets worse. He quickly makes it obvious that he’s no longer interested in you. This is ‘t done in an active, straightforward way. Nope, you get **faded.**


And then you wonder what the fuck you did wrong. Why did he stop liking you? Why did he like you in the first place? You realize suddenly that he never even asked you about your life, your opinion on things, your family or even your hobbies. And then you feel really fucking stupid. Because you were just an object of obsession, and all of those stupid little promises he made are nothing more than fairy dust. And then you’re left with nothing. 


Please think carefully before you shower someone with affection. Don’t make promises that you can’t keep.

61,nmi0bo,1622150610,Am I [M23] overthinking this situation with the girl [F22] I'm talking to?,"So long story short, this girl and I have been talking for over a month now. The first half of it was mainly through text and phone calls cause she was about to graduate from Uni a couple hours away (we're both from the same area/city basically). She came home for a weekend at the beginning of us talking and we went on a great date and really vibed. From there, things just continued to escalate and I could tell she was falling harder and faster than I was. Nonetheless though I was still catching some feelings and enjoying where things were going. We spent most of last weekend together, Saturday - Sunday; went on a great date, she spent the night and we just had a great time overall.

On Monday, she ended up joining the gym I regularly workout at on a month membership so that she could workout with me and we could spend more time together (I was open to working out together but felt like if we were working out all the time with each other we'd spend too much time together too quickly). Had a great time that night tho.

On Tuesday, things started to feel off for some reason. We had memorial day weekend plans that ended up falling through (lake house that a friend owns and they had to cancel the plans) and she was clearly bummed about it. She also has a job interview this week (today) as a FA (flight attendant) in a different city (she'd be commuting from our home town so it technically wouldn't make things difficult if we ended up in a relationship) and has been extremely stressed about it. This stress and her down mood became extremely noticeable throughout the day; not as enthusiastic texting, panicking over the job, stressed that she might fail a drug test, etc etc. I reassured her all night that everything would be okay, amongst other things and her flirty self came back out per usual.

Yesterday, things once again felt off. The conversations were light or boring at times and she just seemed in a down mood once again. Same with today (the day of the interview). She's still flirty at times and was upset yesterday that she wouldn't get to see me until Friday (she gets back late tonight). I can't help but feel like things are off, I'm sure the stress of the interview and potentially failing the drug test is playing a huge role in her mood but part of me also feels like were growing some distance from it. Am I overthinking this? I've been trying to go with the flow but I've also been dealing with some big job related stress and tend to really overthink when I'm stressed myself.

This afternoon we talked a bit about some work stresses that I've been dealing with (after her interview) and told her that I kinda hid my stresses from her at times and that it probably made me seem distant.  She said the same thing and how she wanted to work on improving her communication with me.  Conversation got a little flirty/sexual after all of this and kinda seemed back to normal but I know she'll continue to be stressed until she founds out the answer from her job....and we've certainly had some high period in the past few days but they've been short lived so I'm hoping this isn't just another one of those.  

How should I take things from here? Should I give her space and text less until this job interview period is over? Should I pull back and just let her invest the time? Thoughts?

tl;dr: Met a girl, hit it off instantly, things have been going great for the past month. Past couple of days have felt off due to her stress over a job interview.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmi0bo/am_i_m23_overthinking_this_situation_with_the/

More importantly, he’s a wonderful person. Not once has he tried to overstep his boundaries or give the impression that he’s disguising his attraction as friendship. As a friend, I know I would be okay with rejection and even watching him go out with other people. As a real friend who genuinely likes him, it wouldn’t matter as long as he’s happy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmihew/do_men_like_it_when_women_wanna_be_their_friend/

I respected her feelings and told her that it was okay. I would be lying if I said I didn't like her at least a little bit, but I truly don't mind being friends and I never do anything to suggest that she should date me. She's a great friend and it's okay. 

I do notice her warming up to me the more we see each other, though. She gives me long hugs when we see each other, she'll hug me as we're hanging out, she gives me touches on the leg and arm as she's talking to me, she'll scoot close to me on the couch so that we're touching.

69,nmj5px,1622153828,Why is it so hard to find a guy that meets the most basic criteria? Or are my standards too high?,"I don't think my standards are extreme. I think it is bare minimum for the most part and yeah some personal preferences. My friends say they are too high though. I mean I want a guy:

- not racist/sexist/genderist (idk the one for not against LGBTQ+). Also doesn't believe in outdated gender roles (only I watch the kids/do housework)
- has a job willing to work
- doesn't smoke at all or drink excessively preferably not at all but every once in a while I may drink so that it why I say just not constantly drinking alcohol 24/7
- not clingy
- takes care of his appearance (doesn't wear dirty wife beaters 24/7) 
- has their own car (it feels so unattractive when I have to be the one picking a guy up for a date) 

I don't think any of that is too much to ask. And yeah I have a type I prefer (kind of the geeky smart sweet guys)

Little things I don't find attractive (bushy mustaches, multiple gaming system screens, or guys that sleep all day until 3pm because they won't get a job)

If I really like the guy I wouldn't care about the facial hair or extensive game systems if they met the biggest ones listed. Just as long as they don't sleep or play video games all day because they got no job

I mean I want someone similar to myself I am working on establishing my professional career about to have my BSW, I keep a full time job, I pay my own bills, I walk around presentable, and I don't hate any groups. 

It just seems like every time I meet a guy they do one of the biggest ones listed. Oh they don't smoke good but they are unemployed sleeping until 2pm everyday to wake up and play video games. Oh they are employed but really into pot. Oh they are employed but are racist.

70,nmj7ha,1622153968,[M] Introvert. How to approach girls and maintain conversation?,"I'm ENTP with SzPD, OCD, social anxiety and more, so bit weird questions also I'm half asleep. Mish mash of questions but you will get the point.

I'm not good with conversations but so are girls, atleast from my Tinder and Messenger experience.

What girls like to talk about? What's a good way to approach girl and maintain conversation.

I'm like a ghost I scare people. I just suddenly appear out of nowhere or look like a creep.

So when I'm in a club how could I make female friends or make out if I don't talk much?

What girls should I approach? Group of them or some girl alone? Don't I bother them? Most just went out to have fun not for hook-ups probably.

If all of it goes well and she's comfortable around me what about touching or keeping her closer to my body to tell others she's mine.

Then how to ask if she wants sex? Shoud I just ask if she wants to come home with me? 

I don't give a f but telling her just Wanna fuck with me? won't get me anywhere 9/10 cases.

If she doesn't want sex that doesn't mean she doesn't want to be freid but rest of the night could be bit awkward or does girls get asked a lot and are used to it? What's better? Hints or straight to the point?

Kinda weird imo but asking her if she wants to cuddle and sleep at my place or while watching Netflix without long previous conversation.

My biggest problem is probably talking. Sometimes I have panic attack and don't want to talk or my emotions are turned off. What should I tell her? I don't like talking much or I don't feel well

Probably best convo line for me would be: I like you you look cute. I don't talk much and I'm bad dancer if you're bored or thirsty I'll be at the bar.

If those are stupid questions tell me I don't want to spam this sub with more.

Attractive, not attractive....it doesn’t matter, I literally don’t feel any interest in anyone in any way. 

This has happened once before but I guess I got over it.

Like, I care to an extent in finding someone (many many nights of crying myself to sleep will vouch for it and so will my therapist(s) ) but it’s like I’m....stopping anything from starting and/or actively sabotaging something that may have started. 

Like, this current guy I’m talking to: I knew it was probably best to reply to him at a good time, but it still took over a day to churn out a response. Like I actually OPENED the app the day he sent the message, saw the message he sent, then I was 2-3 words into replying.....and then...I just closed the app without sending anything.

Asked her out, she said no. End of.

We stayed friends, she dated a guy who she knew was a complete dick (i stopped talking to her whilst she dated him, couldn’t handle that she liked a known compulsive cheat but not me, kinda destroyed me (r/niceguys here i come?)). 

They broke up, she hit me up and we’re now mates again. 

That said, I’m still definitely in love with her.

I’ve now stopped talking to her because I can’t get over someone when i talk to them consistently.

It’s been about a year since i last spoke to her but the feelings are still there definitely.

Anyway, the only reason i added that bit is because this is r/dating and i’m pretty sure it’d get taken down without context. my real question is this:

How long did it take you to get over the one that got away? 

I’ve been told a girl likes me, she’s super cute and funny and pretty and all that (and she definitely likes me, no doubt) but the feeling just isn’t there.

82,nmki9p,1622158033,"After a really weird experience at the gym, I’m beginning to think I(20) might be scared of attractive women and I don’t know how to fix that.","So today I was at the gym and I went there to do abs and some light cardio. The way my gym works is that most things are downstairs and the ab machines and treadmills are upstairs. So I went upstairs and the ab section was pretty empty except for 3 cute girls who were all together working out. The my first workout was at a machine 4 feet from them and I couldn’t use it. I couldn’t bring myself to go anywhere near them.

I went the my second workout instead and it was across from them and if I looked up I could make eye contact with them. I’m terrified of them thinking I was looking at them, or thinking I thought one of them was attractive, or them noticing me in any way. So I just stared at the floor the entire time.

My third exercise was away from them, but they came and started using the two machines I was in between. It was just too much. I finished my set, got up, and left 15 after I showed up.

What’s crazy is this isn’t the first time I’ve done something like this. I’ve done it at the gym before, I’ve done it at restaurants, hanging out with friends even. There’s this one girl that’s a friend of a friend, and I can’t hang out with my friend if I know she’s inviting her. I’ve never said a sentence to the girl, I don’t she knows me past my name but I just can’t allow myself to be around her. Like the only way I feel like I can talk to women is over tinder and I don’t even get any matches so that’s a crap shoot.

I don’t know why I’m like this. The best guess is that it comes from some bad experiences I’ve had consistently with pretty girls wherein they bully me, make me feel like I’m not worthy to breath the same air as them or some other thing that’s fucked me up.

I don’t know how to fix it. I’m not in a position where I can afford therapy and I’m not sure about my university’s mental health services. I’ve heard from one friend that they are awful. I don’t know how to fix myself. I feel like such a loser.

96,nmlnzn,1622161923,is it weird that this guy would not move on even though he rejected me?,"I had a shortlived little ""fling"" with ""Joe"" and he rejected me quite harshly, clearly indicating he regreted it. This self-proclaimed ""azsh0le"" started changing the narrative almost immediately afterwards, to make it look like I pursued him when it had been mutual. One isn't a bad person for rejecting a person, but there is a way to be honest that's not unkind, and I believe he KNEW what he was doing was unkind.

anyways before i even had a chance to process what happened or really react he was chastising me to be ""civil"" to him. but then proceeded to insist we be friends and act like I was rude and unfriendly for trying to avoid him and not act like nothing happened. I feel i was being civil towards him but i was limiting interactions. i was afraid if i had to be around him i'd do or say something i regretted. so i simply tried to get away from him.

one day after a while we spoke on the phone at my request. I thought the conversation was between me and him about what happened, like for me to get ""closure"" or whatever. the next day i unexpectedly run into him in the student lounge. he was with about 4 people I didnt know. to my astonishment, i overhear him telling these strangers about our conversation, repeating some of what we talked about verbatim. (part of me thinks he wanted me to hear) I was mortified. I ended up leaving and relocating somewhere else.

a little while later there was a big get together and he was there with this friend of a friend who i know he had hookedup with, and he kept coming around and showing up next to me. i told him repeatedly to go away. my friend observing this said it looked Joe thought it was ""a game"" and kept coming right back. I was drinking and this was the only time i'd say i was ""uncivil"" towards him. after that Joe started inviting me to get togethers (WTF?). I eventually wrote him an email saying i thought what he did / was doing to me was sh!tty and blocked him altogether and that was sort of the last interaction. i ran into him here and there very briefly.

anyways but that was pretty much it. it's now almost 3 years later and i was with a mutual friend. the mutual friend said that Joe still talks crap about me. in fact that I blocked him and was standoffish was apparently a source of great amusement to Joe

anyways. i actually used to really like Joe until the rejection, but i started to view him as this terrible person. once I got rejected it would be hard for me tobe around him even though he clearly displayed a lot of negative qualities because i'd be constantly thinkingabout how this person had deemed me unattractive or not good enough for him. so much so that he reframed the narrative because he regretted it so much. Being around him made me feel bad about myself. but I feel I was still ""civil"" to him.

and why was he telling everyone about me? this is mortifying. i died when i overheard him sharing our private conversation with strangers. i regretted talking to him at all. if he was telling these stranges all this stuff, clearly he was probably telling our mutual friends and everybody else. our mutual friend recently confirmed that. part of me wishes he would just be nice about it. is he simply a bully? he doesnt find me attractive or else he wouldn't have been so regretful about this. anyways i just dont get it. i thought by now it was in the past.

TL;DR: guy made me feel unwanted, unattractive and he regretted getting involved with me, but then demanded that I be friendly towards him, while he meanwhile talked crap about me to anyone who would listen. He is still doing so apparently 3 years later. what is his problem and why can't he put it in the past?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nmlnzn/is_it_weird_that_this_guy_would_not_move_on_even/
