His defense is only two months away from now. He has been telling me that he is stressed and sometimes sad for no reason. Last Wednesday afternoon,  I sent him something funny and didn't get a reply until Friday night. He told me that he had been feeling miserable and antisocial. And I didn't know how to respond at first so I replied some encouraging cliché on Saturday. He never replied( or even not read the message) ever since Friday night. Now it is Tuesday and he has left me unread for four days. 

I totally understand that he will not prioritize me in his life at this point. However, I do feel that he is not showing respect to me and ignore me on purpose. I mean, he can just tell me straightforwardly  that he is not interested in me anymore or simply give me a short reply during lunch break. 

I do like him, but it is meaningless to wait for two months until he finish everything related to his degree. And I don't think I will get any further reply from him.

He’s also very affectionate, smart and looks after himself (goes to the gym almost everyday, good job etc etc) - ticks my boxes but I don’t wanna be blinded by these things. We have an emotional connection and chemistry for sure.

Dating a 28f I met online last Christmas. We had a great first date and second date separated by 2 weeks. One thing I noticed early on in our interaction is that she would normally respond to my texts the next day and never reaches out to me on her own initiative. She responded to my invitation for date 3 that she was busy for two weeks and had to take a rain check. I waited three weeks and reached back out and she agreed to date 3. Unfortunately it had to wait 4 weeks because I was sick and she had some busy weekends as well. Date 3 was wonderful, we spent all day together and ended up making dinner at my house and kissing and cuddling on the couch. We stopped short of sex. I invited her on date 4 and she seemed very excited but had to check her schedule. 5 days later she accepted the invitation for 2 weeks later. I suggested I spend the night at her house because our date started in the morning. She turned down the overnight offer saying she had a party to attend the night before. We had our 4th date, which included a morning activity and afternoon lunch. We ended up at her house kissing and cuddling on the couch again in the early evening. I asked if I could stay for dinner and she said she had a conflict with family. I tried to make a move for sex and she stopped me short saying she was on her cycle. I mentioned some activities that would be fun in April at some point earlier in the date. When we were on her couch she took some time to show me her calendar and point out that she was busy every weekend in April. At this point we’ve been seeing each other for 3 months. As a man, it feels like it’s my job to reach out with a suggestion for date 5. My plan is to ask her if there is evening in the next week that I can pick her up for dinner. I’m trying to push a simple evening date with an opportunity for sex. I’m thinking to text her after 5 days towards the end of this week.

I am 20M.

***Background/Context:***

So my friend and future roommate, B, is dating this girl, A. B and A are nice and know that I got out of a long relationship about 6 months ago so they wanted to set me up with one of A's friends. The first girl I wasn't interested in, not my type, but the second girl was very pretty and immediately caught my attention. We were both at the bar a few weeks ago but thinking she was out of my league (this girl was a solid 9/10 for me) I was nervous. I told B and A that I tried to dance with her but that I didn't think she saw me - they encouraged me to make a move next time and told me that she said she'd be down for a double date with me. 2 weeks later I did. Same bar, I talked to her several times, talking general stuff and she brought up how our mutual friends were attempting to set us up (being very open), showing a picture the bar photographer took of me, her, and her friend partying that night, from her camera roll. She then stated that she heard that I liked blondes. ""What can I say?"" I replied. I went to get her contact info later on. She had a very up close, leaning against me, arm around my back type of demeanor. Now, I will always prefer # but gave her the option of that or snap. She said I could have her snap if I wanted. After getting it, she immediately stated that she heard I was into her, I said ""I am."" She leaned in and started making out with me. We made out for about 30 seconds until she backed out. I don't blame her, I don't like making out for long in public either and her friends were next to us. I asked her if she was into me right after, she said, ""I could be."" ""What does that mean?"" I asked. ""I could be."" (with a shoulder shrug and optimistic tone). She left afterwards.

Here comes snapchat. I snapchat her the next night (Friday). A face picture saying ""hey whats up?"" She replies about 3h later with a face picture, no text. I respond minutes later with a selfie of me and A at a party. She responds 3ish hours later again at like 4am with a face picture ""no wayyy."" I responded in the morning explaining to her that I bumped into A at a party last night. About 4h later she responds with another face picture. I reply 20-30min later, around 5pm, asking her ""what are you up to tonight"" seeing where it may lead me. That snapchat is not opened until about 11am the next day (Sunday), where she leaves me on 'opened'.

***My Thoughts:***

I want to be honest in saying that I am a very genuine guy. I'm looking for someone to date, not a hookup. I'd love the opportunity to take this girl on a date as she's the first person I've really been interested in since my past (2 year) relationship. Seeing as she seemed to be seeking validation of my interest in her at the bar that night before making her own move and leaning in to kiss me, as well as her agreement to go on a double date, she seems interested. Of course, I could be overthinking, but seeing as I dated from the first month I got into college until this recent breakup, I'm not great at understanding how single girls function and communicate. It's also important to note that I've been notified that this girl has just got out of a 3-4 yr. relationship sometime in the last few months, in which I can entirely understand any hesitance or mixed feelings/signals.

I am ok with taking it slower and seeing where things go. I don't exactly want to snapchat her back after being left on opened to let it possibly happen again. I believe I may wait until this upcoming weekend where I will probably see her again and go from there.",False,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164314,public,self,"Made First Move on Me, But Now Seems Uninterested",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tklbit/made_first_move_on_me_but_now_seems_uninterested/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

Here's the reality. You are not getting dates because you're short, ugly or poor. You're not getting dates because you're boring and don't understand how to excite women. 

First of all, there's literally nothing wrong with women having height preferences. The audacity these men have complaining about women having some kind of physical attribute as preference is laughable. We are men. If anything we are WAY more picky in terms of looks. 

Secondly, being short don't mean shit. Tinder Swindler is fucking 5'9. Ok that's far from being short, but ain't 6 feet either. Yes, women would love to date someone that's 6 feet, but if you are a charmer, many (of course not all) women don't give a shit. Why do you think whenever there's a height post on Reddit, there are literally tons of women claiming they don't care. Because a lot of them don't!

Don't get me started with your career or your car lmao literally have not met a single woman who cared about the car that you drive. And if they do, believe me, you don't want to be with that woman. I once dated this woman. She was a pretty successful entrepreneur. We hit it off and started dating almost immediately. After 2 or 3 weeks of dating she admitted that when we were on our first date, she went on a first date with someone else not too long ago. He was a tall guy, successful investor who drove a Porsche. According to Reddit, this girl will be all over this guy but she wasn't. She even told me how boring it was on their date. On the other hand, she liked me not because of my height (I am 5'6), job (I am a graphics designer) or car (I drive a fucking Hyundai). It's because we have fun when we are together (we like doing similar things on dates and we have same sense of humor).

So why can't you get dates? It's not your fucking height or your fucking job or your fucking car. It's because you are fucking boring. Stop coming on Reddit to complain because you got rejected and then blame your height or blame women because you think they are ""superficial"".

Summary:
She started vomiting but I kept going. She didn’t say stop. But after, while we were in the shower, she started crying.
Me: what’s going on?
Her: I need a minute
Me: *waits a minute* … what are you feeling right now?
Her: pain, exhaustion, sad about Cooper [putting her dog down tomorrow]
Me: what else?
Her: shame *more tears*
Me: I kept going while you weren’t feeling pleasure. And that probably didn’t feel good emotionally
Her: it’s fine, I’ve done it before [referring to the time she was raped by a psycho ex-boyfriend boyfriend]
Me: That’s not okay. *steps out of the shower*
Her: get back in here. You don’t ever do that
Me: babe, I had to take a step away to think. That’s my worst nightmare - to objectify my wife and make her feel like a piece of meat. Did I just rape you?
Her: no you didn’t. That’s a me problem. I didn’t tell you to stop. I know you would have stopped if I wanted to

Background: After, we talked and discussed what happened.

I feel bad. She knows I do. I told her I wanted to avoid certain sexual things because I refuse to hurt my wife or experience pleasure at her expense - a moral code in my ny head I guess.


Tonight I stimulated my wife very well ( “that was the best experience in my life”, she said). Then it was my turn for stimulation. After, she said she felt she needed to return the favor or I would get mad at her or leave her [we’ve been married 2 days and known each other for 1 month {yeah we’re crazy}].

Earlier today, we talked about how she wants me to perform dominant role behaviors, and her perform submissive ones. So, despite my conscience, I rationalized, “This is fulfilling her fantasies.” [side discussiom: Doms don’t have to be jerks, they can be kind, right? I am new to sex (virginity gone 3 weeks ago) so probably don’t understand the balance of being a “powerful tyrant” yet also pleasure-giving]

Anyways… Have any other couples experienced this guilt or feeling bad about pushing your partner too hard sexually? She’s my friend and I don’t want my animal/ instinctual nature to come between us or cause her fear or anything. 

Idk why I’m sharing this, I guess just to see if this is common and what the wife might need from me to gain back any lost trust, love etc… Thanks in advance.

We made up, like talked through everything, and agreed we should tell each other when we’re uncomfortable (because we both have a certain personality type where we want to give and sacrifice ourselves for our partner in everything including sex), and I’m sure she forgives me. But I’m still afraid things will be different. Or that I ruined her Disney princess wanna-be childlikeness/ true love fantasies; or that she felt objectified or forgotten or lonely. I feel like I let my former PMO addiction beast come alive in that moment, and I wish I would have put a 12 gauge shell through that dog’s skull

But then a couple months ago I was like “you know what, I’m just going to set my mind on more important things for now like getting a car, a job, working towards my dream job etc” that way I can iron out my obsession about getting a girlfriend.
And so far it’s worked pretty well.
But even though it has, there are still points in my life where I just really want an attractive girl that I can express myself to, cuddle with, have sex with, and just someone that I can overall love and protect.

But I guess I’ll just have to have patience “sigh”.

So may I ask, is it okay to just really want a girlfriend at times when you just can’t have one??

To be honest, even at this point in time it’s difficult for me to get a girlfriend.
Especially because I don’t really like to talk to strangers 24/7 like a lot of extroverts like to.
To be honest I’m a straight up introvert who loves to isolate himself from everyone and just does his own thing.

There's a lot of reasons I could think of for why. One is just a different look (more crassly put, an ""exotic factor""). Another is a desire to eventually have a child of greater genetic diversity (the less related two partners are, the healthier on average the child will be).

Yet another is a desire to mingle with someone of another culture, another background. I know that I'm of English, German and Scotch-Irish heritage, but I lack much family history, no traditions to draw on. What heritage I can draw on is my American heritage, which is likely checkered and tainted by the same old sins of the country at large. Being with someone of another heritage might bring me closer to another heritage without appropriating it. I want my child(ren) to have more of a history to be able to draw on, something they can be confident in.

The same day I gave her my number we went out for a couple drinks then i went back over to her crib to smoke, I left around 1:30 AM or so. I went back to her crib a couple more times that week and we also went on a couple more dates. 

On our very last date we spent the entire day together and I ended up dropping her off at home that evening. After I got home I sent her a text message saying that I had a great time and that I was attracted to her (which is rare for me because it’s hard for me to be attracted to people) and would love to spend more time with her. The next morning she replied “i definitely would love you spend more time with you too! i do think we should take it slow though, i can get overwhelmed easily and i don’t want that to happen” and to that point I fully understood because I’m big on being intentional but also going with the flow. 

Over the next few days though the communication started to wane and then I got ghosted for two days and at the end of the week she texted me saying “we should just be friends”. Honestly I was taken aback because I thought we were on the same page so I just replied “ok”. A few days later I had texted her to tell her I wasn’t mad just a little hurt and she replied “sorry i really thought i replied to your message i feel like an asshole now. but yeah i really wanted to just lyk how i was feeling so you didn’t think i was leading you on. i’m glad we can be friends though “ and after that i got mad because she said she wasn’t trying to “lead me on” but she’s the one who slid in my DM which left me super confused.

We broke up around 6 months ago, we still talk everyday from that day. We have been intimate physically and through text. Right after the break up, after she dumped me. The very next day she wanted to get back to me. I couldn't say yes to her and didn't get back with her. Because I thought immediately getting back with her would be toxic and impulsive. I wanted to think about it hard and thoroughly and I wanted to take my time on it before I commit again. In my mind I wanted to work on me and my character. In order to get in a relationship with her in the future and to make it successful. In the meantime which was after 2 months of wanting me back. She moved on. After this a month later. I wanted to get into a relationship with her again, and she had moved on. For about 2-3 months I chased and begged her to be in a relationship with me, I took too much effort. To which she didn't find anything convincing. She has gone 600kms away for 3 months for an internship, she said she'll think about a relationship after the 3 month internship, but asked me to keep no hope, Since at the moment she doesn't get the feeling of excitement she got when we first got into a relationship.

 To be honest, I sometimes feel that our conversations last for short stints and most of the time was me initiating new conversations. I've talked to her about it and she told me she's really bad at starting conversations. Moreover, she's a really dry texter (she admitted it herself) and sometimes I really feel disconnected with her during texting and overthink often. I've told her about this and she told me to confide to her when I overthink about such things, but I'm afraid that would just become annoying to her since it happens quite often.

“A” lives in another city, quite far and will only move to mine a month later.
We were getting along quite nice via text for about 2 weeks, but it looked like the conversation lost its spark. I am not sure if I got bored, or he has nothing else to share with me, but clearly something is going on, because it is not the same anymore.

Meanwhile I have met with a friend of a friend of mine, call him “B”, because he was the second. It was only a car ride with the four of us and i did not even find him appealing, cause he made some statements which I couldn’t relate, but clearly he was handsome, but i thought to myself that is not a big deal since he is talking bullshit.
He followed me, texted me, but i was not that interested because of his statements before.
Meanwhile he was asking our mutual friends things like if we would look cute as a couple and why am i not replying to him as much.
So about a week ago he asked me out and i told him, that i am not sure if we would get along (and this time everything was still fine with “A”) and I also told him that i am talking with “A” and i dont want to confuse things, but I have no problem with meeting him in our mutual friend group. He said that it is fair and he is okay with that but he was acting the same with me, like i told nothing to him about “A”. I also heard from our friends that he said he doesnt care about “A”’s presence, because of the distance.

Things got interesting, when we had a house party, my best friend, the mutual friends, “B” and me.
He was hitting on me all night and i tried to be as respectful as possible while dodging him, considering the fact that we are in the same friend group now (it was the second time i saw him). He touched my face, hair everytime he got the chance, invited me to go to the terrace with him while he was smoking (fortunately we ended up always in groups, because the others were following us). But he was extremely thoughtful during the whole night if i am cold, thirsty, anything, he was looking for solutions and thats when I saw the human behind his actions and statements.
Everybody had some drink and we all end up drunk and one point we shared a little kiss.
He would be so good to my anxiety and mental health all in all, but we wouldnt have a proper conversation about books, or life or anything, because I feel like we have an intellectual gap. 
(One time he even told me he doesnt understand my questions, because of the words that I am using.)

So now I feel like shit and the bad guy, despite the fact that I did not promise anything to anyone.
“A” has the mind that I am looking for, but we did not even met and I feel like our convo has become tired and “B” is super nice and easy to get along, but we miss the common intellectual topics.

Since I got confused, I assumed that neither of them could be the right one and I dont want to hurt no one, so what should I do? They all know about each other but we are all in the early stages, not even dating just talking, so was it unfair? 
Did I do something horrible? What would be the most fair thing to do?

I would respond sporadically until last year when she decided to stop pursuing me.

I have since moved further away but recently set up a charity event page which she donated to.  I messaged her along with everyone else who donated to say thanks but she has now started talking to me again, trying it on.

I don't want to offend her, I don't want to ghost her, I am just not that interested and tbh I don't think she would be into me if we actually met up again anyway because she's probably forgotten what I am like in person after 3 years.

We regularly met (27f and 31m) since August about every two weeks/once a week but stay in contact via text. 

While he became a bit distant and behaves strangely in general for a few weeks now, he contacted me 3 times within 2 days. 

He asked something, i answered, all he wrote was ""ah ok"". But then he contacted me again the same evening. And the next morning (yesterday). He asked something and then send a voice message saying ""if i can manage i might be close to you, but i can't tell for sure yet if the workload allows it"". I answered to just give a short heads up so I  can make coffee if it works out. He did not answer at all, not even saying it doesn't work out.

This morning it was me who contacted him. I originally wanted to ask if he is alright as it seems something bothers him and to ask if he wants to go to a hockey game with me. He saw my message but even now 7 hours later hasn't answered.

So why do people ignore messages while dating but it the same time contact you several times?

What should I do? I feel like me pulling back for a few days (he knew I wasn't doing well) to not be a burden might have been wrong and now he thinks i am not interested anymore.

I'm at a total loss these days. I need therapy, probably, but here I am on Reddit instead.

At 17, in my senior year of high school, I formed a great friendship with a girl. Eventually, I asked her to be my girlfriend and somehow, we ""dated"" until I was 21. The reason I put ""dated"" in quotations is because, well, we weren't trying anything out -- we were friends who turned into a romance. 

That relationship ended poorly, during my senior year of college. I went nuts that year. I had a FWB the whole year, yet we were totally exclusive and also amazing friends. This relationship also ended poorly at the hands of COVID taking us out of school early.

Now, two years later -- pretty much the two-year anniversary of the last time I had anything -- I've been coming away empty. I have not gone on a single date. I have not even kissed a woman. I go on Tinder. I go out to bars. I have tons of friends, some of them women. I asked one of them out a month ago and she said she didn't want to lose her ""best friend.""

Tonight, my roommate is going on a date with someone I was interested in. I left to get pizza at the bar Saturday night and by the time I came back he had swooped in. Power to him, I guess.

He hasn't dated either until very recently. And now I'm getting jealous and sad. I just simply do not know how to do it.

I can make friends perfectly fine. Everyone likes me! For real! But I don't know how to advance anything. I don't know how to determine who is a good person to date. I've had two weird, off-putting relationships in my life and I'm 2 years into adulthood with not a clue in the world. I feel like I'm 16 again. I hate the idea of dating. I instead prefer the classic, wimpy way -- make a good friend, turn it into something else.

But I am tired of waiting. If I could ask y'all anything, I guess it's this: what's the best, easiest way to get into the dating mindset after years of never having done it? The annoying thing is, I have plenty of experience (romantically, sexually, dealing with conflicts, communication, etc.) but I haven't been able to show it. 

Note: I do not feel at all that I deserve someone. I'm a mess, ha! But I just would love to experience even a two-week fling, or even just take a girl to dinner for goodness sakes.

Yesterday afternoon, we were at my place playing drunk chess. After one game, she asked if we could have a serious conversation, where she explained to me that I'm competing with another man in her hometown, nearly 1,000 miles away. She said they started talking around the same time her and I did, and she's not sure who to choose.

I just told her that I understand, and to let me know what she decides to do within a reasonable amount of time, at her discretion though, as I don't want to pressure her in any way.

She was a coworker where I used to work.  Since my job wasn't my final career and was really just a way to get through college, I didn't see a problem with dating her even though I knew it would (probably) lead to me needing to find a new job.

She asked me to come over to her apartment around Feb 11th, and I was so shocked I kind of just stuttered a little, but a week later I took her up on her offer.  We hung out at her apartment for a total of...11 or 12 hours and talked, she showed her artwork and stuff, and eventually, we had sex probably about 8 or 9 hours into the date/hangout.  She said whether I stayed the night after sex was up to me (which seemed a little odd at the time, but I thought she was just trying not to be pushy) but I slept next to her and cuddled and everything the whole night.

Then, she didn't really text me for a few days, and I figured she was ghosting me, so I asked her about it and she said basically she was ghosting because she didn't want a relationship and the sex wasn't great (she recently told me that wasn't actually true, but we'll get to that later.)

A few weeks after, my old job told me she was fired, and they asked me to come back, so I did.  But it turned out she was still working there.  At first, it wasn't a big deal because when we were alone she got very flirty.  When I asked her--basically--""what the fuck?"", she said ""what, did you really think it would be that easy?""

I like this girl a lot, so I was perfectly willing to give her a second chance.  Then, later, I asked her to go out to this place we had been talking about, and she said no.

Now that's all fine, but at this point, I kind of got the feeling she was playing with my emotions, so I transferred to a different location of my same company until I could find a better job.

Then later that day, she saw me outside my apartment (she and I live like a one-minute walk from each other) and asked me to go for a walk and talk.  I honestly wanted to say ""fuck off,"" but I was curious.  So we walked.

She said she would have said yes to going out with me earlier, but she was at work where she tries to be a different person.  She also said she didn't really have a problem with the sex except for the fact that she was sober so it was only so-so, but the big thing is she said she doesn't text back very often.  Even if she's dating someone, she'll go a long time without texting them or seeing them.

Basically, she said she was saying she really liked me, and ""yes"" to our date, but also that she won't be in contact much because she just doesn't talk to people.

Is it healthy to give this a shot?  It's a little hard liking her and going days without talking to her, but also that's who she is and I want to be able to accommodate the things that make her a little different.  Part of why I like her is her odd tendencies, so I feel like if I accept some of them I should have to accept all of them.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164334,public,nsfw,"I [M24] thought I was ghosted, now a month later she [F23] and I want to give it another shot, with a catch.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tkwni4/i_m24_thought_i_was_ghosted_now_a_month_later_she/,no_ads,0.0,,,,
