People flex their accomplishments way too much. It shows they have an integral lack of understanding of interpersonal relationships and attraction. Credit scores, careers, cars, educational achievements, homeownership, etc are not going to attract the right person to you.

Instead of flexing degrees, homes, careers and money, more people should ask themselves these questions: **Are you interesting? Are you fun to be around and talk to? Do you give off positive energy? Are you likable? Do people want to be around you? Do you make people feel comfortable? Do you have sex appeal?

So I (17f) was texting my boyfriend (17m) on messages and left him opened on snapchat. I didn’t realize i left him on opened, even after i went back on there because I kinda just look for the ones with the colors? Like i’m not a huge believer of snapchat, i don’t care about opened or delivered. Well, he got super pissed and asked me why i left him on open and responded to someone else. I just don’t pay attention? 
During all of this i was with my best friend swimming in the pool and then it started to storm so we both rushed to hop in the shower. After that i had to pack to go home.
Like he knows i have a short attention span and if i didn’t see the color by his name then i assumed he hadn’t responded. I didn’t even realize i left him on open. So he texted me on messages and asked me why i left him on opened. I told him i must’ve forgot to snap back and didn’t realize. He got super pissy and asked me how i forget to snap back my boyfriend. I told him i didn’t realize and must’ve forgot. He told me to not “just lie and say you forgot”. I got super upset and called him and asked him why would he accuse me of lying to him. He went on to say that he just doesn’t get how i “forgot” and that it doesn’t make any sense. 

He accused me of ignoring him and leaving him on open on purpose, (even if i texted him the whole time on messages) and kept insisting i did it on purpose. I asked him why would i even do that and he just kept going on about how he doesn’t know and that’s why he’s asking me.

Keep in mind he’s with like four of his best friends who all they do is complain about their gfs (which btw he’s ONLY like this when he talks to them) and I asked him why he always got riled up when he’s with them. I told him that sometimes it just happens.

Basically a lot of repeated things happened bc he couldn’t let it go and then he finally told me that he realized how crazy he was being and that he was sorry. And said he was worked up and has trust issues. I told him “good for you” because I mean, what can i say to that?

“Oh that’s okay you can treat me horrible and like i always lie to you bc you have trust issues?”
I have them too and i can tell y’all i’ve never accused him of this stuff. 

I just don’t know what to do because i’m heartbroken and he treated me like shit. I haven’t stopped crying for around five hours and i feel like i’m going to throw up. He’s down this before but not for awhile. 

What should i do? Am i overreacting? I feel absolutely heartbroken bc he didn’t listen to me and accused me of lying to him.

And then suddenly out of the blue things changed. She got kind of cold and distant for a couple days. I internally panicked a little, trying to figure out what was going wrong. And then she left. Ended it with one text message. 

I was hung up on her for a while after that. Then I got over it and just figured I'd never hear from her again.

But recently she got back in touch. She apologized and explained she has realized she has emotional problems around feeling close to people. We caught up a little. 

It was actually good. If she had reached out, say, a six weeks after leaving, it might have brought back my feelings for her and been unpleasant. But now, with this distance from it, it's just nice to get a little clarity around it, and to be able to mentally classify the experience a little more positively.

I tried online  like bumble and tinder but I rarely got swipes and when I did then I usually lost them because I'm not good at chatting up or looking for casual sex and I have poor social skills due to being autistic.

Is it possible to move on too fast? Do I need more time to recover from the last guy? 

I had a friend from college I knew for years who liked me. I didn't at first but the more we talked, the more I feel for him. For a year, we texted and called each other often since I was living outside the US. Then this year, I moved back, to the same state as him and started seeing each other in person. 

He'd say ""I love you"" ""I've always cared for you"" ""you're a great partner"" and so on. We weren't in a committed relationship. He stopped texting me for a month and decided to reach out to a mural friend of ours. They know him longer and said that he's manipulative, cheated on all his exs and that I dodged a bullet. That he's been talking with her and telling her stuff (even though she doesn't like him and had a bf) and trying to get with someone else. 

We talked on the phone and he just apologized for not texted back and for the miscommunication. Because of some family issues, he didn't was to go further into he conversation. I understand that we weren't in a relationship but I felt really hurt since this was someone I trusted and knew for years. 

I know it's long and I left out some details to save time. This all happened over a week ago. He said he would check in with me but we haven't spoken since.
However, I feel like meeting new people. I'm not mad nor crying anymore. Not necessarily dating seriously, but something more casual.

I've never  been in a long relationship with anyone. There were 2 times with 2  different girls that I always felt were the right match but I just  couldn't commit (for things like being scared of the big change, sharing  and being so related with someone, not because of ""wanting to be  single"") and chickened out. I recently have been thinking about this  girls, and to be honest I've been here before but now I feel I'm  thinking about them in a more serious way rather than ""a moment of  weakness"",  the problem is I am not sure weather I'm actually just a bit  lonely and if I do reconnect with them I will only bother them again.  What do you think are the chances they even want to know anything about  me, miss me, or hate me? They have a special place in my heart because  like I said I've never been in a serious relationship but felt like they  could really be one if it wasn't for my own fault. I honestly want to  reconnect with them even if we don't date again.  This are the girls:

First(5 years ago):

This  was a long time ago and I am really ashamed of how I handled it, for  the first time I felt I met someone like me(we were so alike) and who I  really liked and then started feeling weird about being in a  relationship and in that confusion I sort of distanced myself until we  started not talking so I never broke things of, and one time I met her  like a year after this and kind of played it dumb. She later texted me  why I did that and I answered ""I didn't know if you'd want"", she  replayed it's okay, next time I'll say hi to you. There was also an  incident of me getting a missed called from her at like 3am after we  broke up and not doing anything about it.

Second(2 years ago):

This  time the same thing happened even though I promised myself not to, I  met someone who maybe is not too similar to me, but we had a great vibe.  But eventually I spaced out, however this time I handled it properly  and made my decision and told her she is amazing but I am not in the  right head space to date someone, she said she also had a great time  with me and cared about me, but understood and thanked me for not  ghosting her.

Writing this I know  is a bit questionable to be talking about two girls, like I should maybe  pick who is the one I should contact. But like I said, I like this two  girls and I would love to reconnect with them even if we just chat for a  while, become friends or start dating again. I am here posting because I  want to make sure what I want to do is right. Do you think they would  want me to reconnect with them? Do you think I could be in a similar  place in their hearts? should I try to date with any of them if I am not  actually sure I won't do the same thing again(aka chicken out after a  while) I feel I am in a better spot in that regard now, but I have no  way of telling.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,802362,public,self,Should I(25) reconnect with one of my exes?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nncnhy/should_i25_reconnect_with_one_of_my_exes/,all_ads,6,dating,,,

However, she is a little more…coy about her feelings towards me? Not to say she doesn’t have those feelings towards me, more the way she expresses them involve sarcasm or humour. 

The end result is I kind of feel dumb that she has “power” over me, while I don’t seem to have that on her. This is pronounced in the bedroom: I like mentioning how hot she is, but this often turns into her getting off on having control while also denying that I have any on her.

I'm interested in mostly male perspective on this, but open to women's opinions too. I'm a female in my 20s.

I started seeing this guy after knowing him for about a year and a half. We both work in the same field and had met a few times. He always had made in clear he was interested in me, (I was open, but kinda unsure how i felt – as I usually am). We were both busy at the time and it took a while before we ever really started dating. 

He planned great dates, is smart and successful, tall, cute etc. We started seeing each other and it started out really great. And I started to like him a lot. and then at some point a few months later something got a little weird. Unsure exactly what happened. But I started to feel like he was pulling away or not trying as hard (I don't know if this was real or imagined tbh). Being young and immature at the time, my reaction to this was to do the same/ try and make him jealous (i know dumb).  I should have just said something. He started giving me the fade, and so I tried to confront him (via text) and talk to him about it and  he mentioned my behavior had bothered him (it was more of a fight than that, but in summary). So I had asked him to a drink and tried to apologize and told him I had feelings for him. It went fine, but two days later I got ghosted. He didn't ignore my texts, but he didn't respond to my last text and I wasn't about to try anymore after telling him I had feeling for him. I found out a month later he was seeing someone new (a person I know).

I learned a lot from this situation. It was also heartbreaking. I still don't know if I was being gas lit or what. In my mind he was dead to me. **I moved on completely.** 

About 8 months later, I see him at my work holiday party. I was kind of triggered and avoided him. He had tried to come say hi and just walked past him. I was honestly confused why he would come talk to me? 

Then a week later, I'm at a different holiday party and he is there again (I know weird coincidence but we work in the same field). I again avoid him. It's large enough that I easily can. I am at the bar talking to another guy and I notice him straight staring at me. Almost in a way that is socially awkward. I again avoid him...... pretend I don't see him.

Later in the night, he tried to come up to me again. I literally dodge him this time.  He comes up to me and asks me how I am – and I just say I'm good and walk away.

I text him a few days later and let him know why I acted that way and how much he had hurt me. He says that he is sorry and had no idea and he just thought we ""fizzled out.""

So this girl I’m talking to (20F) approached me (23M.) back in February and I said we should hangout we exchanged numbers and I kinda felt like she was playing so I ghosted her. Fast forward to April she msg me on IG and we’ve been talking ever since. Hell we fall asleep on FaceTime most nights. 
Talk quite a bit on the phone through out the day. 

We’ve both talked that we want more out of this and that’s the plan to work towards but want to take it slow. We’ve both had pretty bad relationships, her more so. 

We really click, have the same sense of humor. Conversations just flow too easily it’s great. Haven’t met a girl that I click w so well. 

When she told me about her ex and how they are still really good friends. I didn’t freak out, hell I didn’t really care bc we weren’t exclusive. I mean we’re still not to be clear. But seems like it lmao. 

her Ex (of one year.) she’s made it clear that they are just friends and she feels bad bc he literally has no one else (male or female.) her older sister and the ex are friends and always guilt her in to hanging out with them. She said she hates being alone with him but they got breakfast last Sunday. She tells me what they talk about and what not. Im thinking they’re stil friends bc of the emotional support they provided each other but didn’t work out. 

But is this something to worry about? Personally my view is if someone is going to cheat they’re going to do it regardless. And my life journey so far I’ve learned it’s not hard to leave people in the past (for me personally.) so part of me wants to trust her and carry on and the other part of me wants to say fuck it and move on. I was perfectly fine and happy before she came along. So it’s contradicting because idk if it’s a sign from up above that this is meant to be or it’s another Lesson. 

Personally, I’m trying to trust again and push through past experiences and insecurities. So I don’t fuck up something that could’ve been. But idk it’s just odd to me. Anybody have experience with this?

TL:DR- girl and I both agree we want to move forward together, but she’s stil best friends with her ex for reasons and idk if my insecurities are playing a role or just to trust her and find out.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,802395,public,self,Her “best friend” is her ex?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnd20y/her_best_friend_is_her_ex/,all_ads,6,dating,,,

Dating someone who isn't over their ex is like taking on someone else's credit card debt. You enter a relationship with someone who is still ""paying off"" a significant amount of energy and pain and you both aren't starting fresh from a zero balance. It's a very miserable start. For the partner, it feels like a massive burden to have to listen to the negative stories and comparisons and light comments about someone they don't even know. Even if those comments are meant to paint the current partner in a better light AKA ""you do xyz, my ex never wanted to do that"".

We all have history, we all mention our past partners a few times... but mentioning it constantly and linking it to everything you do or talk about will absolutely kill the potential. When you start a new relationship it should be a fresh start, and it's up to you to make sure your view on this new relationship isn't clouded by feelings from the past. Sure, you might never go back to your ex, or they might make you angry every time you think about them... but that's still mental and emotional energy being expended in areas that could otherwise be spent more productively. Your partner will feel this vacancy, and they will grow distant and disappointed the more it occurs.

Make sure you are wholehearted before bringing someone new into your life. Otherwise, you will actively contribute to the vicious cycle of emotional unavailability by making someone else feel as unhappy and unworthy as you had once felt with your last partner.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,802400,public,self,"Please STOP using friends (that you know like you) as emotional buffers for your previous relationship, it only gives them hope, and it's not fair.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnd666/please_stop_using_friends_that_you_know_like_you/,all_ads,6,dating,,,

We’re really getting to know each other as friends first (something I prefer when it comes to a potential relationship) so the physical intimacy isn’t there but the intellectual connection is. He’s pretty much my ideal guy and while I was the one more interested in him initially, it seems like the roles are reversed now. He’s been hinting at his feelings for me recently, but I know we’re taking it slow which is something I always envisioned myself doing in a relationship anyway. 

Enter three weeks ago, I reunited with an old friend of mine, Guy B. Things are moving quicker with him in terms of seeing each other more often and being physically touchy. Unlike Guy A where our relationship is more linear (i.e. getting to know each other as friends with knowledge we’re both interested then going out on official dates), Guy B and I are doing both stages at the same time. We’re learning about each other as we become increasingly physically open to each other. Though I prefer a more linear relationship, I’m learning to go with the flow and be spontaneous. 

I’m not emotionally there for either of them yet - hence why I’m single - and I’m sure neither of them are ready for a relationship either. To be clear, I’m emotionally available, but I don’t fall for people easily.

Why was I the abuser?

I started dating Bo when I was 20 he was 29. I always thought we connected well we both had a dark sense of humor and love for film. He worked a decent job but over his life had bouts of depression where he has significant gaps in his resume. He didn't finish university because even though he went to a phenomenal university, he said the classes didn’t interest or challenge him enough. I



I work and go to school part-time at a university in the Los Angeles area. About six months into our relationship, he quit his job because he said they were not letting him progress. He had to move home to Denver in with his parents because he couldn't afford rent. I was devastated and hurt because I tried to talk to him about options for a new job, but he was stubborn and refused. I bring up how much it hurt he left he says he doesn't feel bad he did nothing wrong




He has been home for a year and a half not working because he says his depression is so severe. When he moved back, he tried to talk to me about suicide. I said I'm not a professional I love you, but you need to speak to a doctor I can't handle that. He brings up consistently how I abounded him in his time of need. He had gone to a residential treatment place before but left because he thought they were ripping him off and that their advice was terrible. I stopped dating him officially after he moved but still talked to him.




He would say that I'm a liar. He would always try to catch me in lies like ask me aggressively if I've taken my sleeping meds (I'm proscribed this) I feel awkward to put on the spot so I say no then he goes and counts my pills. If I send him a photo, he's checked the metadata to see if I'm lying and if I don't say the exact date he calls me a liar.


He says I lie more than anyone he knows. He brings up the time I drank some of my roommate's juice or smoked one of her cigs and said I didn't. We will be texting every day frequently. He’ll ignore me for days saying he can't talk because of the depression I get upset and try to text him.



He says I'm entitled and I'm not allowed to someone's attention that I need to learn boundaries. He would bring up regularly how he misses perks from his old job. If I ever criticized him or lost my temper with him he would say I’m the meanest person he’s ever met. When I bring up the mean stuff he’s said about me he says “everything I say about you is objective fact with evidence behind it everything you say is a petty insult”



I would say to him he quit that job for no reason he could quickly get it back or live with that choice. He says I'm mean because I never let him vent. He always tells me my memory is terrible and reminds me about lies in the past. When I try to bring up something from the past, he says,” I trust my memory MORE THAN YOURS.” When I lost my temper he’s sent screenshots of the texts to mutual friends making me look bad. I would never send private texts to a mutual friend.



His plans are nothing at this point he says he's just there that he isn't going to kill himself but too depressed to work. I stopped talking to him because of other reasons, but I can't stop shaking the feeling. Do I come off as a liar? Do I sound like a bad liar? I have bad anxiety and feel not open; sometimes, I go to therapy twice a week.

Do you think they would become salty that you ignored the, or think you're not interested?

I personally don't like getting to know someone and get heavily involved without being able to be with them physically. It's not very romantic to me. And things could feel totally different than when you're with them physically if you guys ever do meet and see how they're really like in person. I honestly think long distance relationships are really cringey. It just seems a bit childish to be head over heels in love with someone you never met or spent a good amount of time with. I'm 25 now and don't want to wait 2 years to be with someone. Plus face time dates are lame. And we all know long distance relationships rarely work out anyway. 

It got me thinking about whether or not it's true that timing matters? Some people say if someone is really interested in you distance wouldn't matter and they would still pursue you? do you believe this too?

Just adding another rant. Rejection is obviously something everyone experiences at least once in their lives unless they avoid relationships or hit the jackpot and marry their first love interest. Doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you if someone turns you down; you just aren't compatible. He/she doesn't like you back? At least you shot your shot and can move on. 

But say someone is actually into you, or at least they appear to be. You tell them your intentions and they say they want to get to know you better and see where things go. Not exactly a rejection, right? So you continue to talk and develop a deeper connection until they one day disappear. Usually it's because they're afraid of commitment or found someone they liked better. But at this point you were already forming a relationship of some sort with that person for months only to find out you were on entirely different pages. Even if you saw it coming, it still hurts like hell. It feels like a breakup even if you weren't official.

So what do you do then? Move on, obviously. But unfortunately for people like me (8 months and going wtf), moving on isn't that easy. Rejections like these are closer aligned to being broken up with in a way. It's not the same as asking someone out and them telling you ""No thanks."" People like them are ex-somethings, ex-almosts, ex-maybes. And while it never would have worked out, it's hard to get over the blatant disrespect and realization that you were played.

okay so this guy, (M 21), and i (F 21) have been talking for a while, since about mid-March. we matched on tinder and were basically talking here and there on snapchat and texting. he was really nice and respectful and i had to make the first moves and finally we move to texting and facetiming every night enjoying each other's conversation and HEAVILY flirting with each other. it was really nice and i even expressed my trust issues from men in the past and he was always to reassure me he didnt want to just fuck me but he wanted to take me out and do cute things and dates and what not. he lives three hours away, because we matched when he was visiting friends in my college town, but hes only about 45 minutes from my hometown which i'm going to be in the summer and we'll definitely be able to hang out. past few times i went home it was kinda rushed and didnt have time to meet up with him, so this past monday he decided to drive up for me. i was kinda nervous bc we hadnt met in person before but i knew it was gonna be fine bc we had been talking for two months and i thought it was gonna be a good time!! anyway, he drives up and its raining so hard we cant really go out and do anything so we stay home and just basically cuddle and do other things and watch movies the entire time hes here and he left the next afternoon. at some point when we were together, i told him i felt vulnerable because i had never been that close for that long with someone like that including showering and just romantically sharing my space with someone over 24 hours and he said he was too and idk we connected and had good conversation and nothing felt weird after we had sex either. everything felt pretty good and natural. but now hes at home and the first day back he was asleep and tired and granted thats fine because i was too but day by day hes been drier and drier with his conversations and when it was flowing and i would try to flirt he would avoid it and when i asked why he was avoiding me flirting he said he was ""so high"" and then declined my ft call too. which i dont understand bc i was just trying to have conversation like we were having before he came up to visit me. now i think he's definitely avoiding me (and dont say hes busy bc even when he was busy and going thru stuff before he would let me know or always get back to me) because he hasnt watched anything ive posted on my story left my snaps on open and even has my text left on delivered. and i had asked him if i did something wrong? i feel it in my gut something is wrong and its just like if he didnt get what he expected he should tell me but i think hes not going to and then fish me along to have sex again or something. i'm not being crazy right because i feel like its completely valid to wonder where his energy has gone? is there anything i should say or do to make him come back or or should i just see how he reacts these next few days and if he decides to reply to my message and then confront him for using me for sex?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,802843,public,self,IDK what this guy (21) wants after he told me one thing and acting another,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nni0qf/idk_what_this_guy_21_wants_after_he_told_me_one/,all_ads,6,dating,,,

Thought to bring these feelings to Reddit to see if there's further general consensus on this, or if I really am a huge outlier for feeling this way.

Whenever I'm looking at someone's online profile, whether it's Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge, I've noticed a few specific qualities in people related to dogs:

\- Profile pictures with their dog. Often the first photo!  
\- Prompts, or bios, that specifically state their dog as their main priority. Statements such as ""must love dogs,"" ""my dog is my best friend,"" or my personal favourite, ""will love your dog more than you.""

Now I really don't know where exactly to start with all this. I feel like I'm a huge outlier in feeling this way, but please I would like to address the following:

\- If your main profile picture is you with your dog, this gives off the impression to me that you don't have any personality outside of your dog.  
\- In a statement that's more based on an all-encompassing personality judgement - if your dog is such a main portion of your profile, and if this is what one bases their whole personality on, are we somewhat doomed as a society in knowing that this is actually somewhat of the norm?

Don't get me wrong here - I know I probably come across as someone who doesn't like dogs. This is not the case!! Dogs are adorable, and teach tons of life lessons in regards to responsibility and empathy. However, we are human beings, and our first priority should be ensuring we are able to connect with others on a meaningful level. The amount of people who base their entire social lives on their dogs is extremely disturbing to me, and which is why I always ask the question about dogs, and if the person's lives revolves around their dogs, during the first conversation (not even the first date)! I cannot be bothered with someone who's entire existence revolves around their dog(s).

And I'm sure it could have gone one way, but I just felt weird with someone who definitely couldn't drive and probably couldn't consent. So I just put on Netflix and sat down and watched it and kept my distance and it was awkward and then she's like, ""I'm going to go back to my place"" and it was just down the hall so I knew she could make it there safely so I just said sure.

Sorry about that.

This happened recently. Some friends and I went to a cottage. We had plenty of drinks. There were other people too, a hot tub and a sauna. I found one girl there particularly attractive. I asked her if she was single. She said yes. I asked her if she wants to go on a date with me. She said no because she is not looking for anything at the moment but she might change her mind at some point. I was fine with that. 

However I obviously kept my eye on her. I saw her talking with another guy and it seemed like they are together. They were really close and she wrapped her arms around his neck. 

Either she is a player or just a plain liar. I am perfectly fine with it if I am rejected. But I have been lied to in the past, especially regarding dating and relationships.

I wanted to make this post to bring a different perspective into light as I find this argument flawed for several reasons;

**Not all are only swiping on hot guys.** 

* I myself have had crap luck whether I talked to/went out with a guy I thought was very attractive or a guy I thought was average or less than attractive. When I was using OLD I was looking for a real, genuine connection and possible relationship but many of the guys on there only were looking to hookup, have something casual, or fwb. The level of attractiveness of the guy did not matter. Guys who were conventionally attractive were this way and so were guys who were not conventionally attractive. I have gone out with guys who were 5’6-5’9, skinny and not super fit, average looking, and “nerdy.” I attend an engineering college so many of the guys at my school fall into this category. And many of them also were only after sex. It’s not only tall, fit, hot guys on these apps looking for hookups it’s definitely also ugly/average guys as well. 
* Maybe many women are being extremely picky with looks and only swiping on hot guys but this is not all women so please do not assume it is and assume that’s why a girl has been failing in OLD.

**Even for the ones who are being physically selective, if roles were reversed wouldn’t you do the same? So why get mad and blame them?**  

* I understand the power dynamic with dating apps is skewed immensely, esp in the early stages. Women and attractive guys do get more matches than most average men which leads to more options. It may be unfair but that is just how our society is in general. So if roles were reversed and say you are a very hot guy or a girl, would you not choose to message the matches you found the most attractive first? Hate to say it but OLD is extremely shallow because it is primarily based on looks. You swipe on someone you find attractive and hope they find you attractive and you go from there. So if you had 100+ matches why would you message the girl you are least attracted to? So why blame women and get mad at them for not doing that? I myself have swiped on guys I found less attractive eventually because at one point I did think maybe that was my problem but it still ended in the same result. Yes there are women who are very selective physically, but there are also men this way and if roles were reversed and you are the hot guy with 50+ matches or the girl with 100+ wouldn’t your first messages go out to those you find most attractive and desirable?  Even if you aren’t being selective in swiping, and you get a ton of matches because you are a hot guy or a girl, How is it possible to message and talk to all 50-100+ matches? Guys complain we aren’t giving the “right guys” a chance when maybe there are only 10 “right/good” guys out of the 100 matches. 

**There are several problems with people's failures with OLD and attractiveness level is only one.**

* Attractiveness is a huge problem but it is by far not the only reason both men and women have problems and bad experiences with OLD.  A lot of men seem to jump at the reason women have bad experiences is because they are choosing only the hottest of guys and those guys are bad people and it's her fault for choosing a fuckboy in the first place. This is not the only reason women or anyone has a shitty experience with OLD so please stop using that as the only reason. 

Many people, no matter their level of attractiveness, are only looking for hookups, so finding someone genuine and who is not is hard. Also a lot of people there are unsure of what they want to begin with. You end up matching and clicking with people who want different things from you very often even if it seems the same in the beginning. Another thing, it seems a lot of people use OLD when they are not emotionally available, are fresh out of a relationship, or too busy in school/their career. This leads to a string of problems such as ghosting, leading on, pump/dumps, or getting back with exes and hurting the people they met. Lastly, OLD has also just made the culture of hooking up even more strong and appealing to both genders so it’s hard for those who aren’t into that to find something genuine.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,803103,public,self,"""You're failing in OLD because you are only swiping on hot guys...""",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nnl6lb/youre_failing_in_old_because_you_are_only_swiping/,all_ads,6,dating,,,
