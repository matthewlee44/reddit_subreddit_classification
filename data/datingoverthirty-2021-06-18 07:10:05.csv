3,o2phah,1624024039,How long to form a connection?,"I’m somewhat new to this sub and have noticed a trend that I want more opinions on. I know online dating is hard and annoying. Early on, I figured out not to chat a lot before meeting and to temper my expectations. I did not date during covid, so I didn’t have to navigate that difference. I’ve noticed people seem to get really upset over being “dumped” or “rejected” after a date, after a few dates, or even after just talking virtually. It seems that the rejection is internalized somewhat as something was not good enough in them and that the other person was a selfish ass.

Am I an outlier in that I don’t have much attachment at all before the three month+ mark of exclusively dating WITH labels? I am very stoic early on and don’t internalize another person not choosing me for a second date. I also don’t think I’m a selfish ass when I don’t follow up with people I haven’t met or only met once (though a couple guys have tried to call me names like “flakey” when I didn’t reconnect). Some had to be blocked. In reality, it’s not that I thought these people were “not good enough”, they just weren’t it for me, and sometimes there’s a disconnect where they thought I was it for them. Maybe being on both sides of this coin makes me not see things so emotionally early on. Am I too being cold? Is this unusual?

22,o2z8z5,1624047455,"Advice on dating a Divorced 42M (with kids part time) as a 34F single, never married, no kids","I read through some old posts and gained a little bit of insight. Things I hadn’t even thought of. Was hoping anyone with experience can give some more input.
Here’s the major points
1. He’s 42, was married for 17 years, and has been divorced for the last 5 years

2. She cheated on him (he caught her in the end but he thinks she did through the whole marriage). But they are kosher now, he doesn’t seem spiteful

3. Has 3 kids (they live primarily with mom): 20f, 17m and 13f (she seems to be the one he spends the most time with since she’s younger)

4. We met at the dog park in my complex. I’ve known him for at least 5-6 months after he started bringing his puppy. So we live in the same apartment community which serves to be an interesting dynamic

5. We hit it off a few weeks ago (Memorial Day) and strikingly found we are VERY similar. Quiet around certain people but secretly have big personalities and are hilarious. I genuinely laugh so hard when ever we are in each other’s company. There’s a big comfort factor with him (he’s seen me look homeless at the dog park for months)

6. He also owns his own company (limos) so after a year of no work, things are exploding for him. He’s understandably really busy. I’m struggling with this the most

7. He seems to be the monogamous type (I joked about him going apeshit after his divorced and being newly single and he said that’s not his style). I definitely get vibes that he’s interested

8. As for me, 34f single. Never married. No kids. I like kids, just kind of gave up on worrying about the bio clock ticking. Been single for the last 2 years aside from two short 1-month dating things. Was in a terrible relationship for 3 years prior to that. Hence why I stayed single for a while. Have my apartment to myself with my two dogs. I’m a nurse so financially I’m doing ok on my own. Never seriously dated anyone with kids (or ever met anyone’s kids). Don’t think I have any issues with that.

Anyways, I’ll take any wisdom/advice/learning points",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o2z8z5/advice_on_dating_a_divorced_42m_with_kids_part/

26,o30tj5,1624052030,Is social media the answer?,"Background- me m38 divorced a couple years ago. Took some time to clear my head. Started the dating scene earlier this year. Using bumble hasn’t really been good. Match has lead to 8 dates with 4 different gals. Haven’t found what I’m looking for yet. 

The progress I’ve had so far seems to be slowing down. Despite how frustrating OLD can be I keep a positive outlook  and remain optimistic as finding a serious relationship is very important to me. Gotta keep myself out there cause it’s not gonna fall into my lap. 

So…. 
I’ve never been on any social media ever, and I really don’t want to be. I’m pretty reserved/ keep to myself and focus my time on my kids, work and keeping my ducks in a row.  I’m entertaining the idea for the sole purpose of it leading to more dating prospects. 

When i was married my ex was/is on it and she’d get hit up by old high school aquatinteces or randos all the time and was constantly annoyed by it. So I have this idea in my head that getting on there and hitting up past aquatinteces will only look trashy on my part. (But I’m defiantly not the harass/fake nice guy type). 

About a year ago I ran into an old friend from grade school. We hit it off very well and it was awesome. But she was/is just out of a LTR and needs to figure things out. So I really like the idea of using it to maybe make a re-connection. 

Also is it possible to use the likes of Facebook to get involved in some activities like volleyball, softball, rock climbing, hiking and such? 

Am I best off just staying away from social media? It seems like no one has anything good to say about it and it only causes depression. 

Is the Facebook dating thing any good? 

Side question. I’ve stayed away from tinder as I’ve heard bad things about that as well. Lots of bots, fake profiles, scams, trashy folks etc. is that an avenue worth going down?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o30tj5/is_social_media_the_answer/
27,o30uvr,1624052142,What does it mean when women say they need someone who can assert themselves?,"Or rather, there's a phrase in my language which I see mentioned very often in dating profiles, and it's kind of hard to translate, but basically means that they are looking for someone who can ""put me in my place when I need it"". ???

Truly, I instantly disqualify myself when I see that mentioned, and it actually makes me very insecure about myself. Despite being dominant and assertive in the bedroom, I need equality and open communication in a relationship, I need respect, trust and safeness. How does *putting someone in their place* possibly fit into that? That's awful... right? It makes me envision being in charge of her, not listening to what she has to say, and dismissing her as an individual. Is that really what's desired? I don't understand.

(N.b.: I mention how I am in the bedroom, because I feel I need to defend and clarify that I'm not a pushover or a wuss, or... less of a man. I don't know.

I now really hate the feeling of grabbing coffee with someone, finding them cute/funny/hot, then trying to hide my disappointment when they eventually bring up their girlfriends. I feel so lame but those are my feelings. I was excited about starting the program because I also anticipated good dating opps. 

And then I look at the single ones and they’re either unattractive (to me) or have pretty dysfunctional personalities that I could never date. The ones that are super partner-material are…you guessed it taken. 

I’ve never subscribed to the idea that the dating pool is any worse than in our 20s. I always told myself that good people are always available at any age.

I was a little confused, he asked me out a week ago, so I thought he had something in mind and now our date is tomorrow. 

Is that normal?  Was I supposed to be brainstorming this whole time?  Maybe I'm not ready to get back out there, because I had no clue at all.

He was naturally more submissive and I was naturally more dominant. Our energies worked well together for the most part. However there was one issue, he was very insecure. At first i  was trying to make him feel better but after I got really busy at work and just thought, maybe I could not make him happy and I broke up with him. He kept wanting to be friends but i said no mainly because in the past this just make the break up process slower. 

It’s now a few years later and I was just thinking that he understood me in many levels, certainly a lot more than the single men that I’ve been chatting with. 

He could be married already but potentially he could be single. I had blocked him because he would not stop calling (which freaked me out at the time) but what I realized is there was probably some self inflected pain on both side.

72,o3efad,1624103928,What are some your worst OLD experiences? I have only used Bumble so I have a few bad experiences on there. (and I don’t mean flat out ghosting) it’s story time!,"So I own a restaurant and I never put the name in my OLD profile. However, when I get a match, the job convo always comes up and I’ll politely tell them I won’t say the name of the restaurant till I get to know them better. 
This is because I’ve had a bad experience a few years ago, and have learned not to share my business too quickly now. 
So years ago, I was more young and naive and told a match right off the bat (first time using OLD). We had a long conversation the night we matched and it was a good one, like we clicked. So I felt good after leaving our first conversation. A day went by and I didn’t reach out because I was working a lot. But the next day I had planned to.. until I randomly recognize his face show up in our lunch rush line. Unannounced, was not open to an invite, and very awkward for me as I was working the cash. He comes up and introduced himself while I’m trying to move quickly because we are in the middle of a rush! And I don’t have a lot of time for small talk but he keeps going. Eventually I pressure him by asking what he would like to order and tells me he would like whatever I recommend. I do this politely and ring him up and then he goes and takes a seat while he waits for his food. Unfortunately, he chooses a seat that’s facing me so he can stare at me the entire time at a two seater table. I was pretty creeped out and kinda mad at myself. Lol learned I should never do that again. I realize restaurants are public spaces but if someone owns and clearly works there I don’t think you should bombard them with a visit. I get supporting them but... not in this context. It didn’t work out I just didn’t like his approach.... 

One experience recently...
I had a match on bumble, I didn’t even start the conversation yet and noticed he friend requested me on Facebook. We didn’t even have a conversation yet. I was like NOPE. Kinda creepy how he found me so quickly without a last name or anything. Maybe he was making sure I wasn’t a catfish? But like that’s kinda early in the game if you haven’t had a conversation with me. 
I feel like the social media one is pretty common.

74,o3enbk,1624104656,Can this possibly turn out well?,"Went on a date with late 30s M. It was very fun - I felt like we were well-matched intellectually, but on top of that the conversation was flowing and we covered all sorts of topics that I wouldn't usually even get to talking about on such an early date.

However, at one point he mentioned being afraid of not being able to make rent, and also deliberately skipping a rent payment to a former bad landlord. He's been a starving artist in the past, so it makes sense that he would have been in this situation before, but it sounds like he has a much more stable job now. It wasn't clear from what he said if he is internally nervous about making rent and then makes it, or if he isn't making rent / is at risk of eviction. Note that I did not ask about any of this, he brought it up himself and we quickly moved on to another topic.

Not sure if it matters, but he paid for the date (I had offered to pay).

I'm interested in going out with him again, but this financial thing scares me. I have no idea if he has tons of debt, a bad credit score, or other surprises in store - basically, my imagination ran wild after this rent comment.  If everything else is genuinely great (TBD if it is), is there a way to get past this? Should I try to observe his behavior, or should I explicitly ask questions to get a clearer picture?

92,o3l27v,1624123420,Are coffee dates a horrible idea? I'm noticing a trend where they never go anywhere.,"So I've noticed this recent trend with myself.  I get a match, we chat a bit, and I ask them out for coffee usually around 3pm-5pmish.

Every single time it feels like a job interview.  The last woman I went out with greeted me with a handshake, and I sat down adjusting my shirt a bit, and then she asked ""So what do you do?"" as she sat across from me.  They ALWAYS sit across from me.  If I try to sit moreso close to them, it feels weird since our chairs are bulky.

I then started talking about my job for 5 minutes as she sat there quietly judging.

The dates usually end with a type of hug I give my aunt.

So here's the real problem:

I noticed that these dates set a very anti-romantic tone.  Like even if there's a second date...our convos build upon what we talked about on the first date...which is usually work related stuff, so naturally the relationship just never progresses into anything other than 3ish dry dates that don't work out.

One of the women I went out with, I knew every single dry fact about her life.  Enough to write a 10 page essay, but I knew absolutely nothing about her humor or anything on a deeper level.

She then broke it off saying our personalities are different, and I'm thinking ""I didn't even see your personality outside of the 11:30 am Tuesday morning coworker chitchat.""

So what are your thoughts and experiences with coffee dates?  For me, it's like they force me to be an acquaintance with someone as opposed to a potential lover... but maybe I'm doing something wrong?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o3l27v/are_coffee_dates_a_horrible_idea_im_noticing_a/

Since then, I've done another night or two with that same company (cityswoon) and Im mostly enjoying it. Nothings really gone anywhere, but its a fun low-key night. They never match you with the same person twice, so sometimes you'll have to sit a round out and watch the presenters speak and ""entertain"" those who dont have dates that round. But I usually get at least 5 or 6 rounds to chat to men. It takes less than an hour because you get 5 minutes per person, so it goes by a bit too fast, I wish we had more dates, but overall its been a decent enough experience.

BUT I thought I'd try a different company - My Cheeky Date (has locations around the world) and Im not impressed. I booked the morning of an event later that night, paid my 40 bucks, then got a message later saying sorry we didn't get enough people to sign up please choose a different date to reschedule your ticket to. I said I'd like a refund instead and they said sorry we dont do refunds but your ticket never expires. I have since rescheduled six different times, and EVERY TIME the event gets cancelled. I'm so mad, and they refuse to entertain the thought of a refund, they just keep telling me to pick a different date that we both know will be cancelled. I dont think my credit card company will do anything, as its very clear when you buy there are no refunds. If this ever changes and Im able to use my ticket, I'll come back and update you. They also offer personalized matchmaking dates for hundreds of dollars, but I think Im absolutely done with this company...once I can finally use this damn ticket.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o3mqu7/speed_dating_update/
