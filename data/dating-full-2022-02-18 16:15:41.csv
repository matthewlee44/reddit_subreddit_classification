The first few paras will be context and our story - the real crux of the problem will be titled \*\*\*PROBLEM\*\*\* so you can skip if you don't fancy all the context.

So my (F24) now ex BF (M30) (who for the sake of this we will call, Courtney) half ghosted me but half didn't... let me explain the whole context and dynamics of our relationship before we get to the crux of the issue.  


Overall we had dated for around 5-6months, in what felt like a very 0-100 relationship, but I grew to like that and fell for him. Courtney and I met at a mutual friend's (I knew the birthday person and their partner from work, we worked in healthcare during the pandemic and we became very close to this day I see them 2-3 times a week) birthday party. I arrived late, as I was entering the venue the birthday boy came out with 3 friends who were leaving, one of them being Courtney - I said a swift hello then goodbye as they left. Anyway, I got a drink and went to our table and Courtney was sitting there.  I said to him, ""oh I thought you left?!"", he replied "" No I'm here"". Anyway hours went on and I felt him staring at me the whole night and seemed quite shy to speak to me, so I told my friend to introduce us (I thought he was cute but I'm a very sociable person so I thought let's talk seeing as he's looking at me so much). We get introduced, talk about what we do for work (I had just left Healthcare to work in tech Law) - he told me he was a decorator but had just moved back to London during the pandemic, but he used to own a restaurant and he was trying to get one started in London. The birthday boy and their partner left as they had drank too much. I told Courtney I was heading into Shoreditch to meet a friend and he said so was he - so us two and a couple others headed off into Shoreditch. Long story short - we never met our friends, we went off in a club on our own, had a kiss and thus begun our relationship.

Now on our first date, we went for dinner and cocktails and then went on to a club. It was nice, I felt he was very shy (however, I do have a big personality so you know I gave him a break). However, at the club we met his sister (24F - who we will call Daisy) and her bf (25M) and their friends. I was thrown, as I felt A LOT of pressure but I was like, F it, I'm here now like let's just roll with it. Later on in the night, after enough alcohol, he told me he had two kids, by the same mother a boy (8M) and a girl (18mnthsF) and i was thrown as I had no clue. I told him, this was not the time, in the middle of the club to discuss this. We would talk later. Anyway, we went to a casino after and Daisy and I let the lads go and gamble whilst we went to the bar and got some cocktails. I basically asked her to do me a solid and tell me what am I walking into. She told me I have nothing to worry about, he is never going back there and he would never even tell her about me if he wasn't serious.

So, we went on countless dates in quick succession and Daisy and her bf were always present, to a point I was a bit confused as to why - don't get me wrong I loved them but it was just a bit surprising. I grew to learn they are super close. Anyway, one night I organised a date (this is probably 2-3weeks since we met now) and asked him to give me the full disclosure on his relationship with his kids and mother of his children. To keep this post from not getting too long, if you want the dreads of it I'll post an edit but the need to knows are, he was never happy with her, they had their first kid by accident, he went back to the relationship to try for his son, he wanted to leave again and then she got pregnant again and they separated again. He said he would never go back and that I was probably going to be his first serious relationship post her (talking serious early on and they both had dated/slept with people but no one serious). I said I would not bring up the situation or question his relationship with her, from here on out (as in the first two weeks since the first date I had dropped a couple questions here and there). Now I have to say, he is a fantastic father - he is very involved, has them every other weekend and during the week sporadically. He financially supports them as the mother of the kids has never really worked. I told him, the kids always come first and I would never stop that or disagree - however - just to keep the communication lanes open with me around things eg if you cant see me because something came up last minute etc etc. Just to be honest.  


Now we continue to see eachother after work when we can, clubbing bars etc etc. I met his bestfriend (who becomes relevant later so we will call him Theo (28M)) on multiple occasions, I met his older sister (34F) and his cousin and his partner on several occasions.  


One night we had a disagreement, because he bailed on dinner plans last minute  -when I rushed home from work to get ready to go - with me and then text me a random address to meet him at to go for a night out -  I declined to go because it all felt very - not for me the way he went about it. the next day, he came to my house with flowers to apologise but also had given me a gift (we are about 2 months into dating at this point) that he had for a little bit of time now. It was a puzzle with our names, with it saying I was his missing piece to his puzzle and a wooden postcard saying I was his Yesterdays, Today and Tomorrows. I was taken aback because it was too soon and I hadn't allowed my feelings to develop quickly at this point. He took me away to a fancy hotel in the following weeks,  he had asked me to be his gf and I was a little bit shocked but I went with it.  


So that is basically the vibe of our relationship, we were starting to become very touchy and kissy and inseparable when we were in person with each other, he would call me at 9am, lunch and on the way home from work. he was really a sweetheart and I started to fall for him. Now in december - he told me he would tell the mother of his kids about me and he wanted to move in with me. On two separate occasions post this I asked him if he really wanted to (he didnt have his own place since moving back to london so he was staying with his parents and a small bedroom apparently, he couldnt stay at mine as I was living with my aunt who is a foster carer so he would have to go through all the checks and my aunt wasn't onboard with all of it - which was fine, but he had come over once when I was WFH one day and there was no one around - lest to say we had a lot of sexual tension and chemistry both romantic and sexual) .and there was no pressure to change his mind. He said no. I asked him a week before he ghosted me if he was happy with the relationship and if he felt like we could really go the distance - he said yes (why did I ask, the reasoning is below).

\*\*\*THE PROBLEM\*\*\*

However, small issues were starting to form leading to the ghosting. We had been planning NYE for a month with the friends who's birthday we had met at for a month. The day before NYE he tells me he's not about NYE he might not be feeling it. I told him no no - I want us to go to a bar or anything I really want to be with you, don't flake on me haha - like it was a light hearted convo on my end. On NYE, he texts me at noon saying hey cant come out have the kids tonight. I was so upset, because there was no way he didn't know prior to NYE and a text to tell me without even a sorry. I felt so shitty. We spoke later in the day and I said to him listen, I know the kids come first but for you to just text me and not even say sorry - not even to call me just to explain the situation was shitty on your behalf. The kids come first and always will but that doesn't mean I come last - just communicate with me properly. Call me and apologise. We (the friends of his) felt he knew days before hence his convo the day before NYE and just was putting off telling me. I accepted his apology - the reason I mention this is because this starts to become a theme. Throughout Jan, he would never really text me if he had the kids - which I didn't have a problem with, but I said you know you can just check in when you go to bed, I'd like that and just to see how the kids are - please bare in mind from sept-dec; he would text me all the time when with them and even FT me, so it felt like a big shift. so this started to continue and I just kind of got used to it but i found the sharp change weird.   


So one friday night in towards the end of Jan we went our for a mutual mates surprise bday i had planned. long story short, we had a fun, we were kissing touching bla bla - it was a normal night out.  He was talking to the two friends (the couple whos bday is was when we met) that he cant wait for me and him to join them on holiday in April.  
That night  I asked him what was happening with him speaking to the mother of his kids. Now I wasn't trying to put pressure on him but he kept agreeing he was going to and well it had been a month so I wanted to know where his head was at. He just said he will and said he didn't realise there was a timescale. I said there isn't but you're the one who brought it to me so I assumed it was a short term thing not distant future. Now I knew Feb was going to be a difficult month for him, he has both his kids bdays, and their communions. He kind of alluded to money was tight (he gives his kids mum around a grand a month, has money in doing up properties and pays his parents rent so I could see what he meant). So I just had a feeling something was gonna happen but I just assumed we wouldn't talk as much which was fine. We left each other on the platform at around 1am as we were going two different routes. He was much drunker than me. I called him when I got in - no answer. The next morning I called him nothing. I text him. Nothing. Now I knew he had the kids that weekend so I was hoping he was busy with them but I was getting worried. It is 9pm and now I'm very worried something has happened, so I spoke with the friends we were with the night before if they had heard from him - they said no and how it seemed odd. I look at his instagram and he posts a story out with his kids. I text him saying omg i have been so worried why didn't you just text back saying you're fine!! Nothing. The next day I text saying is everything okay baby like this seems very weird. The whole day goes by and nothing ( we had a date planned that night). So now I really am concerned, am I getting ghosted - is he okay mentally, has something happened. My mind is racing, I feel sick. Now on the sunday I was texting him saying, hey baby listen if something is wrong or if youre going through something just let me know im really worried this isnt like you bla bla. I text his sister (who lives at the family home with him) asking if he's okay because I'e heard nothing from him and we had a date planned.  She said he's fine the kids have been needy she'll get him to contact me. Monday comes  and I dont hear from him so I text his sister saying hey can you just tell me girl2girl what is going on? she said she honestly had no idea and he can go very ""anti"" and to give him time and space but she will speak to him. He messaged me.  

He said, I'll message you later today. I reply saying Lets meet at our local cafe we go to to talk - i'll be there at 7pm - he saw the message and never replied.  I go to the cafe - he never showed up.

I tell his sister (now from all the dates she kept going on with us we had a degree of closeness where I felt comfy to). what had happened and shes like I'll talk to him. At this point my heart is breaking - I just cant understand what has happened. And just getting no communication was just killing me. I had fallen for the guy - I thought he had these feelings for me from the way he behaved, he felt like one of the good guys. His sister text me the next day asking if he had text me. I said no. He then messaged. basically saying how he is sorry for not replying he is sorry for how everything went down and that he's struggling to juggle me and the kids. How we wished it didnt have to be like this but he has to concentrate on them and himself. How i should continue being me and he is sorry for not showing up as he had work.

To shorten this, i reply saying why couldnt we have had a chat about this in person or at the very minimum via the phone. I have big feelings for you and I care for you and the kids. Why has this gone 0-100, why cant we dial back the relationship or at least talk in person - my feelings are so confused and i deserve more than a text. He didnt reply. I send another message saying that I hope things go well with the kids but I would like to talk to you at some point. he said thanks and we'll talk soon.  


I'm heartbroken and confused that A) he treated me like this across 4 days and B) that this is actually happening. Now, dont get me wrong his feelings are very valid but why was pulled into this emotional torment - is it because he didnt want to have to this and couldnt face the music like with NYE? Or is he just a prick? my heart was and is so hurt. I go on a nightout with my mate that following weekend and we bump into Courtney's best mate! he hugs me and we start talking and he had no idea all of the above had occurred and said they hadnt spoke in 3 weeks. The bestfriend tried to get me to stay out with him but I left with my girl. I text Courtney saying I bumped into his best mate - as on our instagrams we were at the same place and i didnt want it to look weird. He just said Lol. I then said to him listen, is it really the kids or do you not have feelings for me anymore - because if you have no feelings for me thats fine but just tell me so its easier for me to move on. True to form - He never replied.  The following weekend I bump into another one of his mates!! Our circles had become intertwined so Its just a surprise him and I havent bumped into eachother. I text him saying I bumped into his mate and I said I hope the kids bdays go well (it was the next day) and communions. I said I am moving at the beginning of the March - once im settled, id like to have you over and to talk. He said thank you and that it would not be a problem at all. Now I was annoyed that I even text him because if he has no problem meeting me to talk why cant we do it sooner!? I just remembered his sisters comment around space and time.  


So, I was half ghosted and I know why but I also don't. It feels off, he was in the driving seat when it came to having the bigger feelings and he perused me. I let him know the kids came first I just wanted him to communicate effectively what happens and if things change. I fell for him and as soon as I did he puts me through emotional torment for 4 days. I can take a break up but just fucking talk to me, like a person who exists, who has feelings - who you have/had feelings for!

 I just wanna know why he treated me the way he did - he knows my feelings haven't changed, I just dont understand why it go to the level it did and why we couldn't have had an adult discussion to either break up or dial back the relationship. He gave me no indication he had no feelings for me as things were building up to that weekend, we were great I even asked the week before if you read the context. Despite the way he treated me I still want to be with him. 

My main question is, do I still invite him over to my new place once I've moved - am I wasting my time? I know he agreed and I want to see him and find out what actually happened - as our circles are intertwined its only a matter of time we bump into eachother. I still have big feelings for him but I just don't know what to do or if I missed the signs. Should I still invite him over?

So I'm dating this person who's also an ex (we broke up after dating for couple months because they moved to the other side of the country and our attempt at a LDR wasn't working), and a friend (stayed in touch, talked on the phone regularly after breaking up and hooked up once when they came to visit). I've known them for over a year now, they moved back for at least several months in January and we started hanging out and sleeping together knowing that they're gonna move away soon. I like spending time with them a lot, we have very lengthy conversations that just won't stop and go out and do all kinds of interesting stuff; in bed it's very casual but like, in a good not a single worry in the world way. However they live a 2 hour drive away and I don't have a driver's license so it's entirely on them to come here. I bought a car and am working on taking the test one of the reasons being so that I could drive to their place too, not just the other way around. Right now I can't help feeling disappointed with how little time we spend together, it's usually 6--10 hours on the weekends. It would be fine if this were something I could rely on, if we had one day devoted to seeing each other, but they usually only hit me up on the day they wanna hang out, and when I suggest plans in advance it takes them hours to days to give a definitive answer. They also promised they'd teach me driving ages ago but never left up to that promise -- which is fine I guess because they've driven so far and I understand the sentiment of just spending quality time together, but it leaves me wondering if when I do learn to drive they will not want me to visit them. This weekend we're not hanging out at all because they're dog-sitting and while I'm not expecting them to abandon a dog for a full day, it would be nice if they were more pro-active in suggesting an alternative (meet as close to their place as the public transport goes for a small coffee date; hang out on Monday because neither of us have a fixed work schedule). They don't suggest anything like that. The way they initiate is like ""What are you doing today? I was thinking of doing [stuff] today in [my area]"" *on the day of* -- they struggle to tell me if they're gonna be available if I wanna make plans in advance. I feel like because I'm not the one driving it's not my place to take an issue with that, but at the same time I miss them the time they get out the door and it's frustrating when I've been waiting to see them a whole week and they hit me with ""I can't come this weekend"" and don't reply as to when they can come. I guess my action plan is pretty clear, I'm gonna get my DL and see if that makes things easier and if it doesn't then I know it's an us problem.

I'm a 24 year old guy who's socially awkward and has never been in a relationship before, and only a handful of dates over the past few years. In 2019 I started talking to this guy on tinder. He was basically the perfect guy, at least to me. He was very attractive and talented, a former model, he could sing and play a lot of instruments. He told me when we matched that he thought I was very attractive and hot, and that I was the cutest guy in town. We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do all kinds of dirty things to me. I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I would like to have sex with him, but that I to take things slow, and said he understood.

He went on a first date and it went really well. We had lunch at a diner and then made out, which was my first time. We lived an hour away from each other and he told me that he usually wouldn't drive that far to meet someone and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended a few months before then, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things, and he held my hand for a bit while he drove me home.

We kept texting afterwards and the told me me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, (things no one's ever said to me before) and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I was elated to have this guy so into me. It was everything I've been wanting for years. 

He told me about how his family was being kicked out of their house by their aunt. He texted me at the bank before he was about to find out if he could get a loan for a new house for his family and I sent him encouraging texts. He told me that I was his sunshine and that he liked how attentive I was.

We planned a second date and he said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. I was a little hesitant, since I'm a virgin and he told me that he was well endowed. He said that I just had to get over it. He also wanted it to be unprotected, saying that he wanted to cum in me.

One day I brought up that I wasn't sure if we were sexually compatible, since he told me a few times that he needed to know if his sexual needs would be fulfilled if we were dating and I didn't really want to have sex with someone that I only knew for a few weeks. He said that he couldn't be with someone who was debating whether they wanted to be with him or not. I really liked this guy and didn't want to lose him, so I sent him a bunch of texts begging him to reconsider. I know it was a very desperate move and I'm not proud of it or justifying it. He said that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that maybe he could get them back if  I had sex with him. I was going to at first, but after a few days I realized that I didn't want to do that, still wanting my first time to be with someone that I knew for a bit and had a good established connection with, and also we would have had to have sex in his car since his family was losing their house and I couldn't have sex at my house since I still live at home too, and I wanted my first time to be in a bed, and we stopped talking.

Since then I went between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me to being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who really liked me, the first time anyone's liked me like that in my life. Last month I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked him if he actually liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me, and he said that he really did like me at first, and then I ruined it. I regret asking. I know it's dumb to ask a question and then get upset when the answer isn't what I wanted, but I don't like knowing for certain that I ruined things and I'm having trouble coming to terms with it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159707,public,self,I ruined things with someone who really liked me for the first time in my life,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/svni6k/i_ruined_things_with_someone_who_really_liked_me/,no_ads,0,,,

We were never exclusive, and before the start of this semester he told me he didn't want a relationship, so I continued to see both him and another guy (19m) I had been going on casual dates with for about a year. This resulted in a lot of fighting between myself and Nick as he had expected me to be exclusive with him without being in a relationship. I told him I didn't want to put in that kind of work without a label and he disagreed with my philosophy. I also brought up the fact that he would go long stretches of time without talking to me, which to me meant that he didn't love me as much as he said he did. He always had some excuse for giving me the cold shoulder. During some of our arguments, Nick started yelling at me and making fun of my voice and I suddenly realized he was verbally abusing me. After much reflection and research, I realized that a lot of what Nick had done to me in the year and a half I had been seeing him would qualify as abuse and manipulation and I decided to stop seeing him.

After I cut off Nick, the other guy I was seeing told me he wanted to make things official with me, so I agreed. I have been seeing him casually for about a year, I really admire him, and we have really good chemistry. Things are going really well and I do think I love him, but I feel weird when he tells me he loves me. I feel like I don't believe him and that his feelings are too strong given the fact that we just made it official. Sometimes I am able to reframe this thinking as I have been seeing him on and off for a very long time, so the strength of his feelings might be genuine, but I'm still unsure. I don't believe that he loves me. He also said once that he has never felt the same for any other girl he's dated as he does for me, and I may be acting insecure here but I just feel like there's no way and that this statement might be another form of manipulation. I can't tell If I'm being paranoid right after the Nick situation, if I'm being insecure, if this other guy is being manipulative too, or if I'm overthinking it and everything's fine. LOL.

I would like to get your advice on my latest dating issue. I have to say in advance that my dating life was quite lame the last years and i don't look for a relationship specificely, so i am more the 'let's see what happens' type of person. Furthermore, i take my time to connect and get to know each other before i get intimate. so here we go:

I (M, mid 20's) met a woman (early 20's) on tinder 3 months ago. we regularly texted, snapped (snapchat), made phone calls or facetimed every day for the last 5 weeks (the start was a bit challanging since we both rarely checked tinder). we got along very well and we also met a couple of times in person at her place (there was great chemistry and we talked/laughed a lot). The last week she acted a little dismissive and I asked her what the reason was. She said her interest is gone because I went for a walk with a female friend with whom I had something three years ago (she is working at the same company and i havent seen her for the last three years, furthermore we separated in good ways back then). after we talked about it later that day (i told her the situation) everything was back in order. a week later (yesterday to be accurate) she said that she is not ready for a relationship (i was looking for it in the long run) although she would like to have one, she said her focus is currently on other topics (job, studies, etc). she said that she had huge interest in me but does not know exactly why this interest is now gone (i believe her in this regard, since she always asked for phone calls and to meet in person). I suggested to go separate ways since our focus was not the same and wished her the best.

Since I have high standards when looking for a woman, it is even harder to let her go now. For me, she has met almost all my 'standards'. Since yesterday we have broken off contact. Until now, the physical contact remained only hugs, because we both wanted to take time to get to know the other properly before we get more intimate with each other which was fine for us both.

My question now is:

Should I forget about her completely and move on? I think about her every day and since yesterday it is even worse. Do you think it would be possible to get back in touch in a few months and see if her opinion/focus has possibly changed (and also if she doesn't have a boyfriend yet lol)? by that I don't mean to wait but just move on with my life and if something comes up with another woman then fine, but not focus on her completely, i hope you all know what i mean.

I have to say that she is almost 'perfect' for me....

Thanks for all answers.

I think we are both making efforts but I am not sure. I have been in one real relationship and then have dated but that's it so I am not good with the whole flirting and stuff thing

We started talking a dinner a couple of weeks ago after having met once a couple of months before. He came and sat at the table I was sitting at because no one else was sitting there yet. I shared a nickname I got from some kids because its funny and people love hearing the story. Later as we were leaving for the day we called me the nickname. A few days went by and he said hello to me at church, and he doesn't really say hi to a lot of people. A couple of weeks later at another dinner, he came and sat at a table I was sitting at. Next to me but leaving a chair in between us and said hi. Then a couple days later (this past Sunday) at church he came and sat right next to me . Bouncing and swinging/ opening and closing his leg the whole hour. We didn't get a chance to really talk after the hour. Then the other day at another dinner he said hi to me as soon as I walked in and then sat kinda next to me but leaving a chair in between us again. We didn't get a chance to really talk because other people came to socialize. But we had a thing that night at church so I sat next to him in between him and his other friend. He made a remark about something I said about the Super Bowl but then he dipped out.

I honestly can't tell if he likes me and I am afraid of making myself look stupid. If he does like me I feel like we are both making efforts of sitting close to each other.

I just meet this guy on Tinder a few weeks ago. We chat for a week and he asks me out. We went out for dinner. It was really nice, we talk and laugh a lot. He keeps saying how beautiful I am, that I am prettier in person than in my pictures. We didn't kiss, but we hug each other a few times. After I left he message me saying how beautiful I am and how he enjoyed spending time with me. I gave him a gift which was a horse key holder. YES, he is a cowboy and I am a city girl.

On Valentine's Day, I was expecting he would ask me out again. He didn't it. He messages in the morning asking what my plans were and that he was taking his daughter out. I just said it was sweet of him to do that for his daughter. I ask him to message me later before he goes to bed. He didn't it.

I called him the next day at night. We talked for a while... He said he has been busy with work and everything that's why he didn't message on Tinder. But I told him since he now has my number he can call me. His answer was: ""I WILL KEEP IN TOUCH"".

I didn't call or text him...

Has been 4 days and I didn't hear back from him. Should I call him or just forget about it or move on... I just didn't understand why he didn't even call or text me. Just because I don't drink, go to bars, or sleep around which I told him from the beginning and he said he was okay with that. 

This morning I just texted him, he texted back right now asking how I was doing. Then I asked him if he want to go out for a BBQ dinner. He just said: He would love that but he has some plans to get out of town to Nevada today... Which he mentioned before but I forgot the date...

I don't understand why he is so insecure with me... When we were at the restaurant on our first date... many people were staring at us. He said people were staring at me because of my beauty... bla...bla... He just put his hands on my waist a few times. I knew he just want to show I was with him... 

I do like him and would love to spend more time with him... but not sure what to do anymore!!!

I met a girl on Hinge and have been talking almost every day for about 2 months. We have been vibing very well. Humor, music, hobbies, vision matched.

She clearly says she likes me and we send voice messages to each other so I can really feel her excitement and interest while talking to me. She also feels the same from me. We've talked about almost everything from family to daily life.

Since we are leaving away from each other (different neighbor country in EU), we wanted to have an online date first some weeks ago. We attempted twice but she has to cancel both due to reasonable issues. However, she was always willing to reschedule. So we did. BUT Last week,  another try for our first online date again didn't happen because her social media got hacked like an hour before our date. I literally and luckily saw this weird process. In her IG, a cheap commercial with a link was posted etc. then the account was deleted. Since it was the only platform we had to communicate ( I had deleted Hinge), I couldn't reach her. I was shocked and confused.  I tried to reach her through a music platform. She replied that her account, email and etc. were hacked. I wasn't fast enough to send my number because her account was deleted there, too. 

I dug in and found her Facebook. Then, I sent several messages asking what is up and so on? she replied to the last message ""GOODBYE"" it took some time to reply but she did and she said she is surprised that I tried hard to reach her. Moreover,  she said it's not a random hacking so happened before and doesn't wanna get me into this. She even said the person is probably reading the messages right now.  I didn't ask for any further explanation but I was going to ask sometime later because she was already tired of this. Anyway, We exchanged our tel no. She got her accounts back. We started sending nice messages back and forth again. We planned finally our date. The day came. In the morning, we threw good morning and see you later messages.  About 2 hours before our online date, I received a message from her on Facebook, saying that you are not having a date. She has a boyfriend. I am blocking you from everywhere. I am crazy but she has to understand.  It was a different language I had to translate it :D 

And that's it. No date again. I cannot reach her this time for sure. I really thought I found someone that everything was going very well. She is very very nice btw. I get how nice she is from not only how she speaks to me but also in her communication with her pets and my understanding of her family. I don't think that she would be dating while having a boyfriend.

He was in town since he was visiting a friend for the week. I knew he'd be leaving soon, so I didn't really think much of it. I was just looking forward to hanging out with him and having a good weekend. Our dates were good, nothing spectacular. But he still came off as a really sweet and intelligent guy, the kind I unfortunately haven't run across in a long time :/ So after he went back home we texted till 2 in the night for two or three days. In these conversations it was quite clear that he was enthusiastic to get to know me more. He kept asking me questions about my family,  work, past relationships, taste in music etc. Even when I said something like I don't know when we'll meet again and talked about the distance between us, sort of directing at how it wasn't probably a good decision for us to potentially date. He said we'll find a way if we had to and was very positive about the whole thing. Cut to a few days later, he doesn't respond to my messages for the whole day. After he's free from his work, he texts me late at night usually saying something sweet. I've been telling him for the past two-three days that he could atleast drop me a hello in the morning and go on with his routine, instead of completely ignoring my messages till late in the night. He still didn't respond to my good morning message and another message today which was sorta important. Another thing I've noticed is, he tells me to wait and to make time for him but never does the same himself. Like he told me to stay up for a bit at 1AM tonight because he was leaving his friend's place in 15 minutes so we could talk when he reached home. An hour later, he sends me a photo of him still at his friends. Like bruh, I didn't tell you to leave? Why are you lying about that. Even on our second date, he had told me he was on his way to pick me up but ended up showing up an hour later. I had to wait all by myself in heels on a roadside where there was no place to even sit. He wasn't even apologetic about that..I called him up a few times in between that, he'd either not pick up the phone or he'd respond saying it'll just take him five more minutes to reach. ü§¶I'm sensing some trouble lol. I want to stop talking to him. Am I overreacting? From my past experiences I've realised that I need some conversation throughout the day. 2-3 messages here and there, I understand people are busy but I don't think anyone's that busy to not send messages at all throughout the day. Him asking me to wait and then not following up on that and ignoring my messages completely, frankly gets me a little anxious and into a bad mental state where I think about the person and why they are being mean.

I was instantly smitten. i tried to use terms of endearment/be cute and he curved me a bunch of times, I was hurt but I didn't thing too much of it. I was easily working 11+ hours a day, 6 days a week last year, and he was awfully patient and understood fully when I told him I can't constantly be there. anyway we stayed in casual touch, talked about our days or weekends or anything I could think of and fast forward 7ish months later, he's visiting the city again for a friend's wedding and asks me again, and I say yes, I dressed the part for a date and I enjoyed his company, we tried coordinating another meal, but I had to take a raincheck because of work and bec of other things in life I was not in the right headspace, didn't tell him the latter. the space he gave me though, the ease, I had fallen very hard for him by this time. the second time around seeing him was awkward, admittedly I was caught off guard with the change in air but I didn't comment. both of us had just begun new jobs and it's like we swapped our schedules. he was working 24/7 now, and I suddenly had decent weekends. one day, when everything was falling apart around me as is the case on bad days, I took the only thing I could control and nipped it in the bud which was him, I told him I wanted to cut my losses it didn't seem like this was going towards a ldr and that we were really busy and too far apart, even tho it was really just my loss bec he was cute and really fun, he said he was sad but he agreed however he'd like to remain friends. I didn't expect him to fix it or tell me otherwise, I just wasn't ready for the hurt that followed. we still speak but he's been more terse and avoids conversation.

I'm conflicted if i should've put in more effort, is it my fault or is it just the timing. clearly I'm not over him, but I'm too embarrassed to ask him that I want to explore the idea of seeing each other seriously.

We recently met at her place. We had a great time. No sex, as she seemed like she wanted to wait, or at least that was my interpretation when I tried to go down on her. We had a great time after that had happened as we laughed a lot and it seemed as though we were genuinely good friends. I would be there talking to her if it only were for the laughs as well, so I was happy. She also seemed happy.

I texted her a bit later and told her that I had a great time and that it was cozy (this makes sense in my language), basically stating my clear attraction to her and also saying that I enjoyed the time. She replied by saying that she agrees and that she thought it was fun. Afterwards I got a bit confused, as she didn't really text me anymore, without me texting her first. This did also happen earlier, to some extent at least, but suddenly it felt as if she was not so sure that she liked me, let's say.

I would always have to make an effort texting her, which wasn't rare but I was giving her a lot of attention, which made me wonder why she was not willing to text first, ever. Whenever I text she responds within ten minutes, unless I do not respond equally quickly.

It might be worth noting that I have not given her a lot of attention in the past, despite her being interested in me for a long time. She did however seem to give me a lot of attention, and now suddenly when I am here to give her that attention, she does not seem to want it as much.

She recently said to my friend that she was not sure how she felt and that she wonders how I feel. She said something along the lines of: 'Well he is really nice, but I don't know what I want' and 'What does he want?'

After she said those things we went on a skiing trip through an Institution we both attend, not as if we had any plans made together, we just both happened to go to the same place. After a row of unintended consequences, let's say, we often happened to be right next to each other and we had a lot of fun together. She laughs at virtually everything I say, sometimes almost falling over doing so. I seriously don't understand what all her signals mean... I get that she likes me, but I don't know what to do to seal the deal.

I thought this was kind of odd as she seems to have been more straight forward in the past. This really messes with my head and I am wondering what is wrong exactly. She does not make an effort to write to me first or plan anything with me, but when I write to her she responds quickly and seems happy. We're soon going to meet each other so I might realize something then, but I would like your take on this. Now that I think about it she actually wrote to me first a few days ago, after I had written to her and taken initiative a few days in a row, then it suddenly stopped when I asked her out, even though she said she would love to meet. Why does she stop texting me and taking initiative when I am clearly showing my interest, as when I ask her out? Instead she started texting my best friend, they also know each other, talking about somewhat random things, but still things she does not really seem to talk with me about...

What should I do? I have not really texted much more than a few times a week, but when I text it leads to conversations that end whenever someone of us go to bed. I don't think she seems to take initiative to text me... Should I start texting her more, or give her more space and time to think about it?

She was smart and passionate and honestly would have checked every box on any other persons list but I was more concerned about the fact that I‚Äôm a 22 year old man on his first date EVER.

My friends encouraged me to start since I never really dipped my feet in that part of the waters so me going on this date felt more like peer pressure than‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶ a date?

I wasn‚Äôt nervous or anything but at some point a bunch of questions started forming in my subconscious.

Why am I here? Because I‚Äôm on a date‚Ä¶

What do I expect out of this? Do I want an actual relationship?

If I want a relationship, can I even make myself that vulnerable to anyone else?

Why am I even dating if I‚Äôm unsure if I can even handle being that intimate with someone?

Do I find her attractive? She‚Äôs cute but, no.


All these thoughts just kept coming at me during the date and Although I managed to keep the conversation flowing I could feel myself just slowly losing interest in the entire process.

When I dropped her off at the end of the date she leaned in for a kiss and I instinctively kissed her back. Then she stuck her tongue down my throat and I forced myself to endure it even though it felt completely mechanical/unnatural . I had to stop her at some point because I almost threw up for some reason.

Told her good night and now I‚Äôm just sitting here and just reflecting on myself and what I want my future to look like.

A part of me feels like I have away my first kiss too easily and kind of regrets it. Another part of me is glad to have some kinda development in my romantic life at the very least.

She was also super distant the whole time, probably cause her close friends were there but it made me feel very strange. It turned out to be fine but now I have to text her again to make further plans when I could have just set it up in person.

Here's the problemo: if I text her to make plans again that's kinda lame now that ive done that once. I dont want to seem like im not confident enough to ask her to her face. If i don't text her it seems like I'm weird for not following up on the failed date. I don't want to just text her to start a conversation hoping she brings up getting together, we're not texting buds.
