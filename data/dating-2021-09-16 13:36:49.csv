1,ppjhpi,1631818299,I'm accidentally people's wingman but I struggle to find love for myself,"I'm not sure if this the right place to talk about this but I need some advice.   


I'm frustrated because I unintentionally always get two of my friends to get to know each other and then they fall in love. In this case, it has happened twice already with 2 of my lady friends that I know through a video game that we all play. They both met a guy that they like. It frustrates me because I used to like these girls myself and even confessed some of my feelings for them, by saying that I care about them and that I'll be there for them but they don't show the same feelings back. After they meet one of my mutual friends, they happen to fall in love with them almost instantly, leaving me in the third wheel. Eventually they start hanging out every single day, completely forgetting about me or that they never would have met each other if it wasn't for me. I can't change their feelings if they really love each other but I just wish they would at least see me as a friend and not completely forget about me after they meet one of my mutual friends...   


Another struggle that I have is that almost all of the girls that I meet happen to be online. I've been outside and to several other places to try to meet girls but it's not as easy as finding a girl through the internet or in my case, finding girls that play the same online game that I do. Everyone is deserving of love so if my mutual friends can find love almost instantly through me, I also want to have that experience with a special someone.   


If you relate to any of this, feel free to leave any comments or advice to my situation and what I could do about it for any future cases. Thank you",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppjhpi/im_accidentally_peoples_wingman_but_i_struggle_to/
2,ppjiku,1631818377,Two questions. How often do female dumpers come back? Are they avoidant attachment or uninterested?,"1. How often do female dumpers come back? 

2. How can you tell if they had an avoidant attachment style or if they were just uninterested?

These are 2 questions I’ve been thinking about as I read attached and learn more about attachment theory. Curious about your thoughts? I’ve discovered that when I’m really into a girl and I’m unsure of how she feels then I have anxious style. I believe the girl in question had an avoidant style. Which can be extremely tricky to work out. 

My answers to those questions 

1. Usually when a girl is done then they’re done. They’ve thought about it for a while. Guys dumpers tend to come back. 

2. Girl in question had a hard time opening up, had a hard time being intimate, claimed all her relationships last 1-2 months, stayed because she never stays, etc..Friends told her to take a break from dating. She had sexual assault in the previous relationship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppjiku/two_questions_how_often_do_female_dumpers_come/
3,ppjpv2,1631819009,A group of girls are taking false accusations to the extreme I’m M[19],"I made a post earlier this week stating my situation. But here is a summary so a girl I recently slept with made false allegations on me and has gotten the past girls I’ve slept with  to agree  with her about the allegations. But here’s the thing the allegations are  broad they are saying I forced them to do things they didn’t want and I’m a rapey guy whatever that means. But here’s what happened; I’m a guy who deals with women for only sex and I let this always be known to the girls I talk to I let them know I dont want a my kind of a relationship just sex and that’s it. After I sleep with a girl i almost always never respond to any texts ever again ending things their. But the girl who started he spread of these allegations before I slept with her knew I ghost girls after sex and even asked one time why I do it. But later down the line after I slept with her I severed connections with her but she thought she could get a relationship out of me anyway and attempted to start one, ignored her and  she went ballistic. She sent 20+ text messages going crazy and yesterday her and the girls she convinced came to my house chanting rapist.

Does anyone have experience with trying to date/chat with a nurse? I just wanna get past the first date to see if she's attracted to me in person, vice versa.

We’ve had issues with in the past because she would tell me about all these guys texting her and hitting on her, and she would tell them she’s not interested but keep talking to them on a regular basis. Some of these guys she has had a “thing” with in the past, at least 4 of them, and many others. 

Anyways! I went on her snap and found this one dude who she started talking to before we became official but continued to after we got in a monogamous relationship together. After we got in a relationship they weren’t sending flirty texts, but they were commenting on each others selfies and exchanged pictures of themselves. 

One of our first dates ad a couple we were at a park in LA trying to get tickets to go on a boat at the lake and she was talking to him on Snapchat while we were together. She also told him he seems like a fun drunk to be around. He then said that she couldn’t handle it and she said “I can loosen up”. So he said the time he was in the area he would pick her up for a few drinks and she agreed to it and said “sounds like a plan!” FYI by this this time we were living together!

11,ppkr62,1631822158,Sister might marry her sexual harasser,"My American 21 year old sister has been living in Israel for two years. 

Last year, she confided to me that her married boss with children (in his 40s) was sexually harassing her, sending her gross messages, and I convinced her to leave the job. She ended up moving to another city in Israel. 

A couple months ago, my parents got an “anonymous tip” from my sister’s friends that she was dating this man. She vehemently denied it. 

Fast forward to yesterday, and my mom told me that my sister sent my parents a long message about how she is in love with this same guy, her harasser, and essentially saying they want to get married. He is now getting divorced. 

It sounds like they may get engaged any day. The message was very obviously not written by her — my parents and I are all 100% certain of that. It’s ridiculously far from any writing I’ve ever seen from her and sounds like it was run through Google translate, probably by him. It’s sappy and lame and I’m sad for her. She has no college degree or means of supporting herself independently should this go south. 

None of my siblings know about this (there are 3 others) and my sister has told my parents she wants to tell us herself. I’m very worried about this relationship, as are my parents, and also worried that if we wait for her to tell us she’s dating him, it will be too late. 

My question is: what do I do? Do we stand back and let them get married? What can we do? She’s not particularly close to any of my siblings and I’m not sure that we ourselves have the power to convince her, but maybe there is another way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppkr62/sister_might_marry_her_sexual_harasser/

14,ppku3o,1631822405,Brutally honest: am I (26M) right to feel rejected/doubtful if we don't sleep together after 2 good dates?,"Hey, guys. Am aware how self-centred and possibly overentitled this is going to sound so I am just going to bite the bullet &amp; put it out there. Probably a mix of insecurity/a lack of experience playing with my mind, I want to get others' perspectives.

Is it wrong to start getting frustrated/doubtful of a girl's interest if we don't have sex after a couple of (good) dates? Although I probably wouldn't sleep with someone first time around, if I enjoyed the second time and was attracted to her and didn't see red flags, I don't think I'd hesitate. Been on a few dates since April and have had a similar thing happen with 2-3 different girls, where we'll get on well and be making out quite intensely on several dates, maybe even 2nd base, but when I say I find her really attractive and suggest moving things forward and coming back to mine, there's a reason not to...usually involving 'taking things slowly' or 'really liking me' and 'having really good conversations'. 

Honestly it's messing with my head - it's happened several times in succession, and I'm starting to doubt myself and wondering whether I'm just being used for validation or company. I get the whole worry about being humped and dumped i.e. the guy ghosting after he gets what he wants, but I try hard to be honest and open and transparent if I'm not feeling it for some reason, and don't ghost. If I had a good time on a couple of dates with a girl I found attractive, who wanted to sleep together, I wouldn't hesitate. 

To clarify further, 2 of the girls I saw (one for 2 dates, one for 4-5 dates, with texting inbetween) I broke it off with because I wasn't feeling able to do a relationship, which was where things seemed to be going and I don't want to mess anyone around/use them. Another girl I saw for 3 dates (bad timing, we were both away for a month after, I've gone back to work in school and she's leaving for Spain) I was close to sleeping with, got to 2nd base and had some really steamy making out, but when I said I really wanted to have sex, she said she was having a really nice time, good conversations and really liked me.

I tried to end my life multiple times. delving into middle school i started doing drugs and was bullied even more. freshman year of highschool i started hooking up with a lot of girls/guys and ended up getting kicked out of a guys house drugged up. my dad got a job though. it really really sucked and i didnt have any trust with my parents, i got diagnosed with psychotic symptoms and bipolar disorder. then the pandemic hit and i had no friends, i failed my classes and went to summer school. now as a junior i can say im in an okay place. my parents always go out and im left babysitting everynight, but i met someone. i mean i went to homecoming with him but we ditched each other. now we are talking again. really talking. ive never been in love before, i still am not. but i actually like someone. thats never happened to me. it feels like year-round christmas. it feels like time is slow yet fast. it feels like im comfortable, sleeping on the perfect matress in a room with the perfect temperature. im okay with not having friends, because i just want him. the kisses are different, he grabs my face and touches my legs softly. it isnt a hookup or a quickie. its real and i like it. i like this. he wants me, and honestly i want him too. he isnt perfect but nor am i, and i too admire every flaw :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppku66/i_dont_usually_like_people_but_i_like_him/

17,ppkzg4,1631822824,Asking for perspective about another guy I am talking to.,"
TLDR;This is about another guy I have started talking to. Both late 20s

For two months he was trying to set up a date with me but I was legitimately busy. He for sure was the peruser.  I can tell he is kind of the relationship type by looking through his social media, he seems to have been in 2 relationships in college that lasted for over a year. He has added me on social media. 

I think he thought maybe I was not interested so he kind of stopped reaching out to me for a week then one day I ended up texting him kind of last-minute but asking if he was out and if he wanted to meet up. He invited me to come meet up with him and his friends and we all hung out together and went back to his house.  He wanted me to spend the night but I told him that I was just going to go home.  We hooked up but not all the way if that makes sense. Aka: I didn’t see his dick. 
I told him that I wanted to take things slow and he said that he was OK with that. 
So the next day he asked me if I wanted to get dinner. I was super hung over so I told him that maybe In the next couple days but he told me that he was going to be out of town that weekend and during the week he was busy every night. So I ended up going on the date with him and we had a great time we hooked up again a little further but no sex as I told him we should wait a little.  So for 4 days we didn’t hear from each other until I sent him a random text to which he ended up texting me back and the convo went on for a while. 
That weekend I knew he was out of town so I didn’t hear from him. But the following weekend (So a couple days laters) I reached out and asked him if he was doing anything that night and he said he had plans early the next morning at 6am and was then out of town again that weekend so he couldn’t do anything (it’s legit)
So then a few days later I reached out to him and mentioned how I was grabbing drinks with one of my girlfriends and said if he wants to meet up with us he can. He said that he would but he is having friends over to watch football but then he asked me where we were going.I replied and told him the name of the bar but he hasn’t responded yet. I’m not flipping out about it but does this guy seem interested?

21,pplo1y,1631824938,Little bit of a rant/need advice,"   I (26f) just want to preface this by saying, I have nothing against polyamory or anyone who is in the lifestyle. I’ve tried it multiple times. It’s just not for me. I’m on all the dating apps, like literally all of them.

   All of that being said, how do I find quality matches that are just looking for something monogamous and long term? I’m really not trying to generalize here but it seems like everyone I match on is either not looking for anything serious or is already in a relationship and just looking to explore with their partner.

   I even put in my profile exactly what I’m looking for and I match with people who’s profile says they’re looking for the same thing, but then we get to talking and they say “oh by the way I’m poly/in an open relationship but my partner knows I’m on here. Hope that’s cool!” Or worse yet, I find out a couple months in that I’m actually the side piece and their partner has no idea about me.

   It’s really starting to mess with my self confidence and has got me thinking that I’m not good enough for more than just a hookup. Am I just doing this all wrong? Should I lower my standards? I don’t know. I already feel like I don’t ask for much when it comes to relationships. Just someone who treats me decent.


   I’m not picky about looks at all, not all about material things and brand names, I’d consider myself a decent conversationalist considering I usually find myself carrying the conversation. I’m not perfect. I’m a work in progress and I’m open about that. I’m also open about my physical disability but I try to show that I’m goal oriented and motivated despite that.

   I really, really don’t want to believe it’s because of something as out of my control as a disability that I was born with. Maybe it’s because people think they will have to care for me? I do have some limitations but nothing I can’t handle on my own. I have a kid that I have about half the time who I’m fully capable of caring for, I have my own car, my own place and I have lots of hobbies ranging from doing makeup and making music to helping the elderly and babysitting my younger siblings.

   I don’t get invited on dates and if I invite my match on a date, I get the run around or blocked/ghosted or stood up. Should I just get off of dating apps altogether? I thought they would be a good option for me since I’m pretty shy in person until I warm up but it’s definitely not increasing my odds of getting a date if I can’t get anyone to want to know me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pplo1y/little_bit_of_a_rantneed_advice/

That point where you suddenly don’t feel for anyone and only desire pleasure from the opposite sex and just that? There’s no capacity or understanding of bonding, and you have to act like you feel for the partner when in reality you don’t gaf? This happened to me at the age of 15-16?? Idk, somewhere in puberty. I never believed or had interest in intimate relationships, but I did have a sex drive. I knew that I needed to lose my virginity because my sexual energy was getting out of hand.

Fast forward to two years later, I get labeled as a hypersexual by a psychologist after just screwing up in life for having an unbearable sexual desire that was hard to kill/satisfy. 

I never understood why people wanted to get married or why relationships are taken seriously. However, I will not lie and say that I never felt anything for a woman. I have liked women before, but never really liked them like my peers like their gfs… if that makes sense. It’s just not in me. I don’t know how to explain it. 

Naturally, I’m very chill, relaxed and have been told by almost every date that they cannot read me, they feel safe with me and that something about me makes them tingle.. that I have a powerful but very subtle confident energy/power/demeanor and aura (whatever you wanna call it) that demands attention. Every time I take a girl out with me, we get complimented.. which usually never happens to them before with a guy. These experiences and energy I guess keeps them coming back without me doing anything, but then I decide what kind of show and personality to put on depending on the girl’s personality… if it make sense. 

Obviously, I’ve never had a gf , but I’ve had countless of hook ups and casual dates (involving sex of course) and it just now got me thinking about why some people can’t move on or get attached. That emotional bond I guess.

Like why bother being with someone other than to have sex with them? Why do y’all date? What else do you guys/girls do with your partner other than sex? How can I build emotional bonds?

How can I get myself to be more caring? This will help me maintain fuck buddies for longer than 3-6 moths do I need to know/learn the skill.

27,ppm5d4,1631826434,Ghosted and blocked by a girl after hooking up; it happens to guys too,"I hear a lot of stories from women about guys disappearing after hooking up with them, but I just had a girl completely cut me out of her life after we hooked up. Some background; I'm 25 and she's 23, we met on Tinder, and had our first ""date"" on Saturday. Before we met, she expressed interest in hooking up with me, but wanted to meet in public first and see how we vibed. I agreed, and we met at a cafe for some coffee and ice cream. We were very flirty with each other during our cafe meeting, and after the date, she agreed to come back to my place. It didn't take long at all before we were having sex, and afterwards, she expressed interest in spending the night. We cuddled for a bit, watched TV together, and had some great conversations about life. We even went grocery shopping together and started holding hands in public. After a few hours, she told me that she really liked me and didn't want this to be a one-time thing. I was feeling the same way, and she spent the night in bed with me. In the morning, we had sex again, and then she had to leave for work. I kissed her goodbye and walked her to her car, and told her that I look forward to seeing her again. When she got home, she texted me saying that she had a wonderful time, and I replied likewise. 

We texted a bit on Monday, talking for a bit about our workdays. She kept calling me ""handsome"" and ""sexy"" in her messages, which I found endearing. On Tuesday, I texted her again asking if she wanted to go to dinner that Friday. I did not receive a response, and my text never showed up as being ""delivered"" which I thought was strange. I went to send her a message on Snapchat instead, but noticed that she was no longer in my friends list. I went to add her as a friend again, and it said something along the lines of ""could not find profile"", which I discovered was Snapchat's way of telling me I'm blocked. I was also unmatched by her on Tinder. My heart sank as I realized that she had just cut me out of her life with no explanation or warning. Although we only spent one day together, I was really hoping I could have seen her again. Now that I think about it more, it's highly likely that she might be in a relationship and decided to block me after our hookup so that her boyfriend wouldn't find out. Regardless, I'm quite dismayed by the experience and feel used. It's taken me a few months to work up the courage to date again after being cheated on, and this experience has me disheartened.

I'm hoping to move past this experience as quickly as possible and not dwell on it. I've learned to never take what someone is saying over text at face value, and to let someone's actions speak for themselves. Someone who sweet-talks you over text might be ready to drop you like a bad habit, so don't be caught off-guard by someone who turns out to be way less interested than their texts imply.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppm5d4/ghosted_and_blocked_by_a_girl_after_hooking_up_it/
28,ppmbv7,1631826986,That’s a hard no.,"When a guy mentions multiple times in conversations about wanting me to come over to “watch movies” but states he’s looking for long-term relationships…

That’s a lie. 

It was going great BUT he ruined it because that was our first conversation ever. He kept throwing it in whenever he could. 

I was talking about cooking at one point and he automatically responded “maybe you could come over and watch movies after a meal”. 

I was talking about things to do around town  and he responded “maybe after a date you can come over and watch movies and cuddle”. 

PSA: If you tend to do this with females and they fall for it, that’s great. Just know though that it will NOT always apply with EVERY female you talk too.

30,ppmmji,1631827948,The law of averages,"39 M, I’ll probably take a lot of crap for this one, but here we go. I’m in sales, and the law of averages means the more people you see the more chances you have. After my divorce I was craving a relationship and impatient. I tried dating one person at a time, but the process was too slow for my personality. So I went nuts. In a 2 month span using mostly Hinge and Bumble in a small-ish city I went on around 40 first dates. I didn’t discriminate: all religions, creeds, body types (to a certain extent), complexions, etc and I went on dates with 21 year olds to 55 year olds. I was always my most authentic self and I was never dishonest. Then in the midst of of it all I found her, the first date I knew. I sent polite text messages to those I was still dating and those I had planned to date and went solo. We now live together and have a puppy. Life is perfect. In my circumstance, the law of averages prevailed and it paid off quickly. But had a heeded to societal norms, and dated one, or maybe 2 at a time I may still be miserable and single. 

End notes; 

1) Hinge was by far the best if you want to find that somebody. 
2) Yes I made many faux pas in this experiment. 
3) I did get a crazy stalker who finally went away after 3 months. 
4) I have zero regrets because I found her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppmmji/the_law_of_averages/

i first saw maddie in the introduction room, i am autistic and have anxiety so i didn’t talk to her but she did catch my eye as she’s pretty with big eyes. 

at lunch on the first day she approached me, i had my noise cancelling headphones on playing music to help relax me, i was also sat alone. she is i tagged conversation with me. Maddie was the first person to make an effort to talk to me.

since then we’ve spent pretty much all our time in college together, just me and her and sometimes others, never really for long with others. 

she’s pretty great, laidback and chill.
we went shopping together today after college which was nice, i bought her a jumper and she spent the night wearing it which was nice, she sent me a picture of her in it.

i am going to her house on saturday and on monday we are going to a sculpture park together as part of a college trip, we are free to wander and a created a plan together of what we want to see.

we have very similar interest and call until she sleeps and text all day and night. 

sometimes she says things that make me wonder if she likes me, for example she told me whenever she liked a guy she’d try to get him to admit he liked her because it made her nervous and then soon after made a joke about me waiting for her to kiss me. 

i have known her for two weeks but i think i would like to pursue a relationship, how do i do this? is it too early? should i wait until after i go to her house to tell her? we are watching DVD’s together.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppn3nu/pull_the_trigger/

______________________________

Another one :) When will I learn? :D

Not today, the sixth of September.

The evening. My workplace, a large-ish corner 24/7.

- Hi! Why are you working here?

A woman. I look up. Suntanned, late twenties - early thirties, clothing a bit ragged, a stuffed leather backpack and a stuffed plastic bag with clothes visible at the top, probably arrived home from a vacation to the station nearby. She is pretty by general standards and I don't find her unattaractive either.

- Why wouldn't I?

- You look too intellectual.

- The glasses maybe?

[Laughs.]

- No, you just stick out.

We continue talking, ending up on two sides of a waist-high freezer. I tell her about inheriting shortly after the end of highschool, not having to work, being unable to decide what to study, living the sweet NEET lifestyle, then running out, having to work, choosing this place as a quick temporary solution, growing to like it and staying. My possible mental issues and the family trait of being social outsiders as likely reasons for fitting in and sticking out at the same time.

It's unusual. I often talk with customers about various topics, mostly their life. Also about scifi novels with the perpetually stoned dad, tv-series with the guy whose glasses make his eyes look like frogs', or action films with the guy whose Aliens tee prompted me to ask his liking order of the series and who hadn't seen Heat so I recommended it. But mostly their life. The unusual thing is she lets me talk instead of pouring on me. Turns out she is some kind of journalist, interested in characters, how certain types of people look, behave and live very much like each other all over the world.

I start to cite Z., the shift's main cashier as a counterexample. You'd think he is a toothless prole because he looks the part, but he is much more, and a great guy. Before I could elaborate on his carpe diem personality, his antics, his punny wordplay phonecase-decor collages made from brand signs and slogans cut out of carton packaging, his zen paired with gallows humor, she jumps to the new hire cleaning nearby (and looking a bit unhappy about me slacking).

- Ok, I'm almost certain she is lesbian.

I can't disagree (I later asked and she is bi, has gender dysphoria but does not identify as trans, also she found customer hot).

She later recalls a night cashier (M. is quite a character too, I mention) letting her take some patisserie products that would have to be written off in the morning anyway for free one night, asks when our shift change is and if she'll be in tonight. Asks if I work tomorrow. I don't know, we are understaffed so our store manager only finalized the week's schedule today and I was too busy to check it yet.

We talk some more, eventually getting to how she thinks sex creates a bond between people. I try to disagree, wanting to say maybe sex isn't special in that regard, when she cuts me off.

- But you don't date much, right?

She is right, but the abrupt change in her tone paired with my being somewhat annoyed by her self-assuredness breaks the flow, so I notice it's well about time to start a mandated administrative process. I excuse myself and go to the front. She keeps loitering in the back. I check the schedule, M.'ll be in, I won't work tomorrow.

We finish the process, I man the checkout to wait for M.'s arrival. Customer comes forth after a few other ones. While sweeping the stuff she brought, I tell her M'll be in and I won't.

- Ah, I won't wait for her.

- ...

- Did you hear what I said? [Nods to the back.]

- Yes.

- ...

- ...

- Ok, bye! [Winks and leaves.]

Oh. She wanted me to ask her out. Sigh. I enjoyed the conversation, I would've been willing to continue, walking around town with drinks after my shift. I didn't dislike her either, nobody's perfect, it could have developed into anything. **So why? Would she lose face not doing this social dance?**

TLDR: customer looking for D, was out of stock.

I don't know if this subreddit really is the most suitable place to post my story to, but I couldn't think of a better one. Here is a straight example from C., the other night cashier: He's sweeping a woman's stuff. Repeated sustained eye-contact. He is thinking of asking for her number. End of transaction. She says ""Yes, I'd have given you my number if you asked."" and leaves.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppnt67/you_dont_date_much_right/

56,ppoul8,1631835736,I made my ex block me - Now I feel like a monster,"’ll try to keep it simple. A year ago I met a girl who made me crazy by all means. I had a long history of depression and after a long battle with that and several life events I thought I was getting my reward, because we were compatible to the bone.    

But I was wrong.    

After some time she started being obsessed with her ex and kicked me out of her house twice, I couldn’t hear from her for two weeks, then surprised me by coming to my house with a gift and a wonderful letter where she said she would always be there for me. Well, problem solved? No, just the beginning of the end.    

She didn’t want to spend more than a couple of hours a week with me, I tried to convince her kindly in any way possible but eventually I had to quit her.    

Story over? No, I couldn’t stop thinking about her, I was torn by my decision, she returned to her ex in the meantime while I was suffering badly.    

Luckily I found after sone little time another girl, we got engaged in October and surprisingly things worked out really well. But, the thought of my “summer adventure” kept tearing me apart. I had a lot of questions to ask her, I wanted to know how she was and come to good terms with her in a friendly way. But she didn’t answer me. And that made me feel even worse.    

I tried everything, talking to friends and family, seeking help from my psychologist, nothing seemed to work.    

Sone days ago my doctor told me to write to her even if she wasn’t answering me and didn’t even put the read flag on her message.    

So I started a “NiceGuyish” unilateral conversation with her, pushing her in that I needed some answers about why she chose me and why she is not talking to me anymore even if she promised to and I tried to reach out as a friend.    

When I grew devastated and tired, an idea got in my mind.    

I told her “I am going to burn your letter, no, I am going to go to your next gig and burn it in front of you, collect the ashes and keep them to remember me to stay away from crazy bipolar girls because they remember my former self to me”.    

And then she blocked me.  

Now, this was a bluff, I save every memory even the painful ones, but I realised it was not possible to let her go in any other way, believe me I have tried a whole year, and I wanted to preserve what I collected last year. Still, I feel like shit because I touched her on a weak spot, one that I share with her.

After a month or so, he just very suddenly realized that we can't do this anymore and he stopped talking to me right away. That was heartbreaking enough, but there was more to come.

After 2 weeks or so, I realized he has found a new date, and I also found out they're really ""clicking"". That was the word he used to use about me too. After a month he posted about how he has found his soulmate ""for the first time in his life"" and how he had never seen any girl like him and how all his previous partners have been toxic and blah blah. 

I noticed he's describing that girl just like she used to do for me. He said she's her first love, but he said that to me too.

We really hit it off from the beginning.  We went on 2-3 dates a week, some going to dinner and some just hanging out. We seemed to really be hitting it off and getting along good. 

Then i went to the beach one Saturday with my daughter. He knew we were going. Then, without notice, he just appeared at the beach. He said he wanted to surprise us. But he stayed only about 30 minutes and then left. While he was there, a young man, maybe around 19/20 (could have even been 18) started talking to my daughter, who is 16. After they stopped talking, my daughter told us that the guy was way too old for her. I thought nothing else of it.  (My friend showing up seemed a bit stalkerish to me, honestly, btw.)

Anyway. My friend, after the beach trip, started having less and less to say to me. I was confused, but my job and life keep me busy, so I had assumed he was busy too. 

Then he went radio silent. 

Then out of nowhere, i got a text from him. He felt he needed to explain why he had stopped pursuing ""us"". 

He told me that because my daughter ""seemed disgusted"" by the young man who was a few years older than her, that i must be disgusted by him too because he is older than me. 

Im sorry. What?!??!

1) I don't even know his age. 
2) i am almost 50....not a 16 year old. 
3) once again, WHAT?

I’m a naturally possessive person, so I easily get jealous. I’m trying to find a way around that, especially since my boyfriend has his own gbf. 

It does appear as if my boyfriend has begun to keep a little distance from her ever since we started dating, but it’s hard to say due to the pandemic’s limitations. He’s even offered to give me all his account passwords, but I said no to that — I might be toxic, but I’m not THAT toxic. 

I’m a solid believer of the saying, ‘If you’re not his best friend, then why bother?’ And he tells me I’m his best friend too. However, I also know he used to like her, back before he and I even met, and they’re still close up ‘til now. I don’t really know what to feel about that still; I mean I like her, she’s kind, and she’s absolutely gorgeous, with her own boyfriend (though they’re constantly on-and-off, and when they’re off it’s usually up to my boyfriend to scold / comfort / advise her.)

It just bothers me a little. Okay, maybe a lot, especially when he just springs up some random fact about her or I see them in a group chat 100% comfortable with each other. Some advice might help on that front too. 

We’ve discussed about it briefly before, and he only said that what’s past is past, and then left it at that. Should I talk to him about it again, or can I simply just swallow down the occasional jealousy?

67,pppqok,1631839075,Need tips on approaching attractive women in a bar setting.,"So I’ve got everything else nailed. 

-Hair cut and styled nicely
-cologne on point
-fresh and well fitted clothing
-working out a lot more, feel good about body
-good job and own my home, feeling independent and confident. 

I feel like I’m just right about where I need to be when it comes to having my life together. Except when it comes to dating and most of all approaching women that I find attractive. 

I’ve done OLD but I honestly don’t like it. It takes too long and I actually want to work on my social skills and rather go out and possibly meet or even just get a number. 

The problem is that I walk into a bar, I feel good about myself. I’m confident and happy. Ready to enjoy a night of music and possible banter. Thing is, I always go out alone. So I have no choice but to approach people and talk to them in order to have any types of conversations. This isn’t too bad, usually I can talk to a guy or so or a woman that I don’t really have an eye for. 

The issue happens when I see a woman who I do fancy and find attractive. For some reason everything stops working. Brain goes into this anxiety and deprecating mode. I start seeing her as “out of my league” and I simply never approach. I don’t have a problem with rejection. I can take it with stride. But I have a problem where I feel I can’t even go up to her. I start to hesitate and feel like I’m not good enough or look attractive enough to her. 

The other issue is that I don’t even if she wants me to approach. I pretty never catch anyone looking at me or smiling or anything. I look around a decent amount when I’m enjoying the night. Not a lot but a good amount where I probably would’ve noticed someone. So I’m kind of left to just approach and hope for the best. Which sucks because I get this anxiety and start to psyche myself out. 

I’m just curious about how anyone with experience would go about it in this kind of scenario. I’m pretty introverted but I’m working on my social skills. I’m doing fine with random guys and women who I don’t fancy but when it’s someone who’s attractive then I kinda go blank. 

I’ve read getting cigarettes is a good idea at bars because going outside for a smoke is kinda of a small social thing in of itself.  But I don’t want to smoke just to interact.  Especially since I’m working out and just joined a kickboxing course I’m having fun with. 

So how or what can I do to approach a woman I find attractive at a bar that hasn’t really shown me signals?

Another thing is I feel like I should probably get more friends to go out with. Lots of women go out with friends and I’m starting to feel a bit out of place being their alone with nobody to talk to half the time. I do have friends but they’re very socially awkward and don’t flirt or interact with women at all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pppqok/need_tips_on_approaching_attractive_women_in_a/

71,ppq66a,1631840737,It worked,"Oh my god. I can't believe it. I had a date with her. How did that happen.

Okay the story is actually kind of long but because I am feeling so excited right now, I really need to tell the world what happened. Here it goes.

So back to school beginning of September. I enter a master of maths. This master gathers all kind of schools and universities which are located in a certain area, which is I think a great way to enable relations between different institutions. I think to myself, that might be a good opportunity to meet someone. 

Now, you have to understand that in maths studies, there are basically really just a few girls. Last year they were 3 beyond ~25 students. So I never found someone for whom I had a first sight crush on in maths. In fact, the last times I had crushes like those were in middle school, so almost 10 years ago, and each time the girl happened to be quite mean, which each time I understood too late.

I had only 2 relationships, one of which lasted almost 3 years. These were constructed after long friendships, so not first sight crush, which I didn't really believe in after my experiences in middle school.

But that day. I clearly remember. The moment I saw here, and I know it's silly, and that never happened to me before, but I thought to myself ""I'm gonna marry that girl"", just like in Good Will Hunting. I couldn't help but think that, knowing full well that was bullshit. I guess that shows how serious I was. She was absolutely stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. And when she started speaking, I felt like a kid, I felt helpless. She was always smiling, making jokes, she was interesting, smart. I could not believe it. 

There was 2 days of back to school for our master, and I knew I wouldn't see her afterward because we didn't have any course in common, and don't live in the same area (though very close). During 2 days, we barely spoke alone, so I didn't feel like asking her out on the spot. So I didn't.

I thought about her. A lot. I thought to myself ""she's way out of my league"", ""she must have a boyfriend"". I tried to just forget her. Some friends told me to message her on facebook but I said I'd feel like a stalker. But yesterday almost 2 weeks later, I talked about it with a really close friend of mine, and he told me to do it. I was just expecting her to not respond, or say no, or say that she didn't remember me. Nonetheless, I sent a message, today, with no expectation whatsoever. 

15 minutes later and she answers ""yes absolutely ! Are you free tonight or tomorrow?""

Oh my lord I never felt so happy and stressed out at the same time. 

So I took my courage and answered yes to tonight. And it was wonderful. She is amazing. She is just so great. It's really too soon to say that I love her, and it's completely stupid, but I think it's what I'm feeling.

So why not just say something along the lines of ""Hey I am not feeling it. I would not like to continue this. Btw please don't take this as an invitation to ask me further. I will block your number because I am afraid of dealing with confrontation."" It is direct and goes straight to the point. At least the other person does not have to guess if they got ghosted or the person is being busy hence they don't get any messages. Whether the other person's gets way too upset or not is on them. And you won't have to deal with any of their outbursts in you blocked their number already.

But then again, people who ghost usually the care about the feelings of other people. They probably just enjoy making the other person feel like shit cause it puts them in a position of power. I mean if you are scared of people getting violent, don't ya think ghosting would make them angrier?

78,ppqn5l,1631842502,"32M Never been on a date, Need Advice","So, yeah as the title says... I'm 32M and I've never been on a date or been intimate with a girl before. I was wondering, would this be picked up as a red flag for women? I'll provide some context to maybe elaborate a little bit to how I got to this point. 

So, back to high-school me, I was always the pretty shy and anxious type chubby/fat kid. Did ok in school, not great. Close circle of friends and so on. I was very much interested in girls back then but I never got the courage to ask anyone out or anything and honestly just lacked confidence.

Fast forward a couple of years after high school graduation, I decide to study Computer Science. It turns out that about 99% of my classmates were men so I didn't have much interaction with women at all during this time. I'm not the party type guy, so I never put myself in the position to actually meet new people and so on.

Anyways, so in summary 1st half of my 20s was me worrying about what to do in life and what my future was gonna be like. I dropped CS career after about 2 years and tried to learn a trade. Did that for about 4 years ( studying &amp; working in said trade ) but I eventually landed back into CS to pursue once more that path. During this time, I  became a full time web developer and started working in the field and slowly becoming independent. Unfortunately shit happens and basically I became the sole bread winner in my family ( mom and 2 older brothers  ) so this brought a new source of stress, income &amp; finances. So this turned my 2nd half of my 20s in worrying about increasing my income ( first job wasn't that great of a salary. Barely got to cover the bills ) and finishing my university degree. Again, during this time I didn't party or go out much, aside form the occasional get together with 2-3 friends. I mostly spent my time with university, work and/or hobbies ( games, movies, etc ).

I think at this point, its fair to say that I've been mostly a very lonely person throughout my life and I've been ok with that for most of it. I admit to myself that I never actively pursued to be in a relationship ( mix of reasons from shyness, doubt, low confidence, etc ). However as of late, this has changed quite drastically. Ever since the pandemic happened, ironically my work life and financial position has been improved by almost 10x. I'm in such a great financial position and this alone has lifted a lot of the old burdens that I felt to the point that I've started to ""worry"" about other aspects of my life. For the first time in my life, I've been able to set a more or less clear target and goal of what I want to be and accomplish. I've started to take care of myself. Lost 20lbs already in about 2 months, still have a long way to go, but with time I'll get there. I continually trying to learn new things, thinking about getting in a much better physical condition for health and looks, and overall I'd say that I'm just trying to be better every day. 

So...., this brings me back to dating. I've started to think about this more and more and now I'm worried that my lack of experience with women ( basically 0 ), is now going to get in the way considering I'm 32 years old.

What advice would you give me? Am I overthinking this too much?

82,ppr0eu,1631843930,Need advice - has he lost interest?,"So I went on two dates with this guy while I was home visiting my parents. I live 5 hours away but we agreed to go out anyways and see what happens. The two dates were really fun, and we had some deep conversations. We did end up sleeping together both nights but I knew in the back of my head I was going home so I was prepared not to see him again for a bit/not take things that seriously. We left saying we really enjoyed our time together and I would let him know when I was home next which I said would be within the month.

When I left we started messaging for a week straight through Instagram - sending voice notes and videos, texts. He actually said he wanted to come up to visit me and implied it would be within a couple weeks. Then boom one night after I replied to his last message, he read it and didn’t reply. I sent another quick video message after not hearing from him for 3 days. Saw and didn’t reply.

Now it’s been a week and I don’t know where I stand but most likely can guess he’s lost internet or perhaps he’s thinking more about the distance. I was debating actually texting him instead of an Instagram message but I don’t want to be left on read again.

Ultimately I am just sick of chasing men for replies but I don’t want to look crazy after two dates.

85,ppr8f0,1631844732,Should I give him a chance? Is it too late anyway?,"Been seeing this guy for 3 months. I was looking for something casual but I caught feelings. We always joked about not looking for commitment so I didn’t think he felt that way about me, and I didn’t think we were long term compatible so today, after I told him when I could see him next, I noticed he didn’t really respond to a text where I was being emotionally vulnerable and I just kind of felt “done”, knowing that this wouldn’t go anywhere. 

In decision spurred by emotion (usually Id wait until I’m calmer but I was worried I would backtrack and end up getting dragged along because I struggle to let go) I told him I actually couldn’t see him, something came up, that the last time I saw him was going to be the last anyway, and that I wouldn’t forget the summer we spent together. 

He was understandably confused, asked why, and I explained:

1. This would never go anywhere anyway so I didn’t have many doubts about calling it off
2. Relationship felt a bit one sided - always on his terms about when and where to meet up - and that, yes, I was a bit disappointed by his lack of reaction to me opening up to him and I felt it only further exemplified the divide between us

3. I admitted I had feelings for him. I also said that he “wasn’t longterm material for me” but even knowing that it was hard to continue to see him and I found it a “waste of emotional energy”

His reply really surprised me. I expected him to be like “damn that sucks so much I’ll miss you” but instead he was like 

“I’m sorry I didn’t respond better” and gave a very compelling reason as to why and a thoughtful analysis of why he responded the way he did - essentially he was busy, texting while driving on his way to back to back meetings, wanted to respond rather than make me wait for 6 hours but didn’t have the time or capacity to be thoughtful with everything going on. He admitted it wasn’t a sufficient response and he really appreciated what I sent him 

Then he said he was surprised I didn’t think we were compatible long term and seemed hurt by that. Tbh I still don’t think we are - maybe it’s more that I don’t trust him - but I’m not sure I’m independent enough to have a partner like him. I’m very independent but… I think he needs someone next level who *really* doesn’t need a traditional partner 

Essentially we still ended it. He never said he cared about me but he would say he cared about the situation. He cared enough to apologize for being in a meeting and not responding sooner which he never does and I never cared anyway 

I feel like it would be super whiplash and unstable to tell him I regret my decision - I just think if I’m looking for a long term relationship he’s not the most secure option out there given his history. Even the way he talked today. It wasn’t “I care about *you*” it was “I care about you leaving” or “I care about the situation”. He never said “I want something long term” he would say “we have fun all the time yet you don’t think we are a long term match?” 

I’m going to give it a few days of space regardless, I thought this would end eventually anyway since we always said it would but now I’m not sure - I feel more secure knowing he apparently cares too. But I also worry maybe I’m just afraid of letting go of someone who I like but isn’t my person",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppr8f0/should_i_give_him_a_chance_is_it_too_late_anyway/

87,pprcdh,1631845143,I can't bring myself to go on dates.,"Over the past few years, I've developed a really bad habit of agreeing to go on dates/hanging out with people and then never following through or cancelling at the last minute. 

Prior to the start of my last relationship in March 2019, I would sometimes follow through with the dates. Most of these were just single dates but a few times I did ""date"" for a few weeks. That last relationship did last for several months but ended in December of that year. 

I primarily meet people on dating apps. Usually we'll have short conversations that are just a few things back and forth. Eventually the topic of meeting in person will come up and I'll always say that I'm down. Sometimes plans are made and other times the idea is just suggested. I've never asked someone on a date myself, though. If we do end up scheduling something, I'll already know in my head that I'm going to cancel. 

I've been on and off the apps since my last relationship. After canceling a few dates, I'll usually start to feel guilty and I'll delete. Then after a few weeks or months, I'll get lonely and re download them. I do want a relationship but for some reason when I start thinking about going on dates, I start to feel indifferent. A lot of times I can't even picture myself in a relationship with the people I schedule dates with.

89,pprg7h,1631845548,Is it too corny/shallow to add dating apps pictures exclusively from international trips?,"So I'm a 24 years old guy. I just finished my postgraduate degree &amp; summer internship, and also signed a full-time contract with a decent firm. I never had friends/girlfriends or any kind of social life. Always been too ugly, too depressed, and too poor. Lost so much weight during the pandemic, and though I was satisfied with my body, everything was just so stressful going through grad school. I made a few friends but they all had already built their cliques and to them I was disposable and transient. So coming out of grad school meant 6 consecutive years of studying and working nonstop, while not affording any kind of ""fun"" whatsoever. Eventually it paid off career wise - and I'm genuinely thankful for what I've accomplished.

With the summer internship money, I planned a trip solo. I visited 6 different cities (selectively, bc of renewed lockdowns) that I have always wanted to visit and took god-tier pictures in each one. I just got back home and started to set up dating apps profiles. I'm trying to gauge how generally it'd be perceived if I put all my pictures from those cities - pictures near famous attractions. Is it too pretentious, shallow, corny, smug-ish.. etc? 

If it matters, I'm slightly above average looking guy, 6ft &amp; 156lbs. I don't have an old photo stock because I hated how I looked (mind you I was 230lbs). Lmk what you think",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pprg7h/is_it_too_cornyshallow_to_add_dating_apps/
90,pprmho,1631846224,Really weird dating experience,"So there’s this girl that I (18M) had been into for quite some time. A couple of weeks ago, I finally worked up the courage to tell her and asked her to meet up for drinks. She agreed, and we met about a week ago… it went pretty well I thought, so I asked her to meet up again. She agreed and we met up for a second time, which was today. However, today was a bit different… she seemed very quiet and uninterested. The whole time I thought I was doing something wrong since there wasn’t a lot of conversation happening… I tried asking questions and engaging in conversation, which were usually just met with one word answers or clearly uninterested responses.

She’s definitely not interested, which I’m totally fine with…however, what’s crazy is that I found out that she’s had a boyfriend this whole time…to be completely honest, I don’t really care and am kind of glad that this whole thing will be over. I just find it really weird that she would agree to meet me twice and not once mention the fact that she had a boyfriend…

To be fair, I’m kind of a shy person and not a great conversationalist…but I wasn’t given a whole lot to work with. Also, this was really my first time trying serious dating. It just seems like such a waste of my time… two weeks worth of thinking I had a potential relationship only to find out she’s with someone else…
