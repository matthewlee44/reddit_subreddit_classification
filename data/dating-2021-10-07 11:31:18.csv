3,q3dlf3,1633626297,Why do some people send mixed signals?,"Sorry for the long post 

Ok so I (20m)  met this girl (19f) on a dating app. She was super cute and we talked for a little bit. I got the vibe that she was not into me (took long to respond, kind of a dry texter \[usually late at night though\]). But I asked for her snapchat anyways and she gave it to me at like 11pm on a Saturday. Come Sunday morning, she adds me back and sends me a picture in a DutchBros t-shirt and continues to tell me that she works there and that I should stop by and get a coffee from her (I was raised Mormon so coffee isn't really my fav, but I figured Id try it out anyway haha). I showed up when she said to and she was super happy and surprised that I actually showed up. I parked my car in the drive through for 5 min and talked to her, but the cars started honking at me so I had to move. 

I then talk to her for a little while on snapchat (maybe another week or so) and I got weird signals that she was into me, but my intuition disagreed. I do not understand some of the unspoken rules that people have with texting and/or snapchatting (the meaning of a double text or what it means to leave someone on read for 30 min and then respond). I prefer to communicate in person and I tend to stay away from reading into the mechanics behind a message or any strange interpretations of it. I got to know her pretty well and after about a week I ask her for her number thinking that it is a little more personal to text rather than snapchat. 

She starts to get a little dry with her messages so I play hard to get and don't respond for like an entire day. She comes running back and starts to text me a lot. So I decide to ask her out thinking she's got to be interested bc she coulda ghosted me several times by now if she wanted to especially because there were several times where I ended the convo dry and she would text me and start a new one. She basically says ""I would love to but I'm super busy with work and then I'm going to a hockey game."" From what I've understood, if a girl does not try to set up another time, she does not want to go out, but I think maybe she's shy. After all she didn't say no right? 

So I ask if there's another time that she is free but I make sure to make it not seem like a HUGE deal. Realistically I just wanted to meet this girl IRL and see if there is any actual chemistry there. she says that she'll ""let me know!!!"" but that she is ""really sorry for being so busy!!!"" I had realized that she's probs not into me at this point. Double rejection (not in a mean way, but if she was into me she would have at least tried to make something happen right?) So out of respect/mild disappointment, I just say its not a big deal and I start to move on to other girls that I was talking to. We don't text at all for 2 days and then she hits me up randomly and tries to start a convo about facetiming. She then avoided FTing me and left me on read for two days. Then she responds and says ""I'm so sorry i just saw this"" 

I'm so confused. I am just trying to get to know some people and if its a love connection, so be it. Why would someone refuse to go out with or even facetime you, but then want to continue talking and flirt with you?

7,q3dv0f,1633627038,"define ""work on yourself""","People on this sub, other forums, and every where else dating /relationship related, people love to throw this sentence around as a catch all advice instead of being specific on what the OP should fix... it's BS advice. If I have questions, (which I do) answer them, and don't beat round the bush without giving the specific Advice requested....

Heres how I'm ""working on myself"" I hit the gym 5-6 days a week, 1.5h at a time, I do my own hobbies, follow my own passions, have a good paying job, I'm passionate about my career. I have read men's fashion magazines, and shopped accordingly. I have trimmed my facial hair to suit my style (as much as I hate beards, I have one now).... I also try to push myself out of my comfort zone &amp; talk to women, saying things I never would have in the past because I am apparently, ""too much like a friend"" to women 


3 months in, why isn't any of these major ""rebrandings"" of my physique, character, and appearance working???? According to reddit &amp; other subs, by doing all this working on myself, women should be queuing up at my door, and everyone else who ""works on themselves"". Cause it's made out like all that is a magical cure that will give you confidence, looks, and everything else that supposed to be attractive physically, mentally, and emotionally.

And don't say ""be patient, and the right one will come"".. no. That advice only works if you'd a woman, because men DO the approaching. In my 27 years of life, I have never seen or heard of a woman approaching a man for any sexual or romatic reason.

It's really taking its toll on me mentally. All these major changes with the prospect of maybe yielding some results, and nothing....Mentally, it's a struggle to find motivation to keep going. The only reason I'm even still carrying on with my life in any motivation to continue ""work on myself"" is me &amp; some friends are planning a trip to Las Vegas next year. This should be the easiest place in the world to attract female attention if your even remotely attractive. If I put my head down &amp; stay the course, maybe just 1 woman will like me for who I am by the time the vacation comes and like me for who I am, not just what I can provide or bring to the table.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3dv0f/define_work_on_yourself/

It’s been about 2 months now. From the beginning, he has always taken ages to respond to texts (especially on weekdays when he’s working). But he’s always been eager and enthusiastic to meet. He’s great in person. 

In the beginning, it would take him a few hours to reply. Which was fine, because I tend to take a few hours to reply too (I don’t like getting into long conversations over text). 

Over the past few weeks, he would take a few days to reply. 24-48 hours. The first time he replied after two days, I acted cold after, and he apologised and said that things had been really busy and he always missed messages. 

I recently sent him another message yesterday afternoon asking how he was. It’s been over 24 hours. 

To be fair, he does have a very demanding job. He works in the movie industry and the director is always asking for updates on scenes, even on weekends and late nights whenever I’ve stayed over at his place. On top of that, he’s a bit ‘famous’ for his work, he tends to get lots of messages and emails for advice and interviews, so I get that he misses messages sometimes. 

He’s told me that he’s been depressed regarding work, but I don’t know if that’s any excuse to put up with this behaviour. I usually wouldn’t, but I know he works 14-16 hours a day in general so I get that he’s tired.

38,q3gwqz,1633635722,I(27F) not sure where we stand (27M) after 2 months “dating”. I don’t want to give him an ultimatum but I’m way too anxious the way this is.,"Hey, so I was having dates with this guy. He was my neighbor at the beach place I was living at while I renovated my city home 80 miles away. He also has a home at the city.

We had a very light and balanced approach to texting and making date plans. Often but not too much. 

We both acted like we cared about each other. Also we have good chemistry.

But since 2 weeks ago I can’t go to the beach and he needs to work from there (won’t get in to why but its an equipment reason for now).

Since the last time we saw each other his work demands have improved. He’s initiating conversation less. I know work is a valid reason but my intuition is that he would find a way to send something eventually when he had a few minutes free.

My anxiety is bad and a lot goes through my mind. Maybe he’s not into me. He was never serious with any girl and I’m thinking he might have commitment issues. Or its because I make more money and might move away to another city in the next semestre and his small business is here.

The anxiety went to the roof when he told me this monday he spent this weekend at the city to go to his friend’s farewell party. Its ok he didnt invite me, but he had another free night here and didnt say nothing. We had discussed that he would come check my new house someday.

I’m going to the beach this Friday and I want to know where we stand and if we are still a thing.

I don’t want to pressure him, I just need clarity to know if I should move on and focus on other people.

I always sabotaged relationships whenever I fell the person was drifting away like this. I would break up or disconnect completely. But once I did this and the person had a valid reason and I regret, I don’t want to sabotage. 

How can I talk to him about this without sounding like an ultimatum but being clear I need consistency and honesty?

53,q3iero,1633640040,Something feels off and I need your input! Am I crazy?,"Hello guys,

I'm 19, she's 22

The past few days I have been having a lot of difficulties with my relationship, and I have been feeling so stuck and overwhelmed. For context, I do suffer from anxiety and have a pretty heavy trauma background, so that is one thing that is important to note, so part of the problem may be me. I am in therapy. We've been together since March 2020, and we met September 2019.

When she and I met in September 2019, it was good. She and I hit it off well, and shared many similar interests, perspectives, beliefs and views. She was older than me at the time (and I was still in high school while she went to the local state college).

Two months later, she invited me to her painting showcase where she showed her elaborate designs.   On the bus there, I felt sick to my stomach. That was the day I fell in love with her, but something felt off. I remember thinking about her age or imagining her kissing me and I felt repulsed; I even thought about the age dynamics. But that's the day I fell in love with her oddly enough, and I was hooked ever since.

On the day of her birthday, I was excited to see her, but I felt a sense of emptiness afterwards for some reason. I was really starting to fall for her and the hints of interest continued (our shared Apple Music playlist that she would listen to often, inviting me to her class three times, her being very smiley, sending me her schedule, agreeing to what I called a date, saying I love you too in a text message, inviting me to other performances). And she was very very aggressive about me going to her class too (or assertive). I remember, though, being weirded out by her telling me she prefers to text so that she can ""keep a record of everything."" Aside from that, I enjoyed her company.

Well, she rejected me when I told her that I liked her and said she didn't feel the same way. I continued on as her friend, but I felt like there was more to the story.  The hints continued, she even sent me a valentine’s day. I (wrongly) looked at her Pinterest and saw love quotes. She even put love songs in our shared playlist.

Something felt really off,  and it began to feel unsafe and there was a weird sexual undercurrent where I was sexually attracted to her but because she said she didn’t have any romantic feelings, I felt guilty for having them and thus, wanted to remove myself. January 2020, I had heart palpitations so I went to the hospital. I actually ended up finding an excuse as to why we couldn't hang out and severed the connection. But then I ran into her again in person, and like an idiot, I re-initiated the connection. At this time, I spoke to a few people and they said that it's crazy and that I'm not crazy for viewing these as signs of interest. Weirdly enough, I was watching a documentary about a serial killer who killed her ex boyfriend and for some reason I felt so nauseous like I had to vomit. in that moment, I felt like I had to exit the friendship with her.

The hints continued and I made a last ditch effort to see how she felt in March 2020. I invited her to a lunch picnic. She went and was very smiley, but at the end of it she said she looked forward to continuing to be friends. I blocked her, but then I felt bad so two days later we agreed to speak to each other about what I was uncomfortable with. I told her I didn't like the mixed signals.   She admitted to liking me.

We entered a relationship March 2020, and it was good even though it was the pandemic. We had most of our calls through Zoom or Discord. In April 2020,  during our a video call when she looked out the window and at me (I felt kinda grossed out for some reason), something felty very off, she began doing eyebrow raises and eye squints. I read them as sexual so... When I asked to clarify so I didn’t mistake any sexual boundaries, she said they were just silly faces. I tried to initiate a conversation about to sex to see where she stood (we're both virgin with no relationship experience), but she was very dodgy.

I felt a shift when I stupidly played a song that had the words I love you and she reciprocated, but when I asked about it, she said that's not what she meant. So that is probably 100%% on me overthinking. Around the same time, I started battling with some very intrusive thoughts and my anxiety got worse. It's tough to say if it was the pandemic or not, but I was dealing with pretty debilitating anxiety issues that had very little to do with the relationship.

Keep this in mind, so it might have coloured my lens or perspective. May to July 2020, I was mostly initiating and I felt something off where I would go days without hearing from her if I didn’t initiate.  I saw letter for Jermaine on her computer when she was showing me a video. The explanation for the absences were that she was out with family, so maybe this is on me. Around that time, I felt good while speaking to her. We spoke about sex in July 2020, and she said she wanted to wait until she was married. Boy was I disappointed, but I went along with it too and said that yes, ""me too!"" After nearly three days of not hearing from her (aside from goodnight text messages), I broke the silence. Cases were down, and it was safe for us to see each other. So we did, and at that point we'd been together for nearly 5 months and have known each other for almost a year. So I thought that kiss would be okay right, well... WRONG!  When we saw each other, there was not touching (aside from handholding), it felt like friends.  I even thought to myself “this isn’t gonna work” I felt a pain in my chest after the kiss rejection (I asked her if she wanted to), emotional dislocation and felt unsafe. I was so disappointed, and have not been able to feel as excited ever since. I think when we walking together she was talking to herself at one point and making odd faces?  Or maybe I'm crazy.

The second time I saw her, something just felt really odd. I felt a little embarrassed by how I felt she wasn’t taking care of herself or grooming herself. She didn't seem super duper excited to see me.

August 2020, I was going to break up with her, but decided to speak things over together.  We spoke about the things I was hurt by, but I felt a little insincerity “of course I care” when I told her what she was doing made me feel like I didn’t care. The way she said that didn’t feel genuine. My friends assured me that I’m making the right choice and deserve better, they wanted me to break up with her. My mom too.

September 2020, things were better and more consistent. She was more verbally expressive and affectionate, and made more of an effort to initiate. Things have been this way since then! But then I had a pain in my chest after we said I love you (she told me she's loved me since January, same time as all of the hints) That night, I was restless and tossing and turning in bed. I feel like it was partially guilt for snooping, and asking my friends for advice about the situation and what they said. I remember one conversation that month where she talked about this experience with her friend and how she wanted to get a restraining order on them. Tbf, they were really weird and problematic, but a restraining order... I wrote these things in my journal at the time for a record.

December 2020, she texts me and tells me that we need to talk about some things. She said she felt objectified and sexualized because: I put her sim in a bikini, put a sexual song in our playlist, clicked the woohoo button in sims, talked about a sexual dream I had of her, joked about a sexual pose her bitmoji was doing, and a Hilary Clinton parody video.  I asked her about boundaries again in light of the convo and she said baby steps and we’ll get to kissing “EVENTUALLY.” My mom and grandma were furious and so annoyed, friends wanted me to break up, therapist asked me if this is what I want. I felt awful and had this urge to just escape and run away so fast. I was upset, but also felt unsafe, like a fight or flight response similar to January 2020 and March 2020.

Around that time is when conversations about the future between us started. We would talk alot about and that would make my mom uncomfortable, especially because she felt I was too young. At that point, it was pretty clear my mom was not in support of our relationship and I overheard my mom and grandma speaking about what they do not like about our relationship.

April 2021, she alluded to sex, but changed tune once I reminded her of her values, she was dodgy with answers when I asked for firm boundaries (theme over time). Does not want any form of sexual touching or nudity, I couldn’t sleep that night 4:30am to 10am because I felt so awful. I also felt my sense of reality shift because I felt like ""wait, I know what I heard."" I thought about leaving the relationship then, but I thought it would have been selfish. I had heart palpitations and went to the hospital a few days later.

When we saw each other June 2021, we kissed for the first time. To be fair, we had only seen each other 4 times prior last summer due to the pandemic.

July 2021, we had a conversation about sex and over the course of several weeks here is what I remember was said.   ""Wants to taste my honey, Admits to masturbating, Wants my hands on her body; Lots of sexual fantasies; Wants to taste the fires of my soul; Said we may need somewhere not private; That I’m not ready for Tuesday; That we’re gonna make an explosion; Wants to be sexually intimate; not sure if wise (**I left it there and did not push further when she said this**); Lip licking; Pressing touch against cheek; Lip biting; Very receptive to the very sexually explicit things I was saying to her; echoed it; Wants to rain down on me; Wants to envelop me; Wants to her honey to come down on me and be all wet and sticky ; Was very comfortable with everything that’s happened so far; came when I was dry humping her; Asked if I was hard; Said we will need a bigger blanket; I asked her what she wants me to do and she said open her legs and I said and then what…she said hmmm; She asked me what I should do to her and I said to run her hands down my chest and she then said and then what and I said in my pants; Was receptive to me saying I want to cum on her chest ; Said I’ll hear her moan on Monday; Really liked when I said I will make her vaginal fluids run down her leg; It’s okay to run my fingers down her chest; It’s okay to lick near and in between her legs; I want to taste your lips, and then I responded “I want to taste your lips…both!”

I documented all of that after, just so that I don't feel crazy right. Well, things progressed shortly after to nudity and fingering, and she was comfortable with the idea of me going down on her.

Well, yesterday she asked what I define as sex and if I still see oral sex as sex, then we should hold that off because she still wants to wait until marriage (due to pregnancy). This includes oral sex (due to potential for STIs). So my question for you Reddit, is would it be wrong to leave a relationship over no sex ? She asked me if I could wait and that ""if it doesn't happen, are you out?"" I said I can wait, but now I don't want to, which makes me want to leave the relationship over this incompatibility. But I don't want to leave I had an exit plan, but after speaking to her yesterday, my feelings of wanting to leave completely vanished. After the call I said ""I'm never getting out of here?""

Not only that, overall I feel pretty uneasy.  The things from earlier in the relationship give me pause. The fact that she doesn't really ask me questions or move the relationship forward emotionally bothers me. In light of yesterday's conversation, I now feel like I have to be extra careful about what I say again because I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable sexually.

I'm wondering if maybe I'm wrong here and that I'm just everything, but I can't shake this uncomfortable feeling that something feels wrong. I've had it for a long time. On one hand, she's an amazing partner and very kind, supportive and generous with her time. There are over a hundred things that I can list that she has done that has been loving and kind. And yes, I do love her very much in spite of everything. On the other hand, there are all of these seemingly weird things that make me question my sanity. When I last saw her, the conversation was muted, when I met her parents, they were nice but I sort of felt ignored by her, and I notice that she isn't as warm to me as other people are to me. Maybe I did something wrong. I have asked her and she said no and that she is very happy with us.

I bought my ex boyfriend concert tickets last Christmas which ended up being cancelled due to covid. We broke up in April, it was mutual and no hard feelings. I had totally forgotten about them until I got email saying that it would be rescheduled for the same dates this January and that the tickets purchased would be valid for entry. 

We’ve not spoke since May but it’s his birthday next month and as we didn’t leave things on a bad note I was thinking I should send him a happy birthday message as he’ll be turning the big 30, but thought about forwarding him on the tickets also seeing as they were a gift for him to begin with. 
 I’d like to see them used even if won’t be me going with him. I’m not sure if this is the right or wrong thing to do? 
Men, would you appreciate it or rather just not hear from your ex at all ? (Even I’d break up was mutual)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3j1py/would_you_give_him_the_concert_tickets_after/
60,q3j31r,1633641928,Girl I met on Discord,"&gt;!English is not my native language, so bear with me.!&lt;

Okay so,

I've met this girl around a year ago in a Discord server. For context, it was a sort of game community server, and we both (and still are) moderators there. We started chatting here and there. It really picked up around early December, and we chatted and called daily, often into late hours. At this point I think I already fell kind of in love with her. In march we added each other on snapchat. We didnt really used snapchat much in the beginning. Some snaps here and there, and mostly chats. After some time  we got that yellow heart thingy. She sometimes sent me a cute snap, like really sometimes. And I think we now have that super BFF heart for around 2.5-3 months. However, recently I noticed that we lost a bit of contact. We still chat and call daily, but like it feels different. Especially because I think there is a ""new guy"" in the picture. I know, I sound really jealous. And when I send her a message it feels like she doesn't want to talk to me, or doesn't want a message from me. She answers really short and uninterested. This only happens in the evening when that ""new guy"" is online. But in the morning she always sends me a (voice)message. I just don't know what to do, or what to think. Am I paranoid and too jealous, or am I just overreacting. 

And yes, I really would like to tell her how I feel about her. But I'm just afraid she doesn't feel the same way, and that it'll end/harm the friendship. Or that I am just too late, because of that ""new guy"".

61,q3j4b6,1633642038,Biggest mistake I made early on in dating,"This is something that a lot of people with low self-esteem and/or no experience do: you're so laser focused on getting someone, or anyone to like you, that once you find a person that does, you dive head-first into a relationship with them. For the love of god, please try to slow down evaluate them as much as you think they're evaluating you. If you aren't, you're leaving yourself wide open to getting involved with someone that is fundamentally incompatible with you, or worse, a total scumbag. Coming from a place a desperation, it's really easy to get in the mindset of, ""if it doesn't work out here, who knows if I'll ever have another shot?""

I can tell you from personal experience that once the veneer of being wanted by someone wears off, being in a relationship with the wrong person can me much worse than being alone and desperate. That's not to say that you should date someone because they like - by all means, go for it and enjoy the experience.

67,q3k02r,1633644749,Should I (22F) express romantic interest? Or is it clear he (27M) just wants to be friends?,"So I met this guy a month or so ago while we were both in a hospital due to being depressed (lol). He's in law school and I'm on leave from school right now, but working in neuroscience research. 

We both have pretty bad social anxiety, and are generally quiet and shy, but one day in the hospital, I overcame my anxiety and sat with him at a table in the dining room. We ended up talking for hours. We continued to talk every day until he was discharged. Before he left, he gave me his phone number and email address and told me to make sure to text him. I did. We've continued to text basically every day since then, but we usually take a while responding to each other. Like I'll respond to him in the evening/afternoon, then he won't respond until the following morning, and then I won't respond until the evening/afternoon, and so on. He's said many times that he's very busy and often overwhelmed with his studies.

When I was in the hospital, a couple girls around our age told me, unprompted, that they thought that he liked me, based on the way he was interacting with me and asking me so many questions about myself. But I'm a bit more skeptical. Maybe he just wants to be friends. He hasn't initiated any in-person meet ups, but always asks me a bunch of questions about my life over text and continues the conversation.

 A week ago, I suggested we get a meal, so we ended up getting dinner together at a Mexican restaurant. He looked nice and well-groomed and was wearing a button-down shirt. It did feel like a date. Despite the fact that I'm the one who initiated the dinner, he said that the dinner was his belated birthday present to me and paid for the meal. Afterwards, he said he really enjoyed the evening and that he'd like to come to my housewarming party, which is happening in a week. But he hasn't suggested that we do anything else together since then, and when I texted him last weekend asking if he wanted to come with me to a bookstore that he likes, he said he wasn't able to, but didn't provide any further explanation.

 I'm doubting the girls' insistence that this guy likes me. Nothing romantic has been explicitly suggested, but friendship has also not been explicitly suggested. (He's mentioned a couple ex-girlfriends to me, so I know he is interested in women). I'm just afraid that I'll express interest and he'll be weirded out because he just wants to be friends. He's also a busy student, so maybe it should be a given that he wouldn't be interested in anything romantic right now? Idk.

68,q3k2iq,1633644966,Relationship Plateau,"i’ve been with my girlfriend for about 1 year now — through COVID and everything, she has become my most intimate and vulnerable relationship i’ve ever held (romantically and platonically) and she means the world to me. 

I am struggling right now because the “honeymoon” stage seems to have faded in the past few months. we have both been extremely overwhelmed with work and it’s been had to schedule time for each other. Lately, it’s been a dry spell and our communication / planning for the future has slowed down significantly. 

This largely feels due to outside pressures (work, covid, health, stress) rather than a failure of our relationship or lack of care for each other. I feel like i need to really step up in our relationship to make this work, but i have no clue how. I can’t help feeling really scared for the future — after one year, it feels like there is pressure to “decide” whether this is the right relationship for us long term. 

she really does have my heart and we do express love for each other verbally, but actions and quality time seem to feel just out of reach and distant.

69,q3k86v,1633645466,Saw someone I dated and it’s messed me up,"TLDR: Saw someone I dated a while ago and a heap of different emotions hit me.


I (32M) dated a woman last year for a couple of months. I really thought it was going well, multiple dates, I came up with some unique and creative ideas and the way she responded both in person and by text was always really positive/flirty/appreciative etc. Exactly the way you’d hope if you like the person.

Then as things do they changed out of nowhere and I got the old slow fade and ghost.

I hadn’t seen her in over a year and then she walked past me in the street a few hours ago, hand in hand with a guy.

My initial reaction when I realised it was her was of happiness, I assumed if she was with a lad she was happy and I’d left a voice message saying that as my last communication to her (no hard feelings if she’d met someone else).

Now it’s been a few hours and other emotions have hit me.

Disappointment that being strung along and ghosted has been pretty normal for me over the years. It makes it hard to put myself out there.

She told me several times I was great and kind and creative and just “great at this” (dating). I know it was the best I could do and that there’s nothing I could’ve done better. It makes me realise it’s not worth the effort if my perfect attempt won’t be enough.

I accept that I can’t do anything about other peoples actions but it still hurts.

There’s no question I have, just wanted to get this off my chest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3k86v/saw_someone_i_dated_and_its_messed_me_up/

71,q3kiak,1633646386,24-Year-Old Male in Need of Advice.," I am not exactly sure where I’m going to post this (typing it out in a word doc first) or to how many groups. But I could really use some advice, or support, or help of any kind. This might end up being a bit long, but I think my situation is a bit unique and I really want to both get this off my chest and also articulate who I am and what I struggle with. Maybe I will find out that this isn’t unique, though. So thank you very much to everyone who takes the time to read this, and to those who offer advice.

Before I talk about what my issue is, I’m going to describe who I am and what my life has been like. I really hope this doesn’t across as arrogant, but like I said, it’s really important to me to tell you who I think I am and why this contributes to my issue. I feel I am able to give people better advice when I can tailor it to their specific needs as a person, as opposed to just offering advice that I would give to pretty much anyone. 

I am a 24-year-old male. Since I was in elementary school, I have always been told that I was attractive. With the exception of a few of my schools years, girls have always been into me and in many cases have explicitly tried to get my attention. To this day, I have no doubt that I am significantly above average with regard to physical attractiveness. And, if it means anything, I was blessed with a very large penis. However, despite being attractive and well-endowed I never pursued women in my younger years. I was obsessed with achieving excellence in school and in sports (more on this below). But because I’m a good looking guy, I’ve dated two different girls since the beginning of university as a result of them pursuing me. 

I do not know exactly why I didn’t chase after girls during my younger years, but I do know why I pursued academic and athletic excellence. I have something like an inferiority complex ( I guess this is probably why I didn’t chase after girls). I’m not sure if that’s actually what it is, but it is remarkable how little confidence I have given what I have achieved. I first began to feel extremely inadequate in early high school, at which point I decided to compensate by defeating everyone at everything I did. I would set the record in goals/points for my high school hockey and basketball teams. I studied my brains out to win multiple academic awards in high school and get a scholarship to university. At university, I kept winning awards and getting the attention of my professors who would hire me to be their assistants and help them with their research. But like I said, I never really became more confident as a result of all this. It was all a Band-Aid to cover the gaping chasm of insecurity that has defined much of my life. 

From 2019 up until a few months ago, my life became fucking hell. My anxiety went through the roof, for months on end I was so depressed I could barely get out of bed, I developed insomnia, and I was so miserable that I literally could feel my muscles tensing up with every thought of self-hatred that entered my mind. I will spare you the details, but I have had to grind my heart out to get to where I am right now. I’m not perfect, I’m still dealing with some mental health issues, but I’m on my way up. My depression is getting better and better. I started working out and my body is becoming more muscular and toned. I meditate every night, I eat healthy, I read, I stretch, and I stopped smoking weed and drinking in excess. I don’t plan on quitting anytime soon, and I think things will continue to get better for me. 

This leads me to where I am now, and the issue I want to discuss with all of you (and hopefully receive advice on)! For the first time in my life, I deeply desire physical and romantic intimacy with women. I mentioned that in the past I’ve had girlfriends, but I never pursued them. They pursued me, and because I was interested I entered relationships with them. But now I want to pursue. Finding a partner would be great, but I’m also very interested in one-night-stands, FWB’s, and really any other form of intimacy with women. I feel like I’ve missed out on a lot of this, but because I know some women find me attractive, I know it is possible to begin forming these kinds of relationships in my life. But the issue is, I don’t know how. I’ve never had the confidence to talk to women (only if they talked to me first or if I was drunk). I’m only ever just nice. That’s all I really know how to be. I’m never rude, or domineering, or condensing, or explicitly misogynistic or anything like that. I feel nervous and just end up being extremely nice with little to no sex appeal. 

So I want to know how to begin “getting girls” basically. But I absolutely don’t want to rely on pickup artists or anything like that. Seems like a lot of toxic bullshit and stupidity to me. I want to know from real people—men and women alike—what kinds of things I can do to begin having success in this area of my life. I’m a bit awkward because of my insecurity, but I’d say I’m somewhat intelligent, uniquely well-spoken and definitely capable of being funny if I feel comfortable (I’m sort of a witty person when I’m comfortable, especially if I’ve had a few drinks lol). 

I’m sick of just seeing women, wanting them, and doing nothing about it. I want to begin getting my nerve up and GOING FOR IT. I don’t exactly know what that means, or how to do it, but I suppose that’s why I’m making this post. I’m getting a new phone next month so I’m going to download tinder, and that’s my only real idea so far. 

SO, to all of you spectacular human beings who made it to the end, do you have any advice for me? I’m so sick of being lonely and just fantasizing about sex/relationships with women. I want to make things happen in this area of my life while I’m still a young guy. 

I’m sorry if I come across bad in this. I’m not in an amazing mood while I type this, as it’s sort of making me feel like I’m too messed up to get what I want out of life. Also I’m sorry I’m not posting this to a single, specific community.

76,q3l58o,1633648483,Help/ Distance &amp; Excuses. Communication problems.,"I need help because i am emotionally exhausted and mentally strained over it. i dont know if im doing too much, over thinking or if im just emotional over it.

i'll give some insight about us first.

My new girlfriend and i started out slow, talked for almost 2 months and then started dating. i just turned 20 and she just turned 18. shes more kept to herself typa person and doesnt share a lot of stuff going on thats bothering her. i am more touchy feely i like to communicate an talk to her about what's bothering me. shes the popular girl everybody wants and im the guy who doesnt really talk to anyone i like my solitude. she has school mornings and fulltime job during some evenings. i have a fulltime job that starts in the middle of the day and ends at night. were not even a full 2 months into the relationship yet and we have already had sex some people think sex too early is a problem but it all came naturally so I was okay with it it did not bother me or her.

So lately we have been having some trouble communicating, i wasnt fully hearing her or understanding what she was truly needing like space or time to do homework because originally we had started hanging out a lot almost every day and she would never say no to us hanging out. now she wants more space and time for things which i have figured out a schedule and have been giving her plenty of time to herself, friends, school and work. 

well we had a little fight a week ago about listening to each other and we sorted it out i learned from the situation and read up so i could communicate better and listen better retaining her information she gives me whether its small stuff about the day or a work schedule. 

she said she wanted us to not talk or see each other all of last wrrkend to give us some time to breathe and sort ourselves out which i had to agree too of course and it wasn't a bad idea. but heres where it gets messy now even tho we should be all good from our time to ourselves youd think.

well we had never even spoken about the weekend space and to see if anything was OK or to even talk about it. And we never set up anything to hang out that week after the fact because I was thinking she would do that but I was still in the mindset that I should give her space. we havent seen each other in a week and we barely talk and i never get to call her anymore cause now she is going to bed earlier. anytime i feel like shes upset or being off i ask if shes okay and she just tells me every single time that she is just exhausted or the week kicked her ass or she is just too tired shes been saying this for the last 2 weeks including this one.

well for one i have asked teice to hang out first time she was busy second time she said yes but she never came over cause i asked her if she eanted to come thursday or friday well she never showed thursdsy because she said she didnt knoe ehat day and i never texted her that day ab coming over so that was her reasoning for not showing up. now all the sudden she has plans friday and the werkend and soon we will be running on two weeks of not seeing each other.

over the last week after our weekend brrak its obvious shes much more distant that usual and wuick to be defenessive about any thing i talk about revolving about our relationship she wont listen to me  i asked for a little more communication about her schedule and when she is busy so i know ehen to ask about seeing her or not and she flipped it on me saying i dont eed to know everywhere she is going and im not her parents so she is completely refusing to rvrn meet me in person or even text sbout the matter civilly and idk ehat to do because i just eant to soend time with her and she clearly does not. oh I don't know what to do because it seems like she is saying she's too tired to hang out with me or even call yet she is going out with her friends and making plans but I am not a part of any of that schedule.

as of lately she kind of seems to be treating me more like a problem or threat and not a relationship partner because she does not want me to know her schedule and will not give me the time of day to speak to her or see her face to face and to be honest it has upset me quite a lot to the point where I am thinking about it too much at work or I am going to work crying and crying at work I cannot figure out why I am being treated in such a way that I am a threat.

it seems like from what she has told me that she is sick of explaining herself """" and is tired of the supposed fighting but I do not know how to approach her in conversation about these things because she is so quick to get defensive or blame me for needing to explain her self.

I don't ask her for an explanation for anything and I don't need to know where she's at or what she's doing all the time all I said to her was that I wanted more communication about her schedule so I could know when were able to hang out and I specifically told her that I just want to be in the loop more.

but she continues to treat me like I am a problem and I have tried to explain what I have written here to her but it seems as though she just only hears what she wants to hear and it is genuinely stressful and upsetting not being able to see or communicate with my partner.

I am also kind of bothered by the fact that it seems she is not that interested in me anymore I had told her I was getting a tattoo and was posting it and just little stuff like that she's not even interested in it or asks about it so now I am lacking attention on top of not seeing her at all or barely speaking.

I don't want her to stop being vulnerable with me because that would hurt us a lot I am pretty lost on the whole matter and I don't know how to get into the conversation at all if we can't meet face-to-face

I legitimately do not know what to do at this point because I don't want the relationship to fail and this is her first serious relationship so I am trying to work with her but at this moment I am just playing the speak when spoken to and that's pretty much it I do not know what to do...

81,q3lbwn,1633649115,Has anyone else not seen any improvements after 'working on' themselves?,"I'm 22f and the past few years I've been putting a lot of energy and effort into my appearance. I've gone down a few sizes, wear trendy and flattering clothes, got rid of my acne, got laser eye surgery to ditch the glasses, and I try to eat/stay as healthy as I can.

I'm still working on how I present myself to the world, school, expanding my social circle, and some hobby related goals. A lot of this was just for the sake of wanting to be better, but I was also hoping that I would see improvements to the people I attracted. But the only improvement I've seen is going from attracting no one to attracting people I'm not attracted to. Its been a combo of faces, personalities, and abdominal fat that put me off. I'm not the prettiest girl, but I had hoped I would be more attractive to people who'd at least meet me at my level?

I still want to get plastic surgery one day (bc I'm not photogenic and have some features that are not exactly feminine), but that won't be possible until a few years after I graduate. I feel frustrated by the fact that everyone talks how 'improving' yourself is supposed to be a cure-all, but I'm not seeing any improvements in this facet of my life. I've always been single, so its not like I don't know how to be independent or alone. I just don't know what else I need to do?

82,q3lcnp,1633649186,Accidentally matched on Tinder with someone I know,"I accidentally swiped right on Tinder on an acquaintance from uni who I am not romantically interested in. I wasn't sure how to handle this without being rude so I just kept replying to his messages since they were just about university (nothing flirtatious). We have been messaging for about a week now and  he said it would be nice to hang out sometime and I agreed (in retrospect I should not have done this). He has now suggested a day and I don't want this to turn into a date. I am considering deleting tinder anyway because I have already found someone I am interested in.
I feel really bad about this situation and I'm not sure how to handle it without hurting his feelings. I know I should've said something much sooner and not agreed to hang out. I see this guy once a week so this could become quite awkward. Does anyone have any advice for me?

83,q3ld2s,1633649225,Is this negging?,"Firstly, I know I shouldn’t be talking to him and the right thing to do is just stop but we’re here now and I want some advice.

We talk throughout the day and the conversation is pretty much nonstop, we’ve clicked (personality wise) and we’re going on a date this weekend. I want to see him in person out of curiosity, a lot is lost in texts so I’m giving him the benefit of doubt.

I need to know if on this occasion if he’s gone too far or am I nitpicking. I sent him a selfie this morning and he carried on with the conversation without saying a word. 

Later on we were talking about what we’re wearing for our date and where he wants to take me. I had the afternoon off and coincidentally was going shopping. 

I sent him a picture of a dress I tried on and he said “that’s nice👏”. I sent a *risky* video of a tight dress. Nothing revealing but beyond flirty. He did not comment at all. I sent a few pictures and videos to my friends (the whole collections of my “photo shoot”) and the response was very different. 

Now of course my friends would compliment me but come on, if the pictures sexy says its sexy.

85,q3lpc4,1633650378,My first time actually dating. Any tips or advice?,"So I'm pretty new to dating and I just wanted to ask for some advice. I'm in my early 20's(m).

I've never really put myself out there or tried hitting on someone. My only experience comes from girls hitting on me or flirting with me. Back in my teenage years I was very socially anxious and I had a low self-esteem, so I always turned those girls down. My first and only relationship also started because a girl asked me out. Unfortunately it didn't work out in the end. This all is to say though, that I uh don't know how go about this at all haha, since instead of trying myself I always just let it come over me. But unlike teenage me, I now feel ready to try having a real relationship.

I want to try online dating, and I've been thinking about how to go about it. I find the entire concept of meeting someone I don't really know a bit scary tbh, and I'm very slow with relationship stuff so I really don't know how to develop that with someone new. I don't want to hookup or instantly be very physically intimate, I really want to get to know someone first before I can do that, but I feel like there's a lot of pressure / expectations to be physically intimate soon with dating like this. I just hope my inexperience and need for time to actually develop a bond doesn't drive potential dates away.

Also, I really wish to meet someone with similar interests as me. Particularly some geek stuff, like Japanese games and anime. I just don't know how to properly convey that. I don't want people to think that's the *only* thing I like or want to talk about, but from my (limited) experience I know it's something that's important for me to have in common with a potential partner, just being able to get excited about the same stuff and sharing that with each other. I think it might be best to outright say I value those interests in my bio, just to filter out people that wouldn't like that about me.

I guess this is the first time I'm really activally going to try dating. Despite being still being a bit introverted and shy, I really love talking to people, so I'm hopeful for things to work out. I'm also writing this to phych myself up since this is a big step for me haha. (Btw I've decided to try online dating because I just don't meet that many people irl, and I really just want to give it a try at least once).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3lpc4/my_first_time_actually_dating_any_tips_or_advice/

88,q3lt1c,1633650759,i didn’t let him fuck me. do i still have a chance?,"over the weekend, i was out of town with some friends, and there was a guy in the group who i’d never met before but vibed really well with. 

after being together all night, he suggested i sleep in his room because i was too drunk to drive myself home. so i agreed to stay with him but made it VERY clear that i didn’t want to have sex. 

even tho he did try to make moves on me throughout the night, we did talk until 4 am and didn’t have sex. we had a good time getting to know each other better. 

the next morning, we met up with the group to get brunch. he kept telling me how pretty i was and how he really liked me. he even told the group how much he liked me when i left briefly to my hotel.

by this point, i liked him too, but i didn’t want to make any promises. so when he asked me to stay in his room again that night, i agreed, but still made it clear that i wouldn’t have sex with him.

well night time comes around and he is so coked out. he got aggressive and super pushy to have sex. he would open my legs, lift my shirt, try to kiss me… i felt so uncomfortable and i unattracted to him and continued to reject him. i think that hurt his ego really bad which made things super awkward. 

the next day, we met up with our friends for one last brunch before our flights home. he didn’t talk to me at all. 

but because i still liked him, i decided to give him a spontaneous kiss right before he got in his uber to the airport, which definitely caught him by surprise. he blushed and told me that we will stay in touch. 

it’s been a few days now and he has texted me, but our conversations are so dry. i feel like we are avoiding the elephant in the room. i honestly want to ask him if i ruined my chances of seeing him again. i wanna reassure him somehow that i do like him.

91,q3m44d,1633651815,Separated but now she says we are dating,"I went through my old chats today and found a group message with my ex, things between us have stagnated for some time. She decided it was time to seek other company and consider new opportunities, I feel my time with her has run its course. This has began to be a growing thought in my mind for close to a few months now and have determined that letting things run their course was the best route. 

Suddenly, I get a response when leaving that said something along the lines of ""Where are you going, we are just getting started.""

Now I don't know what to think. Her interest was pretty strong for me long before I knew we had a relationship. When I realized where her emotions lied I was able to see what was in front of me and we stayed together for close to a few months. Then things began to settle to the point I think she wasn't prepared to continue what we had, and this was very upsetting.

So when she messaged saying that we have now started dating, just as I turned my back on her I don't believe she was truely honest with her self form the beginning and is now looking for any reason to keep me present.

I think its time to leave, but she is saying that I should stay. What is the best thing to do here because she hasn't shown herself to be this honest since we started dating and I don't know if this is one of her plans to guilt me into seeing her or if she is prepared to show me that she cares more now than when she neglected me in the past.

94,q3mbtl,1633652549,He blocked me whilst I was sleeping!,"Hello Reddit! I would love some insight on this situation. 

Met a guy online about three months ago. Everything was nice at the beginning, both very comfortable with each other, good connection, lots of laughs, both made loads of effort etc 

Fast forward to two weeks ago - we have a really lovely date. He made me a tea in the morn and asked me to message him when I got home. I did. But he just went weird from then - his messages dwindled and he was avoidant to commit to the next date. It felt like he didn’t want to see me again, so I asked. He replied with a ‘I just don’t want things to get too deep too quick’. He was out out and said he would call me the next day. He didn’t so I sent a message establishing things were over. He replied straight away wanting to apologise and then nothing….

A few days later we spoke on the phone. I assumed things would end but he apologized and made it clear that he didn’t want to cut things off and wanted to ‘pretend the blip never happened’ because he ‘panicked’. 

I accepted his apology. We met the following week but it was basically a booty call which I was not okay about! A few days later I called him to tell him that the last meet was too casual for me and not what I wanted. He enthusiastically declared that we should make more time for each other next time and we proceeded to set a date and plan. 

We continue chatting like normal for the next two days about random shiz. I wake up this morning on the day of our date…and he’s blocked me on everything!! No explanation and my last message was me telling him what music I was listening to.
