0,r53mbu,1638214457,Please help me objectively choose which guy to proceed further with.,"I have intense feelings for two different guys who both want me to be their girlfriend. I need to figure out who I want to proceed into a relationship with. I wrote down descriptions of both. Please help me, I need objective opinions on this.


Guy #1
*unsure about his plans for the future
*politically he is a moderate who leans right, while I am a democrat 
*sexually compatible (I lean dom, he leans sub)
*similar music taste
*we are both spiritual, he is religious but I am not
*he isn’t confident
*will be friends with me if I decide to date someone else
*was a hard drug addict when he was like 14-16. Nowadays he only does weed, doesn’t drink alcohol at all.
*very romantic in my type of way

It feels like we’re yin and yang. He is like the soft guy that I’ve always wanted. It feels like he’s a person I’ve been looking for years. He does a lot of things that I would do. We can talk endlessly. When I hug him it feels like I’m hugging my best friend. I haven’t written any lyrics or poetry about him yet :/. He really likes me but I feel blinded by my feelings for Guy #2 for me to like him as intensely back.


Guy #2
*has a good plan for his future that he is already actively doing
*very compatible with me politically
*his sex drive matches mine
*different music taste
*he is not religious nor spiritual. I am spiritual and open to possibly becoming religious in the future.
*very confident and comfortable with himself 
*can’t handle being friends (because it will hurt) if I decide to date someone else
*drinks socially, does weed occasionally. Never has done hard drugs
*I haven’t seen a romantic side of him but it may be there

I feel like I’d really grow with him as a person. I got that ‘fire in my soul’ feeling from him. I feel a strong pull to him. I’ve written a lot of lyrics and poetry about him. We both really like each other. Holding him feels like I’m holding the world. If I don’t date him, I’m gonna have a big fear of missing out. I intensely miss him when I go a few days without seeing him. But, the conversations doesn’t flow as well as they do with Guy #1.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r53mbu/please_help_me_objectively_choose_which_guy_to/

There’s one girl I feel attracted to and excited to see. We’ve gone on a date and have talked on the phone multiple times, she’s reciprocated interest. I felt this attraction on the first date but I chickened out of kissing her or doing a ton of flirting/complimenting (I did say she’s cute or gorgeous a few times at least). I have trouble initiating kisses and physical contact I think :/

Pretty quickly after the first date we both agreed to meet up again. She brought up the question of what to do and suggested that I go over her place (she lives alone) to have dinner and watch a movie. 

This feels like a good thing because it shows she has some level of interest in me. I’m just nervous because I feel like it raises the stakes of the date and have no idea what her expectation is. We never really talked about our thoughts sex yet and I’m usually the type of person who waits until a relationship becomes serious so I hope she’s cool with that.

Any general advice people have? I’m just pretty nervous because this’ll be the first time since my last relationship I’m going to someone’s place like this. For example, would it be weird if I brought flowers? If so would a candle or bottle of wine be better. Lastly, any advice on initiating physical touch or a kiss.

I don’t understand why he’s suggesting we date if he’s too busy. I want to respect his time and I do, but I don’t know what else he expects from me at this point.

11,r54bff,1638216330,Am I a bad or weird person for being reluctant to do this?,"Okay I want to keep this rather short: I'm interested now for a while in this girl who's from Italy (I'm from the Netherlands), up until now she's the only one I've actually ever been interested in in my life. We're both Christians looking for someone to marry. She really has a lot of good traits. However, I feel she's been doing rather difficult the last time. This really has to do with that fact that she's very, very busy with her job in the orchestra. On average she has to practice for at least 8 hours a day or so.

F.e., she and I wanted to meet up in May somewhere in France for 7 days. She called off in the end because a few weeks prior she got a assigned a certain job/exam. She said she would be busy all the way up to November. So now we both finally have time to meet up end of December/early January, but she said she thinks it's too long to meet for a couple of days now. Mind btw that on average she only is free 6 hours a day max due to her job, even if we meet. So all of a sudden she sees this as a problem. Up until this point we've already have video called for about 20-30 hours total or so. And I think we really have a good vibe so far, just with a lot of interests and jokes going on.

So about this upcoming meeting: basically we can still meet anywhere we want. I'm willing to pay 200-400 euro's just to see her for let's say at least 18 hours total (three days in the afternoon). But now some close people think I am a bad or weird person for being unwilling to meet someone for less then 18 hours. Am I really a cheapskate? Are some of you really willing to pay and travel for many hours, just to say someone for less then 18 hours? Especially if earlier the same person wanted to meet for a week for a total of say 63 hours (7x9 hours a day)? Doesn't this seem rather strange?

I think traveling for so far just to see someone for less then 18 hours (so 6 hours average for three days), is the least I want to do. If I lived closer I would have had no problem to see her for just a few hours. She says now of a sudden that she doesn't want to meet up for longer then 30 hours (6 hours on average for five days). I would be happy with that, but now some people close to me suggest I'm a bad person for being unwilling to see this young woman for only a short time.

Worst part even is: there is absolutely no empathy for my part of the story. I'm not even to at least suggest her to stop playing for her orchestra for about a day or two, or else I'm probably a misogynist or something. Me seeing her probably won't even cost her a single dime or any other investment, at most just to some time to suggest a few options to meet up.  
Up until this point we've been in situations in which a sorry would be due: only I said sorry about every time, she barely ever does. Like if she suddenly stops responding for a full week when I invested hours back in April to look for places to meet.

I even feel like she is offering this last option as an ultimatum all of a sudden: if I don't come she thinks our relationship will continue to stay virtual for ever.  
Also, if she would come here I would gladly pay half of her trip, but from her side I haven't heard even one offer. Which I find even to be more ironic since she is a feminist: so she's in favor of equal pay, but when it comes to it no offer at all from her side.

19,r55877,1638218753,"Drama, so much of it.","Hey all, 30m here, looking for some opinions on one of the most dramatic relationship stories I have to offer. I'll try and keep the backstory as short as possible, so here it goes. I was single after a bad breakup for about 3 months, and rather than continuing to be depressed, I asked a girl (we'll call her X) that I've been friends with for about 5 years out on a date. She said yes, I was stoked. Now prepare for a drama novel.

Previously, she was in a relationship for 10 years prior, we met while they were still together and he (we'll call him Y) was a decent friend of mine, but they left each other on bad terms. They have a daughter, who's about 10, and X has a son from a failed marriage prior to that. She has both the kids, and Y lives 1000 miles away now. 

Anyway, first date: flawless. We make plans for date number 2, which ends up being at her house. Again, flawless, but the kids are there. No big deal. That is, until the daughter saw us kissing. Okay, we're adults here, no big deal right?

Wrong. This little kid freaks out, and uses her cellphone (which I find somewhat disagreeable for someone that age, but that's besides the point) TO CALL Y AND TELL HIM that her mommy is kissing someone thats not him, while we are still unaware. 

Holy hell, so begins the chaos. Y then decides it's a good idea to CALL ME, while me and X are still making out. Of course, I didn't answer, because who would in that situation? He then calls X, who also doesn't answer, after which she realized what was going on. It seems that Y has manipulated this poor kid into spying on her mom and informing him of everything she does. The kid is freaking out, but X gets the situation under control enough to continue what we were doing.

We get back at our adult activities, and everything seems fine the rest of the night. I inquire if we should make an effort to see each other more often, and she agrees, but we're going to step back a bit until the situation settles down. That is, until the real dastardly stuff unfolds. X informs me later in the week that the daughter is going to Y's place soon, which I assumed was pre-planned for her birthday/Thanksgiving. I was then told that it's Y's mother who will be picking up the daughter and bringing her back. That's when I begin to wonder if there's a different motive.

X has seemed pretty distraught, and I don't know for sure, but I think that Y felt salty and jealous, cried to his mommy, told her that he's salty and jealous, and sent her to take the daughter, for what I'm guessing is an indefinite amount of time. It seems to me like some kind of petty, underhanded, low-life way to get back at X, who has done nothing wrong. 

I even called Y a couple days afterwards (against my better judgement) to apologize for exposing the kid to that. He seemed mostly amicable, until he texts me right after basically hanging up on me to say in more or less words that we aren't friends anymore. Childish, but I understand, I guess?

I feel like neither me, nor X have done anything wrong, but I feel terrible about causing this kind of unnecessary drama in her life. She works very hard, is a great mom, and an awesome person, and she doesn't deserve it. 

So, any thoughts people? Am I an asshole, or is Y acting like a baby? Lay it on me, sorry for the long post.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r55877/drama_so_much_of_it/

We text daily and facetime all the time, usually see each other at least once a week (last two times I've stayed the night at her place) and we seem to be very compatible. When we arent going out for food or shopping we just hang at her place and cuddle and talk and laugh. I've slept in her bed at her place twice now, but we havent done anything sexual, just some kissing and cuddling. Sometimes when the kissing gets going she will pull away so we dont go any further.

She explained to me early on, like date 2 or 3, that she doesn't have sex right away and we have talked about it since, she continues to say the same thing. I took that as her explaining her boundaries and I want to respect those boundaries. I wont make a move bc I dont want to be pushy, and I've explained that to her. She knows I want to have sex, though. The issue I'm having is how do I explain what I'm looking for without pressuring her or bulldozing her boundaries. I dont need sex all the time, or even right away, but the last two times I stayed at her place I straight up had pain in my balls the next day (I really didnt think blue balls was real until this experience) 

Do I just tell her part of what I'm looking for in a relationship is sex? Do I ask her for a little help (wink, wink) the next time we are together? How do I explain how i feel without pressuring her or her feeling like I'm ignoring her boundaries?

28,r567qy,1638221455,Did I blow it already? Is there any real chance?,"So I recently joined a nearby gym. There is a girl who has been regularly working out at the gym. I have got a massive crush on her and I want to ask her out. But before that, I would like to know her. 

We cross paths and exchange glances. I have tried to smile looking at her but she did not smile back. Since that day, we have been simply exchanging glances and looking at each other while working out. I overheard her name from one of her friends and I followed her on social media. It was a public profile. I have never interacted with her online (did not even like any of her photos yet or reply to her stories) as she hasn't followed me back. 

I am assuming that she must be introverted and yet very social as she has many followers and she doesn't follow them all, follows only a handful of them. Probably in the ratio 3:1. She doesn't interact with any of the guys at the gym. Probably looks at them just like others.

There have been instances when she needed the equipment that I had been using. She would just stand there and wait or stroll. Would never directly ask or tell anything.  

I am not even sure whether she knows my name or whether she knows that I follow her on the most popular image sharing social media. At the same time, I feel like the window period to say hi or smile again has probably passed. Idk how to approach this situation. The one thing that I know for sure is that she sees me sweat it out and probably knows that I am a regular member now at the gym.

All advices and experiences would be really helpful. I don't even know whether she is dating someone or in a relationship with someone else.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r567qy/did_i_blow_it_already_is_there_any_real_chance/

...I know there's plenty of fish in the sea, so I'm not stressing it. However what we potentially have as far as hooking up isn't anything I've been able to get anywhere else. He's a legit dominant and every one Ive ran into otherwise sucks, it seems like we have a lot in common and we click well....so it's a tad more difficult to walk away vs if it was just sex. I know there are other real dominants out there but hard to find imo. 
Also...I feel like if I were to leave this situation, I would only be trying to jump into a relationship which is probably not what I need right now. I just got out of one and probably need time to myself. (I took time before starting this fwb).

We never fight or anything, when we do not agree on something we just talk about it and listen to each other. We only had one misunderstanding in the beginning and I truly believe that we learnt from it, because ever since we always communicate.

By the way, we’re both in our early 20’s. 
I’ve been hurt in the past and I do not easily trust or believe people in general.... yet with them its different. I’ve told them some of my deepest secrets and traumas that even some people in my circle are not aware of. Everything is just easy with them, might be the honeymoon phase... but hey I like it! 
I can not bring myself to tell them that I love them simply out of fear and me wanting to be sure before getting into something serious with someone so sure about their feelings. I told them that I think that I love them, but still trying to figure it out, like they know where I’m at. One sure thing is that I do not want to lose them and would be bummed if we stop whatever we have and do not talk to each other. I do not want to get hurt, but I also do not want to hurt them at all because I deeply care about them. so yeah im taking my time, but im almost there!

Just wanted to share that it’s possible to find genuine people that are willing to be in a serious relationship online (dating app, social media,etc)!

He immediately launched a tyraid saying that I was childish for how I wanted to handle things and that I was just making excuses. He kept going on about energy and body language being the only way to form a real connection. And I understand where he's coming from but I was uncomfortable about meeting up. After 20 minutes I caved and said I meet up if he could come to me. We live a hour apart and I don't drive (which he mocked me for without listening to the reasons). His excuse was he needed front tires on his car so I'd have to go to him. After about 20 seconds of me trying to figure out a plan he scoffed said ""guess I'll talk to you later since you're not interested"" and hung up before I could respond. I honestly feel bad about the situation and myself.

Step 3 : Start overthinking and overanalyzing. Eg, ""Am I just settling for this person because I'm finding it so hard to get matches in the first place?""

36,r56zly,1638223569,Men talking about their exes on first date.,"

This weekend I went on a date with a guy after talking to him on phone for an hour and texting occasionally. Met him on an app that's specifically for marriage. He seemed nice and interested. The only thing- I felt like he was a bit of a show off. The date started ok but as I tried to have a conversation with him he kept giving me details about other women he had been on dates with. I tried to bring back the topic of conversation to something common but everytime I tried it really made no difference. Finally, he is telling me about this girl who was in his life ten years ago and was so in love with him but he was commitment phobic and how great she was and how rich she was. Even though he has Mercedes, Audi etc now that girl liked him when he had nothing. Blah blah. I had stopped listening at some point. 

It was all just so annoying that I cut the date short. In the end he asks if we are meeting again. I am usually very shy and polite but I just felt so angry that I looked him straight in the eye and said ""Why would I meet you again when all you did was talk about your exes!"" To which he didn't say anything, just nodded. Then I left. 

Another instance is from a month ago where the guy wouldn't shut up about his ex-fiancee but still wanted to keep talking to me and according to him wanted to take things forward with me. I lost all interest in him because of that reason alone. 

I don't know if I am doing something wrong or these men are just not interested in me and still haven't gotten over their exes.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r56zly/men_talking_about_their_exes_on_first_date/
37,r571nt,1638223726,Disappointed with how things are going and want to know whether or not to give up on her.,"Been talking and hanging out with a girl for about almost 3 months. The beginning was really fun and we both felt we connected in a meaningful way. We cuddled and made out but haven't had sex yet and in all honesty, I absolutely don't mind because I just like being with her, still do. She was pretty up front that she was focusing on herself and wasn't ready for a relationship just yet, so I was mostly fine with delayed text responses, rescheduling multiple dates (we still had them) and accepting she had a busy life. 

But lately, I been beginning to feel like I'm just an afterthought to her, someone she responds to when she ""gets to it"", like a chore. It's hard to explain how exactly but I think most people have a gut feeling when it like so. The last date we went on was about 2 weeks ago, last week was Thanksgiving so we were both busy. I told her I was going out of state for a week and asked if she wanted to hangout since we wouldn't see each other for a while again. 

She initially said yes but then said she couldn't due to a last minute meeting. She then offered to have a ""phone call"" instead. For some reason, I felt very heartbroken when she said that and frankly, a bit upset. Do I mean so little to someone that they wouldn't even bother to reschedule our date, meet up for a shorter date, or something along those line but instead end up offering a 5 minute phone call as a substitute? 

I know I sound like a whiny man-child, boo hoo, but I felt very hurt by this, more than I thought I would. I feel at this point I have a few options available to me. 

1- End things with her, abruptly (ghosting basically) and be depressed for the next month. 2- Continue with the status-co with some resentment but occasional dopamine hits from when we do end up hanging out, with the spark slowly dying off. 3- Confront her about my feelings the whole ""relationship"" and her most likely breaking things off. 4- Confront her, but only about this specific situation, end up doing the phone call and push things for later down the road. 5. Her magically wanting to be in a relationship after talking and happily ever after. 6??

Fast forward a month and she texts me out of the blue saying. Sorry about the whole date thing I was in a bad place. Maybe we could give it more time. So we spoke a bit and she asked to meet me.

I met up with her and she apologised for the whole date thing and explained how she was seeing someone at that time but that it wasn’t really working. She also told me that it had since then ended and that she liked me but needed some time to think about things.

42,r57gox,1638224910,Second date (currently being planned) too similar to first?,"I met a girl online and we met yesterday to get bubble tea at this one place. We've never been to the place before and didn't realize there was no seating and we ended up walking outside on a snowy trail for 3 hours (I wanted to suggest something else but she actually enjoys hiking and being out in the snow so it worked out).

The date ended pretty good I think. We had a hug at the end and before the hug even ended, she was still holding me when she looks up and asks what my schedule is like. We didn't set a concrete date but we both expressed we wanted to see each other again at the end of the date and during the couple texts that were exchanged afterwards.

I'm thinking of asking her tomorrow or on Wednesday if she wanted to do something again this weekend. I was originally thinking of going to Casa Loma together (they have a Holiday lights display) and then maybe going for dinner afterwards. However, she mentioned that since I paid for the first date, she will be paying for the second and the date that I had in mind is pretty expensive. I don't mind paying and I usually spend around that much on a second date (and some first dates) anyways but I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable.

I'm thinking of maybe pushing back my plans to a third date (if it gets to that) just in case it does make her uncomfortable. She did mention in the text she sent me after the date that ""she had a lot of fun and drinks are on her next time"". When we were originally talking and before we even set up the date, we did talk about our favourite cafes and stuff and this first date was supposed to be her favourite bubble tea place and she said I would need to show her my favourite cafes later.

I feel like it might be a good idea to take her to the cafe I talked about since that's what exceptations seem to be. The cafe I have in mind is a cute little place in the heart of a small town. Its really cute and theres a nice lake and trail nearby which we could go for a walk. My only worry is that that date would be way too similar to the first date.

Met her on Hinge. We went to get boba and ice cream and had a pretty good conversation and we're pretty similar, we also went to something she was performing in before that. She also said it went pretty well and we were even sitting in the car in the parking lot and had some nice conversations.

Now here's possibly where I possibly F'd up. It's been 10 days since the first date (this also includes thanks giving break and going back home). I had added her on Snapchat since I usually post things and she has been commenting on my story like pretty much everyday since I usually post interesting things I'm doing (no selfies).

44,r57kup,1638225245,Her (22F) communication hasn't improved. Need help/venting (22M),"So I've made a post 7 days ago, it's the prelude to this new post [https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzyhpv/i\_22m\_keep\_being\_left\_on\_read\_but\_she\_23f\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzyhpv/i_22m_keep_being_left_on_read_but_she_23f_is/)

&amp;#x200B;

Hey again to this subreddit! First of all thanks to all the kind people who replied to my last post it helped me a lot and I've come again here to vent/talk/discuss the actual situation.

&amp;#x200B;

A few important notes before you read:

* Her first time dating;
* She is only until February in my country;
* We had 2 dates until the events I explained here;
* She admitted to being a bad texter and I haven't had the guts to tell her she has to make an effort because I thought it would be best to have that conversation in person and when we decide to take it a step further, aka relationship.

So after the post, I asked my date for a drink. Before we went to the bar I took her to the most cliché romantic place, an old elevator from the 1890s - yes I took her there and she said she wasn't romantic but it was a very nice view.  We had a lovely evening, laughed a lot. After the drinks, she wanted to go to the Christmas fair so we went there, pity it was closed. But I suggested going to the main square in my city and we began walking there, everything went smoothly.

We sat down on the steps to the main statue there and after a few moments, I opened my heart:

"" Me: - I really enjoy talking and hanging out with you. I wanted to ask you if you have the same feeling?

 Her:  - I thought you never asked. I really enjoy talking and being around you. It's fun and we have a lot in common.""

There was an ""awkward"" moment of silence.

We said some silly jokes and we resumed talking, I had no guts to touch her knee or her hand or kiss her, mainly because I'm afraid that I'm going too fast for her and also I lack a bit of initiative :/

&amp;#x200B;

As we were leaving to catch the underground. She told me she is sorry if she is going a bit slower than other girls, she isn't used to dating and doesn't know how to do it. I said it's alright, though I have dated when it comes to it it is always a learning process.  I used this exact sentence ""It's always starting from scratch. Don't worry, if you think I'm being too quick, let me know and I want you to feel as comfortable as you can."".

We continued our merry way to the underground station, we sat down and talked on the benches. Suddenly I realized I haven't asked her if she wants to take it a notch higher. A relationship, perhaps. To what she responds:

""I do want to take it a notch higher. The only problem we have is time, but we will see when it's time.""

&amp;#x200B;

As we are speaking on the tram, she asks me how I'm going to get home, it was around 11:10 pm and I had to take a bus from the capital to my town and then from the town I had to take a taxi to my home. She asked if it wasn't too expensive? I said it is worth every penny to be with her. I made sure to say it on her ear and also compliment her afterward. 

Due to COVID-19 restrictions in my country, you're not allowed to be maskless on public transport. She proceeded to take off her mask - mind you the tram was almost empty - and plant a kiss on my cheek. Saying just because it's worth it \*smack\*.

&amp;#x200B;

This was last Wednesday. We proceeded to talk through the week - she is really erratic with her texts, but I dealt well with it, I got used to it, I guess. She had told me that she would take a flight to meet a friend (a she) in a city in the neighboring country. She made the effort of texting me saying she was about to embark. I wished her safe travels and answered some texts of her. So this weekend I stayed cool, she was out of town and having fun, normal adult things, right? I had enough stuff to worry for my masters.

Come Monday - she was back Sunday but after a 7-hour long bus ride, I didn't expect much - she viewed all - 1 message - and left me on read.

I didn't stress so much I had to do a lot of stuff and my anxiety about papers is already high.

Come Monday night and I say:

""Screw this, I might have time tomorrow night since I'm staying in the capital to be able to use all my time to work on an archive, might as well ask her to a night out, like we had just less than a week. She takes her time and just leaves on read."" Mind you she usually answers straight away when it is about setting dates - she is a much better person talking than typing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just asking for some help, tips and generally, I need to vent this to someone, because I have cried due to the stress of being left on read. I have invested a lot of my free time in someone who is bad a communicating, but great in person. I need to say something to her next time we are together in person, I need to be brave enough and have the guts to tell her that her communication is really bad, but I like her. Her lack of communication brings small degrees of anxiety worsened by the fact I have a lot of faculty work to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r57kup/her_22f_communication_hasnt_improved_need/

I’m hot and cold about using them—typically I download Hinge for a month, get frustrated with the lack of potential options, and then delete it only to start over a few months later. 

What frustrates me is that most conversations go like this: 

— We match 

— I make a comment about something on the girl’s profile or ask a question 

— She replies with an answer to my question and that’s it. No follow-up. No expounding. It’s like they’re responding to essay prompts. 

— I make a few more attempts at carrying the conversation and then get bored and unmatch because the girl doesn’t seem like she’s trying. 

Ladies, any thoughts on this? It happens even with girls who liked my profile first so I can’t explain it as just a lack of interest on their part. Am I doing something wrong?

Help pls,"So there's this girl I work with (same department, same position, same shift even) that I really like, and we both seem to have a good time around each other while at work. Sometimes we flirt jokingly to pass the time, but I haven't been able to figure out if she's actually into me or not, so for now, I just consider her a good friend, since we both can tell each other almost anything and the trust is definitely there.

Outside of work we never went out alone (only for drinks with other colleagues), so I decided to invite her to come home with the pretext that I'll cook her something nice, and we could watch a movie together, and she said yes! So there's that...

A little more background: We're both around the same age, both are pleased with our current lifestyles, and are not dating anyone else (she ended a long-term relationship a few months ago and enjoying some alone time), but I kind of went on a few dates with different women and even told her about it (which she seemed fine or even happy with, and treated it like gossip from me).

I've been searching deep inside of me and meditating all the possible outcomes and my true intentions towards her so that I could come up with the best course of action for the both of us, but what I know for sure is that I really like her. 

So, hypothetically, let's say she's actually into me as I'm into her, how do you guys recommend I play this out? Is it bad to try and date a co-worker? Should I just confess how I feel about her? I know I wouldn't have a problem with finding out she doesn't like me that way and continuing the relationship as friends.

56,r58mxj,1638228252,Do I have right to be upset?,"Been talking to someone for a few months now me(f) and he have been getting along fine. After a few dates I could tell it wasn’t going to go anywhere as he was too much into spending time with his male friends rather than me and as pathetic as it sounds it’s was just nice to have the attention for a while.

After stopping a few nights and him calling in sick to spend the night with me instead. A few days after I asked if he was sleeping with anyone else to see if I needed to be worried about cross contamination to put it lightly and he said no he would tell me otherwise.

He ended up going away with his mates and told me today he slept with someone whilst away and that’s he’s told me out of respect and he will get tested to carry things on. 

I know I have no right to be mad but I’m more disappointed in myself for settling for something that had nowhere to go. 

He told me it was a case of miscommunication and he just wanted sex. However I don’t sleepover or go out on dates or plan dates(some his idea too) if I’m just looking for a fwb?  

I guess honestly I’m just looking for a pick me up and trying to figure out if I’m in the wrong for not clarifying anything or I’m just respectful enough to give my attention to one guy at a time? Or stupid I guess.

It’s been rough, i know I’ve put him through alot. Lately we’ve been in a much better place since I’ve been getting therapy &amp; wedding planning! 

So just to give background, we’re an interracial couple and his parents didn’t really approve of our relationship, they’ve since come around a bit but still havent really helped with the wedding cost (they’re well to do people). So the cost of the wedding has kinda fallen on myself, my fiancé &amp; my stepfather. My fiancé makes pretty good money &amp; has spent almost 10k so far on the wedding. We’ve been stressed but we’ve been making it &amp; we’re quick to take a step back &amp; relax when needed. 

We’ll just recently there was fraud on my account so I haven’t been able to use my card so my fiancé has taken on even more of the financial responsibility. He offered to give me his card until mine came in &amp; he purchased me a giftcard &amp; put $400 on it so I wouldn’t be with out for the next week and a half. He also just purchased me a new phone yesterday (added me to his line) because I kept complaining about my old one. My therapy sessions are twice a week &amp; they are $150. I was paying them but since I’m waiting my new card i haven’t had a session. Lately I’ve been having spikes so I set up an appointment &amp; my fiancé put his card on file so he could pay for it for me. 

Anyways we were having a playful conversation (don’t remember about what exactly) &amp; I threw up the middle finger to him &amp; ran into the bathroom &amp; he said “nah babe, come here” so I did &amp; he said “I don’t like when you give me the middle finger, that was disrespectful. I mean shoot I can take my card off for your therapy session.” &amp; that made me upset because why threaten me with that? I told him how I felt &amp; he said “I was joking, I would never do that. I didn’t like the middle finger though, that’s all”. 

He came back after he saw I was still affected &amp; said “babe I’m sorry, that was a dick move. I could’ve said something batter than that.”

I get incredibly emotional at the touch of a woman. Let me preface this by giving you a small window of my past as to hopefully make this more understandable of how I got to this point.

I really don't think I had much of my 20s be very different from many others. A lot of dating in my early 20s and a bit more relaxed around the time I turned 26. My first serious relationship wasn't until I turned 20 and lasted about a year, it was the only girl I have ever said I love you to and it ended with her cheating on me with her ex. After that moment it wasn't uncommon for me to have shorter relationships, I'd have 4/5 girlfriends over the year, not at once mind you as I'm not that kind of guy, but spread out across the year. I bring this up specifically as I feel like it may be a precursor to how I'am now and I believe it really stunted my ability to form human connections since my dating life was more or less a revolving door.

However, that was 4 years ago. 4 years ago I told myself I was just going to be alone after my last relationship ended. which was 8ish/9ish months, 4 of those filled with emotional/physical abuse every day from the woman I was seeing and it changed me. I was no longer the confident man I used to be. I lost my ability to make friends, to even make small talk with random strangers as I second guessed my every action and every word I spoke. I've worked on that since and I feel like I'm ready to get out and date again and put myself out there. My problem is a woman's touch nearly opens the flood gates. At work or out it doesn't matter, I work in a predominantly female department and after they gave me hugs before the thanksgiving break I had to hurry to the time clock to get the heck outta dodge so they couldn't see the tears welling up in my eyes.

But how do I date? How do I convey appropriately that I feel vulnerable to a love interest without sending off 50 red flags? How would you react if a man you were planning on going out on date with told you that they were a emotionally a little fragile at the moment but working on it. I feel like dating and getting acclimated to physical connection again is how I eventually overcome this but how do I approach it? Thank you if you've read this far, I apologize for the length but I will admit it was therapeutic to vent and put some stuff into words after a decade. Thank you again.

TLDR, how in the heck do I get back out there?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5a3zf/i_30m_crumble_at_the_touch_of_a_woman_help_me/
72,r5a7h7,1638232804,My girlfriend and I took a break because of long distance but I seem to be the only one interested in coming back together,"Exactly as the title says, she and I are both college students and due to one circumstance or another my girlfriend and I had been doing long distance since around January when we went back to school. Since then we made a few visits to each other throughout the spring semester and then during the summer while she was away for school. I’m someone who really enjoys being around a person and am not really great at communication over the phone. When we had started dating I was under the impression that we would have spent the summer together and that would’ve been enough. However she ended up getting offered a super sweet internship near where she goes to school and would end up spending most of the summer there.

This ended up being a lot on me mentally and emotionally as it was hard for me to express or feel love over the phone. Her work also kept her very busy during the summer and we both had busy schedules in the semester between her job and class work and me being a collegiate athlete on top of a busy schedule for classes too. It was really stressful and we ended up deciding to go on a couple weeks into the semester until we were together again. We agreed that it would be ok if we hooked up with other people while on break, but I specified that I didn’t care for that and wouldn’t be.

Throughout the semester we stayed in touch loosely but it was sporadic at best and we didn’t talk very much for space. Fast forward to now, we were both home for thanksgiving and since we have mutual friends we all met up at a bar. However when we actually got together again she didn’t seem like she wanted anything to do with me. I’ve been beyond hurt I’ve tried to text her to talk but she doesn’t seem like she feels the same way I do despite agreeing.  I was under the impression that the break was something we agreed on mutually.

I’m not so naïve to think that she had to wait for me or anything like that. I’m mainly asking for advice on how the hell I get past this mentally. Is it worth even trying to talk to her about it? What would I say? I’m still in love with her but ik it’ll be hard to work with going back to distance so do I hold my tongue until we graduate and won’t have to do distance again? Because if this past semester is any indication it might be too late. I know I’m probably a hopeless romantic at this point so id also love advice about just how to move on. My past relationship ended when she cheated so I don’t still have feeling this strong and idk what to do.

73,r5a7wr,1638232838,Should I should stand up to silent treatment or simply block/ignore and move on?,"*Quick backstory:* I (24M) started dating a girl (21F) I matched off Tinder a month ago and things seemed to be going well (she would be eager to already talk about Christmas Vacations plans with me and what I was going to do on my/her birthday etc.).  


Living in Japan, I've had much better results in scoring dates with foreign women, but she was the first Japanese girl that I felt I could have a something going on with (I'm half japanese, so apart from some rare instances, I can communicate with anyone just fine).  


We both expressed to be looking for a LTR, and even though I wanted to kiss her on our second date, she said she'd want to wait until the third.  


Some red flags:

1) She answers late, and texts have started feeling less enthusiastic (she may just not be *that* into texting).

2)After our second date, she cancelled our third an hour before. I let it pass because she had a fever, which turned out to be true (no prob for me).

3)Seems kind of flaky and prone to mood swings.  


Now, at this point I was pretty much ready to next her cause the interest on her part seemed to be dwindling by the day, until she wrote to me that she liked me but that she wanted me to wait a bit for her to deal with some emotional issues she's currently going through (f.e. she quit her job because of a stalker who showed up every day).  


I said to her I was gonna give her space, and that she could hit me up with a call if she wanted to talk.  


Surprise surprise, she saw me posting photos of myself at a Thanksgiving party and asked if we could talk.

After I agreed but told her I would be able to only after I got home from the party, I made the mistake to misunderstand a text from her by interpreting *""I'll call you when I get off the train""* as *""Call me when YOU get off the train""* (japanese is tricky as the verb subject is many times implied and not directly stated).

  
Because of this, my drunk-self tried calling her once I got off my train, which she immediately replied to in nasty fashion that she already told me she was still on the train.  
After I told her to wait for me to get home she got mad at me because of this whole language-based misunderstanding, even replying to me with *""Shut Up"", ""You're bothersome""* when I tried explaining myself that this misunderstanding was due to me being a bit drunk (I should've just flat told her to reschedule the call).  


After sending me one final message in which she expressed how she didn't wanna talk with someone drunk (I was coming back from a party what did she expect), I sincerely apologized and told her when I was gonna be free the next days if she wanted to talk with me.

I apologized again the day after once I realized I may have hurt her feelings (she may have wanted to talk about something important that day), and that I was open to reconcile with her over this misunderstanding and language issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it's been 6 days and even though she read all my texts, she hasn't even bothered answering me.

  
She's also always one of the first ones who views my Instagram stories for some reason (I've just continued posting me having fun with my friends lol).  


Even if this isn't meant to be a punitive silent treatment (something I never forgive) and it's just her cooling off, I feel like it's still disrespectful towards somebody like me who forgave all her mistakes and tried to be as empathetic/caring as possible.  


A simple ""I'm still mad at you for what happened, I need a week to cool off before we both hurt ourselves even more"" would've been enough.  


I don't know if she'll ever come back (she still has some of the stuff I lent her), but if she will, I don't know if I should either:  


1)Ignore her = give her a taste of her own medicine

2)Confront her on how horribly she made me feel and that it is not acceptable 

3)Listen to whatever excuse she comes up with for her lack of conflict resolution skills 

4)Just end things altogether  


What do you think is the best approach if she comes back?

Last couple of days she's really nosedived the effort towards me :( I'm literally trying my best to initiate conversation with her and I'm getting little back.

I decided to gently ask what was wrong days ago when I noticed it start happening. She said nothing was wrong and that she only wants to get to know me, no other guys. And she also said that if there was any other guys, she'd ignore them... hmm 🤔 

I'm now consistently getting slow replies (I don't always reply instant. I'm not clingy, don't worry aha, but I'm not hours without replying). 

She didn't even text me today after I was left on read from the previous night. So I text her ""hey, everything ok?"" Which she said she's been too busy to look at her phone. Not even when you saw my reply and left it on read?

80,r5amds,1638234035,I just had my heart broken (M/26),"So this is still pretty fresh in my mind and only happened a few days ago. Details myself and the girl (F/25) that I've been seeing was in a post I made just over a week ago if you want to read it [here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/qy3n7f/really_like_this_girl_but_getting_anxious_the/)

So the last time I was able to actually see her was earlier this month. Haven't seen her since. Ever since the last time we hung out, she's been increasingly distant, sporadic and kept rescheduling proposed dates to see each other. We had planned to go for a coffee this past Sunday, but I had to call it off because of a family emergency. So turns out she was planning to break it off with me in person, but because I couldn't make it, she decides to send me a text instead that night because she couldn't put it off any longer. 

Anyhow, it absolutely shattered me and I was in tears for hours that night. She said that, despite how great or thoughtful or kind she said I was, she felt like something was missing and there was a lack of a spark. Now I don't even know what to take from that. From where I was standing, I had invested a lot of myself emotionally to her and felt like I did everything right to make it work. But she's just not looking for the same thing, I guess. She has said before that her previous relationships never worked out because they were all jerks, so maybe someone actually treating her right scared her off a little bit? I don't even know.

It's just making me second guess everything and thinking I'm not good enough or that I did something wrong and I can't stop thinking about it. I told her how I felt and we ended it amicably but it just hurts so much because of the feelings I had for her and, while I thought they were reciprocated for some time, turns out that she never really felt the same way - so I do feel a bit led on as well.

I just need some words of advice to get over this. I want to get out there again, because I do want a relationship and I know what I want and what I can offer to the right girl, but it scares me as well if it doesn't work out and I just get my heart broken again.

I have met this girl in a bookstore and then proceeded to ask her out for dinner. She says yes and we hit it off pretty well, and it went really well for almost 2 weeks straight. We talked for hours, she told her friends about me and seemed genuinely interested in me. 

When thanksgiving came around then she told me that she’s gonna be busy with her family over the weekend, so she isn’t trying to ghost me but its just a really busy weekend of hers. I told her that it is not a problem and that she can text me whenever she’s free. 

Later that night she sends me a goodnight text and the next day “good morning”. I was happy that she was still thinking about me although its a busy week of hers, but then she later texts me saying “Hey so I think i am a little overwhelmed at the moment and I have a lot of stuff going on and need time to reflect. I’m heading out of town and I wont be able to talk to you until im back.” I responded with an okay and then I ruined the entire thing by asking if she would tell me if she’s uninterested in me. Which then she responds with “I really enjoyed our time together, I just don’t have the time to commit to a relationship right now” 
And now im in misery because I caught feelings with this girls faster than i could imagine. And now I’m wondering if I can recover.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5an95/i_have_went_on_3_dates_with_this_girl_and/
82,r5ao35,1638234175,"After a promising start to things, it appears im back to square one","Hi friends, I am single (M40) and I used to like one woman (F31, who doesn't like me back, so I'm over her now) and I like another woman (F26,  who flirts with me at work but that's about it)

 Anyways I went on a date from a dating app over the weekend...

Tbh it was a really nice time.  I usually have horrible luck on apps and I've deleted my account several times, but for someone reason I got a ton of matches and replies this time..

anyways the match I was most interested replied and set up a date.  Unfortunately I had to ghost 3 other women in the process, but I was really excited to meet this person.

Anyways she (F35) and I went out and had a nice time, I thought we hit it off and I didn't want to ruin anything by trying to make out with her or grabbing her butt or anything so we left it at that and said goodnight.

We started talked a bit the next day through text. her overall tone seemed indifferent to me.  I did ask to see her again and she didn't say ""no"" but certainly didn't seem as interested or excited as some of the other girls that i had just ghosted.

To be fair, her tone was kind of indifferent from the very beginning, but I was expecting a bit more excitment after we met in pereon, just compared to other dates I've been on in the past.

So now we're still talking, somewhat, and it's out there that I want to see her again, but it's basically a ""let me check my schedule and let you know"" kind of deal. 

I dont want to keep texting someone that isn't all that interested in me, but I dont want ghost her too early either.

Honestly with all the bad or just subpar dates I've been on for a while now, I was really excited about this one and looking forward to a second one.  But getting emotionally invested for another let down just seems like more then I want to deal with right now.

Honestly it's been more then five years since I've been on a good date with someone I was actually excited about",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5ao35/after_a_promising_start_to_things_it_appears_im/
83,r5ao5g,1638234180,Does my fwb like me as more,"What are some signs that your fwb is actually interested in you or just an affectionate and respectful person?

In my case: we (I’m 21 f and he’s 23 m) haven’t defined what we are, still early stages of hanging out and getting to know each other. Some things that make me doubt we are fwb includes...

1. Checking in/calling everyday
2. Sex ends in cuddles and forehead kisses and looking deeply into each other’s eyes, caressing each other’s faces
3. Planning restaurants or events to go together
4. Dancing only with me, holding me in the club like a couple
5. Choosing to hang out with me over his friends who are doing “single people stuff” in the evenings
6. Addressing each other on text with “b” or “love” 

I have told him I like him and I compliment him often and I know he makes cautious decisions to not hurt me. Comes across as quite shy about these things (grew up a nerd, inexperienced) so it’s hard to read it. 

I don’t know if he’s just a one-woman man and a bit of a gentleman naturally and we’re just becoming closer as friends with the added intimacy or if this is heading in the dating direction.

Now I have sent quotes in the past but I always send the picture and don’t claim it as my own. This individual claims they are not quotes and that they mean what they say to me.

86,r5b3yc,1638235512,Girlfriend and I have issues with each other’s past,"Before dating I already knew that my girlfriend had a one night stand with my friend, however I thought I was able to overlook that due to her amazing qualities. However, during the whole duration of our ongoing 6 month relationship my girlfriend would (and still does) often raise issues that severely affected her about how I had one night stands, where it has caused me to overthink about her past history. 

As some backstory, my girlfriend had feelings for my friend last December. However right after they stopped talking, she had a fwb with another person she supposedly liked for 2 months. A month after, she went to a birthday party where she saw my friend, and my friend lied to her about how him and his other friends were going back to his to smoke weed. His actual intention was to bring my girlfriend back to his place to have sex. She was supposedly unaware of this even when she arrived at his house and realised that it would just be my friend and her together. They proceeded to drink alcohol and smoke some weed then slept in the bed together and had sex. 

This has severely affected me as sometimes when someone mentions my friends name I get extremely uncomfortable and short of breath. It also makes me feel disgusted where I physically feel like vomiting and have messed up toxic thoughts about how she may be viewed as ‘damaged goods’.

Recently I have also been getting nightmares about her cheating and lying to me. I have told her this current issue and she has been extremely supportive and has reassured me that she only loves me, however I cannot get the image of my friend having sex with my girlfriend out of my head. 

I know this is an extremely unreasonable way to think and I want to change my mindset regarding this issue but am severely struggling. I have suggested seeing a couples therapist however my girlfriend strongly does not want to see any form of psychologist. 

Are there any ways I can get over this issue and are there any ways I can help my girlfriend get over her issues with my past? Because I truly believe that once this issue is solved, I can see myself marrying and growing old with her because of her amazing qualities and our compatibility.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5b3yc/girlfriend_and_i_have_issues_with_each_others_past/

I started dating someone I had been hooking up with for years and she dumped me after 2.5 months. She was explaining things in a way that sounded like she wants a ""situationship"".

It finally started clicking this year - all of the things I do to select for the wrong partner are now top of mind. Now, I find myself being much more selective. It scares me because I feel this gravitational pull towards the “ticking clock” that is called fertility. I’m constantly straddling the awareness of my desire to start a family, and the awareness that I deserve a healthy relationship and a partner that I jive with authentically. 

It’s also hard here in Austin, where the wind blows people will float with it. People are searching for the perfect fit as if it exists, and each move that feels a little uncomfortable may be your last. What if I’ve become too selective, like everyone else? What if we all get nowhere? Small bits of me want to make compromises that don’t feel right for the sake of having a partnership, but I know how wrong that is and how upset with myself I’ll be when it all falls apart.

I have a podcast and sometimes she would say something about an episode and that’s how we would stay in touch. Fast forward to like 1/2 weeks ago she responds to a storie of mine on IG and since then we really didn’t stop talking, 3 days ago she was talking about going to a rooftop bar and I just said “hope you have fun” (This is me thinking this is platonic) and she responds “well if you want you can join me because I was going alone anyway”

She responded with “Dude I’d love to go but I have a grudge against that bubble tea place” in which she then explained why she doesnt like it. But what confused me is that I asked her if she had any other suggestions to see if she was actually interested in going somewhere with me but she just said “idk there’s nothing near our school” and didn’t try to push to do something else. This really confused me because if she really was super interested she would try to reschedule something else, but she used such a strong word of love to show her desire to go, so my brain is in shackles rn. I don’t really care a lot if I really did get rejected because i can’t control someone else liking me back, but this is giving me mixed signals and confusing me. So, I decided to just let her make the next move to see if she actually is interested in me like that and see if she makes it awkward when I see her face to face again. Also to give context she’s a girl who’s blunt, honest, doesn’t care what others think about her, and has rejected guys before by just saying that she’s too busy with school or extra curriculars.
