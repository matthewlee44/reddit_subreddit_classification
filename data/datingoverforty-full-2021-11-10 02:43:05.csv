It is a mostly good relationship and I feel loved and I am definitely in love.

We have traveled together before and have plans and tickets/itineraries to do so again. At his suggestion we planned to return to his hometown for Thanksgiving. He then backed off that citing his sister not being ready to introduce his tween nephews to someone new. I didn’t love that and don’t think tweenage boys give a single care who their long distance uncle is boning but whatever. I don’t interfere with family decisions. He said we will do our holidays together and he will just make a quick solo trip home between you fulfill those obligations. And that was good enough for me.

Last night it came out the real reason is he hasn’t told his ex wife he is in a serious relationship and he’s not ready to. This is unacceptable to me. He was married when we started dating but she had moved thousands of miles away months before we met and in my conversations with him leading to us becoming a couple I believed him to be committed to divorcing and already having grieved the marriage. He was quick to finalize the divorce when I made it clear that was a condition of becoming serious. He is divorced. It’s not keeping me a secret from his wife but keeping me a secret from his ex wife.

I am seriously considering ending our relationship over this even though I love him and see real potential. I don’t want to go out of my way or his to hurt his ex but I believe any feelings she has about this that aren’t a mixture of grief for the marriage, sadness he loves someone else, happiness for him to move on, are not appropriate and healthy and are not mine or his to manage. And I feel that I deserve a place of high priority in his life, as he has in mine. I believe I deserve to be loved in such a way that my partner wants to take me home and doesn’t need to hide me from anyone.

I'm a youthful 41 at heart, but feel much older in soul, and therein lies my difficulty. By 40, I had lost both parents, and my wife of 11 years, to disease. The recovery has been slow, but recently I find myself thinking about possibly trying to date again. Through a lot of soul searching and reflection I find myself less attracted to women around my age, and more so to women in their 50's and 60's. 

So many around my age are either looking to start a family (some frantically so), or are recently divorced and are dealing with that trauma, kids, etc. Others I can't seem to relate to in terms of life priorities. I feel very disconnected from people around my age outside of casual social interaction. I should say that I don't have kids, nor desire to begin at this point.

So I'm drawn to those who are older than I, who may share similar experiences, similar loss, and the shift in perspective these things bring. Life experience, tenacity, survival, wisdom... Those are what draw me to a person.

I have a few very platonic female friends/acquaintances who are older than I, and the impression I'm given is that a woman in her 50's or 60's would never think a man in his early 40's would take interest.  So I'm seeking perspective from anyone who can offer. Are women of this age interested in dating a man in his 40's? Is age a thing at that point? Or is it simply about the ability to connect and relate? 

I don't know what I'm looking for long-term. These are just small steps. This is a very interesting situation I find myself at middle-age. Both confusing and fascinating.

I am visiting home to help my mother recover after surgery. Duration of my stay is 5 weeks. My teenage children are with their father in the US. They go to school there and have their life. 

I wanted to have a fling, an adventure and went on Tinder. Met a guy, had a good chat. I didn’t love his looks, he is not my type and I backed out of a date we discussed. He checked in again with me and was so nice and invited me for dinner. I agreed to go and had dinner with him. 

To my greatest surprise we instantly clicked. It was a wonderful date and we ended up kissing and went for a romantic walk. We went to his place and cuddled and kissed and he asked me for another date two days later. We were very keen to see each other again and discussed meeting again soon for a day trip. He knew all along that my life is now in the US. 

He is a successful businessman who is 10 years older than me and has grown kids who live in the UK where he is originally from. He is settled and happy in Austria, intending to live there. 

We ended up at his place again and had sex. He then arranged a taxi (covered the cost both nights I visited him) and checked in with me. The next day I messaged him and we told each other we both had a lovely time. 

He didn’t message me for a day and then I asked how his day was and he told me his brother suddenly died from cancer earlier than expected and he is talking with his family. He will fly out to attend the funeral this Sunday and will be back on Thursday. 

I might be a fool but I feel that there is something amazing. Maybe it was just a fuck for him but maybe not. 

Given he is grieving I can’t really talk to him about us. Time is running out to get to know each other. He is not messaging much which is absolutely expected given this incredibly sad time. 

I asked if he might consider visiting my city and he said he always wanted to and one day he might. He wants to meet after he returns and before I go. 

I know it sounds crazy but I want him so. Given his circumstances (grown kids live in different country to him already and and his business doesn’t need him in Austria plus English is his mother tongue) he could even visit me or move there if he wanted. I have my own career, so no one has monetary interest here. 

In this situation I understand the lack of messages and obviously anyone would just sit and grieve. And not date and chat much. I very lightly hinted my feelings of wanting to get to know him better but I don’t want to disturb him. 

Due to my mother’s condition I might extend my stay but I can’t stay much longer as my kids need me. I can’t move back to Austria for the guy because my children are 13 and 15 (his are late 20s/30s). 

Am I right to think he likely will not even consider me even if he likes me? Is his response indicative of that? Or is it clouded by grief? He was close to his brother who was only 55.

It’s so hard because time is running out but in his case I would focus on my family not a woman I met 2x. 

I decided that maybe it’s best not to catch up before I leave because it would break my heart if he is not interested in exploring it further. In that case I won’t tell him if I’m extending my trip by a month or two. 

I know love finds a way, but it’s a tricky situation and I tend to think he is not interested in me. But hard to tell. He suggested a third date after sex. 

I’m not bothering him, I’m not messaging him just venting here.

I learned a lot, but I think I have hurt people along the way. 

I heard a lot of “you shouldn’t date post divorce.” I got angry with this because I was over my ex.  Which was true, as the marriage failed years before and we lived in separate bedrooms. I also harbored no anger or resentment of the failed marriage. The big BUT is, I didn’t know how much trauma I had been through.  Almost a year later from signed decree, it took a lovely woman that I had been seeing to tell me that I was selfish and wasn’t compromising.  We are no longer together. I treasure her bravery in communicating with me. 

My trauma from my marriage was there haunting me all along and I had no clue. I gave and gave in my marriage without compromise from my ex. And when I came out of the marriage my safety response must have been that with anyone new I wouldn’t give anything of me away as subconsciously I didn’t want to go back to that role in my marriage - as I wanted my needs met and that was it. It was simple things, not really asking how the other person is doing, when they ask how you are. Or keeping them out of things because inside you had to do it on your own because your ex-wife was part of that thing in the past.  I didn’t know that I hurt the woman I was with by declining something that she wanted to support me in. I also was not giving her her needs. The damage was done. I met her too early in my journey, she was the only person I’ve met that truly was empathetic to my past working through a spouse’s mental health issues. 

I know I’m not ready for a LTR - even though I want one. I struggle with this because I also don’t want to hookup as I don’t feel comfortable. 

I need to create my own memories before I can start dating long term. I need to learn again to be willing to open up and show my care about others and compromise again. I’ve lost the most important part of me and it’s scary to wonder if I can learn to bring it back. Thank goodness I’m still seeing my counselor. 

I think we are all broken.

With that said I have an honest question to ask the men here. Also anyone that is attracted to women regardless of your gender. This question is from a college friend of mine I’ve known forever who is a single woman and is about to start dating. She was married for 12 years and her ex-husband left her suddenly saying their entire relationship was a sham and that he didn’t ever love her. He had started a relationship with another woman at this point although he never confessed to it. They got very serious publicly right after the divorce papers were signed.

Her message for me to post is below.

“There are a variety of people and shapes and sizes no matter what the age. I went through different stages during our relationship. I was fairly slim and a little soft when we first met. May be in the 130 to 140 range being 5 foot five. After I had our child in my late 30s the changes with my body even as I  exercised were really a struggle. I was never able to get rid of the little pouch/pooch/shelf? That was my stretched skin and the muscles underneath even when i had exercised them left a pouch over my pubic area. My weight varied around 150 to 160 after having the kid over the last eight years. I lost a little weight when I really got into yoga and running. Obviously in my 40s my body continues to change and as i have gotten into the menopause area my metabolism has slowed down. With coronavirus and work being very demanding as a respiratory therapist i was not able to exercise as much and the muscle tone i had and the weight i lost went away and I’m pretty much back to how I looked after i had the baby and am around 160 pounds. I have become very self-conscious about it. Generally speaking when you meet a woman in her 40s and her body has changed because of pregnancy and in during menopause, especially those whose breast have sagged and stomachs will never be flat unless they have surgery no matter how much they exercise. do you guys think this is disgusting? I feel so gross. When I am intimate that pouch flaps up and down and looks like an ocean wave. My face is sagging now because of the old pregnancy weight and I just feel like A big saggy blob even though I only weigh 160 pounds… A tight size 10…. Probably should be at 12 but I just can’t except that I went from a size 6 to a size 12 in two years. I honestly want to know what a bunch of guys think. I can always work out more and always eat better but I do it while, pretty damn good job. With guys in their 40s Has it become more acceptable and expected for our bodies to be in this shape? It just doesn’t feel right to me. Also this is probably some confidence due to my ex-husband and his history of dating stick figures before and after our marriage. Thank you for your honest feedback.

I asked him if he wanted to go somewhere else, just him and I, so we could talk more. He declined.

I know it's super early from meeting him, but I've never had a guy turn me down for a drink or more 1 on 1 time  - especially when I offer to pay.

This happened to me a few months back. I met a very attractive woman who was 38, fit, and had a really nice down to earth attitude. 
We had dinner and decided to go for a walk. We started out and she pulled a pack of cigs from her purse and asked if it was ok if she smoked. Hiding my disappointment, I said no problem. We walked for 45 mins and she smoked one more on the way to her car. 
I just couldn't date her. She lied, and I cant stand smoking.

So ""met"" a guy on Bumble, a bit younger. Interesting good fun conversations on whatsapp since. Planned one date for last Sunday but he was sick with cold and it did not happen. Texting as usual and nice constant conversation, so I brought up to set another date. So we both agreed that Friday (today) would work but again since then nothing set in stone. I mentioned a place and to confirm time closer to the day. Nada. Yesterday I asked if we are still meeting up and the answer was ""I can't.I will be in ..(nother city)""
So I wished all the best in dating and to enjoy his weekend. He still kept texting after that I giving up already 😂
One thing i learned and have it as a rule if tgere is no concrete date set in stone withing first week of chatting then it is not going to happen. When do you give up?

Recently, I asked my gf of 3 months on her thoughts about marriage and if she was ever close to marriage with her past relationships. Immediately her whole body language shifted to defense then attack mode. 

To give you a bit of background, I am late to the dating and relationship game and most times I'm just flying blind. To help myself out, I read relationship books mainly from Gottman. Anyway, the books all said to ask about your partner's past so you can have a better idea what the future may look like. 

Anyway off I went with the question and then she chumped my head off. Why the fuck are you asking me about this and why do you want to know about it. I wasn't expecting her to become an attack dog. Later on through her angry responses she said that she went through several bad relationships and men cheated on her. Later on she said she hates drama and claims that I don't know what I want in my life. All the time I was thinking I asked you one question about your past.

Anyway long story short, a week later we were having  dinner. I refer back to the previous conversation. She said I had lied to her that I was happy with my life and I had brought baggage to the relationship and wanted her to solve my problems. There were other things and I addressed every one of them. She apologized for making wrong assumptions about me.

The thing is I get the sense that she got really hurt by her previous relationships and my problem is if I say anything that reminds her of something from her past and she is going to react badly.

We have a flirty friendship, but we live in different places and a relationship isn’t feasible for all those reasons. We have never dated or explored “fun” benefits, although we had talked about it in the past and ended up not following through for the above mentioned reasons on his part. We still text daily and get flirty at time’s , but he has said timing is just not right for him. 

I have lately considered going online and looking for more of a relationship. I was on tinder for a couple weeks a few months back but I wasn’t really ready to consider a relationship and I had a couple casual encounters. Overall I felt the tinder experience was a bit overwhelming and I hate the idea of wasting someone’s time or accidentally leading someone on. 

My question is, knowing that I have this unrequited “crush” at the moment, is it disingenuous for me to be on an online dating site? My two thoughts are that are on the one hand, I may meet someone I connect with more than the guy I mentioned, who is available to explore more with me. But I also feel like I am measuring others against him and it seems a bit unfair to the people reaching out to me. Is this old school thinking?
