Hi all! :)

I would like to ask for your help (if that's okay)!

I am currently doing research for my undergraduate degree and would like to ask you to take a minute to participate in my study!

The research is investigating the relationship between online dating and psychological well-being in the heterosexual population and I would really appreciate it if you took part.

So if you're using online dating apps, are heterosexual, 18years old or older, and would like to take part, here's the link:

I couldn't decide, felt like ""if it's not hell yes, it's no"", and said I felt more like a friend vibe. He respected that gracefully and invited me to ""be friends"" when we bumped into one another. 

Life began to throw us together, and then I made an effort to cross paths ""accidentally."" Every time I saw him since, I liked him a little more, but there was something that kept me from escalating. Sometimes we talked about other relationships we were in or pursuing. 

Over the pandemic, he leveled up hard, mostly mentally. My crush went from ambiguous to unmistakeable. Now, whenever I see him, I am an anxious MESS. I embarrass myself pretty much on every interaction and just cannot act chill. I feel like I'm not even myself...just a blathering idiot. 

He's a gregarious person and has always given me little compliments or noticed if I made a special effort, but I'm not sure that's unique to me. I'm not getting obvious signs that he's interested. He's a bit of an absent minded professor type, and I'm not sure he has any idea I like him. I'm dropping hints, but I think he's a bit clueless in the female attention department. He's also in an environment with a lot of young women who act ""harmlessly flirtatious"" with him with no intentions, so I might just blend in.

I've held off on saying anything because of other relationships in both our lives, but the path is clear now.

We get to see each other about twice a week and we both have children.  Around the 3 month mark we did have a situation where she was doubting the future of the relationship due to the amount of time we get with each other but since then we have managed it and things have been great.  She initially ended the relationship and I backed off but she came back to me within a few days.

She does not communicate how she is feeling so its hard to get an understanding of things with her.  Earlier this year we had a date night with her staying at mine and we ended up in a huge argument where she was raging at me, and honestly I was so confused. Drink was involved.  The next day she came over and apologised and said she thinks she is perimenopausal and ultimately got HRT for this.  I understood and supported her where I could, and educated myself on perimenopausal stages.  Since then I have experienced again with her in February but she brushed over it and said she couldn't remember and we are fine.  She doesn't open up and communicate very well at all (her words).  

Early Feb this year she was under a lot of stress with work, home life and kids, etc and slowly started to fade on the communication again to the point of not coming back to confirm plans when we had indicated that we are both free on the weekend.  We talked and again she went off on one so I left her place and sent a message to her when I got home.  She replied to my long message saying that there is too much to explain on text and she will come over the next day to talk.  She did come over but dismissed it and said everything is fine, but doesn't remember all she said.  She was drinking but I was driving that night.  

So that's all the bad stuff.  In between these occasions we have a great time together, sex is amazing, we don't argue apart from the above situations, talk on the phone regularly, text, and she tells me that I'm the best thing that has ever happened to her, how lucky she feels and she loves me. 

Around a week and half ago I messed up and caused an argument after a shitty day at work and I wrongly vented it towards her and misunderstood what she was saying.  I apologised straight away but she wanted to leave, which I respected.  I gave her some space and tried to talk to her after this but she is cold and has now finished the relationship stating that too many issues keep cropping up mostly on her part or because of her.  I know she has had bad relationships in the past and her kids father doesn't see their children so she has done everything on her own.  

So questions:  Do I walk away or try and save the relationship? I love her and she says she loves me.  Its her birthday next week and I have already purchased a spa day for her to get some 'her' time and relax.  It wasn't cheap.  I'd still like to give it to her even if this is the end.

The thing is because he refers to her as his wife, makes me feel like I won’t ever be his main women.

For example he’d say “my wife drove this rav 4 and one day… “  or “my wife would have wanted me to move on”

  I realize this question has been asked in various forms over the years, but I feel like mine is specific enough to warrant another go.

Im a 47 year old guy, fit, active, moderately attractive, professional with a great career who has no kids and currently single. I moved to a semi-large southern/midwestern city a year ago as a career move and while it IS fairly large, its very rural in personality. Theres limited growing industry here; you might call this place a dying city.Its a pretty horrible place to date as a single non parent, educated well-traveled guy. There are limited single people and its not really transient enough to have anyone new come through (lets just say that I can start bumble and get through all potential matches in a single day).  Overall,  Im pretty unhappy here and even though the work is amazing, I don't think I can say.  

All that said, I may have just been thrown a lifeline. I was just soft-offered a promotion to a global role where have responsibilities in several places in the US and also in Europe. While this will require me to travel more, I'll have no home base requirements. My company is large enough that all the US states are fair game. I would have peers that live I AZ, NC, TX, PA etc.

  My thoughts on all of this is that while I feel like a bit of a leper here where Im at, there are parts of the country that Im quite the catch. Whenever I travel to certain areas, and turn on my apps its a night and day difference for me specifically. Some of these areas, I would be really into living for some other reasons as well (activities, weather etc) so what Im thinking is while Im learning the new job, I could travel to my top 3-4 locations that fit this bill and stay in an AIRBNB for a month or two while I feel out the area and the dating potential. This feels like such an exciting thought that It has me really energized... However, Im not sure how it would read to the opposite sex. Would they think Im hiding a wife in another state (Im certainly not) ? Would they think less of me because Im not settled down in a house in the suburbs?

43M dating 38F for four months. Physically things are great. We spend 4 entire days out of every two weeks together. We’re always holding hands when walking from the car to stores. I’m big on physical touch and like to stroke her hair, arms, a graze as I walk by, etc. when we are close and she has commented how much she likes it. It’s to the point it makes her so comfortable it often puts her to sleep. She also reciprocates touch, not to the degree I give, but more than enough. 

This is all just background to say that while I wouldn’t necessarily touch her all these same ways in public, touch is something very important to me, she is very responsive to, and has always been a major positive aspect of the relationship. 

We met each other’s kids for the first time within the last month. Full understanding that with this being the first time any of our kids seeing their parent around a romantic interest since their parents’ divorce, there would be very minimal PDA and keep things as platonic as possible, we’re both fully on the same page. Fast forward to last weekend when I was to see her kids for the third time where we would meet at a trail for a hike. I mention something like wanting to get a nice long kiss when we part (kids would be strapped in and we could easily stand behind the car where they can’t see) and I get a comment from her something to the effect that she’s not good with PDA. I assume this means like around strangers in the parking lot and think nothing of it. 

Now today I come to her house and one of my kids meets her kids for the first time. They are off playing and I also get to meet her mom. I’m there for 2.5 hours and while she will follow me into a room I’m in alone to get a hug and a kiss, the only time she ever touches me in front of another person is one quick peck as we are leaving. 

All this to say, I feel like “not good with PDA” really means she is not comfortable having any PDA to any degree around anyone she knows personally. I could ask her about it, but actions speak louder than words. My concern is that by now she’s met my kids, I’ve met her kids, they’ve met each other, I’ve met her mom, and I’ve met a dozen of her friends. This is no longer “let’s take things slow when we’re around kids/etc.”, this is just the way she is.

I’m 40/f dating a 50/m for two weeks. It started as just sex from the first night but now we hang out with his friends, etc. 4-5x each week I stay at his house. We went away for a quick weekend trip to stay with another couple of his friends this weekend. We got along great and my date and I too had a great time together. 

I wouldn’t call it a kink but I live in the south and I love southern men who are “blue collar” or as we say know how to work with their hands. That being said I’m kind of an alternative type of person. Fairly tattooed, my friends are a varied group of folks but we’re all liberal as far as politics go. I’ve always said I would never date a republican; it’s a deal breaker. Well, enter my new prospective love interest. I’ve been actively trying to date men who are more settled and less wild. I recently kinda dated a 30/m friend but he was just too wild for me in my older years. The 50/m is very settled, self made and successful in his life except for his love life. Never married and no kids but he still wants both. On our little getaway I confirmed my suspicion that he’s a centrist politically and on some issues he leans right or left. He’s pro choice but I didn’t delve further as we were on a trip. I figure I can probe further on neutral ground… so, does anyone have experience in dating someone whose political party doesn’t align? I’m no politician but I fairly keep up in politics and I could be considered a bleeding heart liberal. We’ve both successfully avoided inflammatory conversations when politics were mentioned (it never even got close to inflammatory and I’ve noticed he avoids the topic in a respectful manner) and I’m wondering if we can keep it that way? He checks almost every box I’m seeking in a partner aside from political party. I just worry I’d be cutting my nose off to spite my face if I dumped him for his politics as I’m no spring chicken. At the same time, I’m breaking my own rule by continuing to date him. He’s kind, tender, intelligent, chivalrous, attractive and for some reason he really likes me. Should things continue to move along I would of course have a conversation about this with him and if he too can handle this difference.

Help??

TL;DR: 40/f liberal dating a 50/m centrist with possibly some right leaning beliefs wondering if anyone has any advice based on their personal experience of dating outside their political party? As long as he’s not hiding some deep dark secret dealbreaker I could see myself with him long term.

I am in a relationship with a person for 3 months now. I am a widower with 2 young daughters. She has never been married and stays alone with her two cats. We mostly spend time at her place. Many times during casual conversation she refers to her cats as her kids. At times I try to just laugh it off but then realize that she is somewhat sensitive towards this.

When I was young I had myself had a stray kitten for few months so I know how to handle cats. However today I don't see myself living with cats inside my house. I am really not sure how to react to all this. I am sure if she moves out of town for few days, she would want to leave them in my care.

How do you folks react towards your partner's pets, in terms of belonginess when you have moved ahead in relationship and you feel you can commit to the other person.

I’ve been trying to be adult about my feelings, and treat them as though they aren’t as big as they feel.  Apparently, I have no idea what I’m doing because I’m not feeling any better, I think about her way too much, and it’s been over a month now.  Hopefully someone here understands and can tell me what to do.  

So when this first happened, my wife and I were going through a long rut.  I talked to her and even told her what was going on with the girl at work.  This situation woke us up from the routine of going through the motions of life together.  Things between my wife and I have possibly never been better now.  So this is a great thing, however, when I see the girl at work, I still can’t shake the feelings and it is taking a huge toll on me; my work, and makes me doubt that things will remain positive with my wife.  

So when this started, as I said, I was stunned by this woman.  She seemed to like me too and there were a couple of days where I wasn’t in control of myself, and I may have lead her on a bit.  This reached a point on the day after we met, where I was at her cubicle at the end of the day when noone else was around and I started some small talk with her, and when I felt it might be time to make a move, I woke up and realized what I was doing, and I somewhat abruptly left the situation.  So abruptly, that it was a little weird.  Since then, it’s been all work talk, and I’ve been trying to leave it that way.  So, no big deal, right?  There was just a little bit of innocent flirting, and I stopped.  This would be fine, but I see her every day at work and my thoughts about her continue to get away from me.  This happens over and over.  

So you know, I would have had no problem with this before I was married.  I would have asked her on a date pretty quickly and it would be settled one way or the other.  -Thing is, I don’t know if she even feels remotely the way I feel or not.  -AND if I ask her, and she does feel similarly, I know I will not be able to prevent it from becoming a romantic relationship.  I’m certain that if it comes to that, I will have no choice.  I mean, if I’m having a hard time seeing her now, how will I feel if I know she wants to be with me? So that is my reasoning for not talking to her and finding out.  I thought time would make this better, but it is not.  Conversely, however, if she doesn’t feel about me the same as I feel about her, it would be great.  Then I could go on with my life.  

I know it might seem strange that I would have such powerful feelings about this.  I don’t even know this girl hardly at all.  I suspect my past is a part of it.

I am a male of 46 years old now. I just realized that throughout my dating experience has yielded  nothing but heartache, pain and financial ruin. I have only my obliterated heart to show for.  I had to endure the cruelty and the emotional dumpster fire of my life. ZERO relationships. Cucked against my will, indulging professional restaurant goers, driving my dates to their dates. I feel so bad I let theses people do these things to me.

I am not taller than 5ft6 on a good day. I do not make 6 figures annually and Objectively the ONLY silver lining of my life is that I have 6 figures in savings as I was always retained good legal council when they tried to take valuable things from me. (Canadian legal craptastik system).

It was explained to me that I am just attractive enough to be the disposable throwaway fluffer because I have a healthy body that can run marathons on a regular basis. As a young man I was deployed to the middle east and I had an unfortunate enough to get disfigured. It was also explained to me that I am too nice, too available, I am a simp,  I'm a beta bitch. I've been Airport Ghosted a few times on flights that I paid for.

The prospect of never finding love is interesting to examine at my advanced age now. I've purged ALL of my socials just now.  And I give up.  And this makes me sad and I feel sorrow in the strict Webster dictionary definition. Every few years I question my sexuality? My gender? my sanity? Can I make through my upcoming golden years loveless? are there support groups for people in my situation?

I just came in from my first date in 3 years. I matched with this actually remarkable looking person, exchanged pleasantries and I fell for the come and pick me up at the bar so we go and get coffee. It was surreal because I thought I believed her.  She had friends. they wanted a ride to the next bar. and laughed at me in the car while driving. I dropped them off and left.

I want to reconcile what the mechanism that makes love something to look for and how to live without it. I am also considering chemical castration just so I don't need to feel love and give up on seeking intimacy.  I regret living like this.

I feel like the older I get dating becomes more and more shallow... nobody cares about character, belief, or values so much as they care about if you are good looking and make good money or have nice things. 

I feel like I will never be in love again, because what I loved about people in the past just doesn't seem to exist in people my own age anymore? I feel like relationships now progress and become more shallow vs becoming more deep. My girlfriends of the past 5 years were more interested in my bank accounts, credit scores, and whether I could support kids while maintaining a bougie lifestyle rather than if I would love those kids. 

My last year of dates don't ever seem interested in anything deep, or having long conversations... just doing fun things and have a good time, then getting down to 'business' of whether or not we can 'get serious' in terms of money...

People seem to stereotype young dating as shallow and older dating as more mature and deep, but my experience has been the opposite. Each year goes by and my dates get easier but they get more shallow... people seem to care about dishware more than they care about what you believe in and who you are. And if you try to ask about deeper things... well goodbye, they don't like you anymore, those conversations are 'depressing'. OK... but that's the kind of stuff that made me fall in love in my 20s and 30s...

I'm a pretty idealistic person. I devoted my life to education, learning, and helping others. My girlfriends in my 20s and early 30s saw that as admirable... now people just seem to think it's weird at best and I feel like I'm just being dated for my looks and charm vs having a real connection based on shared values and dreams like used to? Not sure how I can fall in love with anyone at this age if most of what matters to them is what kind of car I drive in the future?

I always had long monogamous relationships and I was very much into looking after my exes and not focusing on what I really want etc.

These years have been great to discover my hobbies, learning a new language, volunteering etc.

The last 3 years I have been having a situationship with a guy, mainly netflix and chill dates. The sex and intimacy are amazing but nothing else. We had the exclusivity talk and he chose to continue non exclusive. I decided to stop seeing him because we are not moving forward and because it is only sex at the end of the day. 

Now it has been a couple of months and I do miss the intimacy and the sex and having someone to share some nights with. I had tinder again but I didn't see myself starting again with the matches, the chatting, etc

I feel bad for not being able to tolerate not being exclusive when I personally do not want this person as a boyfriend, and I could have kept having my regular oxytocin dosage. I miss that our sex together came very natural, we never had to tell each other what we liked etc,

I'm struggling not to reach out again to him but up to know I still see that there is no point in going back because if I am with him, I have my sexual needs covered for example so I am not looking for anybody who maybe can fulfill me more in other ways.

I am also not sure if after so many years I would be able to be in a relationship seeing someone every day or even living with someone else right now gives me the creeps.

Last time I was using apps, I spent a couple months dragging a tripod and shutter remote around in case I found a good opportunity for a profile photo.  It worked out pretty well, I matched with someone and stopped needing to take pics of myself.

After we broke up, I realized that almost all of the pictures of me from the past two years were taken by her.  Un the upside, she is a great photographer.  The downside is using these pics reminds me of her, and generally feels kinda tasteless.   We dated for long enough that all my photos from before that time aren't 100% true to who I am these days: grayer and rounder.

I could get a professional photographer to take photos, but that's not going to add much breadth to my profile.  I'd get friends to take photos, but most of them are impossible to get out of the house.

Went on a weird date just now and immediately I can tell the woman wasn't feeling it.  We continued on with a drink but as we were close to finishing there was an awkward silence and I upfront and told her ""If you're not feeling it you're free to go...""

She went on to tell me that I didn't come off as ""edgy"" as my photos/text led her to believe. I guess I kind of am but I tend to be genuinely polite whenever I am meeting anyone for the first time. 

She went on to say (among many other things) how I need to be my authentic self, and not suggest a ""bourgie"" place for drinks when I could have suggested a dive bar. Mind you up until this point she made no attempt to get to know me or ask any questions. Yet, she seem to know exactly what I was doing wrong in my dating life.
