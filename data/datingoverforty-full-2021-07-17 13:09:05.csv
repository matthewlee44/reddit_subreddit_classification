Work became super hectic for the both of us in May and June. Still talked every day. Met his family and friends. Still did things together, but the frequency dropped off. I wasn’t concerned because we were both exhausted. 

He had to travel for training for two weeks (beginning of July) and then immediately after that he was headed out on vacation with his kids. Talked to him on 7/2. His training started on the 5th. He texted me on the 6th to ask about a big interview I had had that day. I did reply. No response. No big deal-he’s in training. After a week I called and texted him, but no response. 

I don’t feel anxious or worried per se. He has always been reliable and consistent. At first I shrugged the lack of communication off and knew he would contact me after he got back from vacation, but now I’m stuck in my head and thinking maybe this is his way of ending things. Why? I don’t know. I’m having a hard time distinguishing between the narrative my brain has concocted and my intuition.

We both acknowledged the distance, but also that we didn't mind because we like to go on road trips, etc.

The date went really well and we spent about 5 hours together. When I got home, I texted him to let him know I got there and I mentioned that we could get together this weekend if he wanted to.  He said something to the effect of ""sounds good"", and he mentioned that he also had a good time.

The next day the texts slowed way down and got way shorter and then nothing.  There had also been no mention of weekend plans obviously.  I figured he was not interested, which is fine, but I felt weird about the fact that he sent silent, because we talked quite a bit before we got together and seemed to really get along.

I was thinking about it today, and I decided to send him a final text, and it went like this:
""Hey! I'm assuming the feeling isn't mutual about us going out again, and that is totally fine! I wish you all the best, and it was really great meeting you.""
It just seemed like the adult thing to do because he genuinely seemed like a nice guy. I got a text back within a few minutes that was him apologizing and saying that he didn't mean to ghost me, but he had thought about it and the distance is just too far for him.

I can be honest with my cousin about a lot of things and the feelings of desperately wanting to date and breed have been really weighing on me at times.

I'm so desperate I'd hit that just for the chance to have a kid or some sort of sex!""

When we got back to my place we actually talked about the idea of me just going on one of these breeding forums i found a few years back and just hooking up with someone to have a kid.  She actually thought it was a good idea.  But she did ask me how desperate was i at that point and i admitted to her that there was a time in the past where i seriously considering asking one of my female cousins if we could have a kid together.  Of course my cousin thought this was kind of gross and asked me why i would have even considered that.  I was honest with her and in my mind at least i could have a child with some one i could trust not to be some lunatic and we could get along and not have to marry if she didn't want to. Or even she could simply give said child to me to raise on my own.  I know it seems weird but i guess that's where the desperation creeps in.

So my GF (43) and I (46) broke up yesterday after a little more than a year together.  It was about a month in the making.  We had gone on a vacation with her kids, and her ex and his GF last month and since we got back she's just been distant.  We talked about it, and there were some things on my end, minor, that occurred, but in her eyes they were a lot of small things over time, building up.  

At the same time I had been questioning the relationship as well recently.  I just wasn't getting from her what I wanted in a relationship.  So we broke up yesterday, she came by today to drop off her key and we talked for a little while and we both are hurt by this, but we both know it's for the best.

Then how come it hurts me so much?  I'm really sad cause I really loved her, but I know I'll overcome the broken heart and I'll eventually be happy again - but it really hurts right now. :(

Doesn't help that I live alone (divorced a short time before I met my GF) and I don't have many friends in the area to hang out with and take my mind off her.

Still in the grief and healing phase of a lost marriage. A lot of what went wrong is obvious, some moderately mysterious, but two things are absolute twilight zone to me. I ask for your guesses/intuition/gut feelings about what these might mean. In the interest of brevity, I won’t write a novel unless specifically asked. 

My wife filed for divorce. I knew it was coming. She denied the intent until they day she told me she wanted a divorce. She put all the marital assets out of my reach, told me she filed for divorce with her attorney, and told me tomorrow I will have the police remove me from the house. The part that stumps me is she said, “I am divorcing you because I love you.” Any insight into that?

A very brief conversation took place. I mentioned her having placed all the cash into accounts I can not access and truthfully didn’t have access to enough cash for fuel to leave town for family. I was informed she didn’t think I deserved any money, or that I should get any of the proceeds from the sale of the house we bought together when we married. That’s not the confusing part. When I told her I did not want an argument and that I would not resist her efforts at a divorce but did demand 50% of the house proceeds so I could restart my life, she said that everything she is doing is because “she is just trying to do everything she can to help me.” Thoughts? Sound like a concerned friend?

I think it will be important for me to come to some conclusion about these statements to properly heal (is that the right word?) after this divorce.

It was just social and pleasant for the majority of the time, not flirty or weird. At some point we were chatting about the housing market, skyrocketing prices, etc. As part of the convo I said something like, “I know I’m prob a lot older but….” (details not important). His response was along the lines of, “so are you in you’re 40’s, 50’s thereabouts?” The context for his question was appropriate but hearing someone’s guess include a possibility I could be even older exploded in my brain. Just a few months ago I would still hear guesses that were way younger or comments to that effect. But not so much recently. It hit me: I’m there. Not only do I look my age, at least one person thinks I could be in the next decade. I almost heard the explosion in my brain. It gets worse…

As he gets more and more tipsy I decide to ask for the check. Before I go he says: “so I know you mentioned you’re older, but would you say too old to come have a drink at my place?”  I say, “definitely”,  with a friendly smile. His response: “oh,I’m sorry… Though I’m guessing it must be sort of a compliment to be hit on by a 30 year old.” I was MORTIFIED. I can’t even put into words why it’s upsetting me so much.

He didn’t say anything in response, but seemed kind of upset afterwards and ended the date shortly after. I texted him apologizing about what I said, that I knew it was a difficult subject to talk about and I was really sorry if it caught him off guard or made him upset. He never responded. I cry everyday about this. I just feel like such a worthless piece of shit, having shared something so so personal and difficult and then he just kicks me to the curb. I only disclosed the info because I just get so ashamed of my private parts at times so intimacy can be a little difficult. I’m just so so sad.

Wait, you actually look like your pictures. I’ve seen some guys post pics from 10+ years ago.   


Don’t ask me to borrow money. (Is this seriously happening?)  


All I ask is that you don’t yell at me. (Jeez Louise, this poor woman had this in their bio.)  


Do you have your own car? Do you really? On the date: Where is your car? (It's in the garage. We were meeting across the street from my place.)  


Do you live at your parents/step parents house? (Not since I was 18.)  


Are you married? Are you sure!? Are you separated/in the process of divorcing/ recently separated/ all of the above? (Am I sure? None of the above. Divorced 20 years ago, most recent relationship ended 2 years ago.)  


Are you sure you’re ready to date? (Yup, previous relationship ended 2 years ago.)  


How long have you been single, as in single SINGLE? (What the hell is single SINGLE?)  


Do you have kids? Like seriously, do they live with you? Do you live with them? (Are people lying about having kids??)  


Do you have a job? A real job? Do you support yourself? (Yes, like a legit adult job, with bi-weekly paychecks, insurance and 401k.)  


Are you on parole? (I can see this one as I have some family members in jail.)  


Have you ever been tried and/or convicted of a serious crime? (Seems like people were looking for a loophole, no, not ever convicted, tried, or even arrested. Also, when you have to add serious instead of just crime, something's off.)  


Do you work at a place that ends in E. Cheese? (I gotta admit this one is funny.)

I know that the general consensus would be that he only wanted sex but I didn’t get those vibes and he didn’t come across as a player either.

I won’t want to get into the entire thing and I’m laughing Bc I kept meaning to just post updates but, basically, he’s so great - and also in the middle of a SHIT divorce.

Our loneliness and drive to end that isn't going to find us that perfect person though.  I get it.  It's been a long pandemic, and in that time, our marriages have ended, our relationships have reached their tipping point into separation, our singleness has driven us mad with desire for new people, our dogs have become our bosses.   In the interest of perhaps nudging people's perspectives back into some sort of mental health, I've written some answers to common questions I see on Reddit.  Why? Because it seems like most of us need to refocus on ourselves, at least for now, before embarking on that relationship.

*""He is super sweet, age-appropriate, widowed, gets along with my kids, but is long-winded to a fault and has hygiene problems which I'm hoping I can overlook.  Should I accept his marriage proposal?""*    Uh.   Seriously?   You have just revealed to Reddit that you are so desperate to be coupled up that you will ignore basic hygiene in another person.    Now, look at yourself and ask ""why am I so desperate?"" and answer that question.  On paper.  With a pen.   Because desperation is not love.   Uncertainty is not love.   Straighten that shit out before you go back out there.

*""We started off hot &amp; heavy, but after 2 months, he's not returning my calls, and texts me only late at night.  Is he losing interest?""*    Again...seriously?    If your daughter came to you with this question, what would you tell her?   If you don't KNOW what you'd say, that means you may be in the habit of accepting the bottom of the barrel for dates.   If that's a possibility, ask yourself WHY you do that.  Why YOU do that.  Figure that out, fix it, then get back out there.

And on that same subject, ""*I think she's losing interest in me, but I can't tell, because she used to be so nice.  I can't back away unless she tells me specifically, in clear sentences, 'I'm losing interest in you', and if she strings me along and lies about it, then she's a BITCH and IMMATURE.""*    No.   No.   What has *happened* to people and their communication practices?    If someone is drifting away from you, and you notice it, and they are suddenly unavailable to you CONSISTENTLY, and won't make a future date with you -- OPEN YOUR EYES.  IT'S RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU.      It sucks.  AND it HAPPENS.   Learn to read nonverbals.  They are a thing.      *""Well then they are IMMATURE for not being direct.""*  No.  They are not immature FOR NOT LIKING YOU, OR NOT WANTING TO CONTINUE A RELATIONSHIP.   Quit making this into some sort of federal crime if a date doesn't work out how you want it to.   Some people are for you, and some are not.  Let them go.  Quit trying to ""make"" them into someone you can ""love"".

Lying, buying time, juggling, not communicating, bread crumbing, ""the fade"", negging, narcissists, gold diggers, learn to recognize this shit.  TRUST YOURSELF.  TREAT YOURSELF BETTER THAN YOU TREAT THAT OTHER PERSON.   If you can't, DO SOME WORK ON YOURSELF SO THAT YOU CAN.   Everyone has to quit trying to USE other people to cram them into their big void in the middle of their chest.  Chill out people!   You won't die of loneliness!

Continued conversation learned enough to know I’d like to take her on a date.  Set a date for this Friday at 7pm at a nice restaurant all is good.  

In her tinder profile says that she doesn’t want to text randomly about nothing, likes chivalry, where are all the good men yada yada yada.  Cut to. She starts texting me Monday (date was made on Sunday) talking about be laundry machines how her day was going etc.  I’m confused and thinking it’s one of those traps women set I respond in a timely manor but not too fast and try to seem interested but not too engaging but not too boring like texting jujitsu. Today same thing except then she hits me with, hey do you ride a motorcycle? Because if you do my friend says I have to cancel Friday.  

So I was actually offended because I don’t currently own a motorcycle but I used to own 2 Harley’s and sold them when my son was born to help with expenses and I just didn’t have time to ride but eventually I will buy another one.  So I responded that I guess we should cancel our date.  To which she replied you didn’t answer the question.  I explained I didn’t currently have one but used to and that I was going to own one again in the future.  Then she explained that her “guy” friend said not to date me if I had one because a good friend of his just got in a wreck and lost his arm and his girlfriend lost her leg.  

So here’s where the “asshole” comes out.  I then said Awe he must really care about you.  I then asked if she vetted all her dates like this or if I was special.  Then she tells me that he told her to stop dating and delete all the dating apps.  I said that it sounded like he had some feelings there.  She proceeds to tell me that they dated right after her 3rd marriage ended and “they” decided that they would be better off as friends.  I told her that this is where I take my self out of the equation and cancel the date because I know how this story ends.  I told her it sounded like there’s more to this relationship than just a friendship and maybe she should give him another shot.  She told me that I was being jealous of their friendship and it’s better she find out now.  I responded, that I don’t need to know either of them for the past 5 years to know there is something else there maybe not for her but definitely for him. And I left it with a peace.
