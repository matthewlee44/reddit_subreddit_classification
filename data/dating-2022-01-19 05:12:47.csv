0,s7nuai,1642590768,"Past experiences have left me completely devoid of motivation to date, but I feel incredibly starved of intimacy and companionship. How to regain the energy and motivation?","27M, 5'10"", South Asian. Home was and is always a hellhole with an abusive, controlling father. I never had a lot of friends but I used to cherish whoever I had. I was immensely into video games, tech and anime but lately that passion has fizzled out. Right now my only hobby is to read fictional books and maybe watch movies sometimes. Working a dead end Machine Learning related job but I am in the process of updating my CV and applying for better jobs. Underweight due to medical conditions related to mental health. I only use Twitter and Telegram as my social media as I've deleted the rest, and occasionally Reddit. Sought therapy but no major improvements. No smoking or alcoholic habits. 

I began looking for dates since I craved companionship immensely when I was 18 years old but luck has never really favored me. I never went for the top, hot girls, only for average, decent girls that I thought would be in my league and thought both of us could potentially have good time together. I have seen basically everything from 

\- being defamed in front of my crush by my best friend 

\- brutal rejections (""I wouldn't want to be with you even if you're the last person on Earth"")

\- woman faking interest and using me to pass a university course 

Finally landed a short relationship with a person who proposed me first (to very much my surprise) which ended up alleviating my mental woes and boosted my confidence to the moon, only to bring me back down to reality with her possessive, manipulative and controlling attitude until I broke it off after about 1.5 years. To give a sample of her behavior, she used her own home situation and suicide threats to make me cut off a female friend whom I had known since college. Between each of my pursuit/crush/relationship, I took ample time to grieve and move on, ranging from 8-9 months to a maximum of 3 years. As such, I have only tried my luck with about 5 women over a span of 8 years.

My last pursuit ended rather badly for me and is probably why my motivation is all drained. My anxiety about ending up alone made me rather heavily invest in a person I had known for a while. She was seemingly single, but later confessed that she liked a college friend of mine secretly for 2+ years but hadn't made her move yet. I cut her off then and there after confessing my feelings and wished her well. I also cut off her love interest, because although we used to hangout occasionally, to me he became a walking reminder that I'm inferior to him in some way. Although, he's not aware of the fact that I had cut him off (due to COVID; we're not that close anyway; and my social medias are all gone) nor is he aware of the fact that she likes him.

About 8 months later she reached out again, in hopes of fixing the friendship we had and I basically reiterated that our needs from each other are different. I also stated that I had cut off her love interest because I needed that space and that's how serious this was for me. I haven't heard from her since. Probably never will again. 

It has been two years since I cut her off, and to this I have no energy to do basically anything other than work related things. She owes me nothing, and it is ultimately my fault for being too invested. All I want to know is that given my current state, how do I regain the motivation and energy to put myself out there again? I don't favor arranged marriages after seeing my parents, nor am I certain that things will work out my way. I might just settle for an arranged marriage in my late 30s except that by then it might be too late for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7nuai/past_experiences_have_left_me_completely_devoid/

2,s7nycn,1642591210,Blocked my ex after she continues to try to erase history,"Context: I (m27) had a tryst or fwb or something with  my now ex (f32)  that lasted around a year or so. 

She and I had a good time while it lasted and when it ended, while endings suck, I more or less let go despite the fact I well and truly loved her in ways I had never loved anyone else before.

She was the first person I flew out to meet me (valentines date and dinner) and together I helped her set up the new pc I'd also helped her pick out. She wanted to be a streamer but never had a lot of confidence. She stayed over for a week and we slept together etc. To be entirely honest she was my first though I wasn't hers. 

Just a bit after we had met she was diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma and began immunotherapy. Well, turns out that despite being unlucky with her diagnosis of cancer, she was lucky in that yours truly just happened to have a kinda world class oncologist for a dad. I talked with my dad and he helped review her lab work and would give advice and analysis of how the treatment seemed to be going. (She did recover a is currently cancer free! )

 Fast forward a few months and she had a pretty good streaming community and a regular schedule. Things were going well until they weren't . Somewhere along the way between the sex, I love yous, and literally everything else you could think of that make relationships well relationships,  she suddenly does this about face and decides this is all too much commitment for her and we should just be friends. 

This sucked to lose someone you love and not be open with em about how you feel anymore bit hey can't win em all, so okay whatever. Friends is cool too.  We had already  planned another meet up though before this all went down. She still wanted me to come over and still wanted me to stay 9ver until last minute she asked I'd I could get a hotel instead...

Well I'm not in yhe business of just stay over st peoples places when they're not comfortable with it so fine but she'd have to go half on the hotel cause last minute bookings suck ass. She accepted the conditions.

Again things were okay ish despite my expenses having spiked and now somewhere in the ~2000 range for this week trip to see her and help her get her new apartment set up and stuff.

Then one evening were just relaxing and I was pressing her shoulders and back and apparently this whole massage was some indicator of her wanting to get some?¿ despite being ""just friends""?¿ and not to mention  she has not actually  SAID she wants to get intimate again and wouldn't say that's what she wanted UNTIL AFTER I FUCKING LEFT THE STATE TO GO HOME.

Can you say poor communication? Lil bit.

Also at one point she decided to stream with friends while I was over and basically told me to pull a Harry Potter and be quiet and pretend I'm not there so people don't know I'm visiting blah blah.

Now that bit is going to be important because it isn't the first time she's tried to make me some kind of dirty little secret where I'm not supposed to act like were close or whatever.

Things continue to decline until we basically just don't talk anymore.

Enter current situation:

I work full time as part of a Critical Care Transport team and was working two back to back shifts with little sleep due to having to go in early as a massive snow storm was baring down on us.

Mid snowstorm, after I've already helped rescue 6-10 vehicles from the snow on the interstate and began running calls, this woman texts me out of the blue with two demands:

One: delete the singular picture I had of us from Instagram where we were both riding the metro together when she visited me (nothing sus or obvious that would make it seem like we ere anything other than friends like any other pic of myself and friends on my insta) because and I quote ""she doesn't want her friends to see it""

Two: Don't friends my friends or talk to them


Me over here frozen af, getting freezing rained on and trying to get meemaw back to her care facility in a literal snow/icestorm does not appreciate this.

I took some time to talk it over with a close friend of mine after I got off work and made it back home and they suggested that I delete the pic in question but then block her everywhere at this point.


I care about her and accepted that I wasn't what she wanted but her trying to make me delete shit on MY insta so she can pretend to others that SHE has nothing to do with me etc just really really pises me the fuck off.

I really didn't want to take it down because it was a happy memory of good times for me but out of respect for the request and my best friends who suggested to take it down regardless lt is off the page. 

I just...i don't get it.

Is it normal for people to just demand you erase them from your own social media so they can hide an inconvenient truth? 

Like if you regret it that much that's your fucking problem. I was happy. I enjoyed our time. I fucking loved you and was all in.

But to you I was the guy you had to hide, keep quiet, and subsequently pretend you had nothing to do with...

It really hurts my self esteem that the first person. I let get that close to me also chose to essentially act like and present themselves like what happened between us just...didn't.

Am I wrong for just flat out cutting all contact with her for this? I hadn't removed her from socials or unfriended or anything because I never felt the situation called for that. We parted amicably...

But this just pushed me over the edge. I'm not a dirty secret to hide..I'm not your inconvenient truth you're trying to cover up.

I deserve better...and I never ever thought she'd be the one to do this to me.

3,s7o0f2,1642591403,This guy told me the reason why he ghosted me. Do you think it sounds genuine or just another excuse?,"So this guy and I matched on tinder. He immediately moved the conversation into whatsapp and we talked consistently for like a week. He love bombed me, called me on the phone, made diff promises that he’d come visit me once the corona calms down. This guy and I live very far from each other. I live in a diff country and he lives in the USA. He seems to be an overall great guy but the distance makes it impossible. Things were going well, and as a woman who hoped that maybe he’s different, I started getting attached. 

After a week, he started to disappear. He left me on read, so I sent him a text saying “Hey, what’s up? Are you busy?”. There was no reply. I sent him another one the next day telling him that I think he’s nice, but he should be open to me if ever he changed his mind. Again, message was delivered but there was no reply and he didn’t read both texts. He didn’t go online for a full week until today, when I noticed that I can’t see his online status anymore which means that maybe he blocked me already. 

I was so devastated and really wanted an answer because it was affecting my mental health. I remembered that I still have his number so I sent him a desperate text on imessage (it usually prompts him to respond. I said “What do you want from me? Just tell me. I’m gonna do it. Just fucking talk.” I was shocked that it had been delivered and 9 mins later, this was his reply:

“I don’t want anything. I’m not the right person for you. Don’t want to hurt your feelings. You deserve someone that’s going to give his full commitment. I’m not ready for all of this. Take care. Goodbye”

After that he blocked me, again. Didn’t even had the chance to say that I appreciate his honesty. 

It stabbed me in the heart. I liked this guy and actually thought he might be different. Do you think he would have told me that if I didn’t send him a text on imessage?

Isn't the whole point of a relationship supposed to be to see if you're all for emotionally and physically available for eachother?


I guess the main reason might just be because a lot of people in mainstream society aren't too caught up on having specific hobbies/interests/pastimes be caught up on being their foundation of life, to be their whole identity if you will

12,s7p4jo,1642595546,Not feeling the vibe after arranging a date with a girl,"Why is this so hard man.

I’ve admittedly crushed on this girl for 8 years and, we’ve def had high sexual banter over the years. But shes bi so she’d been in &amp; out relationships with women for a while, which I’m totally cool with. But she’s told me couple times that she prefers men &amp; hadn’t been in a relationship with a woman/or anyone for couple years, as her ex was controlling.

So we got talking again, as we’d swing in &amp; out and this time was different to the other times we’d spoken as she was strongly initiating a drink (couple times) and, a facetime session. Her energy was alot stronger than mine and, so we got talking, teasing each other abit &amp; talking generally about life (this is something we hadnt done so much before) to arrange a date - where we’d go for drinks &amp; you know in a hotel afterwards. That was made very clear.

She then initiated going for Valentines weekend &amp; for couple nights when I gave her the option of 1 or, 2 nights so we could ‘build a connection’. Again, she expressed how excited she was &amp; it genuinely felt real.
Like, sometimes I’d fall asleep at night and she’d pop up saying morning babe, double message me on snap - sending me stuff even though I hadn’t asked for them.

The last couple days have felt different, i cant identity what it is. Vibes dont lie right? She did say she had period pains but, this morning she replied to my snap (replying to her story saying the sunset was beautiful like her) saying Awww babe 😍 but, something feels off - especially as she hasnt replied to my text from last night &amp; she’s been posting to her insta story. 

But, i did tell her last night I’d booked the hotel to confirm it was happening, and she said she was looking forward to it &amp; seeing me. Ugh idk man",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7p4jo/not_feeling_the_vibe_after_arranging_a_date_with/
13,s7p95s,1642595960,"Seeking advice (small TW) (mentions abuse, but doesn’t go into any detail)","So this is something I want to get other peoples opinion on, it might be lengthy, but I’ll try skimming over the not as important details. Sorry in advance if it’s lengthy.

So I (26m) have been talking to this (24f) girl on and off for 2 years now. A lot has happened between her and I. We started talking to eachother around October 2019. I tried to be the best person I could be, I got her a small gift for her birthday, flowers, but I knew to keep it small to not go overboard immediately. She told me her favorite kind of flowers, so I thought she was hinting that to me to get her that. But after awhile, she started officially dating someone else, so we stopped talking as much. But they ended up breaking up and long story short, he was a bad guy. She confided in me and told me what happened, different kinds of abuse (trigger warning), but I have kept that all a secret because I truly believe if people find out, she should be the one to tell people. It’s not my story to tell.

After they broke up, I initially was just trying to be her friend since she recently got out of a bad relationship. At some point in the future, her and I started talking again. After this point, we started getting really close. It got to the point that I quit my job and got a job where she works. The bad part is that I thought her and I were getting super close, like right on the path to officially dating within a couple months. But there was a point where she was feeling sick, so I told her I’d come get her to get tested for covid at the doctor. She declined my request, but I found out that night that she got a ride to the doctor from her abusive ex, and she said he was flirting with her the entire time. I honestly felt really hurt from that. She declined my request, but accepted it from the guy that abused her. I felt like she was basically saying she’d rather be with an abuser than be with me. 

So that time, I created the distance between us. This all happened before I started at the new job. So it was like 2 weeks before then, but at that point, I stopped talking to her, but I was still interested in the job since the pay was higher and because I already put my 2 weeks in at my other job. I went to the interviews and got the job. But within the 2 weeks of us not talking, she started officially dating another guy. I had no idea she was talking to this guy, I just noticed she would answer the phone while walking out of the office and I’d hear her say “hey baby” openly infront of anyone that was in the office. I wasn’t working there long. Within a month, I had a new job that paid more than that one too.

So then it was like 6 months later. Her and I hadn’t spoken to eachother at all. I was dating a new girl, she was still dating that guy. The girl I was dating was planning on moving in with me, so we were looking for a job for her. I thought to ask the original girl, if there were positions open there and I explained it was for the girl I was dating. She was fine with it all and she said she’ll find out if there were any openings. Well me and my girlfriend ended up breaking up the day before I was going to get her. She was thinking it was going to fast. I honestly agreed, so I didn’t mind too much. But shortly after I became single, girl 1 also became single. At that point, I seen more of an effort to communicate with me. So I shared the effort and we got super close again.

Now this is starting to get into more recent stuff. I’ve been trying to be more direct now that I know she’s interested in dating. I’ve been trying to shoot my shot more, sometimes she shows interest, but some other times she ignores my messages completely. I’ve been trying to just spend more time with her in person. We both agreed to getting later Christmas gifts for eachother. I don’t know if she got me anything, I don’t mind too much since I do it because I want to, not to get anything in return. But every time I ask to hang out to have our mini Christmas, she leaves me on read. I try yo be as respectful and none-dramatic as I can be. I’ve mentioned to her that im handling everything on my end seriously and I’m not talking to any other girls. I know that can cause anxiety to tell someone that you’re trying to date, but her and I have had this thing going for over 2 years. Now I try to stay cool-headed, but yesterday the girl posted a pic on Snapchat of flowers. I kept it cool and all, I just said they were cute flowers. After she agreed, I asked her if someone got them for her or if they were someone else’s at the office. She told me a guy she’s been talking too got them for her, but she didn’t things things were that serious.

I feel like I should just cut things off, but we’ve gone through so much together. Would it be better to completely cut things off if she starts officially dating this guy that sent her flowers? I really like her, but I honestly don’t fell like she loves me that much. I remember I got her some other stuff around Christmas one year and she mentioned to me the she threw the stuff away in the trash after she was dating the guy. Some stuff I understood, like a glass rose, but there was some self defense stuff I also got her so she would never have to feel completely defenseless ever again, that stuff I was hurt that she said she threw away.

The chatting was easy, we both enjoyed each other's company. While leaving, we hugged and I offered him to Venmo him half the share of the food and he said - "" you can pay for it the next time"" hinting a second date.
We got home and I thanked him for the great time and dinner and mentioned I enjoyed the evening; we swapped numbers. 

Yesterday (first day after date 1) I generally texted and dropped a message based on something we chatted and he promptly responded. The chat didn't go much further and I got busy with my day and he his. 

Here is my question for this sub:

1. In case he initiates a second text, well and good, if he doesn't, is it safe to let this one go? 

2. Idk if his texting skills arent great, what is a nice way to let him know we should text in-between dates so we can know each other better? 

This happened with the last man I dated, he absolutely never texted between dates and I just let it go not wanting to pressure. He dated for 2 months and I had never heard one good morning or good night! I don't wanna get into the same pattern; I am not looking for incessant chats since I don't have time for it.

My friend showed me another screenshot of my boyfriend with an updated picture (taken a couple months ago) on the app and I confronted my bf. I accused him of cheating and he started to victimize himself also while claiming that he didn’t have the app downloaded. He showed me that I wasn’t installed but idk. I feel like actively pursuing girls on the internet is cheating. And at this point I want him to admit it and stop lying. What do you think??

Matched with a girl on Bumble, at first I didn't really have any high expectations from a dating app but once we started talking, I thought at the time, we really clicked. We would message each other day and night constantly without pauses, we shared personal stuff, tell each other boring details of our everyday lives, play games together and somewhat flirted with each other. I felt that I related to her vibe in every way.

We finally met in-person about 3 weeks in, that's when I started really developing feelings for her. I've dated in Uni before, but never developed the feelings in which I cannot describe which is why I decided to get Bumble to try my luck. Truth be told, I've always felt down and idk how to describe it but just her presence really made me happy. I even got excited just receiving notifications from her which would make my day.

So eventually I decided to confess that I liked her, it was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life (I'm not exaggerating, that's how much she meant to me) and I'm glad I've done it. Unfortunately she didn't have the same feelings for me which broke me a bit but I understood that and respect how she felt.

After that, I couldn't stop thinking about her, you could say I was obsessed so I told her how I really felt. To make a long story short, she told me I should just stop talking to her for a while so that I can focus on myself.

So far (few weeks after), I've been trying to move on without much success, I still think about her constantly (worrying about her wellbeing and general stuff) and I know it's an unhealthy obsession as it's eating me up from within as I try to avoid contact with her. It's really destroying me. Most days I can't even start to do anything like Uni work and when I finally stop thinking about her and actually sleep, I dream about her and wake up worse off.

It's like my brain knows what I should do, but my heart tells me otherwise and I don't know what else I can do as it affects me day by day. In fact, it occupies my head so much, I'm not even stressed in my Uni exams at the moment as I can barely focus on anything else but her.

Honestly, this is the worst I've ever felt in my life. I mistook the signals. I'm usually the unemotional (Just depressed) type of person so I don't really know how to deal with this, I'm trying to occupy myself with other stuff but every second of the day, all I can think about is her and its tearing me apart.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7qtvu/thought_i_found_the_one_on_bumble_now_i_cant_do/

Everyone is extremely quick and harsh to judge and toss you in the gutter like a worthless piece of trash, without even trying to know who you are at all...

Well, not everyone at least. There are a very few rare and wonderful exceptions... People who are willing to take the time to actually get to know you, and see your worth, and love the person you are in spite of your flaws.

Everyone always says “just find a girl that doesn’t care about that”… but is it possible to have too many disadvantages to where it all just can’t be overlooked?  Let me explain:

- I have loose skin from losing 140lbs twice … “find a girl who doesn’t care about looks”

- I’m only 5’7 … “find a girl who doesn’t care about height”

- I’m only 5 inches … “find a girl who doesn’t care about size”

- My hair is thin (not balding but thin) … “find a girl that doesn’t care about great hair” 

- I’m 26 and have never been in a relationship … “find a girl that will be patient and doesn’t mind helping you”

There’s probably 1-2 I’m forgetting but point proven.  I just want to be loved, man. How can I overcome all these shitty genetics (and yes bad choices on the weight part)?

You could be fit and handsome and I still wouldn't kiss a guy who had bad teeth or was visibly missing a tooth.  Get braces, whitening treatments (if they're really discolored), implants, or veneers.

Fast forward 6 months, we’ve kept in contact and talk regularly. We’ve hung out solo and neither of us have made any advances romantically.

We are both thinking about moving out of our respective apartments. For reasons I don’t really care to type out, it’s makes a lot of sense for both us to have a roommate. Also, having a roommate would cut down on cost and open up better housing opportunities. We’re considering living together as roommates.

It started out as my idea but after both of us polled friends and family and received a unanimous “it’s a bad idea”, I sort of walked back the idea, but my friend (Ex) still considers it an intriguing living situation.

That's my number one requirement to or not to proceed getting to know a girl.

From there we started getting to know each other and talking about different topics and we clicked, then I gave her my sc and insta and we moved there. Unfortunately, she lives 2 hours away by plane.

She has checked all of the boxes so far that made me ""I hope this would work"" except for sense of humor irl not behind the phone and I will find that when I see her in person.

One thing she said was that she's not interested in getting married any time soon and want to accomplish something and self-fulfilment as she thinks marriage will hold her back. which is not true to me specially when there are no kids. But because she saw her friends change their principles and what they stand for after getting married like a vegan friend started to eat meat because of her husband, she developed this view of marriage.

You may wonder why I'm already talking about marriage, it's because we live in a society where long term dating is rare (like both being in college) and no sex (religious societybut i'm not a virgin) and there's a stigma that if the guy prolong dating and didn't propose means he's not serious. A year or two of dating is maximum.

One annoying part is that she never initated conversations or just sending memes, It is always me but she engage well in coversations (long texts, voice notes). I feel like if I didn't send somehting she wouldn't message me, which made me feel like I'm the one who's dessperte for her attention. We only talk a little during our lunch break or 1-2 hours before going to bed, not everyday. 

I guess I'm fantasizing about what we could be becuase I know that meeting a girl that matches me like her would be difficult/ rare so I don't want to ruin or miss this opportunity, while she might just see me as a texting buddy cause she is not interested in dating right now.

53,s7ul27,1642611314,It hurts so much,"I was in love with this guy for the better part of a year. He was my everything until I realised that due to circumstances we could probably never be together.

So I pushed him out of my mind and tried to forget how I felt about him,and to a certain extent it worked. 

Recently though,something happened. And I might just be imagining things ,but it just gave me a teeny tiny bit of hope which makes no sense at all because there's a huge chance that the event  that took place was just a coincidence.

The thing is,part of me wants to tell him how I feel and the rational part of me doesn't want to say anything to him because I don't want to annoy him or make him think that I'm weird.

And for some reason it just hurts so much. Not telling him how I feel is the rational thing to do but at the same time it hurts so much not knowing,not taking that chance,however small it might be.

Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7ul27/it_hurts_so_much/

55,s7unf7,1642611488,"Can dating, relationships, love be rational?","I think this is, before anything, a very individual thing. It depends on someone's personality, past experiences, what they are looking for... But thinking that people go into dating with the analytical mind just sounds sad to me. It also scares me because I am a ""follow your heart"" type of a person.

Recently I was talking to a guy I dated for a minute and who is a friend now. We got deep into talking about love. I was saying how this dating thing is not for me - I met a person I felt an incredibly strong connection with and was left stranded. Truth be told, it was for valid reasons (mental health), but it hurts. I am definitely an idealist when it comes to love and want to believe that when you meet someone you connect with on every level, it just shouldn't be that hard. True, we all have our issues and demons, but finding someone you vibe with should help you feel calm. It should help ease the pain and bring a smile on your face. Things have been easy for me with this person because that's how I was feeling. And I wanted to grow it from there. But they didn't because all of it was too intense and too scary.

My friend said it's just not that easy. He's a few years older so a bit more experienced in the dating game, but also a very analytical type in all aspects of life. He said it's a numbers game. You have to go on many dates, get disappointed, try and fail and if you're lucky, your person will show up after some time. 

That makes me incredibly anxious. Do people really look at dating in this way? Of course, you have good and bad dates, not everyone is going to be a fit, but I don't want to think that in order to find love, I HAVE TO give a chance to as many people as possible to get to the right one. In my view, it's all about chance, luck and timing - whether you run into the right person, at the right place, at the right time.

So, yeah. Do people really rationalise love? Can it be love if you're able to decide on someone based on the list of pros and cons? Or is that just settling - you go on many dates, have bad and disappointing experiences, so when someone nice comes along, you almost already have low expectations and they blow you away easily?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7unf7/can_dating_relationships_love_be_rational/
56,s7uqms,1642611700,Ask out Down Syndrome chick at work?,"i started working overnight shift at a big box store on monday. yesterday, i was in the breakroom trying to eat my breakfast and all the tables were full except the one with the Down syndrome chick. i asked if i could sit down to eat, but i couldn't make out what she said. i nodded and sat down anyway.

maybe 10 sec later, a beep goes off and she gets up to retrieve a sausage biscuit from the breakroom microwave. i couldn't help but notice that she had a decent body, but make no mistake, her face looked absolutely busted.

when she sat back down, she started eating and a few sec later also footsieing me. i looked down to find her ballet flat slowly rubbing back and forth against my steel toe work boot. i locked eyes with her and we both started laughing.

58,s7usnj,1642611839,she (18F) really likes me (18F) but she’s not ready for a relationship. should we still go on dates?,"so a little over a month ago, this girl texted me on tinder. i hated tinder because i was never really able to form a genuine connection with the girls who texted me on there, so i just ended up ghosting all of them in the end. but i just felt that with this girl it was different. we ended up forming a genuine connection and have been texting during every possible moment of every day for over a month now. i really like her and she told me she really likes me. we’ve both fallen for each other. i’m gay and i was closeted throughout high school (i’m in my first year of college now) so this is the first time that i’ve really allowed myself to feel like this for a girl.

the only thing is that we’ve never met each other in person yet. which has really been upsetting to me because meeting someone in person is such a big deal in any relationship. we’ve made plans to meet before but she’s always cancelled last minute because she’s too anxious about seeing me (she says she really likes me and doesn’t want to fuck it up). she keeps promising, however, that we’ll meet and go on a date extremely soon.

well over the weekend she posted some pics of her kissing another girl while drunk. this girl was her friend and also had a bf, and i knew that. i wasn’t so upset about the fact that she had gone and kissed another girl because i knew that that was only her friend and i kiss my friends all the time. i was more upset about the fact that earlier that day she had promised to come meet me for the first time but then ended up bailing because things came up (again). and then after that she went and kissed another girl. it made me feel useless because if she won’t meet me and she wants to go kiss other girls, then why am i in her life ?

so i told her that i was upset and kinda emotionally over shared because of how upset i was. i told her that i didn’t understand her and how she felt about me and that i needed to stop looking for love from people who weren’t willing to give it to me. she apologized immediately and offered to talk about it with me, but i wasn’t able to rationally talk about it that night yet so we didn’t. the next morning (sunday morning) when i was ready to talk, she seemed emotionally cold and distant. she said that she wasn’t ready to talk yet because she didn’t know how she was feeling.

from sunday morning to yesterday night (tuesday night) she ignored my texts asking to just talk things out with her because i never wanted this to be a dealbreaker. finally, i texted her last night that i wouldn’t be able to do this with her anymore if she was just gonna ignore me when i was upset and not communicate with me. i told her that she had one last chance to tell me how she was feeling before i just moved on. 

she texted back immediately that she has no idea how she’s feeling and that she wished she knew. she said that she liked me so much it scared her before i became upset with her. then when i became upset, she shut down and has been in that state since. she knows she still likes me and wants me, but that reaction to conflict has alerted her of the fact that she’s not ready to be in a relationship. i won’t get into details, but her last relationship was really problematic and i think has given her commitment issues/fear to be vulnerable in that way. she said that she doesn’t know what she wants because she wants me and likes me but doesn’t want a relationship. thinking of a relationship for her ruins all of the attraction.

i don’t know what i want. i think i’d be okay with not having a relationship with her, but i still want to be in her life in a romantic way. i want us to foster our connection because i know it’s really special. but what should i do if she’s not ready for a relationship but i want to preserve our connection? should we take a break and i let her figure things out on her own and come back to me? the only risk is that she might just ghost me and never talk to me again. should i just take it slow with her again and not bring up conflict so it goes back to being no strings attached flirtation? the only thing is that there’s always gonna be conflict, but maybe i shouldn’t have brought it up so early. should we still go on dates or “hang out” but just take it slow? or is that too much like a relationship ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7usnj/she_18f_really_likes_me_18f_but_shes_not_ready/

64,s7vyz3,1642614790,"question for the guys, from a girl","hi! engaged girl here. im in my early 20s and i often get hit on at work. the sexual harassers i just blow off or ignore, but i sometimes get asked out for real- where the guy is genuinely not being a creep. this question is asked for those guys, not the creeps. 

im a very friendly person and have good customer service, i can build good rapport with a customer pretty quick. sometimes customers think im flirting and im not, but im not going to not be kind. 

so on to the question. when someone genuinely asks me out, i will always work in that i really respect their courage to ask, admire the guts it took, and that i really appreciate the offer. i see stories on here all the time about “asked a girl out and she said no, never doing it again” and i never want to be the girl that makes a guy feel like that. so when i have to turn someone down, i try to do it in a way that… builds their confidence i guess? i dont ever make it pity, more like “i recognize that took a lot of guts, i respect it, and keep doing it because you never know when itll be right.” 

so as a guy, if you asked a girl out and thats how she responded, would you hate that or appreciate it? how should i change my response, if it needs changing at all? i love my fiancé to pieces so its not like im ever going to say yes to any of them, id just like to make the no easier and not awkward for both of us",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7vyz3/question_for_the_guys_from_a_girl/

I was browsing the appstore, looking for a new one to try when I found Boo. I'd never even heard of it before but I noticed it was rated 4.1 out of 5. Way higher than any of the other commonly known ones, most of which hovered around 3. I downloaded it, filled out its brief questionnaire  and did the bare minimum in making my profile just to get going and get a feel for it. I got a match and a woman messaged me the same day. I've had it maybe a month and a half now and yes, the reviews were correct. I have gotten by far more women messaging me on this app than on anything else. But there's something off about it.

Every single woman that has messaged me is originally from mainland China. Nothing wrong with that in and of itself but it's just a very strange coincidence. This app in no way advertises itself as a way to meet Asian women and none of the reviews spoke of this either. I'm in the greater Los Angeles area so maybe this won't be everyone's experience with it. My experience had been the same just about every time though. They send me a message and then very quickly try to get me off the app and to start chatting with them on whatsapp or telegram. It just leads me to believe they are trying to scam me in some way or that they are not actually in the US. How is it that I've not been able to get a single date in 2 years thru other apps and all of a sudden I'm getting contacted by 2 or 3 women a week on this one. I thought it was going well with one woman on there when I got her phone number and it was a local area code. I enjoyed talking to her and we seemed pretty close to going on a date but all of a sudden she would not stop talking about cryptocurrency.

77,s7xa6z,1642618119,2022 red flag: let’s recognize Love bombing,"I keep seeing so many posts on this sub and other dating/relationship subs about how someone (and it’s happened to me too) gets love bombed by someone they’re dating they hardly know and ends up in a horrible situation and heart broken. Some people do not know what love bombing is. Love bombing in early stages can be seen as someone you don’t know well doing any of these things, usually without commitment:
-  giving you lots of attention/spending lots of time with you
- overly giving physical affection
- Constant compliments
- Using “pet names” (baby, babe, beautiful)
- giving you gifts 
- saying right away you’re soulmates or meant to be
- making you feel special/putting you on a pedestal/it’s too got to be true in such a short timeframe 
- saying ‘I love you’ very fast
- excessive or constant communication
- disrespecting your boundaries, etc. 

But in reality they are performing an act to use you in some way for their selfish benefits and possibly leading to control/manipulation/abuse/harassment or other narcissistic behavior, usually to get you to have sex. But love bombing can be used for other motives, and eventually or suddenly they ghost or cut you out after using you for what they want, by having misleading intentions. 

I think in 2022 we should all try to recognize going forward that love bombing is a big red flag and as a clear form of manipulation. If someone is doing this to you don’t give into it and step away. Step back and recognize they’re roping you in and making you hear what you want to hear but in reality you hardly know each other, they don’t actually care about you, and have no real bond formed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7xa6z/2022_red_flag_lets_recognize_love_bombing/

82,s7y73a,1642620458,Hesitant about opening up,"I have been dating an absolutely amazing guy since July. 
I have been divorced for a little bit. About 8 months. I was in a disaster of a marriage. It was a sexless and intimate devoid marriage.  I was a roommate to my ex. On top of that he was verbally and emotionally abusive. 
I was in therapy almost immediately after us say I do.
I'm still in therapy.

Anyway I dated here and there after the divorce. I felt ready because I literally had no relationship with my ex. The love I had dissolved as soon as I realized who he really was and how I would be treated. On top of this amazingness he cheated. I know I wasn't perfect. But I never yelled at him or cheated. I've discussed in therapy my feelings as to what I possibly did wrong in the marriage. Lots of fun inner work. 

I randomly met my current partner at the gym. We went on a few dates and it was so simple and easy to get along with him. So three times a week dates turned into seeing each other six times a week at the gym, and sleepovers four times a week and day long hangouts on the weekends. 
It didn't happen ight away but it just happened. Like it wasn't a thought. It was natural. It flowed. 
We are intimate all the time and we cuddle constantly.
We talk for hours in person and sometimes we just cuddle. 
I love you hasn't been said. But there are clearly big feelings at work. More blatant when when we're cuddling and just looking at each other smiling.  We even have plans for a vacation in three months. 

I guess I still have a wall up. I want to let him all the way into my life..but on the same hand I'm like...your a guy. This can only end in disaster your gonna hurt me. 

I'm trying to not let what happened in my past dictate what is happening now. Because he is NOT my ex and I really just want to enjoy him and our time. 

Has anyone dealt with this? How did you work thru it. I'm working on it in therapy still but would like to hear people's experiences. 

Thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7y73a/hesitant_about_opening_up/

What I want to clarify is that it is not just oh he says hi to me, he must love me. To be honest the greetings have started recently and seem to not happen when our office manager is in the room. For example, I messaged him on our work phone to follow up with a customer and signed my name at the end, like we are supposed to do since there are a few girls in the office at times. He shows up later, while I’m sitting right there, saying oh I got a message from the office to do… I over hear since her desk is next to mine. I interrupt, that was me. He goes oh well yeah I did what you asked but I just wanted to make sure. Is it because our office manager is there? Like can he not act himself like yesterday.

90,s7yue0,1642622055,How to ask a FWB for something more serious?,"Anyone have advice on asking a FWB for something more serious?

I (21F) been FWB with this guy (23M) for 6 months. At the start thats all this ordeal was, but recently I’ve been catching feelings for him.

I feel like he might have some feelings for me also but idk. We’ve been “exclusive” in a sense that we know that neither of us have been having sex with anyone else.

We also sort of take care of each other. Like whenever he’s busy I’ll make food for him and help him with chores especially during finals and his internship. He also helps me out since I share a car with my roommates so during his free time he’ll help me run errands. He’s also attended a few sessions with me talking with my therapist over how to help with my social anxiety.

I know it’s unfair to him for me to ask for something more serious when I agreed at the start to only he FWB’s, but I would just appreciate some advice on asking him about the possibility for something more serious.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7yue0/how_to_ask_a_fwb_for_something_more_serious/
91,s7yyt6,1642622381,Confused,"I am a 23 year old black female and I was in a very short relationship with a 22 year old white/Asian male. 
This guy treated me like royalty. He made me feel special all the time and there wasn’t a second that went by when I didn’t feel appreciated and cared for. 

We were hanging out one night where I met his friends for the first time, and he was just seeing them again after 6 months (in the military) &amp; we both had a few drinks. At the end of the night I ended up driving us home and he was in the passenger seat explaining to me how he was so excited that everything went so well. Everyone seemed to love me, we had a great time playing games, eating, and sharing lots of laughs. In this moment he even told me he loved me😅 

As I continue to drive us home… he proceeds to say that I’m his n****

You can imagine how that took me by surprise. I quickly looked at him and said “you can’t say that!” He then goes on to say “babe you know I don’t mean it like that… you are my friend! I love you! You’re my n****!” I was so shocked and the moment was so awkward for me that all I could do was look shocked and repeat “you can’t say that” I brushed this moment off &amp; by the next day it was like it never even happened… 

Me and this guy are no longer together, but i think about this moment a lot &amp; I can’t help but think that I didn’t do enough for myself in this moment… even after we broke up I thought to myself “how can someone love me and they call me their n**** and…… they’re not black?

94,s7z9bs,1642623099,Insecure or Justified,"Insecurity weighing me down or am I really not his type?

Im feeling insecure because my bf (24m) follows ALOT of females on IG that have only fans and like to twerk all the time. The problem is I (26f) am not built like the women he fantasizes about and I cant dance at all and its an insecurity that has been weighing me down for 2 decades. When he looks at porn he searches for the only fans girls from his IG. Always the same 4 females. And its always videos of them being on top or twerking , basically all the things i cant do with all the women who are better built then me. They are curvy and well within their womanhood, i am not. It really has destroyed my confidence over the years. I cant even get on top anymore because the minute i do my mind run a million miles a minute like “he’s not enjoying it because I’m not doing it like them” or “i must look really stiff and stupid right now” and then i just get discouraged and give up which is crazy cause i never felt like this with any other partner. I use to be wild in bed, now I’m more so a shell of my former self. He is not a very reassuring partner so i definitely don’t want to tell him about my big secret because i know nothing good will come from it and it will be embarrassing. His responses will be something along the lines of “i never said that” or “if thats what u think then ok” or “thats not true” but never words thats really stick or uplift you. Ive tried to talk to him in the past about it but i think it just makes him feel weird and embarrassed. From his POV he says he is a grown man and can look at porn if he wants. He considers the girls on OF porn stars but they are not. They are regular people, some of them are from a city he use to live in. They take photos in regular bra and panties in they bedroom, nothing professional about it. They are the type of girls you can run into at the gas station if you in the right place at the right time. I will say that he did try to clean up his Ig some but doesn’t help much. 4k friends and 3.5k are twerking women, you would basically have to delete the whole page and start over which i will not ask that of him. He doesn’t cheat on me so it makes me feel like the bad guy for getting on him about women on the internet. Idk what to do but i cant stop thinking about. Makes me feel like I’m not really his type.

I have a few examples from friends/coworkers of time spent apart and getting back together like my boss didn’t talk to the person who’s his wife now for 6 months and got back together after a year. Or another friend who’s SO is someone they split with for 3 years.

This has happened with so many guys that I don't know if I should ever even ask again. EVERY time i ask it's either a ""no *insert excuse* or they respond the next day and say ""oh sorry i was busy"" blah blah. I'm not super bitter about this because I don't honestly care that much. I'm just wondering if there's any point in asking. They'll say no to me but then when they want to they'll hit me up and I almost always say yes because I'm not mad that they said no and I almost never say no to a good time. Does this most likely mean i'm the last resort for these men and that's why they say no to me but then will ask me later? 

I'm pretty much done asking because clearly the answer is usually going to be no so what's the point?
