I tried several times to explain to him that if she’s still not willing to have sex with him after all this time they’ve spent together, it means she is not physically attracted to him, but he wasn’t having it. I believe that if someone is physically attracted to you, sure they might be able to resist for a while but eventually they just won’t be able to stop themselves especially since they hang out (just the two of them) in a dorm room almost everyday after school. I tried to tell him he was being used but he was hell bent on giveinh her “as much time as she needs to feel comfortable”…he even got pissed at me. Well today i saw her leaving one of my neighbor/friend’s room around 7am lolololol. When i asked my neighbor about her, he said they have been sleeping together for a while now. I told mark and he confronted her about it, she tried to lie but she eventually admitted it and tried apologizing. Long story short, he is a mess.

In fact, I have never even been on a date from a dating app in the US, other than when I went to Colombia earlier in the year). My point is that very recently, I felt that I was literally addicted to the concept of getting a like or a match on a dating app: I would constantly check my phone to see if I had a new match/message, on all the 3 apps that I was using (Hinge, Bumble, Tinder). And while in the most recent months I've been using pretty much only Hinge (I would get 3-4 matches a week), all the conversations with my matches would never go anywhere: even if I got them off the app via phone number the conversations would always die once they ghosted me or I proposed a date. I guess I kind of realized that online dating isn't really for me (and I wouldn't even say I'm ugly, I'm average looking), because I would subconsciously be addicted to the validation of dating app likes and messages. And even when I did get a match with a really attractive girl that 30 second buzz would fade because I always knew that that conversation would go nowhere/I would get ghosted. In a sense, I was addicted to a feeling of validation that I consciously realized didn't matter because I internalized the fact that those matches would never go anywhere.

So most of you probably read my last post. I am just so sick of crying, this time for a different reason! So ill put it out there I'm jealous and insecure and I clearly have trust issues it's obvious, I know that and I can admit that. But I'm sick of being screamed at for feeling jealous and insecure😒. My partners wanting to go to the gym and I made a joke although it wasn't a joke deep down, I said ""oh loads of women at the gym for you to look at"" I could see him getting pissed off so I told him I was joking, I told him I was fine with him going which I am, but he was talking about wanting to go when it's quiet and all I said was ""that gym is always busy"" well he screamed at me and told me that I need to shut the fuck up about it. 

And I cry because I hate being shouted at😒. Secretly tho, I never let him see me cry. Anyway my point is, shouldn't he be making me feel more secure instead of getting defensive?

I'm not saying he's a bad guy he just has a horrible side to him sometimes, and I'm no angel either i have alot of faults and an ugly side.

I know mentally there's something wrong with me, I've been through so much in life and not sure whether that's had an affect on me, I'm trying to be better and for a while there the jealousy went away, I couldn't care. But it's came back with a vengeance and I can't seem to control it. 

I just want him to show me he cares and to make me feel secure in our relationship,  and I don't. We don't do anything together anymore and he keeps making fake promises like ""we will have a date night once a month"". That was months ago he said that and we've never had one! Is there something wrong with me? Am I the problem? Am I expecting too much? 

I feel as though I'm asking for the bare minimum and not even getting that. All the relationships I've had it's me who's put in the effort who's looked after them, but noone ever looks after me. 

I just don't want to cry anymore, I hate it. I just want to be normal and not be jealous or insecure. Honestly it's getting me down so much, I just never feel good enough for anyone.

So this is a long story, sorry in advance. I (23F) just moved alone to a new country a month ago and 3 days after I moved I met a guy (27M) in a park,we hanging out with mutual friends. Everything was good, a lot of them went back to our dorm and we had a plan with one friend to make dinner together, but we stayed more, went for a beer, went back to the door with a lime scooter etc. 

We really liked each other and some people noticed that when we went back to our dorm and after that we made an agreement to make dinner in 2 days with one couple from here. Since that dinner I started hanging out with that guy (the first time that we hooked up was a day after that dinner) all the time, we’re going out to clubs, going for walks during the day and night, seeing each other almost every day, we’re watching movies, he’s planning dates like walk around the castle, walk around the park, going on a light festival, he’s also opening up about his family etc and also went on a date with him to one of his restaurants where he always went with his dad or grandma. He’s always hugging me (even hugging me all the time while were sitting in the metro lol),kissing me and smiling when he’s around me( he’s doing all of this everywhere, doesn’t matter if we’re alone or not). 


Also for example, yesterday we had a deal to go for a breakfast, but instead i went to his apartment (he moved out from our dorm and lives with one of his best friends), he made breakfast, we just hung out for a bit and then went to IKEA. He was hugging me ther as well, it was really nice and after a couple of hours we had to split because he already postponed a business meeting because of me and ikea lol (he has a small staryup with his friends) in the evening he came to my place after he was done with soccer and everything was nice. 


However, the problem is that 2 days after the first kiss, we were drunk and he told me something like I really like it that everything is so relaxed with you and idk why but I was like yeah,  it’s to early for a relationship, we can do whatever we want, if we want to hold each others hands we can do that but its early for a relationship and he was like yeah I’m fine with that. But after that we went on those dates, he’s opening up more and more, hanging out with me all the time etc. But he is also traveling back home tomorrow and he’s coming back in 6 days. 


What should I do? Does he like me? I really like him and I didn’t feel like this for years and I would love to be in a realtionship with him but not sure if he wants it and what should I do/say? Please help, I literally can’t sleep.

I've haven't been in a relationship since HS, which only lasted 3 months. I just don't have a lot dating experience, but I've finally been getting dates these past 2 years through tinder and cold approaches. 

Usually the dates I get from tinder go better just because we talk more before the first date. When it comes to cold approaches, I get more nervous and the dates I get from them feel different in the sense that it feels like meeting up with a stranger (which I guess I am). But what feels more different is that I don't know what they expect from the date.

When I get a date from tinder, hugging, cuddling, and even some cheek kisses are bound to happen and usually do happen. It just feels that, because we matched on tinder, we already have some physical attraction and we feel more comfortable in the date for some reason. I've just noticed this from the dates I've had from tinder.

When I get a date from just asking a cute girl at the coffee shop or whatever, I feel 100x more nervous and literally don't know what to expect for the first date, and I especially don't know what *they* expect. Is hugging (hello, goodbye) okay? is a kiss on the cheek okay? should I flirt? I know how to hold a good conversation, but when it comes to anything more than that, I'm not sure what to do.

I feel like I am constantly undermining happy and positive feelings towards her to protect myself.

I have also grown somewhat pessimistic about emotions and feelings over the last 1-2 years. Ever since my breakup (1-2) years ago I have not felt that kind of unconditional happiness that comes about when one is wholly satisfied with themselves and the life they have. Indeed, I have begun to harbor an attitude of disbelief that anyone will love me or be attracted to me. I worry that I have embedded this attitude to the point where any real prospect of romantic fulfilment is being automatically disregarded by my mind.

I went on a first date with a guy this past weekend, and it went really well.  I am seeing him again this weekend.  

He is really my type and I am quite attracted to him.  We connected really well upon meeting and he's upfront about what he wants.  He is however extremely busy as he's in school pursuing a demanding career (law).  Having an idea what work/life balance is like for lawyers, I am very hesitant about pursuing a relationship with him and think it might be best to nip this in the bud if nothing changes after our second date.  He doesn't talk to me much since he's preoccupied with studying (completely warranted, I respect his dedication to school and don't expect him to neglect studying to talk to me, I just didn't realize how busy he actually is upon first meeting).  While we have a great connection, I've learned my lesson from my past relationships and I know I need to avoid people that I feel like I am ""chasing"".  I definitely feel like I am chasing him.

I've never had to do this before... how should I word things if I decided to stop seeing him?  I don't want to just say ""I don't feel a connection"" because there obviously is a connection, there is just an incompatibility due to lifestyles/career choices.

There have been many times where I came close to having a significant other but for one reason or another was never able to pull it off. I haven't had my first kiss or any other romantic experience, which is doing wonders for my self-confidence /s.

I recently started graduate school and have been trying to meet new people but meeting people and socializing has always been hard for me. I can be quite shy and reserved when I am uncomfortable which I am trying to fix but old habits die hard. Somedays I feel accomplished if I talk to just one person and even if I only say hi. I think my complete lack of social skills is my biggest problem when it comes to finding a SO as I don't talk to enough people or get out of the house enough. When I try to go to events by myself I get extremely uncomfortable which exacerbates my social ineptness. I often find myself wanting to say something...anything...but my mind goes blank. It's weird because if someone starts a conversation with me, I can hold an interesting conversation perfectly fine. I think I struggle with knowing how to approach people, like when it is socially acceptable or not. Plus, its hard for me to read whether someone would be receptive to having a casual conversation when they're wearing a mask. Everyone just looks kind of angry and unfriendly when you can only see half their face. 

I don't think my appearance has anything to do with it. I think I am pretty and I always try to dress nice. I recently lost a lot of weight so my self-esteem is getting better but still shaky.

I’ve (f22) have been dating my bf (m22) for a year and 6 months and it’s been great for the most part. He’s made his stupid mistakes here and there but one major problem I have with him is his issue with being honest. He’s never cheated or anything, but he lies for the dumbest things and I’ve always caught him for it. It makes me question him sometimes. (I’ll explain why I brought up the lying). 

Now, he’s always had a HIGH sex drive, it is even higher than mine. I could be laying down next him and he’d be ready to go. Like an energizer bunny. He was like this pretty much the whole time we were together. However it all changed suddenly. He never wants to be intimate and when we try to, he loses his erection and it’s just kinda awkward afterwards. This has been going on for 5 months now. We only have sex like maybe once a month now?  I will admit that I’ve gained weight. I’m 4’11 and I used to weigh 108 and now I weight 120. However my body is changing and I can’t be the same weight I was when I was a teenager. But I’ll admit I haven’t been taking care of myself because I’ve been battling depression/anxiety and dealing with stressful changes in my life. I’m definitely working on it by eating better and going to the gym. But I can’t help but think he’s not attracted to me anymore. He loves petite women and I don’t fit that description anymore so maybe he just doesn’t wanna be intimate because he finds me “fat”. I’ve struggled with body image my whole life so maybe I’m just being hard on myself. He tells me he’s still attracted to me and finds me sexy and beautiful, but it’s hard to buy it. 

For the past 5 months I’ve been constantly asking him why this has been happening and if he’s been seeing someone else behind my back. Maybe he’s cheating and feels guilty about it? I asked him if it’s just me and to be honest but he says he’s just been tired and it’s normal for guys to go through this. However every time we have sex it always happens. This isn’t normal and he knows it. It’s made me so insecure and I feel horrible about myself. Am I too fat? Is he interested in someone else? Is he just tired of me? I had all these assumptions in my head and I recently snapped and told him I wasn’t buying anything and that he needs to be honest with me or else we’ll take a break from each other to figure or what’s going on. He finally confesses to me that he has a porn addiction and it’s been getting out of hand.. I asked him how long has this been a thing and he said 2 years?? I’m in complete shock and I’m not familiar with things like this so I don’t even know how to go about it. I’m upset. I’m upset that he’s hid this from me and lied to me multiple times and made me question myself. He saw how much this affected me and he still couldn’t tell me the truth? If he could lie about this, what wouldn’t he lie about? I’m super understanding and transparent and he knows this so I don’t understand why he couldn’t confide in me. I love honesty and he couldn’t do that for me. I asked him if there’s anything I could do to help him and he said to never bring it up and that he wants to figure it out on his own. I respect his decision but I can’t help but worry. He also mentioned that he jacks off constantly which is why he has no desire to have sex. So what should I do guys?

I have a 15 year old daughter that I had when I was 16(When I thought I was straight) and she is like a daughter to my friend.

  As of right now I’m getting a divorce from my husband(24M)who I’ve been married to for 2 years. My friend has been nothing but amazing since I told him I was getting divorced about 6 months ago. He has always had my back since we were little kids. 

My friends husband passed away 1 years ago from a heart attack (he was much older than us) and I have let him stay with me and my daughter since he didn’t like sleeping in his house alone since  his husband passed. He’s one of those people who don’t like to show their emotions, so he didn’t really have a reaction when his husband died, he didn’t even go to his funeral because he didn’t want all the attention (he’s very shy). I went to the funeral and said something in his honor since he couldn’t be there. 

But fast forward to about a month ago, he comes over to my house one night because that’s what he usually does when he’s bored (btw he doesn’t live at my house anymore, he eventually moved back home to his). Me and him were sitting on the deck just talking and we were completely sober and we eventually hooked up for the first time ever. In the morning I practically shoved him out of my house because my daughter was going to wake up for school soon and she would freak out if she saw him.

 I didn’t want this relationship to go any further so I completely ignored him for like a month but then my daughter invited him to watch her basketball game like she usually does but she didn’t tell me she was doing that. He came to the basketball game and convinced me to have dinner and talk with him and after a few drinks, one thing led to another and you know what happened. After a couple of days I realized I might have romantic feelings for him and we had dinner one night and he said he felt the same way. 

Idk if I should pursue this relationship with him in worry that it may ruin our friendship and lose the most important person to me in this whole world (excluding my daughter). What should I do?

Side notes: 

Along with my daughter, he is really the only family that I have because I’m not close with my family because they don’t like the fact that I’m gay. He’s also not like a brother to me at all, he’s more like a gay best friend even though I’m gay as well (I’m not sure if that made sense). But I’m just wondering what I should do? Do I take our relationship further and hope for the best? Do I wait till I get officially divorced before starting a relationship with him, but who knows when that will be? Or do I end whatever this thing we have going on right now?

I would like to share with you some experiences I have had recently, that are killing my self-esteem and leaving me heartbroken.

I have been replaced by two males in less than 6 months, or at least, that's where things are heading.

Three months ago, after a very intense and emotional relationship with my ex, she decided to break up with me for very valid and logical reasons (we were too far, and something that she did in 2020 was too traumatic and made me a toxic person) and lied to me, at first, on whether she was dating someone or not, until I asked her. I tried to do my best, but after our history, she decided to remain with him. It was rough, but it was the best decision for her and me. I am not gonna lie, I was hurt, but with time, and after meeting another amazing person, things started to get better and better.

This person I met is the next protagonist of my story. She had cut off after a toxic relationship with her (now former) boyfriend in June. We met on the internet, and we instantly got connected as it was ridiculous the number of things we shared in common and how we complemented each other; music, art, history, ways of seeing life, love, languages, etc, etc, it was like finding one in a million for all of this. 

We met face to face, after me traveling 4 hours to see her, we spent about 26 hours together and then another 6, then I returned home. Our date was amazing, as we literally shared an entire day and night together. Distance is not a problem that cannot be sorted out as I am going to live in her city in some months due that I am going to college there, and she can always come here for free. Everything was going perfect, we loved each other, we liked each other, we really were one for the other. However, two days ago, a boy she has been liking since she was 14 (shes 20 now like me) french kissed her out of the blue, I am not gonna get into details but that is what happened. This action made her re-think everything about our relationship and her relationship with him, as she is now confused and doesn't know what to feel for him (tho she knows she loves me). I am afraid that she will choose her old crush that she could never have over me...

The thing is, this has more to do with how we see ourselves. For me, when someone wanted me, I felt desirable and when someone wasnt interested in me, I would automatically think something was wrong with me.

But  I have learned that relationships are about having a good fit and it doesn't have to do with your identity. If someone isn't interested in you, it doesn't mean you're unworthy or that there's something wrong with you. It just wasn't a good fit.

Shifting to this mindset has freed me of holding onto people from my past and blaming myself for why them not liking me.

I'm in need of advice in what feels to me like a very heavy situation.  Hit me with your honesty but please be respectful.  Thanks!

About 90 days ago I matched an immigrant girl from Central America that's illegally within the US.  Long legal side of the story short she was interviewed and released for 1 year and is in removal preceedings. She needs a lawyer to file her asylum.  

We've been dating for over a month.  If I pay for her attorney it will cost me a substantial amount of money, but she will likely gain another 2-5 years within the US.  I'm a financially secure individual so I'm not going broke on this by any means...but I'm questioning if it's worth the risk.  The fact is people get used for their money, and everything that has happened in our relationship could very well be a lie out of desperation. There's also the chance she's telling the truth about her feelings for me. I made it clear from the start that I don't want her to feel compromised because of my help, and I'm giving free (yes I told her I would pay for a lawyer,  and she agreed to accept my help). There's also nothing preventing me from backing out at any moment to protect myself and my family from a fraud.  

I've been in a decent amount of relationships and I'm pretty good at reading body language during interactions.  If she's faking her feelings she deserves an award for acting skills.

I hope you are having a great day, unlike me.

I would like to share with you some experiences I have had recently, that are killing my self-esteem and leaving me heartbroken.

I have been replaced by two males in less than 6 months, or at least, that's where things are heading.

Three months ago, after a very intense and emotional relationship with my ex, she decided to break up with me for very valid and logical reasons (we were too far, and something that she did in 2020 was too traumatic and made me a toxic person) and lied to me, at first, on whether she was dating someone or not, until I asked her. I tried to do my best, but after our history, she decided to remain with him. It was rough, but it was the best decision for her and me. I am not gonna lie, I was hurt, but with time, and after meeting another amazing person, things started to get better and better.

This person I met is the next protagonist of my story. She had cut off after a toxic relationship with her (now former) boyfriend in June. We met on the internet, and we instantly got connected as it was ridiculous the number of things we shared in common and how we complemented each other; music, art, history, ways of seeing life, love, languages, etc, etc, it was like finding one in a million for all of this.

We met face to face, after me traveling 4 hours to see her, we spent about 26 hours together and then another 6, then I returned home. Our date was amazing, as we literally shared an entire day and night together. Distance is not a problem that cannot be sorted out as I am going to live in her city in some months due that I am going to college there, and she can always come here for free. Everything was going perfect, we loved each other, we liked each other, we really were one for the other. However, two days ago, a boy she has been liking since she was 14 (she's 20 now like me) french kissed her out of the blue, I am not gonna get into details but that is what happened. This action made her re-think everything about our relationship and her relationship with him, as she is now confused and doesn't know what to feel for him (tho she knows she loves me). I am afraid that she will choose her old crush that she could never have over me...

So, for some context, when I started dating my first girlfriend about four years ago, when I realised I was falling out of love with her, I didn’t feel too bad, because I was young, and I told myself that she just wasn’t right (which she wasn’t), and that I was falling out of love with her, which was true. 

In recent years, I have had two far more volatile relationships with 2 other women whom I loved very much, but those relationships never really blossomed into ‘full’ relationships. 
What I mean is that they were so volatile and unfulfilled that they always remained in the dating stages and never became settled/committed relationships. I was obsessed with both of them and utterly in love.
Both of these caused soooo much heartache and left me longing for something simple, easy and committed. 

I’ve been dating my current girlfriend now for about six months and she’s absolutely incredible. She’s everything I ever wished for. Attentive, committed, stable and loving. She’s been so good for me, and my mental health has been thriving. 
However now I’ve started to get this niggling and sinking feeling of impending boredom. Like the fact that we’ve settled into a routine and stability/ mundanity. 

I remember about a year ago, a friend of mine said that she thought I was inherently attracted to unavailable women. And that that was natural because availability becomes boring. I’m so worried now that perhaps my friend was right, and can’t understand why I’m feeling ‘bored’

I'm divorced. I left an abusive marriage. One where my husband cheated, loved to yell at me and denied me any affection.
I've been in therapy for about a year.
I was out in the wild dating here and there. But not really finding anything.
I connected with a man. He just started talking to me at the gym.  (,He is younger than me , by about ten years. He is late twenties. )
Amazing conversation. We finally exchanged numbers after like a month and a half of seeing each other at the gym.
We hung out. Went out on dates. 
We fell into something. I honestly don't know what we are . It's been four months.
I just know it's beautiful and awesome.
We hang out pretty much every day at the gym. 4 times a week on our own ( dates, hanging out etc)...he sleeps over once or twice a week. 
We cuddle. Talk for hours. He makes me laugh. We have an amazing intimate life. 
He showed up when my cat got sick to make sure I was ok and my cat was ok. He stayed for like four hours just cuddling me and watching tv. He brings me ice cream if I had a bad day. I have his favorite snack in stock. When he leaves we walk to his car together...and he always kisses me. 
We were joking around one time and he called himself my boyfriend.  He did mention he isn't talking to anyone else.
He says he's told his friends about me..but I heard him talking to his boss and said the girl I'm hanging out with .. I've told my friends. 
We don't constantly text during the day as he works in the field. But he will randomly text me.  Sometimes it's just a meme..or a random music video...or it's something nice. 
We are constantly laughing and smiling...Im just filled with so much joy and happiness..it's crazy. 
I guess I don't know exactly how to define what we are. I don't talk to other guys. I don't want too. 
I mean I honestly think it's way more than just a friend's with benefits...I mean why would a man spend pretty much every day with someone if they didn't like them? Or think of them as something special?
But it's been awhile since I've been out here...so. maybe I'm just being a romantic right now. 
But I like him a bunch and I guess I just want input.

so pretty much what happened was me and my ex started talking again like 2 months ago, he told me he wanted to get back together and I just wanted it to be a chill thing (communicated it to him a lot of times). We both knew our intentions so we decided on a middle ground to just go w the flow. 

During this time and now, one of the reasons why I dont want a relationship is due to my DECLINING mental health and my alcoholism. I take meds as well so I have literally just been a full on zombie, not really knowing who I am or what I want and just rolling w it (as u can see why I saw him that way. 

I really love him, I do, but I just couldn’t.

I got really fucked up one night and “cheated”? on him with one of his “friends”-they aren’t friends their in the same friend group but my ex despises him. my mental state, me being fucked up or anything can excuse the decision I made, it’s my fault and I TRULY regret it. But through me doing this, I feel like ppl don’t talk ab what cheating on someone acc does to u? Like I feel heartbroken.

And here’s my whole thing, I feel guilty for anything now. He’s beyond pissed at me for it (oh yes 100% I told him right away) and he just wants me to get better.

I feel so guilty bc I feel bad that I feel like he doesn’t even want to think ab how I feel (completely understandable), I feel guilty for ever even feeling happiness again bc I just feel like I don’t deserve it. I feel guilty even getting better bc why did I drag him through hell and back and then get better after this? Then I get mad at myself for even thinking like this bc it’s like wow now ur just playing victim ur trying to be the victim with everything-
SOMEONE HELP ME.

I[15M] never had luck with girls. I’ve had a life full of rejection, oh well that’s not what I’m upset about right now.

All my successes have been with girls who live extremely far, it’s quite wild. I have been close with some girls I live near… or at least I thought I was. The first girl (who we’ll call Sarah) I want to talk about was right before the school year started. She told me she was interested and wanted to get to know me more. A few days to a week later, she’s in a relationship. 

The second time was with this girl (who we’ll call Hannah) and she told me she liked me but had a lot of drama with her ex I knew. She told me this guy bullied her, had his friends bully her, and a whole plethora of wild shit. I found out that was a lie. How? She started flirting with my best friend. I confronted her and she admitted my suspecions were correct.

The third time, was this girl we’ll call Sabrina. We agreed to go to homecoming together, and everything was going well. Then she told me she “randomly” got asked out and said yes. Then posted this TikTok of her and him kissing on her car. This one hurt the most it still hurts lmao

The final time wasn’t actually her fault. We have this exchange student[16F] and I saw her during a school play. I thought she was cute so I had my friend tell her about me and everything and she thought I was really cute. BUT, her host family doesn’t give her a cell phone and we don’t see each other often enough at school to build a connection off that alone. I was gonna try to get around that and see her but then I found out (today) that she was apparently thrown into some conflict with her sisters and is moving back to Serbia. What a wild ass situation.

I’m always put in the shittiest situations revolving relationships and I’m ready to give up. I don’t know to fix this shit, it almost feels like the world conspires against me getting a girl, the president of the US himself orders the secret service to keep girls from being interested lmao.

Now that part about the world and the president is very obviously a joke, but that’s how it feels when love is constantly out of reach. I think I should give up, what do y’all think?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1100332,public,self,Why I’m deciding to give up on Relationships,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qgog09/why_im_deciding_to_give_up_on_relationships/,all_ads,6,,,
