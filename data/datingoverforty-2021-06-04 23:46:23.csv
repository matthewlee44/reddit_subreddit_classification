0,nstb9g,1622891010,Does age have to be a thing?,"40 isn't old, right? I mean... if you look at most 40-year-olds around you, most of them could be any age from 30 to 55. Some of them even look 28. It's hard to tell these days. I do have people not believe it when I say that I'm over 35, even though I'm starting to feel more and more that I will never have children or a partner, which isn't fair because I really DID want children, a family, and a white picket fence. I wanted to bake, grow fruit trees, sew clothes -- just your basic house brownie stuff -- AND have a career. I see younger women do this all the time. They take a year or two off to raise babies while their husband works. I don't even think this is anathema to feminism, which is another discussion altogether. It is somewhat unsatisfactory that I am only a mother of cats.

But... 40 isn't old! Is it?

This is what I hate about OLD (on-line dating). If you think of OLD and the words ""over 40"" and the word ""woman"", interested men start thinking of Stifler's mom. I look nothing like Jennifer Coolidge. I'm more like the love-child of Bjork circa 1994 and Kelly Marie Tran and (I said) a brownie. I'm not looking for a hook-up. I'm not into that... but for some reason the people who are interested in my profile (some selfies, no total full body shots, nothing suggestive) ONLY want hook-ups. And they are rude when I say no. The few middle-aged men who I met who were not into hook-ups 1) could not stop talking about their careers, 2) made it clear that they were not interested in living with another humans, ever 3) have too many children from previous partners... and their children come first (you will always come second). It makes me think poorly of human beings in general.

I think of that old adage, ""life isn't meant to be fair"", and I think that perhaps it's just not meant to be fair for ME. You might think: well, you may not have children or a partner, but at least you have a career and money. Wrong. I lost those things from being trapped in an abusive marriage for a decade. I'm lucky that I left, but I left with nothing. I say lucky because while some people might say that leaving is an achievement, I think of all the women in the world who are unable to leave, and they are not ""failures"".

Needless to say, starting my life over has been disappointing. Fortunately, I am full-time employed now. Unfortunately, because of my work, which I love, I have almost no time to meet men in the wild. Oh... and before you say, ""it would have been even more disappointing if you didn't leave your marriage"", I'm not interested in the past. 

I'm interested in the present and future. In what universe will a single man, of moderate attractiveness, who is gainfully employed, who values family, is respectful and kind, and is of sound body and mind, want a strange, single, middle-aged woman with a complicated history... like me?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nstb9g/does_age_have_to_be_a_thing/

2,nswjfy,1622902150,I could use some feedback.,"I met a really nice guy recently. We really click and decided to be exclusive pretty quickly which generally isn’t my style. 
He’s perfect in so many ways. I truly feel like I can be myself around him and we talk endlessly. 
He also has an ex wife who doesn’t seem happy he’s moving on and I have a similar situation with my ex so I was understanding. 
Weird mixed messages is what I get from my ex so I’ve stopped taking it seriously. 
If my ex pulls anything he gets blocked. I give nary a shit these days. 
We had plans for him to come up this weekend. I was so excited. 
I’ve worked my ass off on my home and property over the last year and I wanted to show it off. I also did a lot of cleaning and laundry in anticipation of his visit. 
I’m also going to a party today I’ve been waiting months for. I also have some shitty chronic health problems. 
Well, two days ago his ex wife stole his new puppy who has lots of health issues. 
Somehow he got caught up in all the drama and decided not to come up and chose to tell me in a very casual way. So casual part of me wondered if I was getting dumped for the ex. 
I texted this was too much and I needed a break to think. 
He freaked out, said he was going to drop the dog off with his ex and come to my home in the middle of the night. I said no way. One too many bad choices in that scenario. 
I have health problems and went through a nightmare divorce. 
I can’t handle shit like this. I barely slept. I feel horrible. He texts her often. It’s like he likes the drama. As he said he got caught up in it. 

Am I tripping or was saying I need a break for a while and then we can be friends and get to know each other slowly the smartest thing I could have done? 

After writing this out I’m feeling better about my choice. 

I abhor drama and it massively effects my health. I need someone stable and predictable. He seemed so consistent.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nswjfy/i_could_use_some_feedback/

His profile stated that he was 6'1. After several weeks of telephone conversations and text messages, we agreed it was time to meet in person.

As he walks towards me, I realize he might be 5'9 at most (which is a totally acceptable height for me...but I had expected him to be 6'1). Then he smiled and he had so many gaps in his teeth!! I could had slid a nickel between each one!!!

Looking back at his profile, I now realize he wasn't smiling in ANY of his 7 pictures!! Needless to say, this relationship ended rather quickly!

Now, when I'm looking at guy's pictures on their profile, I notice quickly when they're not smiling! And if conversation is engaged, I'm quick to ask them to post a picture of them smiling...with teeth!! You'd be amazed how many of them stop talking to me when I request this!

6,nsz3to,1622909381,Sensualist Seeking Same,"So, here's what's up, guys!

I'm 44, never been married, no kids to speak of. I live alone in this cute little dungeon of an apartment with 2 bedrooms, 1 I just...don't have any use for at all and the one I take up residence in is devoid of love and everything else that bedrooms are for. I'm shy yet passionate, a good writer but I'll stutter if we ever speak. I'm not looking for some crazy role-play or violence and bondage. I'm actually not quite sure why all that hair-pulling, choking, devolution of sexuality ever became popular but I...digress.

Guess I'm looking for what everybody's looking for and I tend to lock up my sexuality for a good long time even though there's such a well of passion and curiosity there. So why not post this here instead of arduously hinting at what I want in a relationship? I'm one of those people that strangers come up to and tell their entire life story to cuz I listen. Anyone making a dedicated attempt to get to know me? SO few and far-between. Consider myself quite an open book, a sinner, an Angel of Mercy, someone sensual who loves nothing more than to take an entire day and make it a classic make-out session with the right guy.

That's where it all usually goes sideways! And I'm sure that's true for you as well. Gotta be the 'right' guy. You should be witty. That's actually probably one of my very favorite things in the whole world, unless you turn sarcastic TOWARDS me, then I'll probably experience an epic chipping away at my self-esteem in tiny doses until ... it's over. I like to laugh, it's halfway to getting me horizontal and there's nothing cuter than a woman dissolving into laughter with a twirl of her hair around her index finger and a subtle lip bite to conclude, cuz you now have my attention.

You gotta be intelligent because after all that sex we're gonna have I'm gonna wanna talk about it, about life in general, our pasts, our futures, our everyday lives and anything else we can squeeze out of our brains. I'd love if you had a libido and were clear about that. I find that in my fantasies the men I conjure kinda never shut up. And it could be just the simplest thing but it leaves me reeling, repeating over and over a phrase you've whispered into my ear or said directly to me during a critical moment will push me over the edge every time and I'll adore you for it.

Who wouldn't love to wake up every morning with the potential for a loving, primal tryst? I don't care if our breath is bad, if we smell like sleep, if your hair's crazy, I wanna feel that alarm clock pressing up against my back saying 'Good Morning, Sugar.' And that's just the morning round...I want you to want me beyond reason, to be able to be verbose about how much and why. I want someone I can send naughty pictures to who'll gape at them and think 'God, how did I get this girl...' cuz trust me...I'll want you. I'm a big writer. I've won an award for it, wrote for my township newspaper as a teenager, had teachers keep my essays for future classes to show them how an essay should be constructed. And of course that spills over into love letters. And texts...chats...what I hope to be all day, all night chats if you're that available. I'm a huge multi-tasker so I'll be able to carry on the conversation as well as slay at work, trust me. I do actually want a relationship, not 'just' the sexual aspect.

I'd love to bond with someone over sharing humor, our personal stories and our everyday activities. Oh age-range...You should be I suppose at least in your 30's to 50's I think, though I won't rule out a little younger if I feel like we vibe together. What else...Oh! I'm in the Central US Time Zone in case you're wondering. Midwest girl, northern Minnesota born and raised.

9,nt39bo,1622921014,"Some people DO look ""young for their age"".","I get it, there are too many people on OLD who are delusional about their looks. And it might feel like a service to ""disabuse"" anyone on here who mentions they think they look younger than their stereotypical chronological age, or that they have been told so by friends, of that notion. You can feel like you are saving them embarrassment, and saving their potential dates disappointment, by making sure we all know that **no one actually looks young for their age**. The comments about it slide into outright mockery at times, and it's become some kind of knee-jerk call and response on this sub. 

But the idea that everyone looks their age is patently untrue, and we all know it. Some people DO look a great deal younger than their age, just as some look older. Especially people who aren't just pasty white Europeans, they often age wonderfully (looking at you /u/MySocialAlt, ironically enough). 

If someone is fit, if someone is healthy, if someone has never smoked, or they simply got lucky with genetics, they can look really damn young ""for their age"". 

Of course, the truth is that there's no one ""look"" for 30's or 40's or 50's, and I think many of us are still stuck in a time when 40 and 50 were considered old, as they were in our parent's time. But ever since Jane Fonda showed us ""this is what 40 looks like"" back in the day, many people have been looking a lot younger as they age, and acting younger, and not capitulating to the stereotypes about how we should look and behave as older people. 

So, I really think we should drop the pretense that everyone who says they ""look younger"" is kidding themselves. Maybe instead we should urge them to say they ""look good for their age"" instead, and break away from the stereotypes around age altogether.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nt39bo/some_people_do_look_young_for_their_age/
10,nt3upb,1622922704,Casual monogamy?,"I’ve (F47) recently started dating a man (M49) who has quite frankly blown me away with his awesomeness. We’ve been on 4 dates and slept together on date 3.  Last night was an overnight at his place, it was perfection in all ways.. the depth of conversation, discovering things in common, the sex... It is now very clear to me I want to focus on this man to see where it goes without distraction ie: talking to or having sex with other people, and I have already told the other guy I was casually dating that I’d like to not continue romantically with him.  I’ve never approached this so mindfully before, previously I seem to have fallen into exclusivity quickly and typically that was due to previous BFs wanting relationships right away.  Being older and wiser(?) I know I need to take this slowly and not jump into anything fast.  But.. I only want us to have sex with each other.  So!  I’m going to see him again tomorrow and I want to bring this up.  Mainly because I do not want to wrongly assume he’s on the same image and then get blindsided and hurt by discovering he’s sleeping with other people.  

How do I approach this without sounding like I’m asking to get serious right away?  What if he’s says he’s still exploring other connections?

I told him via text. He did not react, even though I said I'm really sad about it, twice, except to ask how many dogs and how it happened. He even went so far as to predict her partner dog would die soon due to missing her. Not once did he say ""I'm sorry, it sounds like she was really important to you"". Just flat and lame comments, very matter of fact.

Today I texted him that I prefer to have people in my life who have empathy and compassion, neither of which I saw in that moment, and that it wasn't the first time I'd experienced this with him. I told him we should not pursue a friendship any longer. His reply: ""Yeah, I should probably just stick to guy friends.""

He also doesn’t seem to always want to get frisky when we’re together, which I’m not used to in the early stages of dating, but maybe this is more normal than I realize? 

Not to sound like a princess, but most men I have dated are forthcoming with their feelings, buy me flowers in the first month or so, and initiate at least a few feel good words or sweet sentiments and thoughtful texts throughout the week by this point... I know this can also raise a red flag of love bombing when people come on too strong, too fast. 

I’m not expecting a “hey beautiful” every minute, but I appreciate one of these or this sentiment every once in awhile, in text or in person. Do some men not do this very often? Is he not interested in me? Or is he not interested in big displays or lots of empty words? 

I can appreciate that too, if he’s the type that only says things he 1000% feels and means, and if romantic words have weight to him and he doesn’t want to go there yet.  On the getting frisky part-I totally understand people have differing libidos and I can also appreciate it if he wants to let me to know I’m not just being kept around for sex and we don’t have to do that all the time...

41,nuaa0q,1623065952,How are you all handling Friends that keep picking wrong in dating then complain / get hurt over it..,"It is frustrating to watch people you care about continue to make the same choices and expect a different result. 

Since I've known one of my friends (55F), she's never had a boyfriend even. In recent years, I started to see the patterns as to why men aren't asking for more. 

She often gets taken with men in their 30s. Usually handsome, professional. They may be divorced with young kids. Some are never married, no kids club.

She really feeds into the attention, as she is one that 'thinks she looks and feels older' However, as much as I care about her and know she does look great - she does look her age (I know we talk about this on here often) and she is not active like she may have been in her 20s/30s. She is in the genetically blessed but doesnt work out category also.

Here is the thing with these men. Whether she meets them through OLD or out on a Friday night. These men arent looking for a relationship with her. She has it convinced in her mind that they are. Then, she sleeps with them and they fade away. She gets upset. Then she doesnt date for a month or so. Then legit seems to forget (as in if I brought up a man's name that did this to her last year - she does not even remember the situation or the man!) and then. She repeats the cycle. 

Last year, she did meet a man her age through OLD that coincidently went to her church. She is ALWAYS saying since she serves ministry in her church that she needs a good Godly man. Well, she was sent one to get to know, and he haooened to also be handsome and so amazing. He took her on beach picnics and surprised her with outings. He was patient about some of her ways of doing things. And....he wanted to be intentional about dating her and looking towards the future. She was not into it. Stopped seeing him. And Then after her adult kids and I said "" Remember when you said ..."" She reached out to make amends but he had already at thay point moved on. 

She is now back to the 30somethings. 
This one is the same type. Never married. No kids. She is texting me talking about how how perfect he is and they are falling for one another fast. It has been - 2 dates. 

I'm to the point that I don't even want tI discuss and set boundaries as she keeps picking it. This younger man wants kids. She is a grandmother. She is basically the GMILF version of the women these guys would marry if that makes sense. 

Does Anyone else have friends in their xircles like this? Have you got to the point where you just have needed to tell them ""enough' or I love ya but I cant discuss your dating life because it is honestly too much of a rollercoaster or hurtful to give you advice then you keep picking men that don't want more with you. 

Also: I dont care for the fact that she will break rules for these men yet impose ridiculous ones for the good ones. Ex: with the handsome 55 yo she was so adamant about ""I won't do this or that' yet then with the 30somethings she is having a free for all with them after just meeting.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nuaa0q/how_are_you_all_handling_friends_that_keep/
42,nuao78,1623067231,UPDATE: Delivery to Massachusetts.,"Just about a month ago, u/piece-unlikely responded to a comment of mine. [Here's a refresher.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n7yrgn/men_where_do_you_go_alone_and_how_do_you_signal/gxfomhc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I went up there to follow through on my promise to deliver this past week and it was the best possible thing that either one of us could've hoped for. \[Side note: I already spoke with her and received her blessing to post this update\]

We spent every possible moment together and never once felt like it was something that was awkward of weird. It was like reconnecting with an old lover. We connected in the best possible way and everything about it was absolutely perfect. 

Imagine, for a moment, that you're excited for something. Perhaps a concert. Perhaps an experience you've been looking forward to. But, you're used to disappointment. You're used to things never working out like you expect them to. So, you prepare yourself for the worst. Something's going to go wrong. The electricity and connection you felt online doesn't transfer to real life. Someone was putting on a facade. The connection isn't there. Just...something goes wrong.

That didn't happen.

From the first moment we hugged, it was pure magic. When we kissed, it was cemented that this was something that was meant to happen. We both have been through a lot in our lives, which was seemingly preparing us to be ready for this relationship. 

We've talked for literally hundreds of hours since last month, between video dates (which typically last 3+ hours), texting, Snapchat, and various other avenues of communication. Our communication has always been open and honest, just to make sure that the foundation of the relationship is solid. Yeah...there have been some awkward conversations, but no judgment from either person. We're both grown-ass adults who have been through some shit. But, we talked about it all, putting it out there for better or for worse.

What happens next? Who knows. It's up to the universe at this point. It brought us together, by absolute happenstance. Both of us considered not posting our comments that sparked this. What if we didn't? Would we have found each other? Doubtful. But, this is a point to take that chance. Put yourself out there and take that chance. It might work out in the most incredible of ways.

What if we saw each other for everything we are with all our loveliness and flaws and scars and smarts and glow and just really loved each other and made a life and were happy? Or I don’t know, we could just stare at each other and watch the world burn while the kids play PlayDoh and log excessive screen time.

This video in particular is a favorite and I return to it often to remind myself of the way forward in this new chapter. To sum it up, Vaknin suggests you can avoid trash people and shitty relationships by following these four rules:

1. If it feels wrong - it is wrong.

2. S/he is trying too hard? Involves too much conspicuous and ostentatious effort? It is fake.

3. Too good to be true? It is not true.

4. Verify everything: 90% of the time, people lie and 90% of the time we believe every word they say (90:90 rule or base rate fallacy).

I agree with EVERY word.

53,nuru4g,1623111965,When the break up conversation solidifies that you made the right decision.,"Well, long time coming but my on again off again relationship is done forever.

Despite me repeatedly sharing that him giving me the silent treatment for days has been the kicker for me, and that since this last happened a month ago, I haven’t bounced back, he grabbed on to a bunch of other reasons I was calling it off including that I met someone else. 

This relationship has been an eye opener for me. I was madly, head over heels for this man before all the silent treatments, and I’m not even entirely sure why. If I look back he was always one step ahead of me though, and that did make me anxious. 

He had flaws (as do I) but I chalked it up to “price of admission.” I knew I wouldn’t change him, and I didn’t try. When we were getting along well, they didn’t even bother me. 

We dated just over a year, and one of my comments was that it shouldn’t be so hard so early. Sure, relationships are work. But Jesus.

I see a lot of my mistakes which is great. He wanted to cohabitate and things which I did not want initially, I wanted a casual relationship and I was clear about that, but in time I did see wanting to spend more time together. I struggled with this as it would involve blending families which I didn’t want to do as he kept having these silent treatments. A source of tension was that I wouldn’t integrate the families more, and I was burnt out trying to balance both houses.

The silent treatment is very much the way his father controls his mother and I even pointed out today that he can see that as a problem in their relationship but not ours. He refused to take any responsibility for this, and even suggested I met someone else that I wanted to be in a long term relationship with (this is complicated as we had an open relationship, although never physically acted on). But communication was also open and he requested the open relationship. 

For myself, I see that I lost a lot of myself in this relationship. I dressed to his tastes and things because I knew he enjoyed it. I really moved in to a caregiver role because it made him happy, and as my ex husband was always unhappy, I think I wanted to prove I was capable of “making someone happy.”

I’m returning to my thought that casual dating is right for me. I have no desire to cohabitate, mix funds, blend families, and so on. I may have some casual sex in the future, but I’m not looking to date for a good long time.

I am curious to know your experience on eHarmony. Basically: do I suck, am I unusual, or it's just the norm? 

Female, mid-40s, pretty good looking, but not American so not looking standard blonde American, although I am white and with light hair. Set area for 60 miles to include the larger sprawl. I got some matches, but very few in the over 100 area - a few 108, 109, and some in the 98-104 area. I heard that the top score is 140 and I am hearing from other people that they get 120s frequently.

The reason I am asking is not that I am in a competition or looking for numbers but because I got only one engagement with someone I actually didn't find a good fit. I am thinking that if my low 100s matches frequently get higher scores, then obviously they will put me at the bottom of the pile. So while I consider them high ranking they consider me low ranking and not engage.

Please share your experience.

We're not together now, because all he wants is a sex-only situation and I'm done with that. But I'm trying to be friendly to him. When we were seeing each other, I was constantly doing things for him hoping he'd see what a great person I am. He never so much as wished me happy birthday via text message let alone get me a gift, buy me flowers, or do anything like that over 6 years. I'm not exaggerating. He did nothing. He thought his amazing sex skills were his gift to me (eyeroll). He also didn't treat me like a real girlfriend because I'm several years older than him (to be fair, I look younger than my age). When he was with women his own age, I'd see his social media with pics of him doing nice things for those women. Fine. I'm done with anything beyond a texting friendship with him now.
Anyway, today he asked me if I'd like to keep his dog while he goes on vacation. He worded it like he would be doing me the favor because I love his dog. At first I said ok, but then I thought, FFS, I'm 40. Why am I still doing this? I later told him I would not be doing any more favors for people who don't do things for me in return. I said I have to stop being a doormat and being overly nice because that's how I end up getting my feelings hurt by all kinds of people.

57,nuurkf,1623121324,The Joy of Cooking,"I used to have a boyfriend who, when he would stay over on a work night, I would get up a little early and cook &amp; pack him these kind of elaborate lunches with corresponding sauces &amp; seasoning packets and it was all very Tupperwared out. 

Recently, I dated a guy who admitted he never cooked/had home cooked meals and, when we planned to spend a few days together, I told him I would cook for him. I remember really enjoying it. Planning my best dishes, that little bit of high anxiety hoping I didn't screw anything up. Stashing a travel-sized spice arsenal in my bag. Sharing with him some easy cheats he could duplicate himself, when he asked how this or that was made.

Cut to modern day, and the guy I'm seeing and I agree to get ingredients for a mega salad full of stuff we both like. 

Closer to dinner time he says to me, ""I'm going to go finish blah-blah in the  backyard and by the time you put together the salad I should be back.""

Something about it hit me wrong. It was a little too division-y of labor to me, and I remember feeling like I was being told to 'make dinner and have it ready by the time I get back' in a not so covert kind of way.

I let it pass cause a girl's gotta eat. But I remember not enjoying putting together that mega salad. Not wanting, or being excited to impress, and literally not wanting to 'create' for this particular person, as I had for others in the past.

In a word, it was joyless. I was much happier the next day when we each concocted our own sub sandwiches independently, but next to each other at the kitchen counter.

61,nuvx09,1623125165,Too much for age gap FWB?," So I (25f) have been seeing this amazing guy (50m) (I am fully aware that this age gap is insane) for the past four months. I didn't expect anything from our first meeting but we ended up having amazing chemistry (both sexual and interpersonal) and he's been all around very communicative.

He made it very clear to me that he recently went on a self-discovery journey, and one of the things he realized is that he is not monogamous and really values all the variety that life has to offer (mostly sexually). This was perfect because I'm a PhD student who will periodically do research abroad and am not looking for something extremely involved or serious. But I did make it clear that I wanted something emotionally involved and not purely sexual. He said we were totally on the same page and that emotionally involved is his default. We also agreed to let each other know if we were sleeping with others for health reasons.

Fast forward to now: we parted ways for two months for summer travels. In the past, we had both gone on two smaller trips and he made it very very clear he wanted to see me after each of them. This time feels very different. He never used to go a few days without initiating contact and sending 'thinking of you' texts and now it's been over a week since we talked. I realize that he may be seeing other people, but is it too much to ask for a quick check in once in a while? I honestly just don't feel wanted anymore by him and I have no idea if we're solid upon return. We said we would update each other on any new feelings/if we needed to end this so I feel like an extra conversation would be redundant. What should I do?

It seems daunting to try to meet someone now.  I'm introverted and don't get out much, so it's extremely rare that I meet someone in the wild.  I'd like to have someone special in my life.  Swiping through so many profiles and then starting a conversation feels daunting sometimes. I met my ex wife on a dating site, but now it feels like there's so much chance for rejection (and I know there will probably be a lot more rejections than successes).

70,nv4sez,1623161120,Anyone else feel just a bit... sad... at the way we can't have many new experiences together?,"I don't know if this will make much sense but here goes in case someone can relate...

I have been with my partner for a while now. He's in his 50s (12yrs older than me) and has been married twice before he met me. I am also divorced myself so not really in a position to judge others but somehow it bothers me and makes me worry that he's a bit emotionally unstable and has issues with long-term commitment. He has brought up the subject of us getting married a couple of times and just the thought of being ""the third wife"" is kind of embarrassing and degrading. I don't want to be the ""third time lucky"" or ""third time's the charm"" or all the other things that get said about women in that situation. I've always just brushed it off with comments like ""Given our past history with marriage I don't think either of us are much good at it"" and eventually he stopped bringing it up. Now he calls me his ""not-wife"" which makes us both laugh.

Obviously I love him and enjoy our life together. But sometimes I am sad for what we can't have. It seems like I could have the ""wedding"" if I wanted but I don't see much point given we've both done it once (or twice) already with other people (and this is no disrespect to people that get remarried, just me personally I'm kind of over it). We can't buy our first house or get a first pet because they are all things that have been done already with other people. I suppose we could travel to new places together once Covid is over. Neither of us have children and we talked about trying for that but given our ages I wouldn't be very confident (although I did get pregnant early on in our relationship... 39 and 50, talk about a shock, sadly not to be but you know... maybe still possible...) but a baby is a whole other new human being and probably not something ""to do"" just to tick off ""a first"" with a partner. 

Anyway this was just kind of a rant crossed with a reflection. When I think of my ex-husband and the excitement of us getting married (first time for us both) at 26 and buying a house and traveling and all the good years before it went bad I feel a bit sad that my partner and I don't really have that sort of fun exciting history to draw on. We were both pretty jaded when we met and we kind of saved each other and pulled each other out of black holes so a lot of our relationship has been propping each other up rather than reveling in the fun of life, then Covid hit and our plans to go to Europe and North Africa for 6 weeks didn't happen, and now I'm in my 40s and everything seems a bit... like what is left to do? It seems unfair we only get to do all the good things in life once.

Hope this made sense anyway. Maybe I'm being a bit maudlin! I have a lot to be thankful for. I just thought maybe some of you on here might relate.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nv4sez/anyone_else_feel_just_a_bit_sad_at_the_way_we/

There appears to be consistency between that account and the one here as far as images go.

I'm (41M) recently on the dating scene again and having all these flashbacks to all the time spent on boring dates that weren't gonna go anywhere. Or if I did meet somebody I liked, having to choose between them and hanging out with friends and doing other things that were important to me, especially on weekends.

A big part of the reason why I ask is because as I'm getting older, I'm getting a lot more jaded about dating and trying to think consciously of who's REALLY gonna be there for the long haul. It just seems to be a much more judicious investment to spend time with the people that value me now vs random strangers that might turn into a love interest, and even then it might only be a short-term love interest. The intimacy is nice, but sometimes I really wonder if it's worth the trouble.

How do other people in this sub feel about this question? How do you address it for yourself? I'd be curious to know. 

Note: I'm not asking for advice here. I'd specifically like to hear other people's thoughts and experiences and how they address this for themselves. I share my struggles to set the stage, not to get advice. A lot of these subs need to cool it with the internet psychoanalysis. Yeah, I go to therapy. Yeah, I'm aware of my attachment issues.

73,nv7w3o,1623169071,Took your advice!,"I asked for advice on here a while back. 

As a refresher: I dated a woman in my early 20s for a few months. I cheated on her, and, to no one’s surprise, she dumped me and walked out of my life.

Now, 20 years later, a few weeks ago, I saw the girlfriend I cheated on at a party at a coworkers house. It turns out she is good friends with my coworker, his wife and their kids. I’m divorced, 40M. She is 42F, widowed as of two years ago. I asked about apologizing to her / asking her out.

Anyway, here’s the update: My coworker invited me to a barbecue at his house and she was there again. I apologized for my behavior all those years ago, she was gracious and called it water under the bridge and said she’d forgive me if I kept her Bloody Marys refreshed all night. I did, she mostly just wanted more pickles and olives and I was happy to oblige.

Some of you advised that I not ask her out. Some of you advised that I shoot my shot and ask her out.

In the end, I invited her, and her kids, and my coworker, his wife and their kids up to my lake house next weekend for a party. I promised my coworker months ago a trip on the boat once we were all vaccinated, plus since she and her kids are friends with my coworkers family, this just seems like it will be fun for everyone.

There will be 4 other families up there next weekend too, and my son, who I pick up on Friday. 

So, it will be a fun weekend.

I’m not sure how much I want to persue this.  Apologizing to her was really the primary thing I had to get done. That was weighing on me. And, I am interested in her. She’s easy to like. She’s also a single mom, and I’m fine with hooking up with single moms, but I’m not into a relationship with one, but hey, people change, right?

I figure, the party will be a fun chance to get reacquainted, in a no stress, no pressure way (I love playing host to be honest so this is always fun for me) and maybe there’s something there, maybe not.

74,nv8sl0,1623171418,Can y’all share the lowdown on meetup?,"Hi there - 

Contemplating getting out there after divorce (48F) and read that some folks have enjoyed meetup groups. I’m in a big city so I think it should be fairly varied in options. When I signed up, however, it was a little underwhelming at first glance. 

There were what looked like two singles groups. Ok, so I guess that’s an option. I’m unfortunately the age cut off, so I can’t sit at the kids’ high top table at the bar. Probably ok, but still a factor. I wish it was a more open age range given I’ve met many interesting people across their forties vs just my age plus 20 years. 

I love love games and trivia, but the trivia grouped looked much younger. And the games were… more “European strategy games” or role playing. I guess not everyone wants me to kick their ass in Scattergories, Sorry, or Boggle. Lol. 

Some wine groups - I could consider one of those. Do people Uber to those? Just not sure I want to mix my anxiety about being single again with liquid courage. 

I found a True Crime Book Club but it’s 10 women. (Might also scare away my future lover…🔪)

SO, those of you who enjoy Meetup dot com, could you please share some successes and strategies? 

Please know my comments above aren’t intended to be a way to look for an out. And I do not see it as a dating app - I know it’s just to get out there and meet people. That would be particularly helpful for me because a lot of my life here was “couple driven” before our split. I’m fairly outgoing, feel like I can have broad conversations, but it’s still hard to make new friends as an adult. 

I just like to try things with a bit of a strategy in mind, so I’m already trying to put myself out there.

We are not in an established, exclusive relationship, and have discussed this as much at end of April.  Almost 3 weeks ago, I noticed she suddenly had not been initiating texts as much, while I was, almost daily. I also came to the realization I was the one initiating the date plans, never her. The last date I asked her out on, for Memorial Day weekend, she was non-committal to an answer for a couple of days before I followed up. She turned it down, said she might have family plans the night that worked best for me, and also cited a reason about being uncomfortable with her teenage daughter  being home alone while we were out some 25 minutes away (not really an issue in the past). I decided to leave the ball in her court saying,""Ok, you tell me the the next time you'd like to get together."" To this point, I've yet to get a proposal to see each other again.

Since this realization I made weeks ago, I've cut back initiating texts to every 3 days (she's initiated every 2 to 3), cut down on the length of responses and exchanges, made sure to not prioritize responding to her texts right away since she's always been slow to respond. I also have not suggested a new date, and am meeting other women since we're not exclusive (though my feelings for her are quite strong). 

Take us to today, she surprised me with a mid-day text she has a sudden job interview for a position she told me about applying for the last time we were together. She is panicking, nervous, etc and asked I send some ""calming, positive vibes her way"", making sure she mentioned the time the interview will take place. Naturally, because I care A LOT about her, I sent her words of encouragement and sprinkled in some humor. I truly want to see her get this job; it pays more, will allow her to more comfortably afford her new home and support her kids. I truly was touched by the fact she reached out to me for some support. She wound up shooting me an update as soon as the interview was over.

Does this text today indicate the possibility that maybe I've misread what's going on here between us? Would this be the type of message you'd send to a guy who is a ""Plan B"" you're just keeping around as you search the dating pool for other men?

But before that question, I wanted to see how we would do on our second weekend together, the drive was good, a few hours to truly chat about things, she opened up more about her ex, and how they still chat a few times a week even though she said he was her past and she did not really hear from him. I asked what really happened when they lived together because for someone to live with someone that does not mean much to her, she had to put up with him for 8 years, again, I am going on what she shared to me, it did not add up, for one, I would walk if the women was not into me anymore, I would find a job and a place to call my own, and not leach, she said he stood around and really did not work, he would miniplate her, did not make any sense, she does not seem one to be taken for. 

Every time I would ask what she wanted to do or eat, she really never gave much of a answer, as much as she said she was a planner, she was not much of one. I think she just left it up to me, which in some way I felt like she was my kid and I had to make all the decisions, I wanted more from her, but she was not showing me anything. I honestly think I would have been better off on my own, then having someone that was not giving me much to work with. Not sure what was going on with her, maybe she had other things on her mind, which I would have loved to hear what was wrong, I asked her maybe twice if everything was okay? She just reminded me of her dog, and I know that maybe I should have asked her to bring her dog, since her sitter was not really doing much with the dog, and the dog seemed lonely in a way, maybe that was my fault, but I am not much of a dog owner to actually travel with them, anyway, she seemed like her mind was somewhere else.

I never presented her with the charm I got us, I think I just wanted to end the trip and head home. Unfortunately It took a long weekend away for me to know that we are two different people, maybe it is me that gave up, or could not look past what I felt I would want a women to be like, but I know I tried to be open minded. When someone wants your two cents, keeping quiet is not the answer in my opinion.

91,nvk2fh,1623202431,"So very grateful for OLD, AKA An Ode To OLD","I (M52) never thought I'd date online. And if I did I thought it would be at least a year after my separation/divorce before I did.

But a few months after I separated, my therapist told me it was time for me to start dating again, since the last year of my marriage had been so emotionally difficult (and loveless/sexless!) for me while my ex emotionally abandoned me, which meant --- my therapist said -- I'd been preparing myself mentally for the end for quite some time.

At first I tried to date organically. I'd put on decent clothes and go sit by myself in a pub, or take walks around the park hoping to return someone's smile. But nothing materialized, in no small part I'm sure because it was during the times of Covid, and also probably because I had old fashioned ideas of how people met their dates.

Then one night after most of the world was in bed, I was alone in my apartment, bored and lonely, scrolling on Facebook, when I saw an ad for online dating. I don't know what motivated me to click on that ad that night -- because I think 99 times out of 100 I wouldn't have clicked on it -- but I did. Initially  I was just curious -- after 25 years of being loyal to my ex I wanted to see what the infamous OLD world looked like; that is, I just wanted to peruse. But to peruse, I had to create a profile, and to create a profile I had to pay 60 bucks for a subscription, and once I'd paid for my subscription and created my profile and uploaded a few pictures, suddenly my inbox was receiving pings from fellow human beings. Best of all, they were female and single human beings who were age appropriate (that particular subsite catered to over 40s).

How much fun I had!

Suddenly I was having a gamut of conversations -- via text and via video -- with real people. And not too long after that I was going out on actual dates -- just coffee dates, i.e. nothing fancy. But after a month or two of trying to date organically with no luck, suddenly I was going on 3 or 4 dates a week with some very wonderful people.

I had coffee with a very very nice -- but nervous -- nurse who'd immigrated from Iran and missed her brothers so very much, but also really still had not emotionally recovered from her divorce, which made me feel for her. Then I shared a pastry and coffee with a fun woman who had immigrated from Russia as a young woman and now owned several spas. And I went hiking with a striking middle age woman who was about to sell her business and retire and so looking for potential life partners. And these were just a few of the dates I had.

I was having so much (platonic, except for a little kissing and petting here and there) fun. And meeting such wonderful people. And I thought I'd be dating like this forever, since I enjoy people so much and after 25 years of commitment wasn't sure I trusted myself to commit just yet. But then just a few weeks into this OLD experience I met just the greatest woman. We had a spectacular six hour date of cocktails, dinner and a long walk with lots of lots (and lots) of talking; then a few days later she had me over for a second date where she made me a delicious dinner and served me lots of wine with the understanding that I could sleep in her guest room if I had too much to drink, but that there would be no sex (I was not yet at that moment emotionally ready for anything more than some kissing, so that was okay by me). And by the third date I cancelled all my other dates and my OLD subscription, and just have had the best few months with her ever since where I genuinely believe (and my therapist agrees) that I met my true soul mate.

So I am very appreciative of OLD. How it allowed me to easily meet such wonderful nice people, and then a very special person in particular. And all without making myself a creep in a public place (""Hello, there, what is a nice person like you doing here?"" hahaha) or having to dive into the hook-up culture I thought OLD might be or having to risk alienating women and embarrassing myself too much.

Anyway, there are so many things about the modern world that I love. And OLD dating is one of them. And I'd like to personally thank whoever invented the idea of OLD.

Thank you...",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nvk2fh/so_very_grateful_for_old_aka_an_ode_to_old/

99,nvtwb4,1623239481,Texting something “substantial”,"I see this all the time and tbh it’s one of the most annoying things about dating nowadays, and interested to see feedback from both genders on this.

There seems to be a regular thought in dating (from women) that men do not “text something substantial” conversationally.  Women always say it’s annoying to open with a “hey what’s up” and leads to lack of interest.  

“Why isn’t he texting me something interesting?”

The issue though is This is not how people talk/text.  When I’m texting my friends, it’s often ridiculous memes, a “hey what’s up”, a “hey did you see the bulls game?” Those types of things.  Because we are friends, those “boring openings” and initial texts often lead to a larger convo, or sometimes ends after a few texts.  The difference is that friends “make an effort” to engage in conversation.  In dating , i feel there’s alot of one way on this.  If the man isn’t interesting, constantly, the woman loses interest 

I’m not traveling the world.  I’m not a CIA agent.  I work 60 hours a week in an office and spend an hour a day in the gym.  There just isn’t a whole lot of fascinating shit occurring in life that i can just entertain someone I’m dating constantly…

The manner in which i text my friends or coworkers or others does not lead us to think less of each other.  But in the dating world it does.  It’s honestly kinda annoying and i think it’s causing alot of men to just not want to try anymore.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nvtwb4/texting_something_substantial/
