It was a great date that lasted 7 hours, we kissed a lot, and it was hard saying goodbye. He was in town visiting his parents but he actually lives in a different state. He went back to his city and we’ve just been texting since. This was 2 weeks ago. He asked me if I’d fly out and spend a weekend with him. I told him I’d love to but I will think about it since that’s a lot of $ to spend right now. He said we can pick a weekend that works best for both of us and I can stay at his house. 

I’ve never experienced something like this. Since he invited me should he pay for my ticket? Is this a red flag? Is it too soon to do something like this? I like the idea of it, I just am nervous since we only went on 1 date. Yes it was amazing but I don’t even know what we’d do for a whole weekend together. He said he’d take me all these different places and it’s exciting, I’m just not sure yet and I need advice. 

I want to go but I can’t afford a plane ticket right now but I think that would be weird to tell him. Is that a turn off?

He knows that I am on disability for a connective tissue disorder (ehlers danlos) and therefore live on a low income every month. He explained early on that the type of relationship he agrees with is more traditional early on. Given my situation, a more traditional relationship would suit me as well. He is a teacher, so he doesn’t make a ton of money but mentioned thinking about a career change. At first he payed for dates. I have never gone on a date where a guy has ever asked me to pay for my meal. If a guy did this I would think that he is not in a position to be dating yet. I am old fashioned in that sense and I feel like taking a woman out to dinner and holding doors is the few chivalrous things left that men can do to make a woman feel special. Plus until women are payed equally and men put as much as an effort into grooming themselves for a date, I think it’s only fair. I don’t really want to get into an argument about this here, and people are allowed to have a relationship run on their terms between two consulting adults. 

I felt that this guy misrepresented himself after saying things like “men should be providers” and things of that nature, when he started acting very low effort as weeks progressed. He loved that I was a good cook and I noticed that he would often text me “making anything good for dinner?” And if I was making something he liked, he would invite himself over, “I’ll stop by after work”. He ended up doing this four or five times a week and when he did he would often eat second helpings of my food. I told my friend about it and how this guy recently also told me that he lost 100 lbs. My friend warned me that this guy seemed to be taking advantage and was only interested in me for what I can do for him, and that he probably thought “jackpot” when he found a woman who was good at cooking since he clearly has loved eating. My friend said “he wants a woman who can be his personal cook and can fuck him too”. At this point we had already had sex. I told the guy that it would be nice if he was going to come over so often if he could contribute to my food expenses for dinners since I live on a disability income. He said “oh I didn’t even think of that. Sure”. But I still was annoyed that he didn’t offer in the first place  and acted like he hadn’t even thought that making tons of food cost money . That comes across as someone who is interested in what they can get out of people .So far since we have been dating I have spent more money on food for us than him and I’m on disability. 

For Christmas, even though we have only been dating a little over a month I noticed that I spent more on his gift than he spent on mine. He bought me candy and a coffee mug , about $10. I spent about $30 on him. 

Yesterday he asked if I wanted Chinese food and I said sure . He said ok wanna split it ? I instantly got turned off and I snapped and said “so what happened to mr.provider? you say things like men should be providers etc”. He replied and said jokingly “I identify as gender fluid, plus you won’t be my girlfriend yet”. I instantly thought what does me being his girlfriend have anything to do with it ? I thought he was making an excuse. If anything in my experience men try harder to impress women before they become their girlfriend. The fact that he’s not trying from the start seems like a red flag. I almost wanted to say “well I’m not ready to be your girlfriend, but since you think that you should only pay for dates if I’m your girlfriend then maybe I should be only having sex with you when I’m your girlfriend too”. I refrained from saying this however.

Having dated very wealthy men who wouldn’t even bat an eye about paying for a dinner, this is A huge turn off for me. But it’s not just that. It’s the fact that he was trying to eat all of someone’s food on disability! And the Christmas gift made me feel like I wasn’t important to him. $10 is nothing. Part of his gift was Reese’s pieces and dollar store candy lol.

Anyways after few weeks of being friends , we confessed there is some feelings , i offered we could be in a relationship , he said okay but if we didn't make it please promise me we'll stay friends..
3 months later he suddenly says he doesn't have romantic feelings for me anymore and its better if we just stayed friends , i cried , he cried and we hugged each other he promised me nothing will change and he will still care deeply about me and he still loves me a friend 
The thing is as months goes by if i mention other guys that are interested in me , he seems jealous a little 
He doesn't initiate hugs with his female friends but with me he kinda initiates and hugs me really warmly and tightly ..
sometimes when he drops me off he hugs me a really long hug while his head is resting on my shoulder 
He met new girls during a group trip but is never interested 
Even after the break up we never stopped talking.
3 days ago i asked him if he has feelings for me , he denied , he said im one of his most closest friends , like his closest male friend and that he loves me the way he loves him ( similar to siblings love)..
I asked him if its because of his stressful life or because he havent found a girl with chemistry yet , he replied with the second option 
Yet after all that , his actions are not so friendly 
Like today he was with me helping me study he would always carass me or carass my thighs (not in a sexual way )  in public 
And he doesn't mind if i held his hands interlocked 
So are we friends and he doesnt have feelings like hes saying 
Or hes lying? Or because there are some stress going on ? or he feels he won't be responsible enough to take a serious step so hes friendzoning me so i would give up? 
Ps: he asked me if i have feelings again , i obviously denied and replied with no ofc we're friends lol cause im scared he'll leave

27F, I’ve been on and off the dating apps for years. I’ve complained to my mother enough and she has always reassured me that I just haven’t  found the right one, been hearing this since I was 21. I feel like I could have been in a relationship or at least “dated” if I went for the guys that have pursued me. However, I got tired of the ones I didn’t like back approaching me and have decided to use bumble. I’ve met up with two guys and didn’t feel them either. It’s only been twice BUT like I said I tried the other apps for years. My life has always been the ones I want don’t want me back/aren’t serious and the ones that like me I don’t want back. My mom says that she really loved my dad and she’s been with her current bf for years but I just don’t get the appeal of either of them (seeing them as if I don’t know them or aren’t related to them). She says she didn’t settle but I just don’t get how you aren’t settling if you aren’t physically attracted to the person. I do feel I will genuinely end up alone, rather be alone vs being taken and miserable. Not that this matters but I don’t really have an active sex drive, I don’t enjoy masturbating and haven’t had sex in years. I saw someone very briefly 3 years ago and while he had a decent personality, I wasn’t physically attracted to him. That was my closest to a relationship, you’re seriously telling me I haven’t been able to find anyone since? It’s like the universe is telling me I can’t do any better, I have never even introduced anyone to my family going on 30.

Just here to ask the question from the title and mini vent here.

I’m (21F) and have never been in a relationship before. I’ve gone on a few 1st &amp; 2nd dates with a few guys but haven’t gone past that point. I feel like I’m not awkward with guys either as I have a lot of male friends who I hang out with frequently and play games with.

I’m honestly pretty content with myself and what I do. I enjoy the time I spend by myself and with my friends and family. So don’t really see a point in dating a guy if I don’t enjoy the time I spend with him more than myself ya know?

That being said it does get pretty lonely sometimes. Mainly only like the end/beginning of the year during Christmas, new years, and the lunar new years. Happy to see all my friends with their BF’s on their socials but sorta jealous myself that I don’t have any special person to share this time of the year with.

Maybe I’m just picky, but like I just want a guy who is also my best friend, like how my mom is with my dad. My only reqs is that he has a decent job/career, same height or taller than me (I’m 5’5), and asian american as I prefer someone with a similar background to me.

If you haven’t read my previous posts, please do so, as they provide context. That being said, let’s begin. I’ve decided, after much consideration and advice from the people in this community, to break up with him. I realized that I was in a very bad situation with him. I want to return his things to him, but subtly. I’m not sure how to do this, either. I also plan on saving money to pay him back for everything he has done for me. That being said, I can’t really leave him just yet. I have to put up with him for a little while longer. I’m not sure how I can avoid seeing him physically, though. He’s always on about seeing me, and whenever we do see each other, his only interest is showering me with compliments and trying to touch me everywhere. In public. This is a side note, but I realized kissing him always made me feel uncomfortable. I’m not sure why.

We talked about it admitted we both had feelings but wanted to take it slow. His ex wants to suddenly get back together and randomly messages him, and he considers it. He meets with her and decided that they go separate ways. We take time apart to figure out what we each want, since he was being inconsistent with me on what he wanted us to be. A week later, we talk it out and he tells me he’s not ready to date and needs to work on on some struggles, i suggest that we continue being friends. We decided to not let this get in the way of our friendship. 

Suddenly, seems like I’m getting ghosted, or at least ignored for hours. Why’s that? We had a good friendship and it seemed like we were on the same page to go back to normal but he’s acting distanced….

So a few days ago I signed up for Bumble and Tinder and have definitely learned a lot about the 2 since then.
I’ve had a little bit of luck on both at first, I got some likes and a couple matches on both sites/apps but after about 2 or 3 days, absolutely nothing happened and I ended up wasting some time.
So then I did some research and learned about the elo systems and the algorithms, and based on what I’ve heard about Tinder, you get ranked by how much people swipe right on you and not only that but also how active you are on the app.
And I’ve heard that Atleast most dating apps/sites are like that.
So then I got some advice from this guy on YouTube who said that I should delete my account and recreate it once a month with different pics each time and that’s exactly what I’m going to do.
So then I decided to delete both my Tinder and Bumble accounts yesterday and will recreate them tomorrow with different pics.
So here is my question, is all of this information correct and should I do exactly what I have planned???
Heck, have any of you tried this out and has it worked for you???
Also something else I’ve heard too from a different person is that I’m going to have to use a different phone number or something if I decide to recreate my account, but that might just be for Tinder though.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1150119,public,self,I have a question about Tinder and Bumble,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ryt3u5/i_have_a_question_about_tinder_and_bumble/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

Well the night that they were giving me crap, we were all staying at a hotel (snowed it at work, hotel across the street) and had a little gathering in someone’s room. She came in these cute pajamas and mentioned going to the hotel bar to drop in with some other coworkers. Someone on my team said I should go down to the bar and the crush said I could come if I want. 

Well I ended up not going down to the bar and the next morning someone pointed out to me that I blew a golden opportunity with her given that she was going to a bar in her pajamas just to drop in. I assume they mean I could of gotten laid had i gone down their with her. 

I’m not looking for sex, but I am kicking myself because it was an opportunity to talk to her outside of work and my mind makes me wonder while I wasn’t looking to sleep with her that night, we could of gone back to one of our rooms and spent time together chatting.

Bear with me because this will sound kind of shallow, I'm just talking generalities here and I'm not looking for practical advice just curious on how single people operate in their relationships nowadays.

So it's pretty common sense that women have a much easier time finding partners when they want it. Granted most are not going to be quality men, they do have more options on average.

Well as I've made more female friends I've really gotten a sense for just how bombarded they are by guys when they're single. Nearly all my single female friends have at least like 3+ dudes hitting them up at all times.

I'm just wondering how guys deal with this nowadays. I've got a girl who I'm FWB with, and even though we're not in a committed relationship I sometimes feel like I'm competing because she's constantly getting hit on by multiple dudes. It's not a huge concern but it's a weird dynamic.

We went on a 3 dates (activities like bowling) over the summer, we had one make out, and then she said she wanted to be friends. I handled it politely said no thanks on friendship and then stopped talking to her completely. A couple months went by and then we started talking again and we went out to lunch and went for a walk in the city and it felt like we were vibing better this time. I think she respected that I had been decisive in saying no to friendship and it just seemed like she appreciated her time with me more. Then, a month later (she works 6 days a week and I do as well so we always struggle to make plans), we went out to dinner, followed by a wine bar, and then a desert place. It ended up with a make-out at her front door. It was fun though and we spent like 8 hours together. However, in the past, when I drop off a girl after a date and she is interested, she usually invites me inside her apartment, but she did not. The next day she was texting me how much fun she had and it seemed like an increased level of interest. Next, the holidays came and I haven't seen her for like 5 weeks as we have both been with our families and she was working 7 days in the final weeks before the holidays. We text and stuff in between here and there but we don't really talk on the phone (I generally believe the phone should only be used to set-up dates in the early stages). Does not seeing each other for so long periods impact the spark? Am I handling this correctly?

The confusing thing is that we have now known each other for like 8 months and yet it all seems to be going very slow (not just physically but also frequency of seeing each other). We made plans for this weekend to go to a theme park but now I am wondering, is that the right type of date to go on? Or maybe should I have invited her over for dinner and wine or something more intimate at my place? Since we restarted talking, this is only the 3rd date and she seems to go slow so I'm not sure. We also went on several activity type dates in the first go-around. I could invite her over to my place after the theme park but we will get home late and, knowing her, I think she will likely be ready to go to sleep.

She then replied that yeah this should be possible, so I suggested another date. Then she suddenly replied with a huge text saying that all these suggestions sound all nice and that I am a really nice and sweet guy, but she’s not ready for a new relationship, because of university and that one guy she had a situationship with. She said she needs more time for herself, because feelings for this guy started to come back. 
I told that I totally accept her decision and I hope she will give me a chance once she feels ready for something new. 
She than replied that she'll me text me once she’s over this guy. I just replied with: ""Ok 👍🏻""

However I’m getting very worried that as I go longer without getting girls to like me it’s making me less attractive. I’m also worried that if somehow I wake up one day and there is a girl that likes me, she’ll be bothered by my lack of experience. Like I don’t know how go do something as small as kiss, which is something most people understand by the time their 14. Like no lie I don’t get it. It looks like people just rubbing lips. 

I know that the vast majority of women around me have had sex with at least one person so it’s like I’m as experienced as a 12 year old and they’re actual adults with normal experiences and I know it’ll be unattractive.

Ever since I’ve [18M] started to get interested in girls, it always seemed apparent that I was interested in older girls. Started in middle school with girls who were about 2 years older than me, then the same thing went on through high school. Girls my age just didn’t seem interesting to me, mentally or sexually. And if I’m being really honest, this is still the case for 18-19 years old girls as of right now. I actually had one or two (very) short relationships with girls the same as me back when I was in high school and they were genuinely awkward, loveless, failed relationships that left unsettled. And I find in older (early to mid-twenties) women something I just can’t find in girls my own age. Another vision of life, a general knowledge… that is just more attractive and emotionally appealing.

With all that said, however: I am perfectly aware that most women, especially the ones in the age range I’m into, aren’t into younger guys at all. And for valid reasons. They want men that know what they want in life, that have more life experience, maybe they also want someone who’s financially stable, and that’s totally understandable! Also, what if I get manipulated by an older girlfriend? This would seem unlikely, as I wouldn’t consider myself as a particularly vulnerable person at all. But hey, who knows? There are some sick people out here. But I just cannot help it.

That’s why, I decided some time ago, to totally gave up on being in a relationship until I’m old enough to engage in a relationship where age don’t fucking matter anymore, and only focus on being friends on benefits with a few girls my age I meet on dating apps (which is already what is happening rn). Once again, I don’t know what their feelings exactly are, but I’ve quickly realized these are not girls I would like to be in a relationship with. There’s something deeply missing in them to make them fully appealing to me. While I wouldn’t consider a relationship, I still can be friends and find a sexual interest in them.

You’re maybe wondering : “Well, he’s too young to be in a relationship anyway!”. And yeah, maybe you’re right. I think I’m writing this post just because I feel really lonely though, and need to vent and identify my problems. Ever since I was 12, I always felt really lonely in life for some reason, actually. And now, almost all of the few friends I had, all the friends I could laugh with and who made me feel less isolated, have left the city two years go to pursue college in other cities, and I’m just here, wondering if I’m ever gonna be loved, felt appreciated again like this.

I (m33) started dating someone (f26) I met at a concert back in the summer. I had just moved back to London for a great new job and had a  rare night off work and a friend with a spare ticket to a favourite  Artists’ huge outdoor show. We met in the crowd and totally hit it off,  eventually started kissing, went back to mine and then went out again the next day and spent the whole day together, it was like weed known each other our entire lives, I didn’t ever want to not be around her. We then started seeing each other a few times a week and messaging every day and it looked like it was going good.

But there were a few things that happened that turned us off from each other.  First of all, neither of us were looking for a relationship and kept telling each other as such, even though we were clearly in one or heading that way. Secondly, we both got drunk a few times and kissed other people - but immediately told each other after. (She actually got so  drunk she kissed a random guy(m40+) in front of me once, but can’t remember and I once actually got so drunk with a friend(f31) who I knew  liked me I ended up going down on them) we’re both as bad as each other.  Or maybe I’m worse for that last one. But we kept telling each other what happened and kept forgiving each other, but resentment and paranoia were growing for both of us and I think we stopped respecting one another.

But we were still super close and got on so unbelievably well and spoke more and more often. We started telling each other we loved each other and agreed to refer to each other as girlfriend and boyfriend.

But after a few weeks and a few more dumb occurrences on her part (her getting drunk and being overly flirty with my friends to the point that made them uncomfortable - which I was paranoid about because of the time she kissed someone in front of me) we got to a point where I decided it was going nowhere, I had felt wronged a few too many times but didn’t have a leg to stand on morally, so I suggested breaking it off, which we both agreed might be for the best.

However,  since then she has been very keen on talking to me and arranging to meet up and to sleep together etc. I have reciprocated because I still love her and enjoy her company so much. We are so in sync, sometimes it’s spooky. And the mental health support we give exchange in our times of need was an invaluable part of our lives.

But  I know in the back of my mind I don’t want a relationship with her, after all, we’ve been through, and that I want to and need to start winding things down and cooling things off. But I just don’t know if that’s smart being as how well we match each other.

So here we are, in a zombie relationship. A relationship still working,  breathing and walking, but no autonomous plans or aspirations. Acting like we’re a couple to each other, but I no longer want to bring her into my life or my work or my friendship circles (I don’t even tell my housemates when I go to see her) and I think we both know there’s no future. But we carry on being each other’s support and best friends,  confidants and lovers. A zombie relationship, all of the important bits,  but none of the excitement and drive that fuels a normal relationship.

What do I do? Do all relationships eventually end up this close, yet lacklustre? Are we actually a bad match? Is it a Sid and Nancy thing? (We’re both off the drinking heavily now and are both taking  medication for our very obvious mental health problems furling sporadic  behaviours!) Have I taken the zombie metaphor too far? I’m so confused.

Any advice would be great. Or even a different perspective on the way I’ve told this story would be great.

Much love

I was  consistently getting 5-10 matches per week and just had to stop  initiating matches because it was becoming too time-consuming to try to  have any sort of conversation with any of them.

I got cancer a few years back and it gave me perspective.  Its funny how when your life is possibly at its end, the things you really appreciate aren't what you expected. I didn't care about the girls I had been with or the job that pays me extremely well. I enjoyed the days where I laughed and had fun with friends and family. That was what mattered.

So I recovered obviously. I knew it was time for a change. Its crazy how easy it was to become my old self. Like it was always there just below the surface. I reconnected with old friends and family.

This time we were talking about traveling and so on, and I said something along the lines, if you go there, I can come too, to which he said, maybe we could have a romantic relationship (his English isn't the best). I wasn't really sure what to answer so I just said maybe and laughed. He then asked if I am already dating someone, to which I said no.

But he tells me he’s realised that he’s not ready for dating properly yet after his last relationship and was sorry for wasting me time.  (it ended fairly recently) but really wished he was ready cos he “loves talking to me and finds me very attractive”. 

I’m like ok yeh fair enough I appreciate the honesty and told him if he does feel ready to let me know and message me again. Which he said “of course he will”

I've been flirting with this girl for quite some time now. This evening we were texting each other and our texts were starting to get flirtatious and a little bit sexual (this is not the first time this has happened). She all of the sudden says ""you are so innocent lmao"", and goes on to say that she can tell that I am just a lot more innocent than her. My reaction to this was to reply with ""well I can't wait to prove you wrong, but if that's what you think of me i'd love for you to come help me lose my innocence by..."" (You get the gist). I figured it was best to reply in a way that showed I wasn't offended by what she said (even though I was a little bit). 

Do you guys think there's a chance that she was just testing my reaction, given that we have been flirting with each other?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1150217,public,self,She called me innocent,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rz1ic8/she_called_me_innocent/,no_ads,0.0,,,,
