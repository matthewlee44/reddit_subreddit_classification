I started a new job at a grocery store about three to four weeks ago and I met a guy there who I kind of have a crush on. Unfortunately we haven't had many chances to talk for very long at work, but last week, I was paired with him for a day of training. We talked throughout the day and got to know each other a little. We mostly discussed things like where we're from, what we like to eat, hobbies, etc. It was pleasant but casual mostly. I learned that he is going to be 40 soon, and I'm only 26 (female), but that doesn't bother me. We didn't talk at all about exchanging information or anything, but about 15 minutes after I left work that night, I received a follow request from him on Instagram. 

Normally I would not assume that that means anything, but I had to wonder here how he even found my account. I never told him my last name or my username, and I haven't been on Facebook in about two years. There is only one place he could have found my last name - it's on a clipboard at work which they use to delegate the tasks for our shifts. Every employee is on it for the day and where they will be each hour, so everyone looks at it constantly to see where they're going. My last name isn't like Smith or Jones or anything. It's 10 letters long and Italian, and people who have known me for years still can't spell it or sometimes say it lol. 

I don't follow anyone else from the store at all (I'm new) so he couldn't have found me through someone mutual. He must have made a mental note of how to spell my last name and searched me when the shift was over... there's no other way?

And when I added him, he liked my pictures. I was happy... but he never messaged me. He posted a story about an album he was listening to, though, so I put it on and listened to it. I messaged him that I listened to it and liked it and he asked me to send him something I like. So I did, and he sent me another song too. After a few messages he told me he was going into work, and I told him to have a good day. Now it's been a few days since that, and he hasn't messaged me again.

I'm pretty into this guy in a lot of ways but I can't tell if he is into me at all. I've seen him at work since our conversation stopped on Instagram and it seems like he likes talking to me at work. I feel like my face lights up when he says hi to me and I can't help it. I am a bit nervous to talk to him at work just because I'm new and learning the job still and don't want to just stand around chatting as a new employee... just think it's a bad look professionally. There are lots of other people around too which just makes me self-conscious about being too friendly with him there or showing any flirtiness. But I look for chances to talk to him.. I really would like to get to know him more. I don't show it at work, I mostly say hi and keep working.

So I've been wondering if I'm reading too much into this or if it does seem like he's into me... I've been wondering if he feels like he is too old for me or something.. or maybe I'm just totally wrong and he's not interested in me. That's what brings me here.. I know there's not a lot to go on, but I thought some outside opinions might help me understand him better.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158565,public,self,Trying to understand if a guy is into me or not,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sqv865/trying_to_understand_if_a_guy_is_into_me_or_not/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

I am a 30-year-old Chinese female, born and raised in China, and still living there. I would like to talk about my dating dilemma.

In China, women like me are called leftover, and although I don't think I'm unwelcome in the dating market because there are so many more men than women in China now, I still have a lot of difficulties.

Typically, Chinese women consider sacrificing their careers for their families once they enter marriage, although the Chinese government does not encourage any women to quit their jobs. But this sexist tradition is hard to break. Many of the very talented women around me are in lower-paying but stable jobs because it allows them to balance family and work, and job advancement is no longer on their minds. This type of work is very popular, so the competition is very fierce. I'm not that great myself, although I earn more, my job is not stable and I work longer hours, so finding a boyfriend is difficult for me. And once I get married, there's a future I'll lose my job because I'm pregnant, which I don't want to see.

From my experience, cute and pure love only exists in student days. I'm already regretting now that I didn't get a boyfriend in college. When I entered society, it was more about matching each other's conditions to build a family relationship, which I hated. I've been through multiple blind dates where the other person would date me because of my job and looks, but it was hard to make an emotional connection. I failed numerous times on dates and my parents were disappointed in me. I had a crush on a guy in middle school and wrote him many love letters that I didn't send out, but now I find it hard to feel the same way anymore.

I am planning on applying to universities in Europe and staying here to work because I have heard there is a better WLB lifestyle here. My main goal is to start a family like my parents, with a child and my own career. But what I found out from reddit is that I simply cannot accept the western way of dating and I feel I have to fully trust and love the man before I can have sex with him. But it seems like you all think sexual compatibility is so important that you get laid in the beginning. I don't think I can do this at all.

I know I'm talking about some crap, and I don't know if you guys can really understand my problem, but seriously, I have a feeling I'm going to die alone, as an unloved woman.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158565,public,self,I'm seriously preparing for being alone forever,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sqvbb9/im_seriously_preparing_for_being_alone_forever/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

He apologized for leaving suddenly and that he didn't mean it to happen. We have planned to take a trip and right before then he ended things, saying that it didn't click and that he is not doing well mentally. He then proceeded to tell me that he actually wanted to ask me in the trip to be official. I was really hurt, but hoped that we would somehow find a way back to each other, but recently I just keep thinking about the ways he humiliated me and hurt me during the relationship itself. Like when he would tease me in bed, but actually never pull through, which left me feeling ashamed and disgusting. Like I was some sex-crazed maniac that only wants sex. I felt so dirty and honestly shameful most of the time. I would tell him how I was feeling, and he would say things like I'm not really into sex all the time, which I respect, but nevertheless it made me feel shit. Most of all when I found out his dating history, he constantly said he never had luck in women, but then I found out he had a phase of sleeping around or fucking around with women. So, why was it so hard to be intimate with me? Was something wrong with me? We did all sorts of stuff, but we just never finished.

Another instant is that he would always send me K-pop stars saying how hot they are or show me work out videos, saying that I should try those. Maybe he really just wanted to show things he liked? But during that time, it translated to me that: hey this is my type and obviously that is not you. I know it is childish and probably should have talked about how it made me feel, but I was scared to lose him as he would say a lot of the times that he couldn't joke around me, since I get upset over little things and that he feels like he had to walk on eggshells around me. Also, he teased my appearance a lot under the guise of jokes and banter or that I needed humbling, to which I tried to do the same towards him, but at the end I always felt like the conversations always end up superficial. When I said that his remarks are quite hurtful and are destroying my confidence, he would say: Maybe you're just not as confident as you think you are. It was so confusing, because he was so sweet at the beginning and would want to work through and talk over things that bothered me, but towards the end I guess he did show who he truly was. He would say: Tell me every little thing that upset you, so we can find a compromise and work on it. Maybe it was his depression or whatever internal problems he had, but it was still not a justification to act like a jackass. Towards the end, when I laid him things that bothered me, he'd just say: If you can't like me the way I am, maybe I am not for you.

I was just hit by the wave of : I know I deserved better and deep down I feel like I excused a lot of actions, because he has never had a girlfriend or something along those lines. I know I shouldn't be so hung up over a guy that is literally a walking red flag. I think about the good times, but a lot of the times the negative parts outweighed the whole experience. I was really trying my best to get over him, I was around friends, met knew people, started a new hobby, but everything was thrown out the window once he contacted me after 2 months of no contact saying that he wanted me to know that he was starting therapy and medications soon. I never answered, because I didn't know how to react and felt very indifferent. As ashamed as I am, my dumbass saw a glimpsed of hope that he would come back in the future. I actually hate that I am still so attached that I reread his last message just to find out that he blocked me or deleted my number.

I don’t want to sound arrogant but I believe I’m attractive to others (but I don’t feel it because I have face dysmorphia). I have older ladies tell me I’m beautiful, kids call me pretty, get hit on, get stared at, etc.

I always make prolonged eye contact with the guy in question when he enters the class and moves to his seat. Sometimes I catch him glancing but he’ll quickly look away and other times I think he’s looking based off my peripheral vision. 

I can’t tell if he likes me but case in point if I’m into shy, lay low type guys and the type that hit on me are very extroverted, frat boy types then do I need to initiate from now on?

I have never kissed anyone, romantically talked to anyone etc etc

All this while I thought the problem was me

But I went to a foreign county for an exchange program and in the span of 3 weeks, 3 guys have asked me out
(And the people in this foreign country are SO much more attractive than in my home country)

And I come back to my country and ofc nothing has changed. No one gives a shit about me. All my friends are in relationships. I feel very lonely. I tell my self that it’s fine I’ll find someone eventually but I’m almost embarrassed about the fact that I’m going to turn 22 soon and have had 0 love life. I have met guys at clubs just hitting on me so they can get laid but I’m talking about how no one seems to be wanting to go out with me/ getting to know me

What is the problem?

Few things about me:

I don’t know how to say this without sounding full of myself but I’ll just say it. I think I’m pretty attractive. I get complimented on my body and hair all the time. I’m really into sports and arts. I’m a Med student. I’m into all kinds of adventurous things. Im pretty chill I can even appear as low energy sometimes. But I love parties and I’m always down for new things (Anyone wants to hmu? Jk jk)

I’m not saying someone will like me for these things but they sure should get people interested in me.

But I’m just not very good socially I can get a little awkward. Initially I can look like a cold person so it’s not very easy to strike up a conversation with me. But just these things can’t be the only reason why 0 boys have shown interest my whole life

I have gone to an only girls school before I came to college but I’ve played sports most of my school life with boys.

The result is that I've stuck with long distance ever since I graduated high school. More recently, I more strongly want to start an offline relationship, but I have no idea where to begin because I'm afraid of going to prison. Women historically have been sort of friendly with me but I have never once been accepted for a date, they recoil immediately when the topic comes up. It seems there's something disgusting about me that I can't change. Some people have told me I'd look much better with a different haircut - I have no fashion sense, so I went to a hair salon, asked for something more attractive, and they just cut short what I already have.

I'm a realtor and I know others who get business by handing out cards to random people in the grocery store. I could tie that in, but since I'm not charismatic I'd probably get banned from places for that too.

She even told me him and her dated like a year ago for a little….yet the time period she claimed that happened, me and her still hungout and spoke (as fwb). When I pressed about that, she didn’t have an answer. I didn’t know at the time she was dating him. So it really concerned me she can do those things while dating someone, made me hesitant about wanting more with her

Anyways, a little over a week ago we spoke and I said it’s becoming obvious that what I want with me and her isn’t gonna happen and that we should stop talking for a little. I couldn’t sleep that night knowing we weren’t gonna talk. I reached out the following day and said I’m fine still talking to her and reverting back to a fwb but I cannot continue to wait on her to come around. We can’t pretend to be in a relationship but not actually be in one. We were never officially exclusive but I didn’t talk to anyone else over the last few months and I told her that’s not fair to me

So all was good after that talk. She slept over Thursday night and stayed Friday morning. She just texted me (I’ll link the texts below) that she was upset I’m on dating apps, she must’ve saw my phone when she was here. We got into a little argument bc I essentially said that she should talk to someone else about that and not to me bc it seemed manipulative 

So what do I do? I know deep down for my own sanity that we should stop talking. I know it’s best for me. I know it’s hurting more than helping me trying to continue this thing. I don’t think she’s a bad person I just think she doesn’t know what she wants and that she wants her cake and to eat it too. She likes having her options and the security of that. I see a therapist so obviously I talk to my therapist about this. And I know personally that I struggle to a degree with co dependency. Part of me so badly wants to not stop talking to her, it’s gonna hurt so much. So those who have experience, how do you do it?

I'm a 24M and the girl I'm referring to is 21 or 22, not exactly sure. I had a relationship for 7 years, but ive been single for a little while. Because of the length of my relationship I sometimes feel like I'm a 13 year old in terms of being able to flirt or pick up signals from girls. I recently met this girl and we've only seen each other through school 4 or 5 times but she's extremely friendly and also very cool. I'm wondering if these are signs she could be into me or if she's just very friendly. I want to ask her out and probably will, but I still feel unsure and it definitely will be awkward if she says no. We're in class groups and will be around each other regularly.

- looks at me all the time, occasionally looks away but sometimes holds eye contact until a smile or something
- comes over to me from across room of friends to talk
- moves from across the room to sit next to me during a class
- laughs at stuff I say even when it's not that funny
- called and texted me about class stuff before I met her in person (class started online and she had my number through group stuff)
- tells me her opinions of other people ""between us"" before we were on a pretty friendly basis
- texts me first but then responds very slowly (sometimes a day before response but sometimes responds after 10 mins)
- ""loves"" messages or always hahahahaaha LMFAO type stuff when I'm not really that funny
- she mentioned another guy who's in her friend group came over, then she doubled back to say ""came over with some other friends"" and the story was relatively embarrassing about him hahaha
- asks me what I'm up to after class, i said nothing, then she says she's getting food but doesn't really invite me along. Awkward silence and then I asked to tag along
walks with me after class and seems to follow me out, like if we're not talking on the way out she ends up catching up with me and talking
- initiated hug goodbye after last time we were walking home

My girlfriend and I just broke up as the title states.  She and I have been talking everyday via phone call and text.  She has been coming over every weekend to stay with me and my kids for several months.
I had been trying to remain friends with my last girlfriend because she had a 7yo daughter that adored me as much as I her.  Well, that ex girlfriend posted on her face book story how I had abandoned her and the daughter and broke the daughter's heart.  In turn, that nome my heart and pissed me off.  I went to the girlfriend i just had telling her that I was hurting and mad.  Her first reaction was WTF,  followed by, ""Do you want to get back with her?""  Naturally I don't.  Seriously?  What guy has enough energy to deal with that noise.   I told her I didn't and then she accused me of cyberstalking the ex and looking to two time her.  I denied it and to her wait a.minute.  That just threw napalm on the match head.
I couldn't get a word I'm after that and it just descended into the pits of hell. Ending with me being apathetic to her feelings, to me shifting blame to look like the injured part, and me being manipulating.  Oh!, and being unfaithful.  Then she said she was too stressed and stretched too thin to have the energy to work on a relationship.   Which I totally agree with that last part BTW.  She has kids with her ex husband and he is fighting her on everything.

Anyways she broke up with me with a few not so kind parting words and I said fine.  I'm out too.

I think it's  stupid fight,  out very first, to have and to break up over. 
I'm struggling because i.was an idiot and went all in because everything was.a great match-up up to that point. Even my kids liked her amd they are a tough crowd.

So.am I wrong about this being dumb?  Am I wrong to be hurting so much?  Any suggestions on how to.get past it?  I hadn't allowed myself to feel this intensely about a girl in a very long time,  like years!

I need some advice about this guy(27m) i(28F)was seeing.

My previous relationship ended really badly, I ended up contacting the police for stalking. 

So after a while I started dating. I met this guy and he wanted to go on a date immediately. I told him that I was not completely ready yet, and wanted to talk first. So he was fine with that. We talked for 3 ish weeks and then went on multiple dates! It was so much fun, he seemed like the perfect guy for me. His personality is so sweet and kind but after talking for 6/7 weeks he gave me a card saying how much he loved me. He asked me what i thought about the card and I could not say I e you back. I did say ‘I love you for this’. Meaning that I really liked the sentiment and I told him how much I appreciated him. But we did not communicate about it anymore.

So after the card he never said it again, which was fine. But after a month or so of dating I was a confused with our status.

I know I shouldve communicated better but stuff happened in my life(peoples death etc) which made me close off completely. I also just could not believe he really loved me that soon. Then I saw him liking a bunch of sexy photos of a girl, and I freaked. I apologised for the way I communicated about this.. and he was still very kind.

Two weeks after that happened, he told him that he was not in love with me anymore. And then I found out that he thought we were in a relationship. Even though we did not talk about this at all.

Now im left completely confused, I regret not communicating better with him. I did really like him but I felt so suffocated. I wanted to really get to know him but it almost felt as if there was no room for me. When he ‘broke up’ with me I felt a relieve because it felt as if he had put me on a pedestal instead of really getting to know me.

Tomorrow im going to talk to him again to explain myself. But my question is: can someone fall in and out of love that quickly?!

So yea me and my long distance partner have been talking for almost 7 months like I said, at first we used to talk casually.. flirting every now and then, but it's been over 2 months since we explicitly expressed our feelings. We haven't met yet, but planning to meet next year, I'm supposed to travel to continue my college at his country and that's when we agreed to see each other. When I asked him if he considers us to be in a relationship he said that it was a little complicated, and that he would call me his gf if ""I wanted him to call me that"" and when he felt that I wasn't content with his answer he said ""But just so you know,  I'm not looking for anyone else right now.  I'm just excited to get to know more about you and finally meet you. If we see that things between us aren't working or wouldn't work,  then I'll start looking for someone else"".

On a side note, he also seems very safe and doesn't wanna risk anything when it comes to me, I once told him that I might fly over to see him but if I did I'd have to go to another town where my relatives live instead of his, bcuz I don't have the money to rent a place during my stay..he said that he wouldn't be able to ride all the way there (it's a 6hr car ride) when I literally just told him that I'd fly for more than 16 hrs to see him.

I want to get to know her more. Nothing serious I just think she’s very pretty and would love to get to know her. I thought about leaving this situation alone but I really want to take a jab at it because I’m tired of regretting all

so, I'm 21 and so is she, although i am also her manager and we work in quite a close knit team in hospitality so if things were to actually get awkward from her side then it would have an actual affect on the workplace but i honestly don't suspect that would happen.

over the last couple weeks we have been able to talk a lot more than we usually can whilst on shift, and we have amazing chemistry with each other, she has been quite flirty with me, teasing me about silly things and the same vice versa - she more so than me has been quite complimentary of me too and we both have very similar mindsets about life and similar goals in the coming future. 

She very obviously decides to do dishes a lot more than usual when I'm working in the kitchen (so we can chat, its basically just guaranteed to be the two of us talking most of the time), will always ask me if i want a coffee or even sometimes just bring me one.

So all these things are quite obvious indicators for me, i get really giddy around her and it's actually very nice/exciting (for now lol), i also decided to break off something i had going with another girl because i realised how much more i actually liked the co-worker!

I brought it up to another coworker what was going on and she basically laughed in my face and said ' you both couldn't make it more obvious '

We walked by a bridge (her idea, I didn't know about it"" I told her to look me in the eyes, and I kissed her. (I'm day 2 on nofap, maybe that helped me have the courage) We held hands, walked around some more, kissed some more too. 

She kept wanting to go somewhere new, but man, I usually have first dates that are like two hours at most, it's hour 3, I'm getting tired. 

I wait my Uber ride home, and we kiss passionately.

I met her online, she was a year junior than me. First when I said ""hi"" To her, I was just bored in a very shitty job I don't know how or why I sent her that message. We started chatting and we would chat all day, every day. From the start she said she was the one who always falls for the guy, and I was the guy who was a little detached, busy in their lives kind of a guy. But as we talked I started care for her, man.!!! 

 I don't even how or why, she listens,  she helps me out in my situation. We started talking over call , for 6 hours daily!!! I am that kind of a guy who wouldn't even talk for an hour on the phone daily. 

It's been a month, she said I am running away, a few days back. Then I fessed up, I said that I like her alot, and she said does too but she is scared or whatever, it's my fault I can't loose her as a friend but I have never felt like this, and I am 24, never in my life. 

Today her net wasn't working, she was saying that as a reason why she didn't call. It's been a week since we are talking over calls, every day for 6 hours. I am scared bcoz if she thinks I am in love then she may feel she should stay away, I am trying to maintain and be a friend only but I can't help it. She knows me too well. 

She always picks up on it, I want to know about her day. What she made for dinner, how was studying going. But today she was asking about goals and stuff. I don't know, maybe I should calm down and you know give her space. 

I have never felt like this, it like my heart has a needle inside when she says me as her ""friend"", I don't even know. Maybe she won't reply tomorrow. She hasn't said anything like that, she just said she was sleepy. Why wouldn't she be we have spent all night talking for 5 days straight. I just thought she had to lie about the internet for me to back off. I was so stupid, I should have let her sleep. But NOOOO!!!! I wanted that instant hit. 

I don't know what to do, maybe I should just stop talking this much. Maybe I should just back up. I have genuinely no idea. I just want it to die off, like slow death. I have seen it before. I can't with her, it's too painful. She just said I like her more than she does me, what the hell does that mean. You idiot, it is my fault, I should have stayed friends first for a time being then said something, not like this. Maybe I am the one expecting too much out of a month old thing, we haven't even met physically. I am not stupid, to chase a person who has no interest in me, why would i. It's like cutting myself., it would hurt too much. 

I don't know what to do, seriously. I can't lose her, even as a friend. But no friend is like that that will talk to you all day and all night. What am I doing, I have no idea. When she said I may like you as a ""friend"", I felt like crying. Truly, I am a guy. Not the manliest of the man but you know I do not get attached that much.

In the past year I have had some very bad experiences with online dating. I met a guy at a resteraunt and thought we hit it off. He asked if I wanted to chat more in his car after the date while my car warmed up. I said yes, and while I was in his car he kissed me which I was ok with. But then he shoved his hand down my pants and I said stop, and he continued. I finally was able to get away and even called the police. 

Another date I went on the second date with him and the guy kissed me on a park bench outside of a shopping mall. I was ok with it until he was shoving his tongue down my throat and trying to shove his hand down my pants. He stopped when I told him to , however I was still disgusted that a guy “looking for a serious relationship” was doing this on a second date and in front of a shopping mall where there were families. 

Because I know many men are just quick to want to have sex, I don’t want to be in a situation where it could be very dangerous for me by going to their house .I have met enough men that try to behave for many dates and then become sexually aggressive when I decide to go to their house, ignoring my requests for them to stop their advances. 

I would like to know what do you think the appropriate amount of time to “vet” men for being respectful of my boundaries sexually are , and to make sure they will not do any of these things ?

I have basically no dating or sexual experience and haven’t kissed anyone in years. Have never been on a first date. 

My last relationship was great, but we wanted such different things and were going in such different directions that it always kind of tasted of doom. We’re great friends now but it made me think a lot about putting myself in the right place  and being myself etc. Also spent years caring for a family member. It’s something I’m really proud of but it’s taken time. I was also often traveling or with family so dating just… didn’t happen then 2020 happened which didn’t help. 

Trying to date again has been tough. I want to know someone and have feelings before sex. I go to a university in a major city where the work load is pretty insane and people do tons of extra activities. 

A few issues I’ve run into: 

I speak 6 languages and will be at 9 soon. People on apps seem to find this weird/a turnoff. 
Got almost no likes from other people from similar unis on Hinge and tbh it got in my head worrying that I need to work harder because I don’t look/measure up. How do I date/be dateable while I improve my skills, achievements, etc?

I found this guy I've always liked on Tinder 4 months ago. Since then we've been talking everyday and hanging out a few times. 2 months ago I told him I like him and he replied ""that's really sweet thank you"". I was ready to accept the rejection and move on with my life, but he still continued texting me and wanted to hang out. He's opened up to me about previous relationships and when he hasn't felt the same way he's usually ended up cutting off communication. Yesterday, he hosted a very intimate birthday party and surprisingly I was invited. I'm not really sure why tbh- we're friends but I never thought we were that close and I've made it pretty clear that I want to be more than friends. Also I feel like by inviting me he was leading me on a bit. Today I spoke to my brother, and through a mutual contact, he found out that I met this guy through tinder. Now there's nothing wrong with online dating, but my community is certainly not as open minded about these things. So as you can imagine, I was quite embarrassed and surprised to hear about this- especially since my brother said he saw a screenshot of my Tinder profile. I've mentioned that I wanted to keep the way we met low-key to the guy before- I'm not sure if this was before or after he told his friends and they shared the information with my brother. Also, as per my conversation with my brother,  the guy has been telling his friends about how much I like him. I don't know why but there's something about this situation that makes me feel unsettled and angry. Am I being unreasonable or do I have grounds to feel confused and angry?

I found this guy I've always liked on Tinder 4 months ago. Since then we've been talking everyday and hanging out a few times. 2 months ago I told him I like him and he replied ""that's really sweet thank you"". I was ready to accept the rejection and move on with my life, but he still continued texting me and wanted to hang out. He's opened up to me about previous relationships and when he hasn't felt the same way he's usually ended up cutting off communication. Yesterday, he hosted a very intimate birthday party and surprisingly I was invited. I'm not really sure why tbh- we're friends but I never thought we were that close and I've made it pretty clear that I want to be more than friends. Also I feel like by inviting me he was leading me on a bit. Today I spoke to my brother, and through a mutual contact, he found out that I met this guy through tinder. Now there's nothing wrong with online dating, but my community is certainly not as open minded about these things. So as you can imagine, I was quite embarrassed and surprised to hear about this- especially since my brother said he saw a screenshot of my Tinder profile. I've mentioned that I wanted to keep the way we met low-key to the guy before- I'm not sure if this was before or after he told his friends and they shared the information with my brother. Also, as per my conversation with my brother,  the guy has been telling his friends about how much I like him. I don't know why but there's something about this situation that makes me feel unsettled and angry. Am I being unreasonable or do I have grounds to feel confused and angry? Also do you think I was led on or have just been overthinking this situation?
