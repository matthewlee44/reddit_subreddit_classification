0,oi013y,1625988408,Ambiguity in morality of hook up / beginning stages of a relationship - advice and thoughts requested,"I fell deeply in love with someone (who I knew earlier in life and later reconnected) three years ago, and it was a spiritual and life changing experience that dramatically changed the way I see myself and the world. I’m old enough and have enough world and dating experience to say that despite having been in other relationships, she was probably the only person I can really say I have ever been in love with (even though we never even formally dated). However, the timing was terrible - I was dating someone else at the same time, she started dating someone else, etc. 

Fast forward three years. It takes me 2.9 years to get over her. It was an excruciating and painful healing process. One day, I finally feel at peace and ready to move on. Literally one week after that she tells me that she broke up with her boyfriend and has had feelings for me the entire three years?? And that she felt that she needed to try to make her now ex relationship work at the time, so she created distance. And she needs some time to recover/wipe a clean slate from that last relationship, but afterwards wants to date me exclusively… there is no timeline on it, but we are beginning to reconnect and reform a “slow” friendship and get to know each other again. So we are “friends,” but she’s also placing her foot firmly in line…

Before reconnecting, I had already planned a trip with another woman (casual relationship / booty call / adventure buddy). This trip was planned months ago.  I wasn’t really planning on sharing this trip as I felt it would be cruel to share that. I also thought about if I should cancel the trip. Through our conversations, the old flame finds out about said trip and is upset. She was upset that I didn’t tell her about this trip earlier, and she clearly doesn’t want me to go. She also realizes she’s not in a position to tell me what to do. From my view, I want to go for the fun and because I feel that I need to continue to live my life. I even feel a little weird that she pried for the information – I feel that it’s not inappropriate to date multiple people in the early stages of a relationship (I realize the situation is different since we have a history). 

I’m confused on what to do. I feel like I’m being forced to cancel this trip if I want a future with old flame. However at the same time, it’s not a sure thing. I feel conflicted and confused. I want a future with old flame, but I also feel like I’m giving up my sovereignty. I also feel like she crossed the boundary of only being friends, but that cat is out of the bag, it’s too late now. I suggested that I’m planning to cancel the trip, and she seemed delighted. I guess part of it is that I still have the feelings for her, I’m afraid of being hurt again, I don’t want to give up my life for what hypothetically could be a rebound (unlikely), I don’t want to do something immoral, I still want to enjoy my life as we aren’t committed. But there is (to me) deep complexity now. 

Questions: Will I ruin things if I go? What are the appropriate boundaries in this type of situation? Does she have a right to know if I’m dating someone else? Do I immediately just change my life and stop dating everyone else just because she showed up? What is the moral thing to do? Beyond this trip, what happens when we are still in the “friend/getting to know phase” and I have opportunities to date others?

Tl;dr. Old flame shows up and tells me she’s single and wants to date me as soon as she “finishes processing the last relationship”. I have a “casual relationship” who I had planned months ago to go on a trip with. I want to be honest and also have healthy boundaries and be moral. Do I cancel? Do I go? What are your thoughts?

Whether on the apps or in real life I just can’t find fun and interesting girls to flirt with. 

It seems like every time I leave town, I have a romantic-ish episode but not much here.

For example, I visited nyc a month ago and hooked up with a pretty girl, all her initiative. And during my 2 week east coast trip I was getting a bunch of matches on bumble, whereas I get almost none here.

The crazy thing is the so-far love of my life is here. We met 5 years ago and have been on and off but she won’t commit to me because she’s young and drinks too much. Sucks. 

I have a good life here, many friends and I like the area. But dating is just miserable here and I have enough proof to feel like I could do much better somewhere else.

So, I’m seeing this guy. He is sweet, he is caring, he hugs me while we are sleeping. Cute right? But thats just it, there is no label. 

We have been seeing each other for a year but there doesn’t seem to be any progress. Is he taking it slow or is he just not that into me?

4,oi0kmk,1625991254,2 Shy/Over-thinkers trying to be together,"So it all started when I asked this girl out one day. I used to see her in the university at different places and sometimes we would have eye contacts and I would catch her looking at me. She seemed timid. So one day I decided to go talk to her, she was sitting alone somewhere and I just went up to her and said hi and started chatting. In the end I asked if she wanted to go out and she said yes and I got her socials and a week later I texted but she didn’t reply (didn’t even make it seen). I thought she wasn’t interested and was just being nice at that time. Weeks passed and again whenever I would see her, she would keep looking at me but I was too embarrassed to have eye contact with her so i avoided it being shy myself. Also some posts she would like on Instagram would appear in my news feed which seemed pretty close to our situation. From all the posts she would like, I gathered she is really timid, suffers from anxiety, likes me and wants me to wait. This staring of her at me and me avoiding being near to her continued on for 2-3 months. Then I decided to follow her again on IG and made a stupid mistake of changing the theme in chat settings to love and after realising that she could see it, changed it to some other. I thought she would consider it weird and would probably block me or something. But to my surprise she accepted my chat request (as she has an open profile, but didn’t follow back). So then a couple days later I texted her, she again didn’t reply which was very shocking. With news feed being a huge help, I saw a post liked by her later that day which said something - “self respect over feelings”. Few days passed, I saw a notification of her following me and then unfollowing me which was that probably by mistake as she was going through my profile. Now it’s been a month since then, occasionally I would see her in the gym and she would still look at me, sometimes workout closer to me. But I feel very insulted and embarrassed to talk to her now. I really like this girl but I don’t know where is this going. Everyone keeps telling me either I might be wrong in reading the signals or that I should just move on. But it’s very had, I can’t with me having a strong feeling that she likes me back too.

I’d never known what love was before her. I felt like my eyes turned into the heart emojis every time I looked at her—and it wasn’t her looks. She was pretty,  but I’ve never had problems “pulling” attractive women. It was just her. Her soul. They say when you meet “the one,” you’ll know it. And with her, I did.

I was in ecstasy with her on every date. But after the date I’d go home and eat my heart out over the fact that I felt it wouldn’t work long term. She had a debilitating health issue, or at least one that could become debilitating, and a bit of a complicated life. I saw myself becoming her therapist if the relationship progressed, and I wasn’t sure if I could handle that considering my own life isn’t quite peaches and roses. 

Deep down I feel I’ve made the right decision for both of us. She deserves someone who knows he can handle these things. But still I can’t help but think about the feeling I had when we were together—that we’d overcome everything, no matter how hard.

Until May of this year, she lived with her boyfriend, who also went to high school with us. She DM'd me in the spring of last year about getting drinks. I asked how her boyfriend was since I went to middle and high school with him. Over the next year, we developed a connection. We only hung out seven times. She was terrible at communication. Her boyfriend texted me two times to cancel my plans with her. My best friend, who's a girl, concluded he's controlling after having witnessed his behavior. I ended up at the same party as them two, and he was so possessive and controlling, he wouldn't let me hit up a taco truck with her during the party. She sent me a lewd while in the restroom, then we ditched him. It was great from June 2020 - April 2021. She had ideas for us to go on adventures, road trips, cared about each other, check in on each other. She would typically respond to my texts in under a minute. We also texted or snapchatted every day. She would respond to my Snapchat stories, too. Then May happened: She moved out, she constantly asked me to hang out. My schedule always didn't align with hers, so we hung out twice, right after I finished a road trip with my brother. Then a little over a week later, she and I got into a fight. She TOLD me to do something with her after asking what I was doing, then didn't respond. Against my better judgment, I accidentally started a fight with her. We both apologized a week ago, however. During the last two months or however long, she's one of the first five, if not the first, viewers of my dumb snap stories. I post -- a lot. Also, she and I have terrible anxiety. Honestly, if she hadn't lived with her boyfriend for the first year, it would've been easier to respond to her flirting since I didn't have it in me to encourage cheating. What do you guys think I should do? I'm very anxious.  I, unfortunately, told her after we got into a fight that I cuddled with a gay guy because I thought she might find it cute and against my better judgment, talked to his straight roommate, who's a girl, who asked me to dance with a broken leg and bought me a drink when I went out.

36,oi4rti,1626011311,"I'm not attracted to stereotypically hot guys, and people find that weird","I (21F) don't like guys that look like models. I'm more impressed by ability to code in multiple programming languages than I am by six packs. I can count all the people I've ever been physically interested in on one hand, and one of them regularly had their face compared to the side profile of Big Bird from Sesame Street.

It's not that I don't find anyone unattractive; appearance still matters. It's just that what I find attractive is unappealing to people in my life. It's reached the point where even my therapist struggles to be supportive.

To clarify what I mean, picture a stereotypical high school jock. Perfect grades, captain of the football team, popular, every girl knows who he is. I'm more likely to have a crush on the calculus kid whose head he dunks in the toilet every Friday. When I was growing up I had a huge crush on Maurice Moss from the IT Crowd.

My mom always refuses to comment when I ask her what she thinks of the guys I like. I only ask her because she's my mom and I'm curious.

I don't really think there's anything wrong with me. At least, in regards to what kinds of people I find attractive. It's just kind of tiring how a lot of people always feel the need to give their negative input on something so subjective, especially when I never asked for it. I can't even make an offhand comment on a cute guy without someone telling me to raise my standards. Not even with my mom. The best I can hope for with most people is an awkward silence.

The other month I made another post on here about how I get judged by other women for liking nerdy guys, I just made this post too because it also extends to appearances and not just personality.

Before anyone gets their hopes up, I'm almost completely asexual now, and I'm schizophrenic with PTSD and a personality disorder. I'm not really the definition of a ""light at the end of the tunnel"", unless that light is a train and you're ready to meet God. I'm not nearly hot enough to compensate.

Women tell me I have no standards, and then tell me that my standards are too high. On my last post on this subject, some guy accused me of being a troll that was lying to try and bait people. I literally cannot win.

That's really none of my business, though. Whether people judge me for my taste or believe if it's true doesn't really affect me that much, and as long as I'm not in a toxic relationship it doesn't really matter. Most of how I feel attraction is a gut instinct/gravitational pull anyway. 

The main problem is that I don't know how to meet guys my type, most of them think dating apps are stupid and avoid them like the plague, and I don't have any friends I can go out to meet guys with either because they're either completely ace or just not interested in dating. 

I have a crush on a guy that sometimes works the drive through of a taco place by my neighborhood, but I have no idea how to approach strangers I'm interested in - I only know how to reject people because the other thing I have a reputation for is attracting terrible people, half the guys that pursued me in high school are probably in prison now. 

My bad luck with the kinds of people I attract is a running joke in all of my friend groups, and I can't really blame them. The main reason I'm 21 and still have no dating experience is because I never had a guy pursue me that I also was 100% sure he wouldn't kill me in my sleep at some point down the line.

TL;DR: Dating is hard. I'm hard for nerds. Fuck, I need to sleep.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oi4rti/im_not_attracted_to_stereotypically_hot_guys_and/

Sex is fun and all, but there is more to it than just that and it seems now a days thats the thing everyone just wants to be desired. And after the puppy love stage in a relationship I really start to desire more, like a deep conversation about everything without starting some type of argument because i see things differently sometimes. Most of the time I'll talk and I can tell my partner is listening but she has nothing to say in return. I can talk for along time and just express myself but I dont get anything back. Does anyone feel like that?

I know I'll probably never meet these guys but I put them on a pedestal in my head that they are probably better than me through what I see on social media.

44,oi5pnw,1626014673,My online girlfriend of 3 months and a half broke up to me due to depression and suicidal thoughts coming back to her.,"2 days ago my online girlfriend broke up with each other due to reasoning being depression and her suicidal thoughts coming back to her. Note, she's been depressed and suicidal before, she's been the therapist and I know that her mental state right now is everything but stable. To maybe get a better understanding from her perspective, this is what she wrote 2 days into the breakup, after reading a message I sent to her.

 ""While I'm very thankful for what you wrote, you have to understand that I'm in a position of depression and that's why I need to find myself again, find life that was in me a few years back. I just wanna be happy but if I was to keep going into this relationship, stress about thinking is he cheating, are there girls around him. I trust you more than anyone else but these thoughts just create bigger stress on me that I don't need at the moment. That's why I've chosen to remain bestfriends at the moment while I try to just be me at the moment and focus things on me.""

Before this message, she opened up with me, a lot of her depression comes from family issues and stuff they've said towards her, stuff that even me as a guy who has been through hard times in life aswell, would find as painful as a bullet in the heart. These problems have followed her for a year now and the fact that she decide to end it 3 months in the relationship because of the same problems she had when she started it, hurts me. Sometimes it feels like she just doesn't want my help, we really love each other and I begged her to let me help her as that's what a partner is for, be there for you during your best and worst days. She insisted on remaining bestfriends but she still wants to spend the same amount of time with me, talk to me and just me all the day, play with me, fall asleep in FaceTime with me and still tell me that she loves me and will not stop loving me no matter what. She promises that this breakup will not effect her love for me and that when she finds herself, she will come to me, the person she loves. She will not move on nor find anyone, she will focus on herself so when she comes back, she's stronger for ever and then we can make things work out. I know it's only been 3 days now but she tells me that she loves me before she sleeps or goes somewhere, she tells me that her love for me cannot be put into words.

I asked her about the part where she said ""then I have to worry about thoughts of you cheating or girls coming to you"", she said that she fully trusts me and it's just thoughts that come through her mind and make her stress even more. We have argued a lot in this relationship, most of the time the reason being a dumb one, not even worth talking twice about, not mention argue. She doesn't want to worry about arguments or breaking up while she finds herself, thus doesn't want a relationship right now. She's had access to all my accounts and to make her feel better I asked her if she wanted to still have access to them so it would make her feel comfier and better knowing that I'm all about her and I wouldn't even TALK to anyone girl, not mention do anything behind her back. She said it would make her feel better having access so she still does. 

Also another thing to point out, is that during our relationship we've done sexual things on a FaceTime and 2 after we broke up, so yesterday, she decided to start flirting and do it again, even after breaking up. We're pretty much doing everything we used to do as a couple, spend so much time together even though our time zones are 9 hours apart, sleep in facetime and now even do the thing still. She says that even as bestfriends, she feels comfy and trusts me, that's why she does what she does. 

She's 17, this exact argument with the same reasoning happened some days before this and she ended up coming back a day later saying ""she would never leave and she just ends up coming back to me because she can't lose me."" I don't know if she's just confused at the moment and needs some time or if she's breaking up with me because of the arguments and she's just trying to let me down slowly. She did tell me to move on and that she'd keep my heart safe for another girl when we first broke up, but now she's switched up and knows that I'll wait for her and she says that she'll keep loving me the same till she's ready again aswell. She's been through all this before so I doubt she's lying, I believe her and I'm aware of some of her problems, I'd be depressed too.

**My only question is, will she keep loving me the same, will she come back?** We're not distancing from each other, we're still close the same but not in a relationship and honestly there's barely any difference since we still do everything we used to do, other than call each other nicknames and say that we're dating.

Matched with a guy on bumble and asked him to meet the next day since he seemed interesting (and its more efficient getting to know someone in person)! I'm 24F, he is 30M. We talked for 5/5.5 hours, moved from the restaurant to my place and we ended up hooking up (I kissed him first). He left my place 8 hours after we met and it was great! Interestingly, he confirmed multiple times if I really wanted to hook up and wasnt making a drunk decision "" you sure? you're really drunk.""

We continued texting - I sent the first message the next day, and it continued for a week. he met me after exactly a week, straight from work around 9.30 PM and we just talked at a bar for 2.5 hours. he made no attempts to kiss/ get physical despite multiple opportunities.

next day, I texted him just to catch up and we have been texting non-stop. he keeps the conversation going even when I give him a chance to just drop it off. He's signaled wanting to meet again after a week.

I'm a little confused about what is going on here though? Do you think he's interested in just sex or actually hanging out? Conscious that he's a little older than me and I ruined stuff by having sex on the first date. Is there any way to tell what he feels?

So a couple of days ago my girlfriend (F17) of 9 months broke up with me (M18). We had such a strong bond and out of all my relationships this was just something else. She was so caring and loving and we worked out so good together. I really thought and still think that she is the love of my life. And with tears in her eyes she said that she thinks that about me too. But out of nowhere a couple of days ago she broke up with me. She broke up because as she said she just can’t be in a relationship right now. That is because she doesn’t have energy for anything more than a friendship, she said that she feels mentally drained. She said that i’m perfect for her and that she doesn’t deserve me but even though she just can’t give as much energy as she should while being in a relationship. Because of all this she broke up with me but we still stayed as friends, as best friends because that’s what she wanted and that’s what i want if we break up. She says that this could only be temporary, that we could get back together when she regains her energy for a relationship. Until then we can build a stronger friendship, so that our relationship could be a lot stronger IF we get back together. But she can’t say for sure if we would get back together when she is ready because she just can’t know how long will that take, what will be the situation between us and where will we be in life. All she promised is that she will focus on us after regaining her energy depending on the situation. I really want to wait for her because she really just feels perfect for me, but what if all of my waiting will be in vain? I just want to know what would you do in this situation.

I figured I could gain some experience flirting or texting or something. I wasn't expecting much, but I put in my post that I was basically looking for anything up to a relationship.

I spent a lot of time crafting my posts. I have a writing background and I used it to my advantage. I looked at what all the other guys were doing and I made posts that differentiated me from them. 

I spoke with around 2 girls per post. I think that is ok considering the sub is mostly men. I wasn't really looking for anything other than to chat. Success lol.

Around the time I was about to go to bed, I get a message from a girl and we just hit it off. Everything clicked. We have similar backgrounds, beliefs, and life views.  We texted for 3 hours the first night. This was good texting too. I didn't even have to active listen. The next night we had a 2 hour video call and so forth. 

She is currently travelling for work, but we have made plans for when she gets back. We text, and call everyday. We have also agreed that we are ""talking"" and leaning towards a relationship once we meet.

85,oi92o3,1626025720,Women (and men) are not a monolith. There many factors at play when we feel attraction,"No matter what you do, a good portion of women will not find you appealing, and will be ambivalent towards you, turned off by you. You can be well groomed, adopt powerful body language, be successful in your career, be charming. Sometimes you just don’t align with what they find attractive, the same way a large percentage of females don’t appeal to you. Why do we expect different rules when it comes how women perceive us?

You shouldn’t go into a social situation expecting rejection, always put yourself out there, but fun, lighthearted, charming. However, be realistic as well. You cannot force long-term attraction with lines, cockiness, or what you wear.

If a woman doesn’t find you attractive, remember there are other factors at play:

Her childhood: Our childhoods play a huge factor in how we interact as adults, and also who we’re attracted to. She may had a father figure or male I her life that shaped the archetype of what makes her feel safe, and you may not fit that archetype.

Genetics: Do you find certain characteristics in people attractive, without any particular rhyme or reason? Being in shape and well groomed is extremely important and is the impactful outward change that will increase your chances. But at the end of the day, she will still have innate features that she is drawn to, and you may not fit that.

Circumstance and timing: Do you sometimes just want to chill and relax with you friends, and not even worry about the other sex? Well guess what, they do too. In our ego we want to believe that we can charm a woman, make her want to look for the one when she’s not ready. Sometimes she’s just not in the fucking mood. She also might be going through a tough time at work, with family, or having issues with anxiety. As men we often put women on a pedestal and forget they are human being with a problems like us.

Social circle: Mark Manson refers to this as demographics in Models, and is a bigger factor that we realize. Don’t get me wrong, a cute metal head girl can be attracted to a clean cut guy, but often times, if a guy (or girl) doesn’t fit into someone’s social lifestyle, it can be an obstacle.

Next time you encounter rejection or ambivalence from someone, remember you are not the sole factor in why she reacted the way she did. This also isn’t an excuse for complacency, how you present yourself is a huge factor, but there often other things at play, and you shouldn’t take rejection personally.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oi92o3/women_and_men_are_not_a_monolith_there_many/

1. I can not go back to this cafe since it might get embarrassing to go back after failing to get her number.
2. This is my favorite cafe to work in with my laptop and there are no other alternatives to this cafe for me to go to if I fail.

I got rejected by a different woman 2 weeks ago because she felt I was too touchy and didn't like being touched even on her shoulders or elbows..   


How on earth am I supposed to know whether a woman likes being touched in a teasing way or not and where she likes being touched - especially on the first date?. I can't even ask them this because it sounds creepy.   


It hurts a lot because I have been putting a lot of effort in improving myself but even one misstep just kills the entire thing and I start again from ground zero. No second chances. You need to get it right the first time around... Navigate past all the landmines, be the ""perfect guy"" who makes zero mistakes and understands what they want without asking them. I mean, how is that even possible?  


For example, the woman I was with yesterday told me 4 times when we were chatting that she doesn't come to the guy's place or sleep with guys on the first date. Yet, she came to my place because she wanted to see it - I didn't insist at all. I just mentioned here's my place, do you want to see it?.

I don’t think I’m very attractive, and I have an average body, but I do consistently date women (who I find to be attractive) every week. I will admit though that my dating profile is bad because it’s all selfies and cats, since I don’t like taking pictures. I deleted the apps a month ago and plan on taking a break for the rest of the year. 

Before going on a break, I went out on 2-4 dates a week. The conversations were always good, long (2+ hours), and usually led to either a second date, a kiss, or sex. Despite having gone on many first and second dates, I get ghosted hard after 2-3 dates. That’s obviously the timeframe where you make a decision whether that person is your person, but I will never understand why people ghost. No explanation about what you did wrong, what you could have done. Nothing.

The worst feeling is when the person ghosts after a *great* first couple of dates. The dates where it all goes well. Long conversations, everything clicks, there’s mutual attraction. Then nothing the next date. I’ve had so many of those, it’s triggering.

I really do feel for the men out there who don’t go out on many dates despite their good efforts. I have friends like this. I’m not saying I have it harder, but it’s definitely not easy either way.

96,oi9ts3,1626028151,I wish finding love was as easy as buying your favourite items from the store!,"Hey there! 

Just wanted to really vent about this!

I'm a male in my early twenties and I've never ever had a girlfriend. I've tried all these things: online dating, apps, bars, clubs, parties, social groups, youth groups, university campus, other social venues such as bowling arena, parks (where I know ppl hang out), cafes............but no luck. Most girls use the ""I have a boyfriend"" card and tbh most girls are really rude and arrogant. 

It physically pains me to go out and see hot girls everywhere time and time again, it hits me in the chest and reminds me of something that I'm missing out on (a relationship) that is soooo hard to find! I just want a girlfriend who I can honestly share my life with, talk to, laugh with, go out with, start a family with one day etc. and I can't believe it's so hard to find just that ONE person! When I think about how there are 7 billion + people in the world it really shatters me inside that despite the huge population it's still this hard. 

I do make an effort to get on with life and do what I need to like hobbies, working-out etc. but it's not like magically working on yourself will make a girl appear. You know what, relationships are the one thing where there is no definitive way to find. If you're hungry, go eat something, if you want to be a doctor, go to college for it! if you want to find a romantic partner, there is nothing you can just instantly do if you get me. 

Honestly I have a comfortable life, a good house, car, money, job etc. but the absence of love/relationship is slowly killing me and driving me insane!!! I absolutely HAATE!!! the single life with every fibre of my being. I get being single has its benefits but humans are biologically made to crave for love/companionship and hence why 7 billion people + exist. The whole notion of ""a relationship won't make you happy"" is like telling a homeless person a job won't make you feel any better. 

Honestly loneliness is one of the worst sufferings. Even friends/family don't fulfil the overall needs a romantic partner can. I really really want to find someone (the right one of course) but I just can't see anything changing. I've been trying for about 4-5 years now. I never thought it would be this damn hard. I don't even want to be the next billionaire or have the most expensive car etc. I just want to love someone and be loved backed! 

Honestly I'm really fucking terrified of ending up all alone. I rarely get jealous of people but seeing girls and boys getting into relationships so damn easily like flipping a switch really makes me hate the unfairness of life and it murders me inside. No amount of money can erase the pain of loneliness. All I have right now is just a glimmer of hope that I may run into the love of my life soon and that keeps me going. 

At this point I'm really a dead man walking!

How do you control your emotions?","I've (29/M) been working on finding a serious relationship or even just a steady FWB for over a year now. I primarily use Tinder and Hinge. I do have Bumble, but I get far fewer matches there. Facebook Dating, OkCupid, and POF aren't even worth mentioning - they're less active and seem filled with strange/alternative people that I am just not attracted to. 

I receive 5 to 10 matches a week with girls I would legitimately consider dating or at least create a FWB relationship with but about 70% of the time these girls either do not reply to my initial message, or will reply once and ghost me. For another 15%, we will send several messages back in forth, usually over the course of a few hours, maybe we will add Snapchat, and they will just mysteriously start ghosting me with no indication as to why. For the final 15%, we will talk about meeting or even make plans to meet but they will ghost the plans/date usually at the last minute, or worst of all just block me hours before we had planned to meet up.

 I usually just ignore it, maybe get mildly depressed and beat myself up for a few hours (or a few days sometimes... sadly), and move on. Eventually I'll match with another girl or two in the 30% mentioned above and the process will just repeat itself. 

To say the least, this has been an emotionally draining experience. It's started to make me nihilistic, impacting other parts of my life. How do you stop your dating life from negatively impacting other parts of your life and how do you stay optimistic when you always getting rejected? As a man, I feel like we sometimes put waay too much of our self-value in getting validation from women - but it's so hard for me not to...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oi9u4p/dating_apps_reply_response_time_snapchat_etc_is/
98,oia07n,1626028722,HVM Shadow Dating Rule?,"I'm beginning to see this occur with enough frequency that it might be a pattern. I'm curious if others are noticing this in dating or willing to admit that they are doing this personally. 

In both secular and religious circles, it appears that HVMs are now unwilling to entertain the idea of **marrying a nonvirgin**. The concept of female virginity has become so anathema in the current feminist milieu that these HVMs are having to come up with other reasons why it's ""just not working out"" after dating for a while and discovering this fact. A big problem here is that women are never hearing the actual reason why the men are unwilling to continue into something serious. To some degree this makes sense because it's not something the woman can change, but it is important to the dating landscape as a whole. We're also talking about actual HVM which would include emotionally intelligent individuals that wouldn't be interested in hurting a woman's feelings or gaining a reputation as an old-fashioned prude.

I'm beginning to question if most (if not all) men have gut-wrenching, visceral reactions to the idea of someone they **actually love** being in a sexual context with someone else. HVMs just have more options and don't have to suppress this reaction in order to be in a relationship. 

Women, does this fit your experience with these kinds of men?
