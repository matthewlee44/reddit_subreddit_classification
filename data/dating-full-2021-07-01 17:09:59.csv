I see this advice all the time in this subreddit, And Honestly, (It's kinda annoying.) I just want to get to know someone better before wanting to be in anything serious with them. Because when I rush into a relationship, It usually ends up in broken hearts. 

 I get that I only have been living on this earth for 15 years  But If I find someone to be attractive I am not going to ask them out right away. 

Yes, I am physically attracted to someone, and my goal is to get to know them, build a relationship or friendship with them before moving into the ""I want to date you."" world. Because to me, That just feels like a relationship with no substance. when your dating right away, But there is no connection or Substance. 

I would just rather build a friendship before I get in anything serious with them. Because then, I won't comfortable with the relationship. :/ Cuz I would feel like I don't know anything about the guy or even is comfortable around him.

He's a busy guy, he often work on the weekend but he would make time to see me after work.

Things been progressing very good so far and being with him makes me feel like I'm at home.

Last Sunday when we hanged out, we followed each other on social media and I noticed he still had pictures of his ex on there. I addressed to him that the feeling wasn't easy to swallow when I saw those pictures. He apologized and removed them. He said he has no interested of going back to his ex, but he did learned a lot about himself as a gay man (he discovered this part about himself not too long ago). It is still bothering to me that those pictures were very recent. He most likely broke off somewhere in may and began to see me in early June. 

I'm just not sure if someone can move on that quickly or am I a rebound to his former partner. From what he describe his ex, the person is nothing like me.

I met a girl who I really fell for. She didn’t want a relationship after 2 months of dating and an embarrassing note asking her to be my girlfriend which got rejected (rightfully so, it was pretty bad. “Your lips are candy” bad. I’m 27…). I’ve been pretty bummed out over it. She’s the first woman that Ive ever opened up to, who still showed romantic interest. Still I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I have made headway in moving forward.

Through this experience I have discovered I am incredibly insecure about a large number of things mostly my age and inexperience. I’m still a virgin and I feel like people see it as a red flag for a man my age to have never sealed the deal with anyone.
I am working hard on myself mentally and physically in every way I know how, day in and day out. Trying to “catch up” if you will. I have intense regret over the lifestyle and choices I made that led to so much isolation for so long.

Now for the twist:

I have to undergo surgery on both of my hips. The hobbies I want to use to meet people are camping and hiking. The recovery process will be lengthy. I have to move in with my parents for a time. Im fighting as hard as I can not to fall into depression. My physical gains will be mostly reset to square one. 

I may be 29 going on 30 before this ordeal is over. I’m honestly crushed and I know it’s going to be difficult. But I won’t get to the other side knowing there’s more I could have done more to make myself a better partner and person. That’s really what’s keeping me going. I want to be a great partner for a great woman.

I feel like I can’t afford to waste another minute. I refuse to let this obstacle take up more space than it has to. How do I cope with my regret and insecurity?

It seems like some of the advice from various dating coaches/websites are contradictory and at times almost toxic. 

I mentioned to my therapist that I thought I might've made myself too available to my casual ex (I don't really know what to call her, we were not officially together), which turned her off, she replied that these tactics are mostly mind games, just be yourself and communicate. She is about my age, attractive, married, I wouldn't consider her to be out of touch with the dating world at all. However it is a possibility she may have said that to put my mind at ease and stop dwelling on what I may have done wrong.

I also think that the human psyche is incredibly complex, and while these tricks may be a game, if it works, it works.

Is this because your parents did not allow you to date at a young age? 🤔 is it because you didn't have that many friends growing up in school ? Is it because we now live in a world where everyone has all this technology which enables us to communicate with people more easily but it also keeps us apart from a real face-to-face one-on-one relationship  early on. Is it possible that this lack of face-to-face interaction actually stunts the ability to have a real one on one relationship at a young age which of course will not make you emotionally capable of doing that when you reach your twenties or older. Is it because today it seems like younger people are more into texting and not actually having a real voice conversation, which I feel is less capable of for lack of a better term transmitting emotional responses to what's happening in your daily life. I really don't think unless of course you have the writing skills of Ernest Hemingway you can possibly write in the average text the emotional feelings of whatever you are experiencing in any given day to another person. I also don't think you can develop emotional intelligence unless you have more voice conversations and more face-to-face interactions. It really is my belief that the more technology that we have the more social media Pages we develop the more lonely we are going to be as a human species on this planet. Considering the first social media Pages started happening in 1997 we have two or three generations of people who grew up with this form of communication. So considering a lot of the people on this site are in their twenties and having these relationship problems it seems to verify all of my observations.

Not sure where to post this. It's been bugging me for quite a while. Just now got the idea to ask a bunch of strangers online. For reference I'm a straight(?) male.

First the preamble: When I was 10-11 I had my first crush on a girl in summercamp after grade 6 (led nowhere) and then I had another crush in grade 7 (also led nowhere). Then that's it. No more crushes. Didn't really think much of it at the time. There were some girls who I liked being around or found myself looking at (is that attraction?), but it didn't feel like anything. Then about a decade later I developed a squish(?) on a friend. Then I got a really strong attraction to a girl (I still think she looked like a Greek Goddess). Now I'm 24-25 and every so often I get gripped by the unmistakable obsessive thoughts and stuff. I'm also totally oblivious to others' interest in me. There were a handful of girls over that decade that now, years later, I'm pretty sure liked me. In case it's important, I was relentlessly (verbally) bullied from kindergarten to grade 3 or so, and lost my father to cancer at 8, and my brother is severely autistic. These difficulties may have had some sort of effect on me, just bringing them up in case they're relevant. I haven't had any real sexual feelings for anyone as well, but maybe those will come in time? The terms ""late-bloomer"" and ""demisexual"" have come up and may apply (especially the former), but I've read nothing about that gap in attraction to anyone. It's like I'm the only person on earth who this has happened to.

Now for the question: why did I have that bizarre inactive period? Are these recent crushes just my imagination? Naturally I'm a virgin for everything from sex to flirting, so in addition to all the normal to stuff to feel insecure about when trying to get your first ever date, I have this insecurity of ""is there something wrong with me?"". Should I be worried?

Thanks for your time!

To set things straight, I've never had a girlfriend nor any sexual experience. I've fallen in love only once at 17 and once at 18. Rejected both times in a pretty cruel way which kinda destroyed my already low self esteem at the time. (I am really awkward socially. People told me a few times that I am a little like Sheldon from The Big-Bang Theory which can be a bad thing as you would guess)

I am now 25 and there's that girl I've been seeing in parties like 2 or 3 times a year sinse 2013. Back then she was a friend's girlfriend but they broke up, she moved out for studies, got another boyfriend, they broke up this year and she's just finished her studies so she's back home. I have always liked her for many reasons but didn't want to have any feelings towards a taken/far away girl but now that she's free, I feel like I can't let that chance pass. So I asked her out for a drink and she said yes. We met, spent maybe 2 hours together drinking a soft at a bar terrace (during the afternoon) then we had things to do so we parted. Everything went well : she was always smiling, we made each other laugh, no awkward silences or anything bad.

Now here's the thing, as I said I've never had any relationship but the first two times I fell in love, it was REALLY in love. I couln't stop thinking about them and when they rejected me, I was devastated. This time though I just really like her and want to be with her.

I (24m) have always struggled with relationships. I have had a few ones, long ones even but recently met this girl and it feels completely different. I have never felt this way, I can’t even begin to explain what it is. 

I have never been a fan of texting, I want to text her ALL. THE. TIME. It’s pretty intense. 

So I guess I’m in love. It’s not even physical, she doesn’t appeal me that much. 

The thing though, is that I know she is interested as well, as she clearly told me she was. However she acts otherwise: we planned a date that have been delayed, we’ve been texting for a month and a half now, and still haven’t seen each other (we had exams), she’s inconsistent in her texting meaning she can go two days without opening the message, or talk to me for an entire day straight. 

On top of that, I feel like I’m the one engaging the conversation 90% of the time.

I know we all got lives, working, studying, cleaning, whatever, I get that, but I don’t understand how you can’t find 2’ to reply to someone you’re « interested in » to say you’re busy and can’t talk right now or idk just something. You can’t tell me you have 0 time for two days straight. 

She doesn’t owe me anything, I get that, but if she (as she stated) wants to build something serious with me,shouldn’t she be a little bit more available ?

A post popped up on twoxchromosones that was incredibly interesting - apparently it was regarding the option of using male prostitution / sex work as a viable solution to being unable to find acceptable men to have sex with (as I inteprited it), citing personal issues and frustration with said gender.

At the same, I know that male virginity is on the rise and larger and larger swaths of men seem to find it harder to attract women - as evidenced by a few select men getting most of the matches on dating websites and the constant repeated frustrations from men posted on here about being lonely/being unable to find someone/etc. 

This juxtiposition is insane to me. On one end, you have women who ""cannot seem to find a decent guy, to even have sex with"", to the point where they are resorting to prostitution as an option. On the other end, you have male virginity rising and men stating that its difficult to find a women to even hold a  hand with and THEY might resort to female prostitution.

But it’s been a fantastic month. We’ve hung out every weekend and every moment we can together. It’s been great! I haven’t clicked this well with someone in a really really long time. I could definitely see it turning into a long term relationship very easily. She checks all of my boxes. 

But recently she asked if I wanted to have kids. Obviously not right now but in the future. I told her I really don’t want to think about kids until I have significantly more financial freedom. I’ve been really hustling the last few years and it’s finally going somewhere very promising. Long story short I just want to focus on my career and my personal life. And due to some family drama over the last few years my opinion on having children has changed. I’m just not sure if I will ever want any. 

Her opinion on kids is the exact opposite. She knows she wants kids and she knows she wants more than a couple. She even went on to say she wants to have kids in the next couple of years because of her biological clock. As a man I can only imagine or empathize what it must be like to want something but be on a bit of a time constraint biologically. That sucks and sounds like a lot of pressure. But I can’t promise her that in 2, 3 or even 5 years I’ll be ready for kids and I really like this girl so I would hate it if after a few years go by and I’m still not ready and she feels like she’s wasted her time with me. I’m torn, in every other aspect I feel this relationship would work. But now that this is brought up I’m afraid that then I would too be under pressure to make up my mind in children and not be able to genuinely enjoy a relationship. I feel like the mature and responsible thing to do is end the relationship now before more heart ache later. But it’s tough as she wants to move past the conversation and continue on seeing me. 

I’m I over reacting in thinking I should end it now or should I go with my gut.

We hit it off immediately. We were exclusive in two weeks. He said he really liked me. He talked about activities he wanted to do with me, places he wanted to take me, and plans he had that he said I would be a lovely date to take to. We always went back and forth about ""playing our cards right"" and ""being on the same page"" with each other.

He did disclose that he was 6 months out of a 5 year relationship, but said he felt ready to get back out into dating. We had this one phone call where we talked about when dates stop being dates and the relationship going to the next level. He even asked if I was the kind of girl that would steal his sweatshirts (keep this in mind, this is important). 

Fastfoward two weeks, I go to hang out with him from Friday night to Saturday morning. We had had dinner and went to get Rita's afterwards. I got cold from the Rita's so when we got back I mentioned I was cold and he offered a sweatshirt. I wore it the rest of the night. Saturday morning, after breakfast and coffee, I gathered my things to go and carried his sweatshirt out with me. I thought I made it pretty obvious that he would see I was taking it. 

After everything was in my car, I went to say bye and said, ""I'm stealing your sweatshirt by the way."" His response was. ""That's okay, I can wash it."" I replied, ""I'm not stealing it to wash it."" He said, ""Oh, we're not there yet."" I answered. ""Oh, ok."" and gave him back his sweatshirt. After the moment becoming awkward, he said we would talk over the weekend about when we would hang out next, but decided on Tuesday before I left. We kissed and hugged a couple more times and he told me to let him know when I got back home.

Everything seemed normal the rest of the day, right up to the good night text saying he was looking forward to seeing me next week. On Sunday, I woke up to no good morning text. I knew by his plans for Sunday he was up earlier than me and he always sent a good morning text. So I sent one. He responded. We continued to text throughout the day, but I could tell something was a little off. 

Fastfoward to Monday, again, no good morning text. Now I start to get a gut feeling, and not the good kind. We were supposed to hang out Tuesday. So I sent a ""test"" good morning text saying I was looking forward to seeing him on Tuesday. He asked to get back to me about Tuesday because he may have to work late. My heart dropped because he never mentioned having to work late, even on nights we didn't hang out. So I pull back and don't inquire anymore about hanging out, just ask how his day and then later how his evening is going. He tells he has to work late Tuesday and not sure about the rest of the week. 

I know when guys pull away, the girl is supposed to ""lean back"" and wait for him to come back to her, but he was still responding to my texts, asking how my day and evening  were going after I asked him and telling me goodnight even if he went to bed first. However, Wednesday night, he sends me a text breaking up with me.

So I guess my questions are: 
- What made him change 180 degrees overnight? (I have some ideas, but want to see what your ideas are.)

- Was taking the sweatshirt at that point in time such a crazy thing to do? (I don't think I did anything wrong.)

- Would ""leaning back"" when he pulled away have changed the outcome of Wednesday? (I guess my thought is if we were truly a match, he wouldn't have pulled away in the first place.)

I said it’s 3 and he brought up how I went on 3 dates and did a second one with all of them. I asked if he plans to go on one and he said maybe. I then said I had to go and we hung up. Clearly I was upset and I think he felt my annoyance. Do I have a right to be upset? I did go on dates but we were casual and the point is now we’re not and I’m offended he’d go on a date while he’s making plans to take his first visit to see me. I’m not even worried about the date it’s more the fact that he wants to go on one. It also means he’s very active on bumble still which also annoys me. What should I say to him?

I’m very direct and forward, so I asked her ‘are you having a good time?’ to which she replied ‘I am!’. I then asked ‘are you feeling hungry?’ to which she replied ‘yes, I could eat!’. We then discussed cuisines and where we could go. I had a list of suggestions that I put to her, and we agreed on a place. 

We walked over, lined up to get inside, and the banter and conversation continued flowing. As we were ordering, we joked about who was the decisive one - she couldn’t figure out what to order, so I laid out the suggestion that we get x items, and she loved it - we agreed I’d be the decisive one going forward. We ended up ordering too much and joked about that too. I said ‘next time we’re gonna have to be a lot more cautious about what we order’ and she replied ‘i totally agree, we have to be careful’!

We then headed out, and walked towards the train station. Moments later, I pulled a very lame but cheeky move - I said ‘I don’t do this often on first dates and usually wait 6 months, but.. would you like to hold my hand’? - she laughed and gave me her hand, and we continued the walk and chatting. 

As we approached the station and it was time
to part ways, I told her I had a great time and would love to see her again. She said she did too, and was down for that. I asked what she was upto on the weekend and she referred to her plans as we discussed earlier in the date, but said Sunday night could work. I said that Sunday night would be fine, and I’d text her to organise. She was very giggly and shy, and I definitely missed an opportunity to give her a kiss, but theres always the next date!

Around an hour and a half later, I texted her saying I had a great time and checked in to see if she got home okay. She responded after saying same, and she got home fine! 

Its the next morning now. We didn’t text much in the 4 days between our first date. At this point it feels like texting is just for logistics, so I’m thinking of replying to her today saying I have an idea for Sunday night and if we should lock in the date? 

I don’t want to take this to a ‘hows your day going’ etc text conversation as I’ve done that too many times to either lose interest myself or it becoming a chore. I like the idea of texting to just organise the date and letting the excitement build for a few days!

I personally like him and really enjoyed.  We basically had lunch and then walked around while talking.  During the lunch, he showed he remembered me wanting to know a certain story about him that I mentioned a week ago (and I like to assume his remembering on his own is one good sign) and when the bill came, I asked if he wants to split and he said he got it (basically paid for us both).  We basically talked about a variety of things outside.  What I liked was that he had similar political beliefs and values as me, and he seemed like someone easygoing and not too opinionated.  I felt like we both were able to easily open up.  At the end of the date he walked with me towards the car, extended his arm into a hug but did it awkwardly when I went in, and then he told me to text him when I get home.  

Now I should describe our post date text and then give some background for prior to today for everyone here on reddit to gauge his interest level.  I basically told him when I reached as he said and how I had a great time getting to know him more especially outside and that I like how we seem to have similar values and way of thinking.  He said he had a great time as well and that I look super cute too.  It seems similar to what he said after our first meet so it could either be sincere or just him being polite.  I told him if he wants to meet up again, he should feel free to hit me up.  He just replied “yea I’d love to meet up again 😊” I kind of initiated the first and hinted at the second so I feel like putting the ball in his court was the right  move and hope I don’t get tempted to hint again (as I sure hope he makes initiative).  

As for background before meeting, basically we’d text daily.  And I always thought he was cute but didn’t become really into him until probably the end of the second week of talking.  I’d take my time responding and I’d say he seemed interested by double texting when I did take time to reply.  And he has always sent good morning and goodnight texts (which I really like).  When I post Snapchat stories with my pics he’d take time to compliment them (along the lines of calling me cute).  I’d say the more I got into him, the more both of us would want to keep convos going, as small talk as texting was, so after that there wasn’t any chances for him to initiate new convos as I’d not want convos to end.  After the first meeting (which was a short coffee meeting) he said the similar line about loving to meet up again and that I looked really cute as well.  But we both said we can’t wait til can meet again.  He even apologized for being chatty and said he gets that way when nervous.  When I said I didn’t even realize he was nervous, his words were basically that he was definitely nervous especially with how pretty I am.  

And with that being said, I’d like to gauge what he thinks of our vibe at this point and where he sees this going, though I’m not sure if it’s too early for that conversation.  As for what I want, I like him enough to date with no expectations as I have been enjoying spending time with him and I’m definitely physically attracted to him.  I’m open to a relationship but I want to continue getting to know him slowly to make sure we are compatible before making that next big jump.  I’m wondering how to bring up that convo as well as tell him exactly that.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,872591,public,self,"What does an awkward hug at the end mean?

Everything seemed to be going extremely well, we would see each other at least once a week, went out on amazing dates, the physical dynamic was great, we seemed to be on the same page the entire time. That is until last week when she started to become a bit more distant than normal, so I asked her what was up. She then told me that she had started to feel as if our relationship was moving too fast and that she thinks we should slow it down and take it slow and ""build our friendship bond"" more for a while without the pressure of sexual activity and labeling it official. She even said that she doesn't want to see other people, she just wants to focus on us and building our bond more over some more time.

Now I have several problems with this. I definitely think that she probably has some fear of commitment as this happened seemingly overnight. One day we seemed to be both on the same page and everything was sunshine and rainbows, and then the next I'm hearing this. I think what is going on here is she is afraid to 100 percent commit to a relationship with me because she wants to ""be friends first"" whatever that is supposed to mean. She is trying to make sure that we will work out before she commits, which I personally think is a bit much. I'm not a wizard who can predict whether we will for sure work out in the future or not, and neither is she. We'll either work out or we wont, only way to find out is by doing it. Before this came up, we have been seeing each other basically as if we were a couple. We even called each other the babe words and stopped talking to other people, stuff like that. It felt as if our relationship was naturally building towards us making it official very soon, and then all of sudden, this happens.

Another important thing to add here is that we have yet to have sex. We have had plenty of make out sessions and all of that good stuff and its obvious that we want each other in a sexual way. The reason this hasn't happened yet is because when we first starting seeing each other she told me that she likes to wait until she is committed to someone first before she has sex with them. I have been respecting this boundary, and I really don't care all that much about it as sex is not as important to me as the bond with the person is. This was one of her big reasons why she wanted to slow down, she felt as if we were building towards sex too quickly and that she wants me to stop touching her in certain ways and no more making out and stuff. As if there was really much of that to begin with, which there wasn't.

My question to all of you is what do you think I should do in this situation? I am really torn as to what to do, one part of me is telling me to drop her and move on, but another is telling me that maybe I should slow down a bit and see what happens. I'm just not going to tolerate months more of this ""lets be friends who are more than friends but aren't committed to each other yet"" situationship we are in. I haven't seen her in  two weeks because our schedules have not allowed for it, and we've only been talking about this situation over text which is a horrible way to do it. I just hate the uncertainty of it all, its been causing me a great deal of anxiety and stress simply because I no longer know where we stand. I'm supposed to see her this weekend for the holiday, and when I do we're going to have a long talk about all of this and settle it. I just don't know what I want to do, I'm just really conflicted.

When I first met him my first impression was that he was a narcissist, but he got me a job working where he was working at a time where I was looking for work and he said that he was looking for a place to stay and I also just so happened to be considering renting out a room in my house. So we agreed on a rent price and I started working with him and we started dating. All this in about a span of 10 days. So we worked until November, then our job/program ended, during which we were supposed to file for unemployment. The job was TAXING (physically, mentally, and emotionally) so when he said he didn’t want to look for work right away I felt that.
But then we were getting halfway through to December. I was already feeling uneasy by the last week of November. He started bargaining rent with me so he wouldn’t have to pay (and I believe I had already lowered it by Oct. and Nov.). Since it was approaching Christmas I was getting worried bc he A) had no money, B) didn’t seem to be looking for anything to do, C) had child support to pay, and D) had a girlfriend duhhhh! So I texted my best friend and asked her what I should do, and told her that this was a red flag for me bc I like partners with ambition, motivation, and responsibility. This is how I found out that he reads my private messages bc he confronted me about ""talking shit about him to my friends."" Long story short he got little petty money jobs about a week and a half before Xmas so he could pay his child support and buy me gifts (which he later gaslighted and guilt tripped me about). But I swear he wouldn’t have acted on that as soon if he had not read those messages. So anywho, life goes on, he’s still doing petty jobs and complaining about how he can’t save, blah blah blah. I’m not even charging him rent, he doesn’t have to pay for food for the most part, just his dog food and little other shit. I even gifted him the money he told me he needed to get his car up and running by January for Xmas (mind you, he was supposed to have this car up and running by like September/October). I even paid his child support in January against my better judgement and that of my friends. Again, long story short, this has been the deal through May (him taking stupid jobs, making stupid money/time decisions, etc). I did start making him pay me rent again in March though.
Anyway, come May and we go out, have a few drinks. By my second I was like let’s just go home but he insisted that we stay a while longer since he never takes me out. So after a few more I was ready to leave, we go. We’re at my car and I’m like ""I’m driving bc I know my limits, I’m good, and you’re not on the insurance so if you crash my car I’m fucked."" He’s like ""No, you drank too much."" Argument ensues. I’m like fuck it bro, I’m not dealing with this shit, I’m taking you back to the streets from whence you came. He hops out the car, grabs his skateboard, and skates to my house. He made it there before me bc I stopped at a gas station. I pull up to my house and park in the back. He calls me and I see him at my back door (he somehow didn’t see me pull in after him). He’s like ""let me in"", I’m like ""no"", he breaks open my back door/breaks into my house. I get out of my car and go inside, he punches a hole in my wall (still not fixed), and I call my momma bc now this mf is damaging her property. Long story short my mom kicks him out, but he acts an ass and pulls the ""I got 30 days"" card. Now what we argued about in May wouldn’t have been the reason I broke up with him but now he’s gotta leave and there’s all this drama on top of the stuff I had to deal with before. So basically every week of May I was confused, mad, etc. and I broke up with him at least 3 times, esp. since I could see no effort being made on his part to pack, move, find a place, NOTHING. So that 3rd time I went and called up my ex (same day) and went and slept with him on the 3rd day of our being broken up (he still lived with me bc again, he was deadass using ALL the 30 days); at this point I was fed up and tired of feeling confused. But I felt bad immediately after I got home bc I don’t like having sex with people I don’t love 😭. So I went back to my man. But at the same time I was falling for this woman at my job and she liked me too. Long story short on this part, I ended up cheating (emotionally, not sexually, although we were making plans to have sex) with this girl. But I’ve never cheated before and I didn’t like it! 😭 The anxiety! So I came clean and now we’re back together. But the thing is, I don’t know if we should be. He recently pissed me off on some cheap shit and today I found out that he’s been telling any and everyone that I cheated (mind you, he stays mad if I tell my close friends any problems in our relationship; always tells me our business should be kept between us; and I’ve been very patient with his anger towards me about my cheating and wrongdoings; although I was irritated by his hypocrisy I understood him telling his close friends about it; today I went to his job and found out he told his coworker WHO HE DOESN’T EVEN LIKE about it). So right now I’m really feeling like this whole thing is dead. But idk if it’s just my mood rn. But I graduate soon and I don’t even know if I want him to meet my other family.

She initially reached out months ago for help on an assignment and since then we’ve kept close contact. We’ve talked about assignments and even had our own zoom sessions just one on one talking for an hour. We talk about school, future plans, personal interests etc.

Normally we messaged through our programs slack channel but two weeks ago she asked for my number, saying she doesn’t slack notifications all that time.

The program ends today and I don’t know how to maneuver this. I’m still unsure if she likes me or not. Last time we talked was this past Tuesday.

I want to maintain contact with her and possibly even meet up with her. She lives two hours away but I’m willing to make the drive.

She hit me up a few months ago asking how i was doing and we went for a few dog walks and stayed out late together and this week we’re gonna buy some booze and go drink in a field. 

I’m not gonna recount what happened word for word since those things can be open to interpretation (e.g. i’m into her so her hitting me after i said i didn’t like love island seemed like flirting, but it could just be something she does with friends and that) and it’s also not the point of the post.

What i wanna know is if there’s anything i can ask that’s more subtle than “are we in the talking stage” or “do you like me” or any behaviours that you’d only really find in someone you’re interested in.
