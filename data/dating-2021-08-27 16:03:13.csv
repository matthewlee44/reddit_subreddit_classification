4,pcwptm,1630100250,This has really got me down because I thought we were friends,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pcwptm/this_has_really_got_me_down_because_i_thought_we/

Later I found out that my best friend admitted to cockblocking me that day and I felt tricked and angry. She said she did it bc she didn't want the friend group to change dynamics and I understood that, but I felt that she was kinda being selfish?

I can't honestly sit there and pretend to believe in that as I'd be being dishonest and that's a bad foundation for a relationship. Obviously this leads to things fading out and us going our separate ways. I can't help thinking that they have been in the same situation before and chosen not to talk about it until further down the line.

24,pcyfmp,1630106072,Dating with OCD,"Hello this post is about my current experience with dating while having OCD. Maybe the post will help you or maybe you can help me 😊.

I (21F) have OCD and I mostly suffer from OCD thoughts. I have been -almost daily- talking to a guy since may of this year. We met on Badoo, thanks to COVID-19. 

I don’t have a lot of experience even though I am passed the age of 20:

- I have been on dates before
- I have dated one guy for a year but we eventually broke up due to the pandemic, living in two different countries (Netherlands and Belgium) etc.
- I don’t think I have ever truly been in love 💔
- I am STILL a virgin at 21. I know I am not the only one but it is an insecurity of mine. 

Anyways like I said before, we met online and have been talking on a nearly daily basis. We are not exclusive yet (obviously)and we are both talking to other people but I am the most serious about this guy. We have had an online date ( I wanted to see if he was actually real) and tomorrow is our first IRL date!

Ever since we started talking my OCD has flared up (once again). I have a lot of negative thoughts and worries: 

- What if he does not like the fact that I am still a virgin?
- Are guys on dating apps truly honest? Even if he says that he wants to be in a committed relationship?
- What if it actually goes well and I want to talk about exclusivity and monogamy? How do I do that? What if it goes wrong?
- How do I tell him I would like him to get tested before we are intimate?
- How do I tell him that I am not on BC yet so we have to wait a little before we have sex?
- How do I tell him I won’t have sex without a condom until he has been tested, I am on BC and we are exclusive? And if we do we will use pull-out as well. 
- How do I tell him that I am still a bit scared to have sex without a condom in general? I am afraid of pregnancy 
- How do I tell him I would prefer it if he gets tested before we get intimate?
- How do I tell him that if he does not get tested I will always use a condom for every type of sex?
- What type of contraception should I get?
- What if I still get pregnant using the copper IUD?
- What if something goes wrong using the copper IUD? How do I check the strings etc? What if I mess it up?
- What if he does not want to wait until I have birth control or am comfortable with the idea of having sex without a condom. 

Etc, etc, etc. 

As you can see I am obviously the queen of overthinking 👸👑
These thoughts and many more haunt me 24/7.
It is very very difficult to fight these thoughts even with all the tips and tricks that I use on a daily basis. 

Maybe you would like to know more about the guy. Maybe you are wondering what kind of person he is/seems to be:

- on his profile he says that he is looking for a committed relationship.
- He likes honesty.
- He respects other people’s boundaries.
- He does not have a lot of experience with dating and no experience with relationships. He might be a virgin as well I don’t know.
- He must like me as well, we have been talking since may.
- He did not mind FaceTiming before meeting. He seems a bit more serious than most guys our age. 


Anyways this has been my experience up until now. Tomorrow is our first true date. 
I don’t know if this post was relatable or helpful in any way. Writing everything down did kind of help me sort out my thoughts.
If you have questions or you would like for me to do a follow-up, please send a message.

Been seeing this girl for like 5/6 months now. Things haven’t been super intense, we’ve only met around 7/8 times in that time as both been super busy etc etc, but recently we’ve seen eachother twice in the space of a week I stayed at hers etc, all seems to be going well. 

Tonight I took her out for dinner, was at a pretty nice restaurant that she picked out and I had said before I wanted to take her for a meal and she was super flattered and grateful. The meal was really nice, and we left having laughed a lot etc. When we got outside we sat for a while finishing our drinks, I had a pretty stressful work thing going on that I had to text some colleagues about and I apologised to her as it was super important. So I just messaged the work stuff as she was sat there but I said a number of times that I was sorry for seeming rude etc, and since we know eachother pretty well now it didn’t seem out of place. Once i had finished the work conversation she had gone super quiet and said she felt really anxious and stressed. I apologised and reassured her it was okay. She said she just wanted to go home because she felt bad so I said I’d walk her back. On the walk we kissed and held hands, things seemed better. But by the time get back to hers she said she felt bad again, she went super pale and said she felt unwell. We kissed again but she said she needed to just go to bed. I said I could go and she was super apologetic but said it was probs for the best. We kissed goodbye and I left. As soon as I left I felt awful. I’m overthinking everything. Was I the reason she felt bad ? Did I stress her out ? I’m convinced she’s going to call things off now and if she does I’ll be gutted, I really like her. 

Not sure where to go from here or what to say without just sounding needy or misunderstanding. I’m sad that she feels bad and it could’ve been something to do with what I did? What do I do now!

35,pczmmr,1630110430,How to meet women these days for a long term relationship.,"I have often been told to join a meetup or activity group to meet new people and this is how you meet new friends and women.

But I mean this seems so messy and complicated. Like some Meetup groups have warning statements that this is not a dating activity. I don't feel comfortable and have willingness to meet complete strangers to do something. This sounds so awkward and weird. I mean why can't most women just use dating apps. This is where people looking to date should go. 

But I mean it seems that most women do not accept to meet men this way. They want to meet them through a side activity and want him to be around her all the time and if things go well, then it escalates. Is this how it works or am I completely missing the dating boat? It seems that women do not care about meeting men. They just are open to meet people and if a boyfriend comes along, great. If not, so what. So they're not looking but are actually looking.

36,pczne1,1630110517,"Girl (25F) I (26M) like is sending mixed signals. I like the friendship, but don’t know if it’s salvageable.","So, girl I like and directed in a short film just got out of a nine year relationship. She is completely messed up over this, and I don’t think she is very interested in me anyway, so making a move is out of the question, I think (let me know if you disagree or have an opinion). She came by for dinner once and stayed till 2:30 AM. We talked, and I really connected with her (she agreed). I really love this emotional connection, so I’d be willing to explore this, but I’m also trying to grow more backbone (I tend to be very acquiescent to people I want to like me, which often just hurts me). When we’re together, she is always nice, touching me, lots of eye contact and no awkwardness. When I app her, she’s seems distant. A mutual friend said she might be leading me on, which would hurt because I thought our conversations were a sign of mutual respect. It’s fine if she’s not interested, but I thought we were past the point of stupid games (but this is all interpretation, so who knows what she thinks). Maybe she knows I like her and this makes it hard for her, I dunno.
I asked her if a second dinner, pizza and a movie, seemed nice, and she said yes… after fourteen hours. She said she loved talking, but that it was difficult for her (she is a bottle-upper, I think).
If I simply wanted to date I would have stopped a long time ago, but when we do connect I feel really understood, and it seems to be mutual. So I’m willing to try here, but what should I do? How could I define what I’m looking for and protect myself from misunderstandings?

I haven't been in a relationship before &amp; ive never been asked out or have asked someone out before. So i just dont know how to do it. I know im probably making it harder then it has to be but i tried to ask him yesterday and it didnt go well.

As i enter the store he says hey to me with a wave &amp; i say hey with a wave back. I said ""hey i was wondering...(*pause*)how your day was?"" He answered and ask me the same. I answered and then we went our separate ways. I was going to ask him for his number, but i just didnt. 

So i guess my first question is how do i get the courage to ask him out?

My second question is how do i keep him? Ive never had an actual friend. Ive had potential friends but i can never really keep them interested. Ive realized i cant hold a conversation &amp; i dont think i have a personality. I really want a personality, &amp; i want to have friendships and romantic relationships but i just can seem to keep anyone interested in me enough.

anyways i am now 30, and i am thinking about joining some classes i am interested in. of course if i meet someone nice that'd be great but I am doing it mostly because i enjoy the class and i want to meet new people.

anyone who went this route and got success? activity groups could be anything like a running club, a sports league recreational, craft &amp; arts, movie night, whatever

were the people generally closed off to the idea? I generally find the people there to be much more on the older side (ironic, because i am old too!) but they likely married , either just moved to a new city and not out looking for dates/flings/relationship.

48,pd0w7e,1630115359,(25M) here. I honestly believe I'll never be in a relationship. I'm pretty sure there is no hope for me. Agree or disagree?,"I promise to keep this short as possible.

I'm 25 and I've never been in a relationship. Never kissed. Never had sex. Was a loner in high school and college. So yes. I've never had a close group of buddies. There were things that happened in my adolescent years I just never got over and perhaps, I never will. People have told me that I need to properly mourn my lost teenage years and move on, but I'm not the type to let things go until it is properly given.

I'll be real. I feel I have fallen way behind people my age and I can't help but feel an intense resentment towards my peers. This will be controversial here, but if I was given an option all my friends and my fantasy girlfriend would be around 18 to 20. I just never got to have those adventurous college years and knowing how people my age are busy, they won't nearly reciprocate as they did when I was younger.

All I'm trying to say is that I'm trying to fill the void that was left empty but I know the chances of befriending people of that age group get less likely as the years go by. And people my age aren't exactly teenagers anymore. I just don't relate to people my age. Any relationship whether friend or romantic with my age group will not live up to what I want it to be. I just feel I missed out on the boat in human connection and my interest in any human relationship just steadily slides down.

My depression has steadily increased these past few years and as time goes, the more I hate people. Human relationships are just one big silly game for little reward. I feel empty.

Here's the truth. My maturity isn't really up to par. If I indeed have children one day (I have doubts if I will), I won't be ready to raise any till at least my 40's from a maturity perspective. I can sense the women in this sub ready to blast me right now. If you want to label me a creep. Go on. I don't know what the purpose of this post was but one thing is clear, I've had enough of my existence.

TL;DR It may sound ridiculous but I've felt like I ran out of time and have fallen too far behind the pack and thus, I really do feel like I'll always be alone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pd0w7e/25m_here_i_honestly_believe_ill_never_be_in_a/

She has a high stress sounding job in a mental heath field. We had a first lunch date, and she seem very nervous (hard time making eye contact, speaking very formally). But she did laugh a lot, and we had a lot in common. 

For a second date we went hiking. She again seemed VERY nervous, but I was expected it and tried to make her as comfortable as possible. Again easy conversation, and we had a lot in common. We stopped at a bench half way through, and I started very lightly touching her hand etc. and she was touching my arm back. I asked if I could kiss her (which normally seems formal, but given how nervous she was I thought it was a good idea). She said ""yes"" very shyly, but when I kissed her she started kissing me as fast as possibly, like she'd been waiting the whole date. She also mentioned she hasn't dated anyone in ""years""

After we kissed we ended up having a surprising intense conversation. The conversation flowed naturally, but among the things she mentioned was 1) she is a virgin at 28, 2) she has a ton of anxiety around dating 3) she mom is bipolar, 4) she wants kids. I honestly don't remember how kids came up, but a fairly intense conversation for a 2nd date. I didn't really know how big of a deal the 28 year old virgin thing was, she said if after I mentioned going slow. 

She then setup a 3rd date, saying there is a pool at her apartment complex, and that I should come over. She reminded me about this at the end of the date, and then texted me about it. She didn't text much the next week. Finally, today she texts me more or less saying ""I've been thinking a lot, and I don't think I am in a place in my life where I am ready to start a relationship."" I asked her if I kissed her too fast and she said no. 

I very carefully mentioned that maybe she was having anxiety about starting a relationship since she hasn't been in one for a long time. She acknowledged that ""there are a lot of layers to it"" but still seemed to want to end things. 

This is the strongest connection I have felt towards someone in a very long time. I really liked her, and felt like we had a lot in common. I also have a lot of anxiety, and find it very easy to relate to her. I am complete fine with her being a virgin and going slow (and I said that). I don't know what I should do now. Is there anything left I can say? I told her that I like her, and she continues to say she had a great time, and just isn't ready to date. 

I honestly kind of feel like she panicked either at the idea of intimacy, or at how fast it was going emotionally. Is there anything left I can say to her? She is still responding to text, but keeps more or less saying she isn't in a place in her life to date.

It’s been a painful, fruitless process, that’s given him more sex and me more heartbreak, cos 6 months later it never turned into more…

69,pd2gnr,1630121667,advice,so me and the girl i’ve been dating just broke up yesterday. the reason we broke up is because we live in different states but goes to school in my area. during the whole school year we’re together but then she’s gone all summer until nect year starts. we broke up because she feels that we’ve grown apart and that she also needs to learn to handle her feelings and problems herself bc she relies too much on me and her friends as her “shield” and comfort during any inconvenience and she said that she didn’t want to broke up and wished the feeling would go away but couldn’t help with everything i just mentioned. in fact she hopes we find each other again one day but for now i’m kinda left not knowing what to do. we had a healthy breakup and i talked it out before saying goodbye. we still follow each other and have each other or snap and private stories and numbers always open. so like what do i do? should i just focus on myself now and hope for the best. any advice?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pd2gnr/advice/

Like I legit get along with her so well and we have a lot in common same values, political views, taste in faction, etc. I would ask her on a date but I would hate if I made our work environment uncomfortable for her aaaaand I'm a total scary cat 😅. 
Anyway, the big reason I get the feeling she might reciprocate my feelings is cus she always complimenting my appearance, saying she like certain things about me (humor and behavior), and today she legit said she loved me to my coworker. 
This is how the scenario went down. I dropped by her room to check something out and we were talking with some other coworkers as well. And I said something that made her laugh as I was leaving and after I was out the door in the hallway I heard her tell my coworker she loved me.
 I'm assuming she doesn't mean ""in love"" with me but more as in she loves being around me and she has a fun time with me. The thing is our work environment is really friendly and we complement each other (coworkers) all the time. Her complements feel different then the regular ""you look so cute in those pants"" or ""you look great with your hair up."" She will tell me how she likes certain things about my personality or how I talk. We are both women and I personally think it's a lot easier to compliment other women so maybe it's just that?

Am looking too much into this? Should I ask her out on a date or maybe to hang out outside of work???

I’ve been burnt out many times but never thought this before. I guess it’s because I’ve gone from a conservative authoritarian religious family to a place of true progressiveness on a lot of topics. 

I’ve come to realize that life’s tough. I don’t want to be with dead weight no matter how beautiful the woman. 

I want to be with someone like me:

Driven
Fit
Worldly 
Versatile
Adventurous
Creative

I guess I’ve finally broken that patriarchal programming. It was tough. 

I get that being a provider is sexy, but honestly sometimes I like to be the one provided for. Chased after. Etc.

Odd thoughts for a man to have? 

Yeah the old me would’ve said I was crazy. 

Leading is tough. It’s not fun to always be thinking of the ideas &amp; looking around the corner to anticipate the client needs or whatever. 

Perhaps it’s the natural magnetism of the feminine energy that attract the world to a person. But men have that energy too. 

Why can’t I lean into it &amp; attract someone who is all about me?

96,pd55yi,1630134293,"I (24M) just lost interest in the girl i liked, but it feels like i have lost someone","So to give some context, I met this girl because we are doing an internship in the same company. She looked cute and, since in the past I have suffered from the classic inaction in the beginning of a friendship, especially if its with someone from my group of friends, I asked her out for drinks in the first or second week after she arrived to the company. Now, the reason i suffer from said inaction is because I fear the consequences that can happen to the group of friends when a relationship doesn't work inside the group. These concerns were turned to a thousand in this case because she is a coworker and everyone says that is a bad idea, but I decided to do it anyways, first because my internship is ending in a couple of months and it is very unlikely either of us will stay in the company, so there would be no consequences for my career, but also because I just wanted to improve this part of myself and act on what I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

And so we go out and we talk and I find out a lot of interests of her that makes me even more attracted to her and she seems a generally nice girl. She is intelligent, she knows her movies and tv shows and she likes to study stuff other than her field. The only ""unattractive"" things about her is that she says she likes to party sometimes and that she smokes sometimes when she is out. I hate the smell of smoke and to kiss someone who just smoked, and although I enjoy partying from time to time, its more of a once every two weeks things, but this is not really unattractive because she says the ""sometimes"" so no big deal. I think it goes out well and in the end we say goodbye with a hug (a strong one from her). So I think to myself: great, I think she likes me, I just need to take things slow and steady and hang with her more out of the office (because I won't act flirty or get close to her while we are there, I would like to keep things separate, just as any bad feelings if we had an argument as a couple or break up would stay out of the office) so that an opportunity arises and I can kiss her. After the drinks I find her on Bumble probably because we were together and I swipe her right (never matched with her after that ahah). This gives me mixed feelings because on one side i get confirmation that she is looking for someone, but on the other hand my point at this time was precisely to get with someone other than an app user for a change. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, even in the office we are going for lunch almost every day, and I have never seen pupils so dilated as hers when we are having a conversation and making eye contact, she has very blue eyes so it is very evident. We had mentioned that we both like to cook and to eat and so i send her a message asking if she would be up for me to cook her a dish from my country ( on second thought this might have been too early to ask her for something like this since it implies she is coming over), and she replies she never says no to food. Great. So one week or so after that I send her another message asking if she is free on the weekend to do it, and she says that unfortunately she will have a friend visiting and she probably will not be available. I say, cool let me know when you can then. Then later that week I plan a night out with some interns and she says she is coming ( this would be the same day that I invited her for the dinner) but I think, thats ok she said she might not be available, not that she wouldn't, she probably just didn't want to risk canceling last minute. We go to this party with the group and we get some complimentary drinks, which I give to her since I dont drink, and some of those glow sticks, that everyone starts to put as a bracelet. She takes one and grabs my wrist and puts it on it. Maybe cool, maybe nothing. During the party she does one or two of those dance stand offs with one of the interns and for a bunch of time, since we are in a tight spot and the guys kind of need to keep our space from being invaded by other people, she stays next to him and since he is keeping the ""zone"" he has his arm around her back. Eventually she moves to my side and and she gives me some looks while dancing, but honestly with all the interns there Idd rather wait to be alone with her to kiss her ( might just be an excuse for my lack of balls at the time). Nothing of interest happens for the rest of the night other than another great hug when we say goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

And now last night we were having pre drinks and thats when it hit me. She doesn't just smoke sometimes, when she is out she is smoking like a chimney. Then she is having this conversation on how much easier it is for a guy to get someone in a club than for a girl to do it ( implying she tries hard but its difficult? she is pretty hot BTW) and other going out related stuff. Keep in mind that the plan was for pre drinks and then go to a club. But i noticed that whenever we are with the other interns her conversation topics are mostly about going out to clubs. And at this point i just lost my mood to go with her to the club and try something because I just realized she is a completely different person that I imagined. I realized she is this shallow person fantasizing about this ""luxury life"" and going out like there is no tomorrow. But I dont know how to concile this side of her with the intelligent and curious cute woman that I met at first. Instead of feeling ""good"" for losing interest and not being in the position of liking a coworker, I just feel empty and sad because it feels like I lost that other side of her.

I have struggled with acne most of my life, and it’s looking better but i have tons of scars. I’m doing my best to get rid of them and make my skin better

My skin isn’t the best at all, and it’s nowhere near it. It is healing but it’s still bad. 

I don’t wear make up because I don’t want to irritate my face. I also don’t know how.

Is acne a turn off for most guys? Should I worry about it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pd5bse/is_acne_gross/

99,pd5dms,1630135430,Is it normal?,I've learned recently that my man is using omegle right now. And when i asked him why he just said that he is copying his friends whose using omegle bcuz they're bored. It makes me upset that my man is talking to other girls like yes im a girl and i think it pretty normal to feel jealous or upset becuz my man is talking to other girsl. And i dont know what to do to remove this heavy feeling of mine. I cant even fall asleep bcuz of overthinking that one day he might leave me bcuz he found something else better.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pd5dms/is_it_normal/
