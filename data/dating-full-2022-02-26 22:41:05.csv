however, he only has me on snapchat and asked for it after the first date. he’s in a frat (red flag), but i get the vibe that maybe he’s a little insecure (hence only the snapchat add)? I’m honestly just confused by him. I told him after he asked to have a movie night recently that i’m not looking for casual hookups, and he said he isn’t either, and that he just wanted to see me before he left town for a week. he asks me how my day is doing etc but all over snapchat (pictures). I left him on open for a day and then he double snapped me, which makes me again think he likes me, but then after a couple of snaps he left me on open..

when he did come over we had this moment that again made me think he liked me (when we were cuddling) where we were just kinda smiling at each other with long eye contact. he also didn’t want to leave and wanted to sleep over but claimed it’s cause he’s lazy and didn’t want to walk back in the cold.

so i’m just confused. he says he doesn’t want casual but then he is kinda putting crappy effort. he also never compliments me, which i think is kinda weird. 

he’s not in town for the moment, so i’m kind of chalking up lack of effort to that for now..

should i back off?

I’m a senior in college who’s graduating this coming May, and I am now falling for a freshman girl who fell for me months ago, say, back in September/October. I had a no freshmen dating policy, but she grew on me, like really grew on me. 

I worked with her pretty frequently last semester, as we both taught ESL and for the same class. I knew she liked me, she kind of hinted to that on a few occasions, but I didn’t want to take that further because again: she was a freshman, and also due to the fact that I was also eyeing another girl at the time. 

I will admit that on a few occasions I spurned her texts, having not responded to her after twelve days after she texted me a question. I didn’t do so on purpose, I just never took her seriously enough to quickly respond to her texts. 

Over Christmas break and toward the beginning of January, I became more and more intrigued by her, and she never really lost interest, though I know that in some form or fashion I hurt her, and for that I am deeply regretful. I asked out the other girl and found out she was already talking to someone else, and I took forever to ask her out btw. This other girl who this entire statement is about was kind of my second option in a sense, and at the moment I just wanted to date.


Fast forward to now, me and this girl went on a coffee date together, and got to learn a lot about each other, and after that I became so much more intrigued by her and started to develop serous interest. However, I really didn’t know what to think after that date, and I called my friend who’s the boyfriend of her roommate, and he told me more about her and explained to me why I should want to date someone like her. She’s smart, independent, charismatic, caring, and so supportive. But I really didn’t realize these things until he told me, because she doesn’t like to really talk about herself. I became even more interested. 

A few days ago, we met up for the second time and watched a movie at my apartment, and we cuddled and bundled up, after I asked for permission of course. And then after that moment, I really began to like her, and began to fall for her. We talked a bit after the movie and then I walked her out. 

HERE’S WHERE I NEED HELP: 
1)I don’t want to break her heart. I don’t want to hurt her again. But that’s kind of looking like what will happen. After I graduate, I’m going far away from the city and state within which I currently live (like 17 hours) and don’t plan on returning. We’re currently on spring break and I miss her already, that’s how much she has grown on me. And because she knows that I’m leaving in two months, I can sense that she doesn’t want to become too emotionally connected to me. In that case, should this continue?

2) Are we really dating? I’m not so sure, because I may have accidentally closed the door to us using that term on the first date. But the other night said otherwise. How should I approach this? 

3) This is really my first true and physical relationship. I’m known on campus as being strictly business and as the senior class President, and have always been focused on academics. My entire life. She changed that. How do I navigate texting her and conversing with her from this point on, especially considering the time we have left?

We aren’t official though.. i haven’t shown my feelings to him because i feel rejected…

My mom's a teacher, but my dad has a very important position at a prestigious university. He has connections in the education community, and he's even had business meetings with politicians and even members of royalty. I grew up going to private schools, and traveled to Europe several times.

I met my boyfriend at my university. I met him at my on-campus job at a fast food restaurant. My parents said I should work a regular job so that way I get a few of what ordinary people live through on a daily basis. It's tough, but I met my boyfriend there.

My boyfriend is amazing, he's kind, compassionate, a great listener. He's really into anime, and we bonded over that. He lives with his mom and his sister. He sees his dad, but they don't have a great relationship. He actually has to get scholarship to come to the university. Not only is money not an issue for me to attend the school, but I actually dormed there, even though the university is only twenty minutes away from my house. Housing is actually more expensive than living there. There is a large difference in terms of economic status.

I'm ashamed, but I have really bigoted views of the lower class. I wish I could say different, but I can't. In high school, my best friend was a scholarship student. We got along so well, and one time, she couldn't even afford the already discounted tuition for the school, so my parents paid it for her. Not only did they pay for her, but they sponsored her. However, senior year, she got angry because one time I went to a dance with some girls she didn't like, and spread rumors about me. I lost all of my friends, and some of the rumors even trickled to the country club, so my family stopped getting invitations to parties and events. Because of her, my family's reputation has tanked.

Ever since then, I don't like associating with people of a lower class. I know the anger is very misdirected, but I feel like she shouldn't have gotten so angry. I admit, for the longest time, I thought that her parents should've never sent her to private school. It introduced her to a world that didn't belong to her. What made things worse was that not long after, I met a girl at school who was a total freeloader. She always wanted me to drive her around (she didn't have a car), and always wanted to spend time at my house (she never offered her own, and she always initiated the hangouts). For new friends I've made, I'm very selective. If they have lousy food preferences, like McDonalds or Taco Bell, I drop them. The few country club friends I do have tell me to only befriend those with a lot of money, power, or popularity.

Still, I love my boyfriend. He's the best. He's more loyal, kind, and smart than any other upper class guy that I've had any romantic interest in. I'm still working on my bigoted views, and I do my best to not comment when I see someone doing something I don't agree with. I don't know whether I should keep it a secret, or admit to him that I've thought these things in the past.

Tl;dr: in love with a guy who's does not have a lot of money. I grew up in the past having very bigoted views on the lower class because one time, I got taken advantage of socially by a friend",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162052,public,self,Ashamed to admit to my crush that I grew up with prejudices against the lower class,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t2aswn/ashamed_to_admit_to_my_crush_that_i_grew_up_with/,no_ads,0,,

I have read many posts here and I am amazed how many people are interested in and helping others. This is wholesome. So I guess I'll have to break it up and ask for your advice too.

So I recently started dating again for the first time (this time seriously) from my really toxic relationship two years ago. My previous relationship destroyed me mentally, and until now I am going to therapy. It took a lot of time to find myself valuable and ready to meet people again. I had a couple of meetings over the past two years, but most of the time the relationship lasted a week and well, we know... With the same conviction, I started writing with one guy (he's 20) and was positively surprised. And sooo after a few days of chat we met...  


Okay, so yeah. I really liked it. He assures me that he does too. How fucking cute and sweet he is. Even during sex, he kept asking me if everything was okay, if we could do it and not otherwise. He asked me if we could kiss. In general, he also said that he liked the fact of being younger and the fact that I was experienced in life. But as usual, as is the case with every typical guy I met, he said he was counting on nothing and I shouldn't count on anything either. That's how he answered me when I told him I didn't want it to be some ONS or a hook-up. Well, the answer is that neither is he, but also not the relationship. I love this safety valve....  We agreed that we would say it was over after the meeting if either of us felt that way. In order not to give hope. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite his assurances that he wants to meet more times, he small-talk with me, we don't talk practically. I already know that this is the end, that he is not interested and I am not surprised at all. But my friends assuring me that I give up too quickly, my therapist tells me that writing him down why he isn't talking to me is not encouraging (I didn't do it though I wanted to). And I don't know what to do, I want to let go again and give up like every other type I've been dating since my ex. But my friends tell me to wait, but for what? I'm the only one writing to him, isn't that a clear sign? From time to time he will ask me about me, texting me back with one word. Okay, our meeting took place a week ago, apparently it's short but I know it's not worth it. 

What I do know is that if it doesn't work out now, I'll be done dating as usual. I thought the therapy helped me but theory is one thing, in practice I know that the guys I date have reasons to ignore me. I know I sound like a twelve-year-old girl, but I'm a 25-year-old guy who has never been loved, especially by alcoholic parents.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what I am writing is pathetic, but please if you are going to write to me that you have wasted your time reading this then don't beat me up.

I mean There was a lady sitting next to me (at the bar) asking me questions like “is that your boyfriend or husband”, “I thought you 2 were on a date” we had been chatting with her as well that evening..hell even the chic he entertained made a comment as I was signing off on the check (paid literally out of the kindness of my heart bc he usually always pays for everything when we hang out) she said something along the lines of “I would never” so at the end of it all I took it as a form of disrespect. When I confronted him about it, he basically said I was tripping and that he didn’t even talk to them that long. I told him not to call me anymore!

She is the one that asked me out to a date, and we planned it to be this weekend.

I know height probably won't be a deal breaker to her, but I do think height is like a preference. Idk, I feel mixed up with what I should do but I'm pretty sure I'm over thinking it.

So I’ve had a thing for a girl in my work for quite a while now. It was one of those situations where she seemed so out of my league I kind of wrote it off at first in my head and just acted completely normal with her. Over time though I could tell there was a flirty vibe kind of growing, but I was sure it had to be in my head. We’d tease each other constantly, find excuses to be around each other, all that stuff. Eventually she ended up messaging me outside of work and we got talking even more and she kind of half jokingly suggested we should grab a drink together some time to help with work-related stress. This was a couple of months ago and at first I kind of just laughed it off and didn’t take it seriously because I was nervous and had no idea what to do or say. For a while I thought I’d blew it with her. After that we hadn’t messaged as much and for various reasons we didn’t have any shifts together, so again I just wrote it off. I was still convinced at this point she was just joking even if there was a vibe between us, and that she’d never actually be interested.

Eventually we were on shift together again more and more and I’d been nervous about seeing her again in case things had got awkward between us, but they weren’t at all. The flirty vibe was back and seemed to be growing; now it’s kind of escalated to a lot of physical touch and stuff, her finding excuses to hug me or hold my hand a couple of times, sexual jokes, etc. It was at this point I realised I was being insecure and it seemed like she actually felt the same. The other day she messaged me again ‘joking’ about the idea of us grabbing a drink together, and I decided to say fuck it and ask her for real if she wants to go out sometime.

So basically when we both have days off in like a week from now we’ve arranged to go out one night. I’m looking forward to it because I always have a lot of fun around her, and it’s obvious there’s something there, but I am so nervous. I’m 23 and never been on a date, never had sex, never done anything remotely romantic like this and I’m completely clueless. I feel like if there’s any remote chance to ‘make a move’ I’ll have zero idea what I’m doing and mess it up and make her think I’m not interested, which I’ve clearly almost managed to do already.

I just don’t know the first thing about dating and at this age that’s going to be a huge turn off. She’s had a string of exes and dating experience and while they’ve all been pretty shitty, but I’m sure she would expect to have had some level of experience at this point. She’s an incredibly kind and understanding person so I don’t think she’s going to judge any missteps too much, but I feel like I’m completely under equipped here and that I’ll be way too caught up in my own head.

So, any advice? I feel like some silly little boy here lmfao, I never expected someone I like this much to be interested in dating me and it’s like I refuse to believe it’s real, but I’m determined to stop hiding away and to make the most of this.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162065,public,self,I’m 23 and I have my first ever date next week with a girl I’m really into; I’m absolutely terrified and have no idea what I’m doing,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t2ccvc/im_23_and_i_have_my_first_ever_date_next_week/,no_ads,0,,

Usually I'd know they weren't interested, but I'm genuinely confused. Sorry it's long. I don't post ever. 

Him(27m) and I(29f) matched on tinder end of January. We went on a first date January 30th, after the date he asks what I'm doing for new years eve since his plans were canceled. So I jokingly invite him to my families NYE party. He comes. 

We then got covid and we were together 24/7 from January 1st to 9th. I meet his friends on a night out week 2. This weekend he told me he was giving me all his attention. 
Then after week 3 he calls me drunk freaking out about how he wants to move states and doesn't wanna lead me on. He states he's not looking for anything exclusive because he's moving. I ask to pause the talk and we hangout 4 times that week. Following weekend we have the best day ever and he says we were making love blah blah. Stated he's never made love before. 

Following day he asks to hang that night and make dinner. Then right before our date calls and cancels because he had a headache. Then my friend sees him on a date. He calls me after for 4 hours and come to find out he had sex w/ someone the night before he said we were making love. I end things a few days later. He calls me and we talk for 4 more hours of him asking me to keep seeing him and how he likes me. Asks me to do a first date again. We hangout every day for the rest of that week. (Yep, I'm weak) 

The following weekend his friends are in town and didn't make time for me so I was annoyed so he says it's best we break up. So we don't talk for a week. He then calls me the following sunday and asks to be his wife for the day. We have a whole fun day together. I felt sorta used and think we are done. He calls me the next Wednesday and tells me he values me as a person and is sorry this is happening. He states he's in a changing part of his life and sorry we met now.. he mentioned he is scared to open up because the last girl he did broke his heart.

This week we hungout Monday to Friday every night together. Friday he's out with friends and calls me at 1am drunk and asks me to come meet his friends and a ride home. I get there and he goes ""they were asking about uou and I told them I've never felt this strong of a connection with anyone before"" I say this is bullshit so he grabs his friend to tell me what he was saying about me... 

I want to mention that he initiates almost every conversation/hangout since I tried to end things. So, what is happening... I've told him 100% my intentions. Why fight for something you don't want? I realize I'm letting this happen to me, don't worry. 

Should I end it and if he steps up he steps up?

I’ve asked a lot of girls out, yet I’ve gotten every answer except yes OR no.

I’ve had terrible situations like a girl who was supposed to be my homecoming date dumping me last minute and going with someone else, grinding on him for a TikTok video and getting 100K views, a girl who I made plans with and she didn’t show up and never talked to me afterwards, and everything in between, which is a lot for me being a sophomore in highschool. The situation that kinda ruined my drive for relationships is possibly the most disappointing one.

I met this girl from my school on Instagram. I wanted to show her some music stuff, so we FaceTimed. We ended up having a super similar vibe and I started talking to her way more. I asked her to meet me at school a few days afterwards. She didn’t text me at all that day so I didn’t expect her to show up because girls usually don’t even if I remind them lmao. BUT, she showed up and told me the reason she didn’t text is because she left her phone at home. This is the first time I’ve been able to depend on someone to remember our plans.

We then hung out later, going to both a pizza place and a frozen yogurt place. We hung out for a couple of hours. This is when I knew she was who I wanted. We FaceTimed a lot, we talked a lot, and I was ready to tell her I’m interested. I told her I was interested in her, she dodged my question. Dodged the absolute HELL out of my question. It is shocking how bad she dodged that shit. Even my friends said it was like really bad. 

This has ruined my drive. I don’t have a desire to ask anyone out. I have interest in this girl in my choir class, but I’m never gonna do anything about it lmfao.

Came back to public school in middle school, and then left high school again for Muslim school. I was never able to form deep relationships with anyone, and am seeing the consequences now. Oh I also happened to take a couple of semesters off college because I was diagnosed with cancer and that also ruined things 

Also, I hate that I have a Muslim name because I feel like people ostracize me for being Muslim even thought I’m not really. Even on dating apps, my name screams “Muslim” I hate it so much. 

Basically, I just want to say I fucking hate being an immigrant. I hate religion. I am never going to be in a good relationship. So sad.

First of all, I am going to give you some context about me, ans this is honestly how I feel about myself.
 
I am definitely not the most charismatic, the most wealthy or handsome dude, but to be honest, I feel like at this stage of my life, I’m doing pretty great in a lot of ways : 
- I’ve been working out since a few months.
- I’ve been working on personal projects that may bring me a good amount of money.
- I’ve been going to impro class to improve my social skills and be more comfortable (even tho I’m not really shy)
- I take care of myself, physically and mentally, I know for sure that I am attractive and that I am definitely happy.
 
But when it comes to dating, well… Something is wrong, there is something in my behaviour that I am not doing right, and I can feel that there is some kind of mental block somewhere.
 
To be honest with you (this is kind of shameful but anyways), I’ve looked up on youtube ""Why do I don’t have a girlfriend"", and I started watching when something hit me :
- First of all, I already knew all these advice because it’s always the same
- And more important, these videos are always about this ""Talking stage"", not before it or how to even get to this talking stage, and this is a key element I think.
 
And here is my problem, I think. It’s been since a few years that I haven’t really talked with a girl, that I haven’t spent time at night on my phone with her just talking (a real true deep conversation, the kind of one where you feel this connection), and this is the funny thing in the story : I’ve done it before, and now I can’t, seems like I’ve downgraded on this point.

I already tried dating apps, but didn’t like it since it wasn’t « natural » but very fake, I tried cold approaching in the street, it worked a few times, even got to go on a few dates, but it stopped here, it wasn’t really natural as well…

I know it can be hard for someone to help a total stranger on internet, especially when it comes to these kind of topics, but if someone has ever been in the same place where I am and found a way out, please tell me.

I (33F) matched with someone (30M) who really got my attention and we hit it off, chatting alot right away. We have alot in common and he's showed interest in me and my life - and is super clingy. And now I'm turned off.

He's admitted he gets attached easy and is clingy, and needs validation and attention. After the first day of texting 4 hours straight he said he was simping for me already. I may have lead him on when I didn't mean to (nsfw joking, I have a dirty sense of humor) but I made it clear I'm not looking for a relationship. I'm just looking to get to know someone, to hangout with as friends and see where it went. He agreed, he's working on himself right now and going to therapy. I can see he has things to learn about himself and ways to grow. But on our first date after 7 days of texting, he's trying to hold my hand, hug alot, kissed my forehead once. I told him I'm wary of touch and he did ask after the fact if that was ok to hold my hand. I was meh, it didn't feel good or bad. I won't let that happen again though, it was too much for me.

14 days after first meeting, no second date yet, now he's admitted he's imagining us as partners already. He's mentioned things he'd like to do with me, traveling, activities, some personal nsfw directed jokes. One actually said to me infront of his friends. His best friends all know about me already (met them on discord, we were all in a voice chat). He wants physical affection so bad, and writes attempts of that in text, but it makes me uncomfortable even thinking about giving so much as an arm touch. We had talked about meeting again this coming week but now I don't want to. The neediness is offputting.

What are your thoughts? I would like him if it weren't for this clingy 'desperation' I'm seeing. My initial interest is all but gone, and I'd rather just be his friend and help him figure himself out... but if he's this attached already, I might need to cut him completely.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162146,public,self,What is too clingy?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t2jf79/what_is_too_clingy/,no_ads,0,49223cde-abc9-11e9-b518-0ee41f1cd37e,dark

I have invited her out to dinner on Friday and I have a plan to tell her all about how I feel and why I haven’t told her before.

But I wonder if anyone here has tried telling someone who probably doesn’t reciprocate your feelings how you feel? If so, how did you go about it? In particular, I wonder if using the word ‘love’ is too much? Keep in mind, we’ve been close for about 4 years so it’s not like I’m pulling a Ted Mosby.

I realize that we may not be able to be friends after this - but that’s kind of part of the point. I unfortunately don’t think think our friendship is sustainable anyways. If I were to not tell her, I know we’d stop being friends once she got a boyfriend because that’d be too hard for me.
