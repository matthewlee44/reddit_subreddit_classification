3,pzohmh,1633149592,Long term companionship vs living alone together,"So, after coming out of a relationship of just over a year, I finally remembered what I actually wanted all along - which was someone to love, but not build a life with (I've got the house, and the kids, so there isn't much more building to do!).

I'm thinking more about what it is that I actually want from someone, which is a monogamous long term companion type situation. Where you ask them if they want to join you on things that you are doing, but without the expectation from either of you that they are there. Someone who has respect for you, and would be the first person to show up if something was going sideways.
But still someone that respects the fact that my kids come first, and I'm happy to snuggle up on the couch but I may ask you to leave before the kids get up in the morning.

And I'm now wondering - is there such a thing?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pzohmh/long_term_companionship_vs_living_alone_together/

I went on three dates with the same person just to see if spark would develop — spark never developed, so I declined a fourth.  Now I’m tempted to just end after the the first date with new people who are interested but I am lukewarm about so as not to waste time.

We didn’t “announce it” on facebook or publicly but those closest to us of course knew.  Now I am starting to see a guy who i’ve been friends with for over 15 years who is also out of a relationship around the same time. There is a definite shock value when people see us out together (just lunch for now) as they expect us to be with other people. It can be awkward!

15,q0bhh4,1633238886,"Did I meet my ""Delilah""? Is there any such thing?","TLDR; I met a fantastic woman last night, gave her my number, now ALL my powers are GONE!

So, I (54M) played a local gig last night. We play hard rock, party rock, and 80's hair metal. The entire first set was flawless on all of our parts. We had a killer groove that flowed the entire time. It was SO MUCH FUN! You couldn't have paid us to miss a beat, or send an errant note. The crowd was incredible! Dancing, drinking, and singing out loud! The stage was seriously hot, so I went outside after the set to cool off with a drink. There was a mixed group of people at one table on the patio that were all very kind in their congratulations and appreciation for the music. ""Barbara"" was one of them. She quickly disengaged from the conversation she was having with her friends, turned her chair to me a bit, and we proceeded making small talk for the few minutes I had available before starting the second set. I dragged out the banter as long as I could, but I had to get back on stage. She was leaving with her friends soon, so we exchanged phone numbers.... then she gave me a wholly unexpected hug and a little kiss on my (still sweaty) cheek. 

Holy CRAP! This doesnt happen to me! I don't meet kind, jovial, well dressed, well spoken women, do I? I mean, maybe she had ""wine goggles"" on or something? Who knows. Either way I was on cloud 9 and ready to be ""Jonny Q Rockstar"" for the next set!!

We finally started the second set with a swing-rock instrumental to get the crowd back in the mood again. Sadly, I accidently grabbed the wrong guitar for this song. It was set in a completely different tuning from the one I needed. I got through the song, but not without a ton of bad notes. I was so messed up, the rest of the band was looking at me like I'd grown an extra nose! First song done, I scramble to get the correct guitar. An OLD Ibanez RG that I've had since I graduated high school. I couldn't find it.......it was gone. I figured out later that it had been stolen between sets! Anyway, the rest of the set went ok, but it never caught up to the fever of the first set. The police took my report for the guitar when we were wrapping up. I went home sad about my RG, but ELATED about meeting ""Barbara"".

She called me about 11a.m. this morning. We had a great conversation, albeit kind of light. Just getting to know you kind of stuff. We made plans to talk during the week, but no dates or anything like that. After hanging up, I started working on a few new song that the band wants to do. Most of them easy to play, but today? I couldn't carry a note if it had a handle attached to it! Everthing I played was off time and my technique was non-existent. Imagine a toddler the first time they try to feed themselves...... it was THAT messy! Ok, forget it. Music just isn't giing to happen today. I had to get to work soon anyway.

Work turned out to be a shit-show. I deliver pizza on the weekends. Yes, I'm THAT guy. I really do enjoy it though, and the extra $400/week doesn't hurt anything. Tonight? I couldn't get anything right! I brought pizzas to wrong houses, I forgot salads, I couldnt make change for customers when I needed to, and the tips were terrible! It was one of the worst nights I've had delivering in years! I drove home very carefully, not knowing if I still had the ability to drive, and sat my ass down to start typing this. I'm afraid to do or touch anything!

So what say you? Have I met my ""Delilah""? Have you ever met someone that turned you around so much that you thought you were crazy?

I will be working in my office as the the janitor just begins to make his rounds. He always stops by my place first, and empties the trash, says a few things (casual conversation) and then leaves. Sometimes, I am leaving as he empties the trash. He is good at being in the same proximity as me. He could avoid me and start at another area of the building to do work. 

One time he offered to give me his phone number in case I got locked out of the building and didn't have a key. I was hesitant and said I would think about it because I rarely give my phone number out. This isn't something a janitor usually says either.

A week later he said he was being transfered soon to another department. He said he would miss seeing me and to keep in touch. In my mind I wondered just how I would keep in touch? Again, I didn't say anything other than I was sorry he was leaving and that I would miss him. Was he trying to say he liked me? Or is this his way of making conversation?

He seems to be very sweet yet awkward and clueless, so I am getting mixed signals.

I could use some advice.

This is a post for anyone who has followed my other posts / trials and tribulations of my relationship. So basically, despite people telling me it was a road to nowhere, I pushed on forward hoping we could make a go of it. Skip to now. We’ve not had sex for 2 weeks (is that a lot for you guys?) and last night he couldn’t sleep. This morning, he was like I’m worried about my current job, the job they’ve offered me in the UK and us (so basically everything). It just keeps obsessing and obsessing and it’s killing all passion and joy in life. As I said in my previous posts, his entire family basically see life as one problem after another (yesterday his sister wouldn’t come to us for lunch because she couldn’t be bothered getting ready and walking here – a 15 min walk). He also keeps saying how I’m complicating his life by encouraging him to move to the UK, and that his life was so simple before meeting me (yes – at 42 he’d never had a partner and his mum did his cooking, cleaning, ironing, etc., so it was definitely a simple life for him).

Is there literally any way of doing something positive here for the relationship?

You can be “Fuck Yes” about seeing someone again because you think there’s something there. You can be “Fuck Yes” about giving things a few months to pan out and see if you can fix the problems in the relationship. You can be “Fuck Yes” about sticking it out in an unhappy relationship because you can see the long-term potential in the future.""

42,q1noel,1633409356,"Love, but not on the same page. Advice greatly appreciated","I’ve (40sF) been dating a man (40sM) for a little over a year. We met during quarantine and spent nearly 100% of our time together for 12months- including major holidays since we couldn’t be w our families during that time. We became very close and our relationship became quite serious quickly by anyones standards. He was out of work (because of COVID restrictions) and I was working remotely and that’s all we knew for a long time during the beginning of our relationship. Then the world started to open up again and things changed a bit. He has a job in entertainment (that despite his talent, barely pays) and his work hours are exclusively at night- that is, when the seldom work opportunities do actually arise. He bartends on the side occasionally for extra income. I have a community based public service job that occurs during regular daily business hours and is salaried. He’s a really smart man, and capable of so much, but he lacks motivation. He admittedly loves not working. He also is fiercely independent in his lifestyle  and does not like to answer to anyone. He doesn’t like to feel as though he needs to ‘check in’ or ask if it works w anything I may have planned before making social plans. While it hasn’t always been the case, we were able to move beyond some early transgressions in our relationship and things have developed to a point where I can safely say that I do trust him to be faithful romantically. Thing is, while I love his companionship, I am sometimes made to feel as though I’m an afterthought- he does what he wants and expects that I’ll be there when he’s available. My fault for so often acquiescing. But now that the holidays creeping up are around the corner, and I have a friends wedding that we’ve been invited to the day after Thanksgiving, I brought up the topic of how he’d like to spend the holiday this year.  His family lives about 8hrs by car away, mine family is all within 2.5. That being said, I’ve spent a lot of my vacation time with his family and -very much enjoy, appreciate, and truly care for them. Still, in asking about his thoughts on thanksgiving so I could RSVP to the wedding invite, he was quick to say that he was planning to go be with his mom. I felt let down that he wasn’t even in the frame of mind, after dating for a year, to have a conversation about what we’d each like to see happen and find a way to try to work both of our interests into the equation. I asked if he would consider inviting his mother to spend the holiday here with us so we could accommodate both our families and also be able to attend my friends wedding. He snapped at me saying that money isn’t a nonissue for everyone like it is for me. To be clear, I do not make that much money. Enough to get by, and I saved until I was able to buy a small 1bdrm place (which I make mortgage payments on and will for another 25 years), but I’m not rich at all and live paycheck to paycheck with other debts I do my best to juggle too. I try to be forward thinking and am want to make a good life for myself down the road. I get frustrated because as much as I like to sleep in, not working isn’t an option for me at this point. I don’t want to be made to feel as though I’m being unfair by wanting to be considered when making holiday plans with our families. It feels really crappy to know that he could easily take or leave me being a part of big celebrations with our loved ones. I have started seeing a therapist because there’s a part of me that knows I deserve to be treated with more respect than I am, but I struggle with having the courage to leave because I do truly love him for all of the amazing qualities he has and adore his companionship. When he is present, he’s wonderful. But when it’s a matter of his interests or mine at stake, I’m usually quickly reminded that mine are unimportant and second tier. Recently, he said that he is going through a midlife crisis. It makes me feel sad to know he is struggling. I have tried to encourage and support him in offering ideas and willing to seek out resources to get the ball rolling, but there hasn’t been any real action on his end. In writing this, I hear myself and know the advice I’d prob give myself if I were my friend. But how, if you love someone and enjoy someone’s company so much, do you find the strength to walk away? He’s not a bad guy, I love being around him, most days he makes me very happy, and I believe I can trust him.  So I guess my question is, all of this in consideration, am I being greedy to want for more? Or how do you end a relationship that isn’t bad, but also probably isn’t going anywhere?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/q1noel/love_but_not_on_the_same_page_advice_greatly/

He’s a business owner like me. Conversation was super easy.  I gave him my card at the end of the flight and we’ve been texting ever since. 

A few days ago he stated he was coming to my hometown this weekend and hoping to be able to see me. He said he had family in town. I have since learned that yes he has a cousin in town but his real reason for coming is… me. 

It’s all insanely exciting! Meeting someone in real life and they go out of their way to pursue you. Not to mention we seem to have a good connection. 

Now here’s the part where I seek advice.  I already told him he needs to get a hotel and he can’t stay with me.  Anyone has experiences (good or bad) of when someone flew into town to see you but you didn’t know each other super well?  How much time did you offer to spend with them? How heavy was the pressure to be intimate? What do you do if you decide you aren’t interested?

48,q1w9bk,1633440040,Not looking forward to time together,"For background, my marriage ended just under a year ago. My divorce was pretty amicable and drama free, so I’m not feeling any real trauma from that.

I’ve been pretty fortunate since I started dating and that I’ve met some really awesome people and have had a really good time with some of them. But, I’m finding a recurring pattern and it’s happening to me today, again. When I’m about to see somebody that I’m dating, I dread it. I spend the entire day leading up to it thinking about all the other things I can do with that time and how much I’d rather just be by myself.
 
I think part of it is that I have majority custody so I only have two nights free to myself most weeks. (I am pretty militant about keeping one to myself- which is actually the reason that my first short term relationship ended. He wanted more time than I would give him.) But, the man that I’ve been seeing for about a month is coming over this afternoon for a few hours and all I can think about is how much I would rather he just didn’t come. I keep thinking about calling him and breaking it off with him just so I can have my afternoon to myself. 
 
To be clear, he’s delightful. It might be the best sex I’ve ever had in my life. When we spend time together, I really enjoy his company. He kind, sweet, and really likes me. I have no interest in hurting this person. But, I’m wondering if this feeling that I constantly have that I really just cannot be bothered spending time with dating partners is indicative of not being ready to date at all? Or, if there’s something just wrong with me?
 
Has anyone else had this feeling- that even when you’re dating somebody that you really enjoy it’s just kind of a pain in the ass you’d rather not be bothered with?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/q1w9bk/not_looking_forward_to_time_together/

We’ve been talking for about 4 months, nothing really serious, more just fun and that’s probably all it will ever be with him.

It’s not a family wedding so there won’t be cousins and aunts and uncles to meet although my sister will be there (but he kind of jokes that he wants to meet her). Thoughts?

Edit - I’m not worried about what other people will think.

55,q2758n,1633472615,Why do 85 percent of my dates not turn into second ones?,"I was thinking about this. I almost always ask for a second date if I’m at least somewhat attracted to her and there’s no massive deal breaker. Usually my mindset is “yeah she’s cute and seems nice. I’m down to go out again!” I’m super aware that most people are nervous on the first date, so it usually takes awhile to get to know them anyways.


It would be unfair for me to judge anyones personality just chatting with them for an hour over a beer.

But most of the time when I ask if they want to go out again, I get ghosted or a cliche “no spark / chemistry.” It’s like if they don’t immediately have fireworks with a stranger, it’s a next from them.

I get the impression that people are super excited going into a first date thinking “well maybe he’s handsome, rich, our personalities will perfectly match,” but then when the day of the date gets here, they quickly realize that it’s just a human in front of them and not a greek God, so they next and go back to swipping.

I’ve seen the same faces on dating apps in my area for about a year now. I’ve went out once with some of them.

So my question is: why don’t people give each other more time to mesh? Like what’s the point of a lot of first dates?

It’s weirdly frustrating. I went out with a woman last weekend who didn’t want a second date. The weird thing is, I’m willing to bet we could have been a potential compatible couple if she would have just gave it a go.

Most of these issues revolve around my inability to select women that I actually want to date, and extreme feelings of nervousness and inadequacy around dates and dating, to the point that it just isn't fun. These issues, and the fact that I am over my ex but still very angry and hurt by how she broke things off with me, have made me realize that I'm just not ready to date again for a little while. I want to take some time off (maybe the rest of the year, maybe longer) to figure things out.

So I'm interested in people's experiences, but especially the men, of what you did to rediscover, improve, whatever yourself so that when you did go back to dating, you felt more comfortable and things went more smoothly.

68,q2yjtj,1633570771,"Here is to the people who take (appropriate, not creepy) risks!","2.5 years ago I was in Ft. Lauderdale for a family cruise. As the sun was setting the night before we sailed away, I took a walk along the beach. Suddenly, an attractive woman approached me and asked me a question about an interesting looking ship in the distance. 

“I don’t know,” I said to her question. “I’m not from here.”

“Me either!” She said. “I’m from Alabama! But I was so curious about that ship!”

She walked and talked with me for a bit, and I learned that she was an insurance agent (she owned an agency), recently divorced, had grown kids and was my age (almost 50). She liked that I knew something about Alabama football, was very charming, and to be honest very attractive in every way. 

“Well, it has been great talking with you, but I need to get back to my family,” I said.  

“Oh,” she said. “So what’s your story? Are you single? Would you be interested in sharing information?”

I was in fact married, and unfailingly monogamous, and so not available, and even if I had suspeted (I didn’t) at the time that my wife would leave me in less than a year (as she did), I still wouldn’t have exchanged information since I wouldn’t have thought it appropriate while still married. (not separated).

“Oh,” she said when I told her I was married, and I could tell she felt a little awkward/embarrassed. Which is sad, because if I had been single I would have definitely gone on a date with her that night and have been interested in staying in touch, and plus I was honored/flattered that she was interested in me. As I said, she was both charming and nice (most important) and beautiful (less important). 

I am posting all this here because I’ve noticed posts over the past month or two where women ask about asking men out, including random strangers. And I just think it is so great when people put themselves on the line and take a chance. And for whatever reason I thought about that 50-something woman from Alabama who took a chance but then felt rejected — I hope she continued to put herself out there and met someone wonderful. 

I always encourage other people to take chances. But if I am honest with myself I think the last time I asked a someone out on a date (other than on OLD) was when I was 21 years old since I hate to risk rejection and also worry about being a male creep. So I really admire the people who make themselves vulnerable, and who don’t let rejection stop them.

To the woman from Alabama, whereever you are, thank you. I hope you found happiness.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/q2yjtj/here_is_to_the_people_who_take_appropriate_not/

We went out earlier this week for 1 drink that went well and he asked me out for dinner for tonight. He asked and chose the restaurant. I asked him if he wanted to meet for a drink beforehand. I paid the check at the bar because I asked him out. When the check came at dinner, it sat for awhile until he eventually picked it up and said something like: Oh, we did alright. As a courtesy, I asked if he wanted to split it only because it sat for awhile and he made a comment when he picked it up. He said sure, so we split it. Even though it was only a second date that he asked me on and chose the restaurant. I figured that since we’re over 40, by now he should theoretically know that since he asked for the date and that me offering to split it was merely a courtesy that he should pay. However, I’m wondering if because of feminism and confusion around gender roles if he didn’t realize that it was merely a gesture. To be clear: I do not at all feel that a man has to pay for the date every time. I do however think that if it’s early on in dating and you asked for the date, you should be ready to pay. Also, I already paid when we met for the drink. I suppose I could see if he asks me out again and next time not say anything when the check comes. If he then asks to split it, I know he’s not going to be someone who’s into courting at the early stages of dating.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/q2zmex/splitting_the_check_on_a_2nd_date/

I go over to his, we chat for hours and then sex, all very pleasant. About a month ago I ask if we were physically exclusive, he gave me some lines about he doesn’t like to answer those types of questions but generally that’s how he is because he doesn’t like to mix energies. I told him I’m always exclusive but at my age I’m looking for a serious relationship as I want a family, so even though I wouldn’t get physical with someone else without breaking things off but I would need to date if he wasn’t looking for anything more. 
So I thought brilliant, we’ve got all that sorted, I’m not expecting anything more from him but we are both physically exclusive.
Last week we were talking about his past relationships and he tells me he just ended something with a girl he’s been sleeping with for a year because she got attached and wanted more. I had to ask when did you see her last and did you sleep with her. He tells me it would’ve been a month after we started seeing each other and he did sleep with her.
He got very upset that he should be answering any such question and it really didn’t have any bearing on me, I said well the fact that you said something to me and done the exact opposite (lied), he insisted it really had nothing to do with me and I said at the very least the sti bit was reason enough for an honest answer.
He kept insisting he didn’t say anything about being physically exclusive and that “this is what women do” get attached abs have issues. I ended the conversation with its cool I just wanted to know what the parameters of our set up was, his trying to be all airy fairy with why should I need him to tell me, I should be free to go do what I want.

Don't throw away a potential good lasting relationship just because things got a little hard.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/q3qhs4/its_easy_to_give_up_but_is_that_what_you_really/

93,q3uc7u,1633685710,Perspective please!,"Well, I’m now single, after a long time (13 years)  in a bad relationship. I haven’t yet dabbled in OLD, as I just want to enjoy singlehood a bit. Now here’s the quagmire, I’m 20kg over my goal weight, but I feel sexy as hell. When I look in the mirror I dont really like what I see, thick thighs, round figure but in myself I feel sexy. I’ve decided to lose the 20kg but before I do I want to have a night or two of passionate lovemaking with someone. I want to be touched tenderly and feel loved. I want to be woken up at 3am with kisses and groans of ‘I want you….’ I just feel like I’ve got this energy that I need to release before embarking on my weight loss journey. I know my self worth. I just needed to put this out there to see if what I’m feeling is normal or should I seek therapy of some sort? Excuse my English. Thank you.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/q3uc7u/perspective_please/
