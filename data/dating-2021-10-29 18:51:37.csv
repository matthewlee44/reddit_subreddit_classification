0,qipl0p,1635551945,Should I ask for clarity or is it wise not to?,"I go to college with this girl whom I've been talking to and hanging out with for over a month now. I've told her before multiple times that I liked her, I've even called her cute multiple times and done some minor flirting. Very recently I asked her if she'd like to go out on a date to which she replied she was not interested in making it a date and only wanted to keep having hangouts. However when she was saying this she kept reinforcing that, ""I don't like to say no"" to which I would tell her to please turn me down if she genuinely doesn't want to so I don't get led on. I wanted a clearer answer from her so afterwards I asked her if she was at all interested in me as more than just a friend, as she had not ever turned me down or told me she didn't approve of the flirtatious comments. But she only answers me with, ""I'm not sure, it takes me a while to get used to people."" I don't want to assume that she's either trying to be nice or that she could be honest about it, but I'm not sure if it's worth bringing it up to her. Personally I'd appreciate a clear answer of a direct ""yes or no"" so I know if I should keep putting in effort or to give up entirely, however I don't want to seem repetitive/nagging or push her away. I am also still upset about it as this was very recent, and I do like her a lot so I am taking time to try to get over it so we can hopefully stay friends as she means a lot to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qipl0p/should_i_ask_for_clarity_or_is_it_wise_not_to/

I think guys are absolutely ridiculous. /r/dating/comments/qigo37/behavior_of_guys_toward_short_women/?sort=new I just read this and I'm surprised that so many men want short women to weigh 110 lbs or less. I'm a short woman at 5'0 and I weigh 140 lbs and even guys have told me I'm too have and that if I was 40 lbs lighter then I would be more attractive like wtf? A lot of you guys even go as far as cherry picking with these strange preferences. If a woman is 5'3+ she's too tall to be ""short"" if a short woman is 5 - 10 lbs heavier than what is ""petite"" she's not attractive but her height is? What kind of weird crap is this

Some guy went even far as to say this wth.. 

The entire ""spinner"" idea, is that she is small enough to spin, and to physically pick-up, etc.

Just like a cheerleading ""flyer"" (the small girls who are tossed into the air), there are weight/size limits to that ""ideal"" look.

(That is not to say that we only go for short women; but there is a certain appeal to that height range, e.g. because of the body type/small size).

In my experience, the attractive criteria that men prefer for ""short"" (small) women, is usually: 4""11"" to 5'2"" • Size 00 to 2 • Less than 120lbs (usually 100-110lbs) • (often, but not always) C to DDD in bra cup size.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qipsqe/being_s_short_woman_that_isnt_petite/
3,qipuqt,1635552874,Gift Giving Love Language,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for over a year now and we have both learned a lot. We commonly have conversations about how we feel- if we are both happy in the relationship, what one person could be doing better etc. About a month ago I suggested we take the love language quiz again. I told him that we both should be honest, and it’s ok for needs to change. 

Finally, when we both completed the quiz, I saw that his main love language was over 60% Gift Giving! I said, “How did I not know this!” He responded by saying, “I didn’t want to be selfish.” 

It’s so sad that so many people ignore this love language to avoid being “selfish.” I totally understand why, but I don’t think it’s selfish at all! Gift giving doesn’t have to be expensive. It doesn’t mean that if I want my significant other to love me, I have to buy him expensive things. It means, when I’m in a cafe I get him his favourite muffin to show him I’m thinking about him. A muffin where I am is what, $3? The smile on his face after I give it to him is worth thousands to me. It’s the small things that matter.

41,qitojk,1635567053,is flirting considered cheating?," 

sorry this is kinda long. I'm 23 F and I have been dating my bf 26 M for 5 months now. Basically, I have a good friend who I know from school, who's engaged, and we will talk here and there, mostly about his relationship problems or I will ask him advice about mine. I never had any sexual attraction to this guy, and never had feelings for him. He is definitely a good looking guy, but I only see him as a friend. He also knows how much I love my bf because I talk about him a lot. Anyways, a while back, we were texting and he said if we dated we would have great makeup sex, and as a joke I said ""it would be immaculate."" To be honest, I thought nothing of it at the time and forget I had even said that, until recently I was rereading our texts and stumbled upon me saying that, and felt disgusted. I really have no bad intentions and have never fantasized about this guy in a sexual way. I literally think of him as a brother. When we talk, we have a sarcastic, playful dynamic. When I sent that text, my bf and I had only been dating for about a month and a half. I had only known him for a month before he asked me to be his gf. After he asked me, we did long distance for two months, so when I sent that text, it was when we were doing long distance, so in my defence, we were pretty fresh into dating, and it was difficult to talk/get to know each other during that time because he was busy a lot of the time, and we were in different time zones, and we were still getting to know each other, even though I know its not an excuse. I love my bf so much, and I would literally do anything for him. He's the only person I've dated that I can see a future with. I have never cared so much for someone before, and I feel so guilty for sending that text. Again, I know this is not an excuse, but obviously I love him a lot more now than I did when we first started dating, when I sent that stupid text, and i would never do something like this again. Is what I did considered cheating? This whole thing is causing me so much anxiety and guilt. I don't want to tell him because it will cause problems that aren't there, and I will hurt him for no reason and he will lose all trust in me. I have actually told him about this friend, and I even mentioned that he had sent me a picture in his boxers because I think he was showing his new haircut...I don't remember exactly it was a while ago, and it made me uncomfortable, but my boyfriend seemed to be unbothered by it and thought it was funny. Please no mean comments, i'm just here for advice.

42,qitrn5,1635567379,What does this mean?,"Background: a guy I know started flirting with me a few months ago, and I finally took notice.  I thought we had a connection (hey, I could be wrong), and there was a late Thursday night that he asked me what I was doing the next day.  I said I was busy, which was true, and he knew what I was doing (volunteering), but I think he may have thought I wasn’t interested in dating him.  I’m definitely interested, but I’ve been seriously hurt in the past, so I was thinking to play things cool inside my own head.

So he went out with someone else.

Fast forward a few weeks.  Saw him out last Saturday, and wanted to spend time with him, nothing formal.  He left, and texted me when he got home, apologizing for leaving.  No need to apologize, I told him.  He then asked if he could vent.  Sure.  Sigh.  I’m assuming at this point I’m friendzoned.

For a few hours we texted off and on.  He told me about his mistakes, his ex-wife, his ex-girlfriend who was drunk-texting him that night, the woman he went out with after me…

The next day I was out and had a couple of beers, and when I’m buzzed/drunk I tend to boost people up.  I sent a simple text that said please, hold out for someone who thinks you’re special. 

I wouldn’t be confused if he was silent, or if he replied with a simple thanks.

His response?  “I’m holding.”

She commented 
“😍” when I posted a video with my face. 
I shrugged it off as her being friendly because I have a lot of female friends who think I’m cute plus she has a boyfriend. 

She’ll also reply with something like “I love youuuuuu” when I compliment her. But girls are like that. 
I have female friends who call me babe or baby  without romantic interest. I’ve even had guy friends say they love me so no big deal.  
She commented “Lmao 😂” when I posted a video about something that frustrated me. No big deal she thinks it was funny. 

But today I posted a selfie where I look really hot. Light and smooth Caramel skin, big gold chain around my neck, giant curls, big and smooth lips. And she commented “Have a good day🤍”. 

Maybe I’m overreacting because she does have a boyfriend but the white heart makes me think I have a shot with her. 
I saw the white heart emoji meaning on urban dictionary. 
I’m very careful with the hearts I send people. She’s 4 years older but young enough to know some hearts can be taken differently.

'I have a rule that I don't mix work and my personal life.' Which logically is a conditional statement; easily misleading. If you can imagine the question being asked like we're not working together, and the answer is still no, then you should just say that you're not interested. Why? It's the truth, and there is nothing to interpret or overthink. Thus it makes things easier, and is more respectful to the person who asked you out. If you can imagine not working together and the answer then becomes yes, then something could probably be worked out. Plus, if you are already friends, that is personal, which ipso facto means you are lying. If the person asking can analyze your statment and find so much interpretation, then it is not going to 'spare their feelings', or seem 'nicer'.

I’ve matched with him on tinder years prior to my then relationship, but never really talked nor met. We chatted on and off for about 2 months while I was dating around. I finally then made a decision to just focus on him as I saw that he was more genuine than other guys. When we really started talking more was September (FaceTime, calling). That downfall is that he is states away from me. We have discussed and agreed on meeting up within the next month. He’s willing to fly all the way out to me to see me. I just don’t know when yet exactly.

When I like someone I naturally gravitate towards responding and wanting to talk more to them. With this guy, I became more aware with his texting/communication habits. I remember I bought up this to him once about how I didn’t appreciate him responding slow. He would say he is busy, have tried to text me with more effort “than other girls” in the past and was worried that it might be an issue in the future. I knew I was a bit petty because he still responds to me no later than the following day but that I was just being demanding of him responding within a hour. So I backed off. 

Fast forward to now, we are going pretty smooth, frequent calls maybe few times a week. Texting few times maybe every other day. There are many times now though where he leaves me on read and tells me the next day that he got caught up with something etc. Not only that but he usually looks at my stories and don’t reply back.

61,qivyf4,1635576918,What to do when your partner isnt “there” anymore,"A few months ago, i just didnt understand my partner because school for the both of us (more for her) have been hectic. I’ve been wanting attention even if its just through small gestures like affectionate messages or just showing she cares by being gentle. This then led to me being unsupportive in a sense because she felt like i should understand her when school comes first. Eventually, i did understand her but i just wanted undivided attention when its time for us if that makes sense or saying it in a more loving, caring or enthusiastic way at least? Id understand if she has to do something for school so we cant spend time together but its just how she says it that makes me feel put aside or makes me feel like shes now cold. 

This all led to hostility towards one another, just easily ticked off by the smallest things because we never got to properly talk about the issues until recently. So basically theres hard feelings that were left unsaid for around 2-3 months. Even if we talked about it before (before everything was addressed recently), it would just be superficial you know? Like we’re okay but theres still more left unsaid or needed to be talked about but we couldnt make time for it because of the busy schedule. She says that she just isnt there anymore and i do feel that. She says she loves me still and she wants to talk and try again. Lately we both haven’t been okay mentally and this might also be a factor because of just not having enough energy i guess and needing that support but it isnt there. I do try to support her but to her its just words. She doesnt feel it.

There are times shes sweet, she misses me, and shes playful but she transitions to being cold and closed off. This mostly happens when she dissociates with her intrusive thoughts. The inconsistency confuses me most of the time. She told me she wants to fix being inconsistent too. Idk if shes just going through it or if she doesn’t love me anymore.

The reason I started online dating is because I find it really difficult to approach a girl and start a good conversation with her so I thought online dating was the best alternative. 
The truth is, its way more harder there. The first girl I met online turned out great, I mean we would chat through the night and I didn't go a day without calling her but it all came to an end when we decided to meet up in person.
It was honestly very horrible. She looked absolutely different from what I imagined including the fact that she was way shorter.
After our date, our long term relationship we built online started dying because she said I was not a fun guy to be with in person.
It felt hurt by it and in less than 3 weeks later, we broke up.
I decided to try online dating one last time and I found this girl which I immediately suggested we meet up a few days after we started dating. It actually turned out great and we had a good time but she also preferred the online version of me than the real one.

65,qiwj1h,1635579535,Is it ok to not understand dating at 25?,"(Male, 25) I'm a college student. I've lived in a small town of 7,000 until 3 months ago, but unfortunately I appear too late to the big-time dating game, age-wise. For context I run and look good (5'7 to be completely clear). Recently ran my 3rd half marathon (by myself, not competitive). I'm a double major and double minor with plans to get a PhD. I've been accepted into a study abroad program for the spring, and will study abroad next summer and all the next year. I had to write a great essay to get in. So I'm not a worthless POS that looks bad. Yet the ambiguity of dating remains an old foe that taunts me from my childhood. I guess living in an actual large city as a kid would have given more opportunities to meet people and date, rather than 90% of those 7,000 residents being boomers. 

It isn't an inner desire to date as much as it is to not feel left out of something in general. Every pop song ever, all tv shows and movies rated above PG, half of the conversations I hear at my campus, the hot topic of every online platform- is dating and sex. The media and people themselves make it seem like it's intrinsic in being human to have been dating and fucking since 12 or 13. Like it's a pastime or hobby. Hell, in my biological anthropology class, sex is mentioned a lot when talking about early humans and their primate ancestors. The professor makes some references to humanz today in it, like saying ""gorillas and chimps just have sex for instinctual survival purposes, unlike us humans. We have sex for fun, because it's pleasurable"". It didn't sound that cringy in the context of the lesson, but still. Hearing that makes me feel like I'm the only person in the lecture hall that hasn't been having sex 3 times a week since the onset of puberty. I've had a fling before, but that was 3 years ago. I just feel left out romantically and emotionally. I don't have to have a girlfriend, especially considering my workload. Or sex. I've  made it pretty fine without it. But those things are apparently such an essential thing to do as a young person that seeing/hearing references about them makes me feel like I'm missing a crucial aspect of life. I'm the only one in the cafeteria that isn't sitting with friends or a partner. I don't have to have a partner, but it makes me feel subhuman to be this one guy that isn't walking and holding hands with someone, or not eating with a gf, or etc. 

The strange thing is, there's no parties or huge social events (thanks Covid) at my university, so all people do is go to class, eat at the cafeteria, and go back to dorms. I have no idea how people have met and been dating. I guess most of them knew each other through other people from living in this city  before going to the college here? I'm from 4 hrs away so I'm basically a master third wheel. Maybe I'm just not compatible with most people at my college?

66,qiwjhk,1635579597,Is it a red flag if a woman mentions an obsession with the beach in her dating profile," 

My perspective is going to the beach can be expensive, especially staying there. I feel as though if a woman goes out of her way to mention ""the beach"" in a dating profile, it has some subtext to it.

I have a relative whose wife was obsessed with the beach to the point she made her husband rent out a beach house for the last 20-30 years and that lifestyle has actually impacted their retirement savings.

Another possibility is that daddy or mommy support the beach lifestyle as they may have a house there and this gives a good indication she's used to living outside of her income via her parents.

Am I crazy to think this? Personally, I prefer the mountains vs beaches and have been avoiding all the women on dating sites who specifically need to call out their love for the beach. To me, it's subtext for expensive taste.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qiwjhk/is_it_a_red_flag_if_a_woman_mentions_an_obsession/

68,qiwqa1,1635580502,Date cancelled on me should I move on?,"Hi friends! 

I’ve been going on a few dates with this guy and everything seems ok. He will usually make it a point to plan the dinner spots. Im not a big texter and I’ve communicated that to him since the first day. The only time we do text is when he check in on me and suggest a date thereafter. We usually meet once a week or biweekly. 

We were meaning to meet today but he cancelled on me for the reason that he strained his shoulder at the gym. He sounded apologetic over the texts and cancelled on me ahead of time. My main concern is that he asked if it’s cool to reschedule without actually suggesting a date. I wonder if this is his way of putting me down softly that he may not be interested in seeing me going forward?

And since we hardly text it is really hard to ascertain if there’s any change in his behaviour. Should I give him the benefit of the doubt even though my gut instinct is telling me otherwise? 

I don’t want to waste another week or two anticipating the idea of meeting him again if he’s not on the same page

69,qix4yt,1635582385,Just really confused and don’t know what to feel,"This is going to be long, 

I’ve been dating this girl who I use to work with for a month now. Things were going great. We would call each other every day. See each other all the time. Go on dates. She’ll talk to her friends and parents about me all the time. Things were amazing. But also let me add that we’re not officially exclusive. Even though she said

“If you sleep with another girl I would be hurt”. (This will comeback later on in the story so stay with me lmao)

However she’s been going through a lot over the time span we’ve been seeing each other. 
•She just got out of a abusive relationship of 2 years.
•She got let go from her job
•Her parents are getting a divorced
•She’s moving an hour away from friends and family

We had plans to go to a pumpkin patch this weekend and stay at a hotel this Sunday. But had to cancel because this week hasn’t been the best for her. Which I’m cool with. 

Recently her ex has been trying to get back with her. They’ve been in contact with each other because he used her credit cards while they were together, and he’s the one who has to pay it. However, her and her ex hung out earlier this week and had sex. 
I found out because I was sitting by her friend when she FaceTime’d her and admitted to it. She didn’t know I was sitting next to her. I and her friend planned this out because the night she hung out with her ex she was acting cold and distant for the first time with me. 

She called me later that night apologizing. Saying she fucked up multiple times. Saying that she didn’t know why she did what she did. That people are giving me info that isn’t true.

I wasn’t hurt or mad that she slept with him. We weren’t officially exclusive. I was more confused than anything, and just wanted to hear the truth from her.

Now let’s skip to currently. I’m really confused on how I feel. I really do like this girl, and she’s someone I do see myself with. She still texts me all the time. She says she loves me, and loves the person I am. Her closest friend tells me that she told her that she honestly sees a future with me, but she’s just not in the right place right now with everything going on with her life. Even though she texts me all the time. She doesn’t call me like she use to. And the last two times she said she’ll call me at night. She doesn’t follow through. I always give her the benefit of the doubt because she is going through a lot, but her actions haven’t spoken louder than her words. 

Maybe I’m just asking for too much. But what are y’all opinion on the whole thing?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qix4yt/just_really_confused_and_dont_know_what_to_feel/

I (22f) am talking to this guy (30). We've been talking about a month now. I worked with him two years ago. When we worked together we had a BLAST. We were always joking and picking on each other making my days as a stocker at a tiny grocery store worthwhile. I really like him. But he post REALLY cringy videos, he moves REALLY fast as in relationship wise and has two boys. The kids aren't a problem at all because I absolutely adore kids. I just got out of a 2 year long mentally (and sometimes physically) abusive relationship that birthed commitment issues and anxiety of starting up something serious again.

Me and this 30yo man talk quite often, but they aren't superficial talks. We talk as if we've known each other for years about anything and everything. We both have busy schedules so we don't get to talk as often as either of us would like. Tonight he dropped the ""L"" word over a silenced and slowed down video on snapchat. And kinda played it off saying ""oh I'm glad you didn't hear that I don't think you were really ready to hear it. Plus it's way too early for that."" We met up last week to hang out in person. We went mini golfing and out to eat and there was not one awkward second. We had sex and it could have been much better. He definitely has potential. I realize since we are 8 years apart there is quite a big difference in mental states. I feel as if I'm pretty mature for my age other than the commitment issues.

&amp;#x200B;

My ex cheated on me after one year and I was stupid enough to forgive her.

Here's the backstory. She flew out to her birth town to help take care of a matter involving her parents. While visiting, she decided to hang out with some old friends from high school and college. One of those friends happened to be a guy she had a thing with before he shipped off to the military. They grabbed lunch where she claimed they talked about his girlfriend, and her boyfriend (me). Afterwards he invited her back to his place to ""watch some anime"", where she claims she initially refused, but went anyway. She refused to go into any detail, but basically they didn't actually watch anything. Two hours later she went back to her parents house. The following night is when she told me what happened.

I forgave her and told her we would work through it. After all, I felt I was hopelessly in love with her. Big mistake... The following three years was nothing but emotional abuse. I mean getting yelled at for asking the simplest of questions, getting accused of cheating if I got stuck at the office longer than I would have liked, ridiculed for speaking my mind over things. It got so bad we started sleeping in separate rooms and I would do all I could just to avoid her. Eventually I told her I had enough, broke off the relationship, and moved across the country.

I'm at a point where I wish I were already married with a family, but every time I think about pursuing someone that piques my interest, I get flashbacks of my last relationship, and I back off.

1. If someone is lacking in effort or wont match yours just drop it. It is not worth it.
2. If you're thinking about asking, just ask. Stop spending a ton of time debating and making posts online asking others. The worst the person can say is no.
3. Set some uncompromising standards for yourself. Don't let people take advantage of you, disrespect you, insult you etc. This will save you tons of time with the wrong people.
4. Be a good listener. Too many people are caught up in talking about themselves that they don't listen to what the other person has to say.
5. Learn from your mistakes. If you said or did something foolish then be humble enough to admit it to yourself and correct it next time. Nothing worse than someone who doesn't want to improve.

My parents have actually warned me about male gold diggers before but I dismissed it then because it is not like I am chasing gorgeous male models much younger than me. Anyway I agreed to meet this one guy from Bumble for coffee because he seemed ambitious, funny, stylish and quite normal. 


We met in line and I was ahead of him. He looked visibly annoyed when I asked for a slice of cake with my coffee but relaxed when I paid for my own order. He “joked” lots about me being a poor student and kept asking if I only got the £5 cake because I assumed that he would be paying for me. Extremely rude and ludicrous but whatever, maybe he just had a bad experience recently. I got my cake and I was going to eat it. 


We made some small talk and then I asked him what he does for a living, which seemed to really trigger him. He sighed dramatically and told me how it is obvious why every girl asks this question, then bragged about how he is an engineer making mid five figures but it is getting so hard for him to weed out all the nasty broke gold digging sl*gs. He went on and on about how females these days only care about a man’s money, that we all just want to use nice guys for free meals but of course he is way too smart to fall for that. According to him 50/50 everything is the only way to go even if his girlfriend makes a lot less, because equality and it is not his problem that she isn’t smart enough to get a STEM career. He finished with how marriage is nothing but a huge scam for modern men, that he will definitely insist on a pre-nup to protect his assets and that anyone who has a problem with that is absolutely a gold digger.  


He looked super smug like he just totally called me out and was waiting for me to argue or to prove myself to him somehow, but I told him calmly that I agree completely with what he said about a pre-nup being extremely important and that if I ever get married my family will definitely insist on one. He looked really confused for a minute and then started asking all kinds of probing questions about my family and my assets. I know not to talk about wealth but this guy was such a clown and I most certainly didn’t want to see him again so I just told him that my grandparents are gifting me a beautiful house in a posh neighbourhood. 


He got extremely excited and immediately started asking how I feel about moving in there with a boyfriend because I am an adult now and it is time for me to stop living with my parents. He then moaned about how he has hefty student loans and still has to pay an exorbitant amount to live in a tiny flat further away from the city with two other guys. He gushed about how great the location of the house is and how much money he could save if he didn’t have to pay rent at all. He even had the audacity to ask if I would eventually consider giving my boyfriend co-ownership of the house since he can contribute by taking care of the garden and whatnot. He then confessed that in spite of his cynicism he is just a romantic at heart who believes that marriage is amazing with the right person and that when there is true love, pre-nups just feel so cold and one-sided especially when overprotective families try to intervene. 


He then started bombarding me with negs (?) like how I seem smart for a non-STEM major and look alright for a tall girl. He kept talking about our bright future together in “our” house, that “we” have the money to retire early and travel the world and creepy stuff like how our kids are going to inherit his IQ. He was extremely pushy about setting up a second date on the spot and declared that he would even be willing to treat me to a nice dinner to show his sincerity since it is “our” money now. 


I faked an emergency, left, saw him typing furiously on the app and blocked him immediately. Total psycho with no social skills and zero self-awareness. At least nobody is falling for that. 


TLDR: I guess guys who constantly cry about all women being gold diggers usually don’t have much gold and are totally projecting. Avoid!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qj0ozp/i_think_i_met_my_first_cheap_angry_hypocritical/
