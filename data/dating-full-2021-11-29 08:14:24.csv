Looking for some quick advice if you would reach out in this situation:

I (M) went on two dates with her (F) and really liked her. At the end of date two, we kissed when I dropped her off and I thought it was going well. The morning before date three, she sent me a long text explaining the dating process felt like a chore, she needed a break, and was deleting OLD. She also asked if we could put in a pin in things for now, or if I wanted to just end things entirely - I said we could put in a pin in things and to let me know if she wanted to talk. She then asked if we could still send each other memes (we would send each other about one a day while we were dating/talking), and I said sure. 

Honestly, her whole text seemed like a classic “it’s not you, it’s me” vibe in order to spare my feelings, when in reality she just wasn't interested. I’ve done that before too, so I know how it goes (I’m sure we all do). Anyway, she did send me something later that day (which was pretty unfunny) and I just wrote back “not bad haha”. That was three weeks ago and it was the last communication we’ve had.

I’m still a little hung up on her, and I was really hoping she’d reach out, but she hasn’t. I think that mostly confirms she’s just not interested, but on the other hand, it’s not too late to send her something funny and ask how it’s going, right? If she doesn’t respond to my text or doesn't engage, I’ll know to drop it for good at that point. 

So my question is: if I’m still interested, there’s no harm in sending a meme/text three weeks later, right? Or would you seriously advise against that for some reason?

This is a very complex situation and I'll do my best to keep it as concise and clear as possible. I apologise in advance if I express things in a confusing way.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year, we briefly broke up in summer. He was the one who initiated the break up but he felt pretty terrible and regretted it. Overall, we were broken up for about two weeks.

Things have been rocky with us in general. The problem mainly is that my boyfriend is extremely moody. To a point where I believe he might potentially have some sort of disorder. Perhaps it would help to give you some background info...

My boyfriend works for the military and takes his job very seriously. His career is important to him, he is very driven, wants to do a good job and advance. I know it's an ego thing. In the beginning, I figured it was normal, now I'm not so sure anymore. As we continued dating, he opened up to me about his past. He was adopted when he was 7. His biological mother is a drug addict, his step father molested him as a child and also killed his half-sister, long after he had been adopted but I can imagine that it was traumatic nonetheless.

His adoptive family kept him very sheltered, didn't allow him to go out when he was in high school and  his adoptive father verbally abused him. Toxic masculinity was a big issue as well.

I have known about all this for at least half a year now - I actively decided not to break up with him and stand by his side as he tries to cope with all of it. Unfortunately, he has shown some hurtful behaviours, like texting his ex (whom he doesn't even feel attracted to), not deleting his dating apps to get compliments from women, making comments about my appearance... I know, you might think now, ""Why the hell are you still dating him?"" - I don't want to picture him as just being a bad guy. I think he has some serious issues and doesn't even want to be like this.

Sometimes, when he gets drunk, he will talk about how he's intellectually not on the same level as me and that he might bore me with not being interested in some of the things I like. Last time he was drunk, he made a comment about how one of my male friends would probably be a good guy for me, and that he sometimes lays in bed and cries. When I asked him why, he said he was just joking. 

Yesterday, he was back at the point of wanting to break up. It's so weird because he made this effort of getting me a ton of nice Christmas gifts (which he didn't have to), he's been telling me how much he is looking forward to spending the holidays with me. He danced with me in the kitchen on Thanksgiving and was so affectionate with me. A couple of weeks ago, he even invited me to fly back to his home country with him when he goes to visit his family (I couldn't afford the plane ticket, so I won't go). 

He is in therapy right now, it was my condition he started therapy in order for us to get back together. He has been in therapy for the largest part of his life, he takes antidepressants and anxiety meds. However, he doesn't really trust his therapist because he put a diagnosis (GAD) on his record without telling him about it, he saw it by coincidence. In the beginning, he told me his therapist seemed like a good guy who knew what he was doing and now he's completely demonising him - he has the tendency to do that. Think positively of one person and then suddenly change their opinion about them.

My boyfriend asked me a few weeks back if I'd be scared if he was diagnosed with a personality disorder and I replied that I wouldn't be, it would be more concerning if he had one and suffered because he didn't really know about it. Now he's paranoid about getting diagnosed with one even though he says he doesn't believe to have one. Quite frankly, I believe he thinks he might have a personality disorder but he is scared of how it will affect his job (and potentially me). 

I don't really know what to do. I don't want to break up with him or him to break up with me. I'm not perfect either, I have strong fears of abandonment and tend to get very emotional quickly. I understand that's tiring and a lot to deal with when you already have a lot on your plate. I'm just at a loss right now. One moment I'm the most fascinating person he knows, the next moment he's bored and unhappy. One moment he is very horny and loves having sex with me, the next he thinks it's repetitive and there is ""no passion"". I'm trying to be understanding of his mood swings potentially being a result of his mental health but it's also very taxing.

I feel like there is so much more that needs to be in this post but it would get way too long. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend is very hot and cold about me, sometimes super affectionate, sometimes on the verge of breaking up. He has mental health issues that might contribute to his mood swings.

Context: I'm a straight, 23 year old 5'4 transman who passes pretty well. I'm very transparent with this because I never want to date someone who's not ok with that or who is transphobic.
I am also from Sweden if that matters and I've been dating via Tinder and Okcupid on and off for a couple of years now and it has gone pretty well in general.

Last week I met an amazing girl on Tinder. She was funny, kind, had similar interests to me but was also independent and had her own passions in life - something I value greatly. I have met some catfishes previously but I usually think that they're off in some way and sense red flags right away. Not this time I guess. We hit it off really well and a couple of days later she gave me her phone number and said she'd message me when she could meet up.
I wanted to text some more and talk over a phone call just to make sure she was who she said she was (being harassed every now and then online makes you extra careful). And she instantly snapped at me, messaging: ""Well I guess this isn't going to work out then. Unmatched and blocked. I will only meet you when I say so"". I was kinda shocked by this and then suddenly I got notifications that someone was trying to log into my Tinder account with my phone number. Ngl I was pretty uncomfortable, and I'm still thinking about it.

Here in Sweden you can google phone numbers and get information like what adress the person with that phone lives at so now I'm a little afraid that this person (who might not even be who they said) will come after me. 
I reported her on the app and tried looking for her adress via the phone number but it came back as a private number.

So we all come here for advice. That’s for sure. But he’s an interesting one for you: 

So for context I’ve (26F) lived with my roommate in a city that I had to move to part time for nursing school (some of my school is still remote so I can do it wherever). The other part of the time I live in a city 3.5 hour (drive) away and I’ve been living in the new city with my roommate (29M) for about 5 months and it’s just him and I + his dog, my dog, and my cat… so we don’t have any other roommates… also we were Craigslist roommates so we didn’t know each other before. 

His girlfriend and him broke up like less than a month ago and he seemed pretty messed up about it for a couple weeks and I tried to be as supportive as I could given my roommate position. And trust me, they had a dynamic of a relationship that wasn’t healthy so it was good for him, and I viewed all of that from a friend perspective (honestly 100%). We have been keeping busy doing house projects as I have been in a depression funk lately so it’s been good for me too and so this is where it gets interesting… We were drinking the day before thanksgiving and doing some house projects and then he started kissing me and so for the past 4 days or so this has kinda continued. I went over to his family’s for thanksgiving, as his aunt invited me a few weeks prior and we also got kinda turnt there and so for 2 days this was in my mind: I guess an “oh well maybe this is just going to be a drunk thing” because neither one of us addressed it the next day (so thanksgiving), but it also wasn’t awkward in the least because we are so comfortable with each other. We talked about it and banged after we got back from his family’s thanksgiving but again we were a little tipsy. So yesterday we were just hanging out watching a movie on the couch and he was sitting really close to me and I’m so fucking touch starved right now and I kept getting really turned on just by him kinda sitting close to me and touching my arm a bit and then we started making out and I was like “I want you to fuck me” and we were sober and honestly the sex was really good. A few hours later I just kinda spit it out and said, “we should probably talk about this sober,” and so we did. Basically he told me he has feelings for me and such. But I felt like I had to force this conversation out of him almost. Like the same stuff that he said drunk the couple days before… but I’m just so worried about fucking up my living  situation  and now I feel like I’ve caught feelings in a way because I love him so much as a person but our dynamic has never been like this but it’s also been really good so far but I really am not in a place to get hurt anymore by men and I’m worried I’m walking into fire with this but I just don’t know.
From an outsiders perspective I could see people shitting all over this idea. But the couple people I have told have been really supportive (mostly because they love him lol because he’s such a good guy). 
Also, when we talked (sober) the rhetoric was basically opening up the conversation about exploring something between us. I brought up what we should think about our sleeping situation and the amazing person he is basically said: I mean my bed is bigger, and I’m down if you want to sleep in it every night or just some nights. I decided to sleep in my bed tonight because in some ways I want to still feel desired like I’m not encroaching on his space I guess? This is why the roommate thing is hard. But I did sleep in his bed the last couple of nights and we were both sober, and we have had sober sex twice now so I’m just confused. 

P.S. both of us have been engaged in years prior and are both seeking therapy for our stuff individually outside of this situation 👍🏻

I am a prefinal year college student who has a crush on this final year girl. I am 50 percent sure that there's no one in her life.
The problem is, I have never seen her in real life and only follow her on Instagram. I would love to approach her in real but she's in final sem and those guys rarely come to college(even when it is open, and as of now college is indefinitely closed due to covid).
She doesn't follow me on instagram which isn't very rude coz she doesn't follow any other junior as well.
She has a second public account where she posts a lot of her writings and reels related to books. She loves to read books and has a proper shelf full of them. There's some great views that I admire her for. 
One of the few people I know who aren't faking things.
I don't want to regret later that I couldn't approach her and covid is making it really hard(I've been quite lonely).
I once replied to a story of her public account with a 3 line experience of mine and she replied with a simple haha. That's the only interaction.
So here's my question:
1. Should I DM her and approach her that way, clearly writing why I chose to dm instead of meeting? I have been planning to write a poem in my own handwriting explaining why I admire her? I want to advocate for the word admire because crushes are just admirations, that's not love. I don't want to fake any compliments on her appearance based just on her instagram, I didn't fall for her appearance. 
Note- Poem is only because she writes and read literature. Tell me if it's a bad idea.
2. Things I shouldn't tell her in my dm, if I do message her.
3. I don't want to hurt her or cause any harm(and also not to get in trouble myself). I've seen what some of our indian fellows do to women on instagram (once had the pleasure of using my mother's insta, which she never used. There were atleast 5 extremely random guys sending her requests and all. I don't want to be that). I also don't want to come out as creep. Suggestions pls.

I got clean in 2016, my life was pretty messy prior to that point and to varying degrees so were my relationships. When I decided to pull my shit together my focus was my health, number one followed by my career. Outside of those two goals I set everything else on the back burner. I did all of the normal things that life basically consists of; family, friends, hobbies. Pursuing a relationship was put on hiatus indefinitely until I was “in a better place”.

I’ve actually been in a good place for some time now. I didn’t turn into a full blown monk either. I did spend time with some ex’s occasionally who understood and some online (nsa) flings. That being said, here’s what feels like my dilemma. 

So, I’ve gotten incredibly used to this very independent lifestyle and I haven’t been emotionally available for a long time on any intimate level.

I’m very comfortable and content but my plan was always to hopefully settle down with someone special to me. 

So the catch is I do have a date with a woman I like very much and have known for a while but outside of small talk we have never really had a real conversation so I know her but not really at all. I don’t have any problems talking, joking or carrying a conversation. It’s that all the relationships in my past always went incredibly fast. Is it weird to put it out there that I want things to move slowly? Should I even bring it up? 

When I’ve been around her, there has been chemistry and we have friends in common. Some of those friends know me well, so I’m inclined to think she knows a thing or two about me and not that it’s some giant secret anyway. I just don’t want one thing to lead to another and then I get awkward and distant. I know I’m overthinking things a bit but it’s largely to do with me wanting this to work out. I know she’s been interested for a while and same for me. I’m afraid if I bring it up that my vulnerability might scare her away. Idk, for me, finally with self-awareness knows the importance on taking things slow for it to work out long term. Things were way simpler when I drank and didn’t really give a f. Any thoughts ?

I mean she’s a 9 on a bad day, and I’m a 7.5/8 at best. I was questioning whether she was out of my league. She was head over heels for me once we first started talking. (She liked me WAYY more than I liked her at first)She expressed how much she liked me and that she doesn’t usually date. I said cool and we started taking it slow. We would FaceTime nightly, go get drinks, and see each other a good amount the first month. Her communication skills we’re the best but I thought nothing of it. The sex was AMAZING ! I mean, we would fuck like rabbits. She even was bragging to her friends about our sex. Mind you, we’ve only been talking for about 3 weeks up to this point. Then Hurricane Ida came and things took a turn for the worse. We had to split for the evacuation and communicated daily. I even drove 400 miles to see her during our separate evacuations. When I got there, all we did was have nonstop sex for the 2 days I was there. Then, we started having arguments about small things. She told me she was starting to feel uncomfortable by how fast we were moving. I took a note and said we can slow things down once we get back from evacuation. At this point, we’re really into each other but I like her more than she likes me now. The tables have turned 

Well, once we got back from being evacuated, I realized she changed. We stopped FaceTiming, texting became dull, and we stopped having sex. I brought it up and she said that she was uncomfortable with the way I was handling the relationship because she’s never moved that fast. Then, I basically became the guy who was chasing her. I told her I loved her and I wanted to be with her forever. I became attached. She obviously didn’t have the same feelings I had for her. At this point we’ve been talking for 6 weeks and then we basically stopped all the fun things we did once we first started. An argument led to me not talking to her for a month. 

Then being the guy that I am (I’m an intense lover), I sent her a “I miss you text” after my birthday. I couldn’t stop thinking about her. She hit me back saying she missed me too and thought I found someone else. We agreed to try things again but after about a week of texting again, she’s been back to the same shit. Saying we should link up but once the day comes, she ghosts me. Terrible communication skills and fake love.

I told her tonight that if she didn’t want to do it anymore lmk, and she said we should end it.

Dated a few girls, was hooking up with the one, but then thought I found ""the one"" in early August. We casually dated for about 2 months, nothing official, no sex. After a couple dates she revealed she was very recently single, and vented about her ex's a lot. I told her to take a break, let the thing with her ex's cool off, then maybe we can try again. She spilled her guts out, saying she's not used to ""mature emotionally available men"". And that her ex bf's were ""depressed alcoholics"". She asked for another chance and I gave it to her. We went out one more time and it was awkward as can be. She texted me a couple days later something like ""you're a great guy and deserve somebody special but let's be friends hee-hee."" I was like wtf is she serious???

&amp;#x200B;

So I move on to another girl, we go out to dinner a week later. She's a nervous wreck on the date. I figure it's just first date nerves so I ask her out again, she says yes. She's out of town that weekend. Weekend after we plan to go out, she calls me sick (she sounded sick) and we don't go. Weekend after I have to work. I try to reschedule again, but at this point my cell towers are DOWN and Im on the backup 3g network. I don't hear from her for over a week. New cell towers are up and Im back on 5g. I text her like ""if you didn't want to go out again that's fine, but don't have me pay for tickets when you know you're not going"". She texts back 15 seconds later ""ummmm I haven't heard from you in a week I thought we were going"". Turns out my texts weren't all sending on 3g. Now it's been like 5 weeks since our first date. I just give up with this girl.

&amp;#x200B;

So I go out with another girl. First date goes pretty well, she texts me when she gets home like ""thank you for the good time we should do it again"". But I have plans all thanksgiving week, and work 12 hour shifts all weekend. So next weekend would be TWO weeks since the first date and I can already feel momentum dying. I'll ask her out, she will say yes, and it will be weird seeing each others faces again after such a long layoff.

I got blackout drunk and hooked up with a guy who later turned out to be a friend from a guy I was dating. We both weren't aware they knew eachother.

I was a mess and disgusted with myself. Guy I was dating reached out a few days after that happened with a pasive aggresive message to let me know he knows everything. He acted like everything was fine and like it isn't a big deal but we haven't talked in a month after that. I knew he was hurt by my actions.

A month later, I randomly ran into him while I was out with my friends. He was excited to see me and I decided to apologize in person and to tell him my side of a story - that I was blackout drunk and didn't have any control over my behaviour and that I feel terrible about it still. He was kinda mad at first and irritated that I'm even mentioning it but eventually accepted my apology and said that we weren't official or anything so he practically doesn't have a right to be mad about it but that it did kinda hurt him. Long story short, we ended up making out and he slept over at my place. We haven't heard in 2 weeks after that and I saw on social media that he went out of town to visit his mom. I thought it was over between us and that he just used me for sex one last time, so I decided to move on from this mess.

But on Saturday afternoon, he reached out and told me he came back to our town and that he would like to hang out with me if I'm free. He came over at my place and I said to him i didn't expect we would hear from each other again. He asked me why did I think that and said he wanted to reach out earlier but he isn't big on texting so he waited to come back so we could talk in person. We cuddled and watched movies and it was really a beautiful evening.

My question is - do you think he's genuine or just using me for sex and affection? When I'm with him I don't get bad vibes but my friends are telling me to be careful. Him and I have a great chemistry and I think that is why it's so hard to get away from eachother.

I have a crush on this girl, who I completely rejected in college.  
Story is, my sister set me up with her friend ten years ago. My family is religious, conservative and Asian, and at the time I found my sister a total kiss-ass and hated being in the same college as her. I was trying to rebel, hung out with a douchey crowd and did a lot of stupid stuff. This is not an excuse, but an explanation. So when she set me up with this prim-and-proper looking girl, I messed around the whole date, so my family would leave me TF alone in future.  It was bad.   


Well, this summer this friend came for a visit with my sister. I met her again on a group hike my sister had organised. I was pretty smitten at first sight, tbh. I had forgotten about her, but she hasn't, when I introduced myself she was like, ""Oh, I know you, my worst date ever. lol "" She wasn't hostile or anything, she roasted me a few times, mostly around stuff to do with that stupid date. The other thing is, my brother-in-laws friend was really into her and they flirted a lot. He even invited her to stay at his place in another city for ""sightseeing"".   
She stayed a week and we ran into each other a few times. She is just really cool and sweet, and she got along with my parents, who generally don't like anyone new. She also isn't religious or conservative, which I still don't like. Sometimes I felt like she was flirting with me, but she also said, she wasn't interested in dating, because she was newly single. We also had this really long conversation over a bbq, and I really think we would work well together.  
Because of the BIL friend situation, I didn't make any moves, he was also invited to most of the stuff. Also felt a bit insecure, tbh, I have had quite a few rejections from white girls.   


Today I heard that apparantely nothing happened between BIL Friend and her, even when she stayed with him for a couple of days. We have been exchanging some texts and photos from her stay, but not much else. But I just can't stop thinking about her and everytime I am on a dating app, I can't stop comparing. On the other hand, I don't know how it would work, she lives pretty far away and with COVID and all that, what's the point, right?

1. The man became overly sexual too quickly
2. Man asked for their number too quickly
3. Uninteresting first message
4. The man asked for a date too quickly
5. Conversation became dull
6. More interested in their other matches
7. Felt unsafe to meet in real life
8. Became too busy with work / life etc.
9. Changed their mind having seen his profile again
10. Stopped using the dating app

**Methodology**

We ran a survey on anonymous panel base platform, PollFish. The question we posed was, *With 1 being the most, and 10 being the least, what are the most common reasons you don't reply to men?* with these reasons as options.

Women then ranked from 1 to 10, the most common reasons. We also shuffled the answers to avoid any kind of selection bias.

**Sampling**

Mostly even age splits across four groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54. We used a qualifying question, *""Which of the following best describes you?""* and then gave five options to choose from:

* *Single, straight, and not using dating apps*
* *Single, straight, and using dating apps* ***(qualifying answer)***
* *In a relationship, straight, and not using dating apps*
* *In a relationship, straight, and using dating apps*
* *None of the above*

Note - Pollfish only collect results from those who qualify. Those who did not qualify were not able to take the survey. We targeted the survey at women living in the United Kingdom, aged 18 to 54, with mostly even age group split, but some bias towards the 25 - 34 group.

**Where to go from here?**

* Avoid getting sexual too quickly
* Avoid asking for digits too early
* Make sure your first message is perhaps a light-hearted question about their profile (rather than ""hi"", ""hey"", ""how are you"")
* Don't push for a date too quickly
* Be interesting eg. don't go into ""interview mode"" for example, try switching between questions and then statements, such as *""How did you get into \[job\]?"", ""Ah fair. Must be challenging. I love my job tbh - really passionate bout \[x\]. But not as passionate as I am about winning at Command and Conquer Generals""*
* BE FUNNY (in another study, we found the overwhelming majority of women want you to make 'em laugh)
* Have a decent profile - ideally get some pro photos taken, spell check, and BE UNIQUE",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130935,public,self,Men: here's the top 10 most common reasons why she doesn't reply on dating apps (according to research),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4uoos/men_heres_the_top_10_most_common_reasons_why_she/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

I didnt think much of it and a few weeks went by and she texts me to ask me something about black friday because she knows that I used to work in retail, definitely something she could have easily looked up online.

The word ""date"" never came up and neither has there been any flirting of any kind, just two old acquaintances meeting after brief communication.

Now to the question:
We are not in a relationship right now, but would you guys tell her if the question of past relationships/affairs arises?

Don't get me wrong, I would NOT tell her proactively if she doesn't ask  because that would be inappropriate but generally speaking I want to be as honest as possible and not make a big deal out of it.

So it takes more effort than usual to hook up with a girl if you are not super attractive. Which is fair.

But it is the same everywhere. Even on Tinder. If I show my location in, let’s say Paris, I get a decent amount of matches but if it is somewhere in Turkey, rock bottom. Zero matches. So Tinder is off the table too.

I know that I’m an interesting, fun and easy to talk to person, my first dates usually end on something like “I had so much fun, let’s do this again” and we do so. I also usually have long lasting relationships with people I’ve met. So I have confidence in myself.

But it is the first interaction what makes things a bit difficult for me. You see, I’m not that attractive, so I need to be interesting. But in order to show that I’m interesting, I need to talk. BUT, in order to talk, I need to get their attention first. It is easy to do on Instagram or Twitter because people directly see my thoughts and they can have a good guess of what kind of a person I am. But it is hard otherwise.

Let's call him Fred. Fred and I met a few years back at a bar/restaurant where we were mutually having dinner with friends. He walks in, our eyes lock instantly. We exchange numbers and spent the rest of the night drinking/dancing/talking. I ended up driving Fred home and he asked if he could call me the next day. We kissed and I was on cloud 9.

The next day he called and said he had a great time and asked me out. But come the day of the date, Fred was MIA. I decided to call him, and he said he was with family and completely forgot about our date. I was pissed, but Fred insisted we reschedule and texted me all night.

I didn't hear from Fred again. Not until a few weeks later when I got a ""You up?"" text at 1am. I didn't answer, and felt disappointed. I blocked him. I eventually met a different guy and we ended up dating for 5 years.

Cut to my breakup. I was feeling low and reconnected with Fred. He initiated sexting right away, which I was wary about at first since I know I'm not the only girl he's talking to like that (he has a player reputation and I know for a fact he adds random girls on social media) but then I got into it. I was so into the fantasy of this guy for years from one night of bliss and possibility. I also needed an ego boost after my breakup. So I indulged. This carried on for months, and about two weeks ago we finally decided to meet up. I thought I wanted some fun because he was hot and I was lonely.

I got to his house and we started kissing right away. I suggested getting drinks, so he got ready to go. Just before leaving, he asked if I minded if he took some cocaine. I was totally taken off guard because he had not said anything, and I didn't suspect him to be a user. He snorted a line before I could even answer. I drove us to the bar and we were there for about an hour or so.

When we got back, we started getting more intimate. We had sexted about numerous things, but me wanting him to be dominate was one of them. The guy is also really strong, so that mixed with cocaine made him extra aggressive. He took my neck in his hand firmly, but it actually kind of hurt. He reached down my blouse to pinch my nipple, which was too hard and hurt as well. He reached down and jammed his fingers inside me without warning which was also too hard. I'm new to BDSM, but I'm not sure this is how it's supposed to be. I told him to go easier.

We then got to a point where I asked if he had a condom. His answer was no. I thought WTF? We had sexted about him ""cumming inside"" but at this point I don't know him and he doesn't know me. I don't know where his penis has been. I told him I want to be safe. He said no, you're right and just said we would have sex next time. We proceeded to watch tv/make out/ cuddle for 7 hours while he snorted cocaine the rest of the night until around 7 am. I had to go home at this point. He walked me to my car and told me to text him when I got home. He kissed me a few more times and said he had a lot of fun/asked if I did too and that he would talk to me later.

I texted him when I got home, but no reply. I shrugged it off that he was just sleeping. But three days went by and nothing. I decided to snap him, which he opened right away but didn't say anything. I didn't think much of it, because he was working and he never snaps back while he's working. But when the weekend came, which is when he snaps/texts me, I heard nothing. It's been 2 weeks now and I haven't gotten a single text or snap from this guy. My friends think he's just pissed because I didn't give it up. But he seemed fine and understood my position when we were together. Not to say he didn't still try, but he didn't seem that upset.

What gives? Why would he say things like ""next time"" and ""text me when you're home"" or ""I'll call you"" if he doesn't mean it? He didn't have to say that. He could have just been like ""I had fun. Drive safe. "" and ended it at that? I'm very confused and it's messing with my ego. We have a lot of chemistry and I was excited to start something with him.

I am looking for some advice regarding a sticky situation I’ve found myself in. 

Back story: In 2018 I started a new job. My coworker and I (only 2 in our department) formed a friendly bond. Both of us were married to other people, but we had a good work relationship. No funny business happened. 
Fast Forward to 2021….we each split from our respective spouses (due to Covid, family issues, it was different for each of us) but remained good friends. My divorce is now final, his is not. 
Long story short: he wants me to be his girlfriend. We’ve hung out outside of work (downtown with friends, work parties, kids activities etc). When he first asked me I was going through my divorce and told him I cared about him, but that I wasn’t ready to date him. So we continued to see each other outside of work in mostly group settings. He kissed me a couple of times which wasn’t horrible. 
Not that I’m out of my divorce fog I’ve done a little OLD….but the situation with my “friend” has gradually increased in awkwardness. He wants to introduce me to his family. He wants his kids to start hanging out with us. He wants to be official. 
He’s a great guy but there’s so many red flags. His ex is extremely volatile. She will show up at his place demanding to know who he is dating now. She even pulled a knife on him at one point. He also smokes weed literally ALL day. There’s some other factors too and when I add them all up….I can’t be in a relationship with him. 
I’ve stopped hanging out with him outside of work. I’ve stopped responding to the “hey beautiful” messages. I’ve done everything except for telling him….and this is where I’m stuck. 
I’m stupid for even getting remotely involved with a coworker. Should I do the “it’s not you, it’s me” speech and deal with him at work? Look for another job? He’s hanging onto something that can never be….

Conversation flows well, we have a good laugh, very comfortable around each other etc etc. 2nd date he made it known he was looking for a relationship, and he also asked me if that's what I was looking for. I said yes in a round-about way, but I would want it to naturally flow towards that etc. I'm not wanting to put so much pressure on it to completely fail as it mucked up my mental health before. 

So, getting to the issue at hand. He's not the best at texting, not the worst either. At the start there would be gaps of a few hours and what not, sometimes up to a day etc, so I grew used to it and it didn't overly bother me. Now, it's a different story, and after each date he will just not message for days after I send him a text, one of which is not intense and not dull either, but then once the texts do come back in he's game for organising something again...

Now when we are with each other, he is incredibly sweet and kind. Always complimentary, and I often find him staring at me or looking in to my eyes when he thinks I'm not watching. He makes comments/suggestions about us doing things in the future, whether it be planning some activities or actually travelling together to see different places. I'm up for all of it. He'll say certain things that implies that he's all in with this, or make small comments that would indicate he is really in to me, but then the above texting issue has slowly been eating away at my self esteem. I get that's something I need to work on 100%, and I am as I've been going to therapy for previous events that have happened in my life that have had an impact on who I am and my mental health.   


When he's with me, he will use his phone. Always apologises for it, but won't hesitate in texting whoever he is texting back. And I think that's what bothers me lol. I get that the texts could be for work, family or friends - and possibly even another date given we are not exclusive, but I openly watch him do this yet I'll go days without one after a date.. 

I don't know if i'm looking too far in to this or if my concerns are legit enough to maybe either have a hard hitting conversation with him where I just openly talk about how i'm feeling and also admit my feelings for him, or maybe accept that it might be better cutting my losses and moving on.

Now at the end of 2021 I'm trying to put something together and I'm totally flopping at it and I feel awful.

I did have some good connections beforehand. Throughout university I had some ultimately transient but still relatively good times with people I liked. Mostly hookups or short flings, but I did have one bond that's managed to survive it all, although he's now at the opposite end of the country with his boyfriend and consequently we're no longer spending intimate time together.

I spent my virginal teenage years beating myself up incessantly about this kind of stuff. I was always the bullied, quiet kid who could barely string a sentence together and it resulted in a very lonely childhood and adolescence which, despite having experience since then, I still feel bitter about for being a late-bloomer, for missing out on those early relationships. I worry I might be emotionally stunted because of it, not fully able to express myself in relationships as an adult. 

And so now that I've been in this position of isolation thanks to covid, and now that I've tried to put myself out there and haven't had any luck, these feelings of frustration and bitterness are at the forefront of my mind. I feel like a virgin all over again!!

Having confided in the small number of people I know who I can trust with this stuff, they've made supportive and encouraging noises but the biggest thing in my way is the profound sense of shame I feel at my lack of success, especially compared with them. Several of my friends have been getting into things for the past few months, and I'm falling behind them. I know it's not helpful to compare yourself to others but I can't help it, how else am I supposed to know what's realistic to achieve? I've been going out with friends, downloaded dating apps, even been to a house party last month, but so far there's just zero interest. I feel like I'm doing the right things - being out there in the world, focusing on developing a good personality and making connections in general, trying to be flirty if I notice interest, but I'm drawing blanks every time!

The impact on my self esteem feels tremendous. I feel like on some level I'm supposed to feel ashamed, because on some level it is reflective of my value to others. I feel that it is indicative of my social worth - if nobody is willing to sleep with me when most of my peers are able to get it, what does that say about me? It must imply some level of undesirability and untrustworthiness. I get that on one level it's luck of the draw and different people want different things but surely the totality of my lack of success says something right? It's not just that I didn't pull this or that person, but the totality of it. Why is it so difficult for me? I'm trying to put myself out there but I'm running into a wall no matter what I do. Surely it is easier for other people? It certainly looks easier, things seem to Just Happen to others simply due to circumstances they're in, while I'm pushing and pushing and pushing and getting nowhere.

I want to feel wanted, trusted, and sexy, and instead I feel unwanted, untrustworthy, and very unsexy, and very ashamed of myself for it. Because there is a disconnect between my desire and my ability to meet it, I feel like it means my desire is not that of a good-looking confident person who can believe in themselves and know they're able to get what they want, it's the desire of a pathetic useless virgin who watches too much porn and cries themselves to sleep while wondering what a kiss feels like. It disgusts me. I remember what it was like to *really* be in that position and I never ever want to feel like that kind of lowly person ever again.

Clearly I can't bring good vibes to something if I'm feeling like this, and even if I just deal with it by getting laid, another dry spell could bring it all up again!

Ive read that you shouldnt ask girls out at their place of work which I believe is true but there are exceptions. How would you guys proceed with this ?

She is my friend's roommate. I was in an unstable relationship back in september when she first texted me and asked if I wanted to meet up. She knew I had a GF but also knew it was unstable. I told her I couldn't, but explained how I had plans to end my relationship soon and that if I was single I would be up for meeting her. I know this sounds bad. 

A month later she came up to me at a party talking and flirting for a bit before heading back to her group. At this point I had still not been able to break up, but that never really came up. I wasn't flirting back or suggesting anything, just being friendly back.

A couple of weeks after my relationship ended, I texted her. Chatted for about an hour before asking her out, and she agreed to that and told me she was looking forward to it, as did I. Turns out we had been to the same party that weekend but missed each other, and I'll quote her reply; *aww, too bad we didn't run into each other.* She had caught a cold at this point so we couldn't set up a date for us to meet. Almost a week passes and I reach out to her asking when she is free, but told me she had a very busy week. Another week passes and I ask again if she's free anytime this coming week, but she's again busy every night. I get that she is busier than I am, but come on, no free days in two weeks? I get that I might not be her top priority since we haven't been on a date yet, and that's fine - I get it, but it does feel a little disappointing none the less. If she changed her mind about meeting up, I just wish she'd tell me, I'm not sure asking her that is a good idea, but what do I know. 

At this point I am starting to feel bad about asking the same question over and over. So instead of just ending with a ""let me know when you're free"", I asked if she had any free days coming up in the coming two weeks or so. I asked in a way friendlier and less passive aggressive way though. No reply to that yet, but we'll see. Not sure it was a good idea to ask that in hindsight. If she finds a day, then great. If she can't come up with a day, I think I'll just give up. I know we will run into each other occasionally, so will be interesting to see how that plays out.

The conversations and making out continued back at her place. No PIV sex occurred though as she wasn’t ready to do so which I respected. All in all, it was amazing and I thought something was there.

Him and I.. only continued to meet in groups. His friend texted to ask what I was going on Friday.. i told him I was at a bar.. and sort of made an impromptu plan and invited him and told him to bring X along. They came and we had a great time. But the friend told me he felt bad that I didn’t invite him directly. And that he was really fond of me but I don’t text him enough or give him enough attention. Anyway. I called X over to my best friends house for a house party on Saturday. He came, but so did his friend and the girl, and another one of their friends. Now, X is super social and really worked the room. Made friends with and charmed everyone. However, wasn’t really spending a lot of time with me. The third friend spent the night hitting on me though. And kissed me before he left. Messy. 

At the door when I went to see him out, he said.. can I show you a magic trick? And kissed me. I didn’t know what to do. I mentioned it to X. And he’s been weird with me since. When someone else asked if I wanted that guys number.. he said - don’t ask her that while I’m around and walked away. I know he sort of likes me. But he’s pulled away now and confusing me. I sort of like him too. How do I fix this tenseness ? 

After the party.. I texted him to say- the next time we meet, can it just be the two of us please? And he replied saying “oh ok”. 
A lot of his responses since have just been “oh ok” or “hmm” and one word responses. 

I called him last night and he just said “ did you call for a reason or just generally?” I said just called to say hi and he said he was with his friends and said “ok I’ll talk to you later then” 

I just don’t know how to make this better.


Edit/follow up…I texted him about it. I told him it was weird and that I wanted to talk to him about it. He said why do you want to talk to me about this? With what perspective do you want to have this conversation? 

So I said look I called you there because I wanted to chill with you. You. Not your friend. And that thing with your friend was just….. weird. And I felt weird. And I don’t know why I wanted to talk to you about it.

His only response was - well what am I supposed to say? 

So I said ok, leave it. I want to meet you again. That’s all. 

To that he replied saying- yup. We can meet. All four of us will hang out sometime. Special emphasis on the “all four of us”

I work only part time (on weekends), and I don’t make enough money to both cover my basic living expenses and pay for frequent dates. I also can’t afford a car right now, so I use Uber to get around - but that’s an expense, especially if I’m commuting to a location more than 15 minutes away.

So background on my situation, I’ve only ever been in two serious relationships in my life. The first one was a couple years ago, and it lasted 8 months. She was great to me, and it was very good relationship for both of us. We did end up falling in love. She smoked weed every once and a while, while I never have and never did. After 5 months, (not from my influence, I didn’t really care) she decided to stop smoking weed. I believe that this was a large reason why we went separate ways, because WOW did her personality ever change after. She starting to just be more frustrated with the little things, constantly criticize me, and became manipulative, and because of this and some other reasons, we broke up and both new it was going nowhere for months before. My now girlfriend, we’ve been dating for 16 months. I truly believe this is what real love feels like, I love everything about her. A couple nights ago, (she has some pretty serious anxiety) she told me she was gonna start using edibles to calm her anxiety down(never used weed until this point). And last night, she had taken one and kinda went off on a tangent. She shouted out to me all energetically about how she wants to move in together and how we’re gonna get married one day, but then brought up that they make her less horny so she doesn’t want to play around in the bedroom (we do it the same amount as most young couples, quite frequently).

Circumstances weren't ideal, but a little over a week ago I decided to sack up and during a night out clubbing, I pulled her off to the side to ask her out on a date. She said no, and despite making out and some relative intimacy, she said she valued friendship above a relationship among some other explanation for her no which I don't remember apart from falling into the broader ""it's no you, it's me"" category. I do recall telling her that she didn't owe me an explanation, but she was insistent in wanting to give me one.

A few days later, we had lunch together which went fine. I wanted to take the opportunity to clear the air and address things up front, but I ended up chickening out and followed her lead in pretending nothing happened. However, there definitely seemed to be some unspoken tension - which I get, the genie can't be put back in the bottle. Since then, texting and such has dropped off a bit and she tries to turn what could be 1:1 hanging out into group activities, which I can empathize with given the circumstances.

Despite still feeling the sting of rejection, I really do value our friendship. I'm cursed with overthinking, so on one hand, I feel as if I should follow her lead and pretend nothing happened. However, I also feel this has the consequence of things having a perpetual awkwardness whenever we're together and inhibits our ability to actually hang out as friends. On the other hand, I want to rip off the proverbial band aid and acknowledge the feelings (and that I can keep them in check, maybe), that no one is at fault, and reaffirm our friendship and any respect for any boundaries that have been set. I see doing so as a way to address the elephant in the room, remove the cloud hanging above our relationship, and would allow us to move forward without lingering doubts and such.

I would appreciate if you internet strangers could lend me your perspective if I'm overthinking or forcing things or if having a frank conversation would be beneficial.

Is it wrong of me to talk to all three of them? Even though nothing is official yet I can't help but feel like I'm being dishonest or betraying them..


I haven't talked to any of them about exclusivity yet, tbh it's too soon as I've only been on one date with each of them so far. Should I just pick one right now or keep seeing all three until I can get a better feeling of our compatibility?


I'm torn because all three are amazing women and each have qualities I would want in a partner, and all three have expressed interest in seeing me again.
I know I will have to choose at some point and that means breaking it off with two of them and that's gonna suck.


I don't even know what to ask specifically, should I keep seeing all three and if so, how tf am I gonna balance everything? Should I tell all three that I'm seeing/ talking to others at the same time in the interest of transparency? 


I feel like maybe I should date each one a couple more times to see, but that's a lot of time, money, effort, and could be emotionally draining..

I’m more than happy to go for the “you pay now, i’ll pick up the tab next time” option. But i’m getting tired of his constant cheapness whenever it comes to spending time together, be it going out for a meal, to the cinema, etc. 

He’s a huge lover of the argument of women’s equality: “well women have wanted equality, it’s old fashioned to expect the man to always pay”, and yes this is true. But I don’t expect him to always pay and although we split almost everything 50/50 at the moment I feel i’m giving a lot more than i’m getting back. Now i’m not the sort of girl that demands expensive gifts or grand gestures, but there hasn’t been a single occasion where he has given me something for a gift (except for the obligatory Christmas and birthday) out of his own free will. If we are out shopping and I see something i like but am not going to purchase at that time, he has never once offered to get me anything as a one off treat.

So we have been together for almost two years now and most of that time it has been a LDR for us, we see each other once a month for a weekend and sometimes it has been more than 2 months not seeing each other. It’s not ideal and we would both like to see each other more. I’m not concerned about him cheating or anything like that, it’s not in his character. But even as we see each other so little, his cheapness stays and there isn’t much of a desire on his part to make me feel loved and special when we see each other. 

I’m going to also add here that he earns significantly more than me and is definitely able to afford being more generous. He certainly is generous with treating himself.

He makes me feel like a villain for wanting this but i feel it’s how i should be treated.

I wanted to confess and take it into the dating phase, but was scared to break the good bond we shared. Finally mustered the courage yesterday. We had an amazing 8 hours drinking and eating together, and towards the end I confessed that I like her. seems it didn't turn out that bad. She agreed to it, she told she's quite comfortable around me, loves hanging with me, and is fine with taking things ahead. She is not a person who communicates her feelings well, so couldn't get to gauge if she actually has same feelings for me. But I'm sure that can be figured out in future dates. 
My concern now is, how to have a perfect time in the dating phase? Hanging out, talking, getting to know each other more is on the cards. But do you also text each other frequently, talk about their day? I feel dating should be fun, as things aren't serious yet. But do you tend to get clingy in getting to know them more?
