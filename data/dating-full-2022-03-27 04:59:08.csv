We have a lot in common and I think we are really compatible. Only problem is that she doesn't make any sense. She says that she likes me and the way she talks with me supports that. That said, It has been three weeks since I have heard from her. This is not the first time she just disappeared. This has been going on for a while now. She will disappear and come back with an some excuse that does not add up. Her last excuse was that she had a migraine that disabled her from looking at her phone for 1.5 weeks. I don't want to invalidate her pain, but that was her excuse for ignoring me for essentially a month. Her excuse does not explain the other 2.5 weeks I did not hear from her.

During our last conversation we had in person, she said she would be ready to start actually ""dating"" come spring and until then I should invite her to some activities and that she was going to invite me to some activities as well. I sent a few messages about some activities that were coming up and she never responded. Also, spring has come but I still have not heard anything from her end.

After our last conversation I pretty much expected this to happen. I really don't expect her to reach back out. I know it is time to move on, but I am having a hard time finding closure. I really liked her and it sounded like she liked me in some kind of way, so it is really hard for me because I have to tell my self to move on even though she said all those nice things.

I just need help figuring out what is going on. It sounds like she could have been trying to manipulate me, but I see no reason for her to do so. From what I can tell, manipulative people tend to stick around right? She essentially did something comparable to love bombing then jumped ship. 

Also to clarify, after letting her know about those activities I have not sent anything else to her. I plan on leaving at that. I am trying to move on, but I keep thinking ""What if she reaches out again? What do I say?"" Stuff like that. Any ideas on how to move on or what the heck happened?

I‚Äôm 23 and I‚Äôve had maybe two serious relationships each lasting in the ballpark of two years, and a couple others in the 6 month range. 
Almost two years ago now my girlfriend and I split up while we were in nursing school. Between my fuck ups, the ways in which she let me down, and the terroristic stress of school - we were not able to make things work. 
It took me some time to get past that whole situation but I did eventually, and actually started casually dating a women who I had gone to high school with seven years ago or so. She was both better looking and more intelligent than me (what more can you ask for) but I often found myself with little motivation to see her, and nothing to talk about - and so I ended things after about 6 months. 
And this is sort of where I find myself. I often feel that the company would be nice, but I have so little motivation to find a partner. I feel like this is the opposite of how a 23/24 year old male should feel? 
Granted I am awful (really really) at speaking with women in general - but this has never been an issue when I find someone that I click with. 
It doesn‚Äôt help that I live in a small-ish town - hence dating a girl I had been in high school with.. There‚Äôs lots of people, but growing up here you quickly feel as if you‚Äôve met just about everyone. In fact I almost never meet someone who I‚Äôm not somehow acquainted with through someone else. 
I‚Äôm just starting my career as an RN so I likely won‚Äôt be moving for a couple years.  I‚Äôm living in a lovely little farm house with my dog and a roomie, and I‚Äôve got plenty of hobbies to keep me busy.

I think part of it is that I am exhausted by them and don‚Äôt want to put in another two years just to be left sad for 8 months.

I‚Äôm someone that has been through all the toxic stages within a relationship. And I dealt with all of these in one long relationship. Such as emotional manipulation, emotional abuse, gaslighting, exchange of insults, been cheated on, lied to and more. My past relationship was more than enough for me to know the type of relationship I wanted and also gave me better judgement of character with others so I knew who I‚Äôd want to be with. 

I finally got the girl of my dreams. Someone that always wanted to talk to me, someone that‚Äôs always there for me when I needed them to be, and also someone that resonates with me. She had been through the same traumatic relationship experiences as I am which made her understand me more. We could confide in each other when worried or afraid. I‚Äôd always give her closure when she thought I was doing such that her exes did. And she would also do the same. We would convince each other at the end of the day. 

There‚Äôs something that was just off. I had noticed that she would add me to her private story and remove me at random times. She has done this on Snapchat multiple times. About 3-4 times. Just to be clear, I had never asked to be on her story or not. She just added me. There was a time where we got into a misunderstanding and I had been completely removed and I brought it up and she told me that she had not removed me. She sent a screenrecording showing that she hadn‚Äôt and It showed I was still there but I didn‚Äôt believe because she could‚Äôve added me when I brought it up. She then asked me ‚ÄúWhy would she remove me?‚Äù She seemed genuinely confused. And that‚Äôs exactly what I thought too because this girl is the sweetest and best girl ever. But me being in that unknown, especially because my ex did such and hid a lot of stuff from me, made me feel so afraid of what else she was doing after cheating. But I came to realize that this is not my ‚Äúex‚Äù and I shouldn‚Äôt ruin it over some toxic person in the past. She then comforted me and we forgot about it.

I then noticed that I had been removed from her Instagram close friends story twice. It happened once, and I tried not to think about it. But the second time, which is today I just can‚Äôt help to wonder. What could she be posting that would cause her to remove me and then add me back later. Just to be clear, I had never asked to be in her close friends as well. I‚Äôm genuinely confused. Should I be worried? We spend everyday talking to each other, laughing, loving, flirting and it‚Äôs just so great.

An insight I gained today is that the key to success in dating is to not be afraid to lose them-  thats why being very into someone is also the biggest risk.

In the beginning of dating someone, you are your most attractive self and have nothing to lose ! However, when you become more and more into someone, insecurity plays up and often your behaviour changes, making you inauthentic, clingy, needy, scared to open up. And this I think is the reason why a lot of dating fails even though you guys would be great matches.

In the morning he started texting me, inviting me to London, saying that he would pay for the whole trip and stuff. I forgot about it because usually I don‚Äôt take such kinds of offers seriously.

Then a couple of months later I just thought about him for a sec and texted back asking how he was doing, and he said that he was coming again from London to my city for some business purposes.

We met again, and spent 2 days together. It was really cool, and I actually understood that I liked him.

So just because ur a dude ur chance of getting a match is about 1.65% (11%*15%)

If your a girl on the other hand ur chance of getting a match would be 44.5% (89%*50%) 

So let's say a guy has 2 matches, for a girl that would be the equivalent of around 50.

So for guys it's a huge competition, if your not having a Rolex, a six pack and 5000 followers on insta. U won't have much luck here.

We met online during a class and hit it off pretty well. We would often end up texting/calling/watching shows on zoom etc... We did this throughout 2021 and it was fairly consistent. We would often stay up late at night (anywhere between 4-7am) just calling. Unfortunately due to covid restrictions and her being an international student we did not have a chance to meet up. However, I had a feeling that the attraction was mutual and was looking forward to the day we met up in person.


Well, last Friday we finally got the chance to meet up in person, and we went to the arcade at night. Things went OK for the most part, but in hindsight, I'm not sure whether I messed up, whether she's just not interested, or whether there's still hope. I'll summary a few key points:


1. Firstly for context, she is shy and allegedly inexperienced when it comes to dating (she's told me she has never had a bf before), and she also comes from a more traditionally conservative country when it comes to romantic relationships


2. When we were walking side by side, she seemed to be ok with walking pretty close to me, to the point where our arms would constantly brush (is this a sign of interest or was she just oblivious?). This occurred throughout the night, even after the awkward bits you're about to read. 


3. She told me she wanted to get drinks when we first entered the arcade despite telling me in the past that she's not big on drinking alcohol. And we were meeting for the first time at night. I wasn't feeling like drinking so I suggested we get something non alcoholic. 


4. I tried initiating and escalating physical contact throughout the night, starting with short hand on back and light arm nudges (when joking) while we were walking to the arcade. In the arcade that escalated to light arm touches, more arm on back and the occasional arm around her shoulder for a few secs. She didn't seem uncomfortable with it (or was she trying to save me face...) and would occasionally give me a light touch back too, and since it seemed like she was having such a fun time during the arcade (laughing to the point of leaning forward and bending over) , I decided to escalate things further.


5. After we left the arcade and walking to the bus stop, I just said fk it and went for it, putting my arm around her shoulder again, this time intending to leave it on there for an extended period (in hindsight might have been a little random/unexpected). Her response? I had a feeling that she started walking a little faster. However I wasn't sure if it really was that or if it was all in my head - I tried again 5 mins later and felt like she responded in the same way, so I decided to not touch her anymore.


6. While walking her home I gave her a compliment and called her cute. It was kinda outta nowhere and you could definitely say it came out a little awkward. But I felt like telling her that and I went for it. She didn't look at me, acknowledged it briefly and tried changing the subject.



So...what do ya'll think? Should I try and pursue her further or is she not really interested? Or could she perhaps be interested but wasn't sure how to really respond to my advances due to her lack of experience/shyness?

Tldr; Her (26) and I (23)M worked it out and talked about it and she explained to me what she meant. I still feel incredibly hurt and betrayed, that she was willing to leave me this fast though. 

Long story short, there was an altercation between me and a shared friend of ours.. lets call her Zero (I don‚Äôt trust Zero nor do I like her due to some personal issues that happened in the past).
 Anyway, there were four of us at the bar  Zero, me, my gf and a third friend. It was a heated argument and Zero asked me ‚ÄúDo you think im gonna r*pe your gf if we‚Äôre alone‚Äù I ignored her and disregarded what she said because it was so incredibly stupid and triggering. 
Then the third friend asked me right away ‚ÄúDo you trust ur gf‚Äù to which I responded yes, and then she proceeded to ask ‚ÄúDo you trust Zero‚Äù I responded no. 
When I answered the 2nd question in my head it was a totally different question, not connected or related to what Zero had said previously about r*pe, I had disregarded what she said completely, I was just answering the question generally, that I don‚Äôt trust her in general, but Zero thought I was answering to her saying she‚Äôd r*pe my gf.
Anyway this happened almost a month ago, last week Zero was with my gf and she had a break down and told my gf how could you be with someone who thinks your close friend might r*pe you? Etc etc.

When my gf told me about this 
misunderstanding, I immediately explained to her this isn‚Äôt what I meant and that i‚Äôd never think such a thing, and I told her I‚Äôm willing to explain to Zero what I meant and fix this misunderstanding. 
 I explained to my gf everything that was going on in my head in details, and explained to her that it‚Äôs a miscommunication problem, Zero understood one thing and I understood the other.

Then I asked her ‚ÄúDo you want to end things‚Äù she answered with ‚ÄúI dont know‚Äù which hit me like a ton of bricks; Because this whole thing is literally a miscommunication problem, and a misunderstanding and she was so fast to pull the trigger, claiming that when it comes to r*pe there‚Äôs no room to ‚Äúwiggle‚Äù around, which i agree with but this wasn‚Äôt even what happened, because I explained it to her. I wasn‚Äôt even the one who used the word r*pe, and she knows I‚Äôm not the kind of person who‚Äôd use that word lightly.
Then a few hours later she said ‚ÄúI want to take a break because you disrespected my friend‚Äù which is not true. Not trusting someone is not disrespectful, i simply do not trust Zero, to me she is an untrustworthy person and I‚Äôm entitled to my own opinion. 
Anyway we worked out this whole thing, and it‚Äôs been a few days now and we‚Äôre good but every time I remember how she almost ended things with me over a misunderstanding I feel like shit.

I don‚Äôt even know if I can really call it a date, but me and a girl from work are grabbing dinner together in a few hours and I‚Äôm absolutely terrified. I‚Äôm 23, a virgin and I‚Äôve never been on anything remotely resembling a date. I‚Äôm really into her too and I‚Äôm just so damn nervous. 

I thought I was getting mixed signals from her. A few months back after a flirty kind of vibe had built between us she started messaging me outside of work, she kind of jokingly suggested we should grab drinks sometime, and I brushed it off because I was scared and sure she couldn‚Äôt be into me. I thought I‚Äôd missed my chance; after that she‚Äôd take days to reply to my messages and she was off work for a while, so I thought it had died down.

Recently though the vibe‚Äôs been building and building again and after a few more joking drinks suggestions from her, I asked her seriously if she wants to grab a drink with me when we both have time. She said yes and that she‚Äôd let me know when she had days off, but she never followed up on it. Again, I assumed it must all be in my head and that she wasn‚Äôt into me.

But last week we were finishing up work and she left the room and came back in and was like ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know why I had to leave the room to ask this but do you want to grab dinner with me after we finish?‚Äô I had other plans so couldn‚Äôt, but told her I would definitely be up for it. She also mentioned that she hadn‚Äôt forgot we had drinks plans anyway, which was nice because I thought she‚Äôd forgot. The way she had to seemingly psyche herself up to ask me for dinner was kind of heartwarming, I thought that was a pretty clear sign she‚Äôs into me too a little.

Her message replies still haven‚Äôt been great but she‚Äôs now always dropping little hints that seem designed to get us to hang out; she said she wants to see a movie but has nobody to go with so I offered to take her, stuff like that.

Anyway, I‚Äôm scared. My mind is going crazy. What if she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a date and just sees it as a hang out and I‚Äôve read the situation wrong? What if she does think it‚Äôs a date and I fuck up, or it‚Äôs somehow awkward or, even scarier, it goes well and we go on more dates and I have to tell her I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing romantically or sexually? Should I offer to pay? If I offer and she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a date she‚Äôll probably think that‚Äôs weird, if she does think it‚Äôs a date and I don‚Äôt offer she‚Äôll probably think I‚Äôm an asshole.

I‚Äôm just really into her and really hope it goes well, but I‚Äôm just so caught up in my head.

But how can an 8-10 year old even respond to this? I was like so confused that someone could love me? So what did my 8 year old self do? Yeah completely ignored her words and affection, Like I said before how could I digest that she liked me at that time. It was like there was nothing wrong about her. She was a sweet and cool girl. But I found it very nerve wracking and scary that she liked me so ignored her. Even though I did not want to hurt her in a bad way. 

She got pretty hurt by this action that I did. There was no beef or hate between us both, we just keep on living our lives as usual. But that was like two decades ago, nowdays she got a boyfriend and Im actually happy for her that she found a guy that love her.

Four months ago when I was walking around in the city I stumbled upon her. I said hi and she said hi. We talked about on what was going on in our lives, you know the normal stuff like ""Where are you working now"" and et cetera. And our conversation went well. And she responeded that I have growned more as a person and ""moved out of my shell"" and that I speaked more confidently than I did before back in elementary school. But at the same time she had like this passive agressiveness towards me because of I was back in elementary school. I could feel it ""in the air"" that she did not like me today even though that I have growned as person. 

But what is this hate towards me?  She now has a boyfriend that love her, and she loves him. Why are she mad about me growing as a person and living life and being more confident in the person that I am. It's like she resent previous version of me. Help me understand this situation???

‚Ä¢ She liked me in elementary school, and I even like her also. But was very afraid of love at that point

This cute girl that started at my work a few months back and I started chatting ever since she started. We always give each other hugs, she's always flirting with me and checking up on me while at work and always trying to make sure I notice her. --‚Äê------------------------------------ Well we recently started texting. She doesn't respond much due to her having 2 jobs, due to not having much money.

Understandable- a co-worker/my employee that I manage has also been chatting with her and I overheard a conversation that they plan on meeting over the weekend and hanging out. She mentioned to me she wants to grab dinner but when I set up a time and day she says she will text me and let me know. She never texted me. She did mention to me that she is wanting to take it slow since she has been married and divorced twice now.

So far this week I've been keeping it very short, only speaking to her if we cross paths at work and keeping it very minimal just to test the waters. She has been looking at me and smiling but hasn't really came up to me to talk. Not even that she forgot to let me know about meeting.

Just has been giving me the eye like wtf, why haven't you said anything to me. I mentioned to her kinda jokingly she never let me know about meeting and she said she knows and that she had to work all day and she will let me know when we can meet for dinner. The co worker she talks to alot, I think the conversation I have with her she tells the co worker. So it's like a 3 way conversation for some reason. How would you deal with this.
