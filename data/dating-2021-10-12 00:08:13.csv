0,q6eqgx,1634015335,Was I right in ghosting this girl? Gold digger possibly user?,"I'm 24 I have schizo affective disorder anyways In the middle of 2020 I had to be hospitalized there I met a girl I told her I was bisexual and we got along good. When I was released from the hospital I contacted her I got her IG then we would keep up with each other through instagram for a year so far. Anyways I ended talking to her we had great conversations she ended up asking me for 40 dollars for her phone bill she said she was struggling financially.

During our conversations I had mention to her that I had kissed girls and guys but It never felt right because our kissing was mismatched then she said ""well you have me"" and then I asked her is she asking me out? She said yeah she wanted to go to the movies anyways after a day later we start talking about dating apps and then she gets on bumble and matches with a guy start going on dates with him I didn't really care because weren't talking about anything serious. I ended up blocking her and deleting her number because I felt like she was using me for money and I was saying to myself why am I giving you money and we aren't dating? 

Also I gave her 150 dollars before in 2020 for her corrections officer cause she was risking going to jail from her situation of how she ended up in the hospital in first place but I felt I was justified in ghosting her first I give you 150 then you ask me for 40 dollars? 

Gold digger or no?

Had the app for about 2 months now but I started all over again a lil over 2 weeks ago with new acc and way better pictures and got platinum which helped me out a lot. Still manage to mess up 
Even with the amount of woman I texted.

Unfortunately I still have yet to go on a date (never been on one). Most of the woman I text end up ghosting me at some point or just softly reject me and the one woman I did meet up with gave me strong hints she wanted to take things further the first night we met at 2am (ik im clueless) but I was so oblivious and new to this that afterwards she ended up blocking me lol. 

For context, I moved to the city about 2 years ago and don’t have much experience with woman at all and now I have woman usually just complimenting my looks on these apps and have lots of numbers but at some point the convo just dies out early on…

I met someone who is presumably DTF and she said she wanted to meet up in the night after her job and I messed up. She sent me snaps throughout the day as a way of giving hints that I should hit her up and confirm but for some reasons I didn’t follow up. I honestly don’t know why. I got into some family drama today which made me unmotivated to do anything. Plus something about it just didn’t seem real after soo many failed attempts if that makes sense lol.

After all this headache of getting ghosted by lots of woman, I now realize I just did the thing I despise the most. I don’t know, I just thought I type this out.

The men my parents and family show me are all established engineers or doctors in their 30s. Like I don't need your money I'm an engineer I can take care of myself. Also all my aunt's that just last year we're saying ""don't worry Amira you have time"" are now telling me I'm getting old for marriage as I will be turning 23 in February. 

Add to it I recently lost my virginity to a guy in my class who is black with 0 appetite for the Quran. So obviously my parents won't approve. And I'm stuck continually having sex with him because I'm so addicted. If my parents find out they will disown me. 

I'm a traditional woman but this idea is so stifling, these men are 30 plus and they got to live their life. Why can't I?

 She has 2 kids and has a mediocre job and a little apartment. I have a decent job, house and car. I honestly don't mind certain things as she is very sweet and a good mother to her children. But there's some stuff I don't like.

Every night she wants me to bring home a Wawa gobbler sub with extra mayo toasted and a bag of Zapps Voodoo chips. I bring it to her and she gives the cutest ugly gap toothed smile. I find that adorable. But then she starts to lip smack and talks to herself a little. I even catch her forcefully digging her toes into the carpet. This will usually last 45 minutes. She does this generally several nights a week. She doesn't even brush her teeth afterwards before bed.

And the last several weeks during our intimate time while the kids sleep, all she wants to do is rub tongues for 32 minutes before intercourse. She will set her timer for 32 minutes and we will tongue kiss. But the last few times she has tried to put a cereal spoon in my butt. I'm uncomfortable and this crosses the line. She tells me to not be a square and to live a little.

We’ve only been on one date (It didn’t go that well but it was ok I guess) mainly due to us barely talking since she barely texts back. I suggested some ideas for another date and she said wanted to get to know me better. I felt the same way so I said we could FaceTime and talk on the phone too she said that sounded great and I told her to just let me know when and she didn’t reply until a day and a half later talking about something completely different. Sunday night I asked if she was free this Saturday and she literally texted me back as I’m typing this a day later and said “Depends… Lol whats up”.

For some background I have only had 1 relationship and it was my high school sweetheart we dated 5 years and broke up after the first year of college. At the time I was doing a lot of drugs, didn’t have passion for anything or much going so that’s probably why she left me for other guys and such. 

For a few months after the breakup I had a few one night stands, met new people and people were generally into me when they found out I was single. 

Now, 2 years later. I have changed my life. I meditate, have passion for music and computer science, gained 25lbs while working out consistently, gained confidence and worked on my virtues in general. 

What’s weird now is now that I’ve started focusing more on myself, dating has become harder. Women I match with on apps always tend to add me on snap then ghost/orbit. Women in general just seem to talk to me less nowadays. 

I’m starting to feel like it’s something with my personality or because I’m shorter. I have become an overall nicer and healthier guy so I’m lost and need some tips.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6fm0r/havent_dated_for_2_years_and_need_some_help/

i broke it off with him after hanging out a third time after we smoked a bit and watched a movie. i just felt so embarrassed in myself being in that situation but i don’t know why, and it’s completely directed at myself. he was so sweet and sometimes i want to reach out to him again to give it another chance but i don’t know if i’m crazy for wanting to take this risk.

Well now that its been almost three months of seeing each other and going on dates and growing a lot closer to each other I really want him to be my boyfriend. I want to broach the topic but I am being a little nervous and stubborn.

20,q6gztx,1634024844,I think I’m catching feelings.. but,"Posted in Relationship advice just adding some more context 

Last week I met a girl at a bar and we really hit it off, we spent the night and next day together and just chilled and watched movies (no sex), spent a few days together this weekend too, plan on hanging out tomorrow and next weekend. We really hit it off, clicked on every single level and just feels like something I never felt before. 

The kicker is I’m in the process of getting a divorce. My soon to be ex both agreed and are doing a civil uncontested divorce and already split our belongings, hopefully just another month or two before it’s finalized. I told myself I wasn’t gonna get myself into anything again after, but it just feels right. It’s definitely early, I also explained everything to her and was honest and we both agreed to wait to do anything sexual which we both respected. She told me the other day she likes what we have going on and I told her I do too, I laughed more in a week with her than I did in my entire previous 4.5 year relationship, I feel like I’m actually being myself instead of pretending to be someone else like I was doing in my marriage because my partner liked that me and not this real me. I was able to open up to her about my depression and that kinda stuff without being scolded for it. This new girl makes me feel wanted and like I matter. I never once felt like that before. I’ve known her for about 10 days and feel like I’ve known her my entire life, I told her that and she said she feels the same way. We’re always just smiling and laughing together which is something I never had before in a relationship. 

Is this considered catching feelings? Or is it just the feeling of all the things I’ve never felt before mixed all into one? What should I do from here? Wait and give it a chance?

However after all this, sometimes she's nice such as today we went out and she's just spent over £200 on me but these random acts of niceness always only seem to happen when I finally prepare myself to break up with her, the last time I was ready to do it she bought me something nice and started acting like she used to and this constantly happens. 

Now I'm getting a job because she's finally allowed me to apply for one and there's a girl thats working there that I used to ""talk to"" and we were kinda close(intimatly) but I havent spoken to her for over a year and since I found out she's there I've started getting feelings for her but idk if she would even still like me and I don't know what to do about this relationship.

38,q6hyat,1634029204,How to deal with rejection,"31m met 29f online. We went out 5 times over the course of about a month.

&amp;#x200B;

First two dates were fantastic. She was setting up dates, giving me available times and places, showing interest, etc. However when I would pull close, she would back off. When I would back off, she would pull close.

&amp;#x200B;

Third date was a train wreck of awkwardness. So we talked it out. She confessed that she had only been single for a couple weeks before meeting me, and there was a lot going on in her head. We agreed to a 4th date. This time she drove 45 minutes to my place. We went to dinner and that all went smoothly. I asked her back to my apartment nearby (I live alone and she knows this) and she agreed. All green lights. Time to make a move right?

I sit on the couch. She sits on the far end. I move closer, she doesn't. I walk her to her car, she gives me a tight hug and I go in for a kiss, which she accepts.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole hot/cold back and forth was really starting to mess with my head. I texted her a couple days later saying we should cool things off, and we should take a break, but that I am leaving the door open. She blows up my phone spilling her guts out. She explains that she isn't used to mature emotionally available men. That one of her exes was an abusive alcoholic. And that her most recent ex was severely depressed and that their relationship revolved around ""fixing"" each other. And that her mother was twice divorced to alcoholic assholes and that she feels like she's following in her footsteps. But that she likes me and invited me to an amusement park with her friends and their BFs. I really respected what she told me and I accepted the invite.

Day of the amusement park comes and everyone dropped out but me, her, and her female friend. I knew more awkwardness was coming and I was right. 

&amp;#x200B;

So she texts me today saying that we need to stop dating and can remain friends if I want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing has twisted my head out of shape so badly. I have no idea if she ever liked me. If I did anything wrong. If I wasn't attractive enough. If she needs some sort of drama to develop emotional intimacy. I really fell for her and I don't usually do that.

40,q6i16q,1634029521,Why it sometimes sucks to get approached in public,"There are often posts in this about how to approach women (or men) when you are out. I personally don't love being approached in public because I find it uncomfortable when I am trying to live my life. Something happened this week and I thought I would share as a What Not To Do for those who are trying to sort out this fine art.

Went to a new café this week to do some work. It was a quiet place, but the male barista immediately rushed up to serve me. He offered me a membership card and I accepted, which gave him details like name, date of birth, phone number. 

Afterwards  it was like he was trying to keep me there for conversation, asking about the book I was reading, asking about me. I was polite and maybe too forthcoming in providing this detail, but thought nothing of it and left shortly after.

I went back again, same vibe. Rushes up to serve me, again starts trying to keep me there in conversation. It is pretty obvious he is interested. 

He asks for my number, I gave it a shot. We later met up at a pub. It is OK, but not feeling it. Also he is making me uneasy because he asks SO many questions about me and barely talks about himself. 

I go back the next day and again he is up in my business. Staging a walk-by past my table to start a conversation even though i am clearly working. Every time he does this, he stares at my laptop screen which I find uncomfortable, because it looks like he is studying the screen. I am doing job applications, and I don't want this toral stranger seeing things on my CV like my address, my work history, where I am applying. I don't think he is bad, just awkward and overly curious about me. I am hesitant to say something, although I find his behaviour intrusive.

Yesterday was the last straw. He did the same thing again. Walked past me, said hi, starts talking to me while I am obviously working, staring at the websites I am on, commenting on things I told him. Finally, he goes away. I am so distracted by that point that after 15-20 mins I can't focus and I turn to grab my laptop bag and I see him in my peripheral vision standing there, again looking in the direction of my computer but far enough away that I didn't notice him.

The whole thing is so invasive that I don't want to go back to that business at all, ever.  I didn't want to tell him off because I don't think he means harm, s i will just **ghost** him because he is obsessive and I don't want a scene.

 This guy was benign but was being a creep who was more interested in feeding his curiosity about a girl he likes than making her feel comfortable as a patron of the business he works in. That tells me quite a lot about his character and how he responds to boundaries in relationships.

If you are going to approach a person:
* don't do it in your place of employment, or if you do, show healthy limits

* don't disrupt what s/he is doing to satisfy your wants.

* Pay attention to the red flags that you may inadvertently give off about whether you would make a good partner.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6i16q/why_it_sometimes_sucks_to_get_approached_in_public/
41,q6icac,1634030929,She stopped responding in the midst of planning another date.

She can be a bit of a slow texter, usually responds in 4-12hrs (while I try to match her pace, I generally text her in 1-4hrs). And even after we hooked up she was still slow, while I was trying to speed up the pace of texting since I felt like it was past the point of playing games.

Anyways I hit her up to get dinner later this week, she sounded excited and suggested Friday or Saturday but I was legit busy so I asked her if she was free a different day and…radio silence.

42,q6iequ,1634031239,Girl I had a crush on invited me to the movies with her and her boyfriend.,"Hi everyone!

So I have kind of an odd situation here. About two or three months ago, this girl I used to like shared the trailer for the Spider-Man: No Way Home film on Facebook, expressing her excitement for the film. I commented that I was ecstatic about it and I couldn't wait to see it either and how there was tons of nostalgia in the trailer. She replied to my comment that she agreed and that was that. Not even a few seconds later, she began messaging me on Snapchat asking how I was. I told her I was good and then she told me she was looking at the dates for the movie and wanted to invite me to go see the movie with her and her boyfriend. Full of excitement, I accepted her invitation simply because I would get to see the movie and her again on a platonic level.

Just a quick description on her and I on how we met: I met her at her work late last November. She was a bartender at a restaurant down the street from my house. Now I want to clarify that I understand most bartenders will do things for tips and as part of their job is to be nice to customers. However, this was different. The day I met her, my gut told me to go up and talk to her and my gut never does that. I was REALLY in love with this girl. I did things for her that I never did for any other girl that I had crushes on. I bought her a rose to her job on one of my off days from work, and she bought us dinner at the restaurant she worked at (beef fajitas). She always wanted to make sure I ate before I went to work. She brought up places we can eat at together as well.I bought a bouquet of roses for her on her birthday, followed by a custom made guitar pick necklace with her name on it. I really felt that we were going to end up dating.  However, the tables turned. She started seeing the guy she's with right now and she obviously treated me different. I was broken, hurt and I just didn't understand what had gone down. However, I didn't want to hold any grudges against her or her boyfriend.

Back to my situation, before this movie thing happened, I used to ask her if she wanted to hangout and she was always up for it, even if it was with her and her boyfriend. We'd pick a time and day but when that day came, she'd leave me on delivered on Snapchat when I'd ask her about hanging out. I even saw them at a baseball game and she wanted me to sit with them, which I did. I used to think that it was only her but then when I would get other people's opinions on what was going on, they would say that it would likely be her boyfriend more than her since he himself isn't good news and is more than likely manipulative.

Here's the thing too: she's pregnant (unplanned pregnancy) and in a toxic relationship. I've told a few people about my situation and some people say that it's good and then there's a handful of people who say that's weird, REALLY weird. In my personal opinion, I see it as just a kind and friendly gesture but I don't know if there's something more to this that I have to be cautious about. When I had these mixture of opinions, I even wondered if she told her boyfriend about inviting me to go see the movie with them. I know being a third wheel

45,q6iqz6,1634032848,Turns out she only thought it was a fling,"So I (24M) just got told by the girl (23F) I liked that she isn’t interested in me enough to have a relationship with me. I feel absolutely awful about it and I don’t know if she has a Reddit account too but she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore and I want to share my story so I don’t care anymore. Here’s a little backstory so you understand how ridiculous it was for me to catch feelings for her in the first place.

I met her on a weekend trip when I was out with my friends. We got to talking and had an amazing conversation about each other and our goals and future desires. We slept in my hotel room until I left early for my flight  and we kept in touch over social media for a few weeks. At first it was all good fun, we texted each other everyday and I got to know her a bit more and learned a lot about what kind of person she is and I realized that’s she had a lot of the quirks and qualities I was looking for in a partner.

I kept talking to her but the messages slowed down and I was doing what I always do which is over analyze the situation and I thought she was slowly losing interested over me. It fair because she lived hundreds of kilometers away from me and it’s not exactly easy trying to book a flight anywhere in Europe nowadays because of COVID. But I didn’t want to lose hope.

Next thing that happened was I fly to London to see some friends of mine and she messages me a day after I arrive saying she was in town with her friends as well. I offer to see her and she agrees and we have an amazing night together, just the two of us. It was so much fun that I thought she wanted to be with me as well. She told me how handsome I looked and how I was fun to be around while we were going out and we spent the second time we met in person in my hotel room, again.

I swear I thought she was into me at this point because of how we talked and treated each other, so I tell her I want to keep seeing her more. For me, I am completely into her. I was truly willing to try whatever I had to in order to make the relationship work, but it turns out she thought of it only as a fling and wasn’t interested in seeing me long term.

Now I’m left with nothing but a broken heart and the bittersweet memories of an amazing woman who I thought we could be great partners to each other. Why is finding someone so hard?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6iqz6/turns_out_she_only_thought_it_was_a_fling/

47,q6j499,1634034401,I don't get this girl... but maybe that's on me?,"Okay so I met this girl, we really clicked and seemed to really enjoy talking and spending time with each other. It was this nice exciting feeling and it felt very mutual... just two people that really lile spending time with each other. It wasn't explicitly romantic, cause we didn't meet in that context but it was kinda obvious (and later both of us admitted it).

At some point she became distant all of a sudden, which really hurt me back then. I even told her but she said she wasn't doing anything deliberately (later admitted that she did)

At some point I gave up talking to her cause she was distant and tried to process my feelings, when after two weeks she texted me again and everything felt as usual again. I did tell her that I wanted to talk about the distance again, but that it's not urgent.
Okay fast forward like 2 months... the dynamic was kinda bothersome for me. I do have slightly anxious tendencies but usually really not that bad, but her hot and cold-ish behaviour really really triggered me and made me feel terrible. We didn't have anything official so I admit, she didn't have any responsibilities towards me in that sense but it was very apparent that she always altered the way she acted... probably even subconsciously.
Back then when I didn't text back for even a day she would instantly mention it multiple times the next day which was so odd to me... cause it didn't align with the way she acted.

When I tried to go in the more non platonic direction more explicitly she also sometimes ""blocked"" it and sometimes went along with it. (Leading me on?) At some point I just asked her whether she'd like to approach this in an explicitly romantic way and without any further detail, let's say her circumstances are keeping her from engaging in anything official at the time... but she did say ""no expectations"" to me referring to me not expecting anything when her circumstances change/not waiting for them to change. Both of us cried in that conversation... she then said that we should approach things ""naturally"" and avoided saying ""platonically"".

The weeks after weren't too different from before but that's what bothered me. I admit that I fell for her, meaning it was difficult to approach this platonically all of a sudden but what was even worse was that she had no problem being really distant but for example after one week of me and her not talking she nearly cried on the phone... I felt like I didn't get her at all, was constantly worried about how what I do affects her and worst of all, my hopes were still up.

At some point I asked her once again, cause things seemed to be so chaotic and back and forth-ish inside of her but then she said that she thinks she made her side very clear. That was all I needed to hear cause it was explicit. Finally...
So that was like 6 weeks ago. I started to distance myself, prioritise her less and thus take longer to reply and stuff...
And she really didn't seem to take it too well at the beginning. About 5 weeks ago she texted me and started deleting some of her messages cause I didn't reply before she went to bed and stuff...
How do I approach something platonically when I still feel like I have to prioritise her for her to not delete messages and stuff like that.
That's when I got even more distant and barely tried to keep up convos anymore cause I couldn't deal with this anymore. She kept up a one sided convo for like a whole week and then gave up on it roughly 4 weeks ago.
We haven't talked ever since, and yes I still think about her... I don't think I will text her again because I just don't see it going well and it'll just affect my mental well being

I think I am fine without fully understanding her side... but I'd like some help to conceptualize this. What do you think? Was I just being lead on? Was she just a confusing person? Was she just internally conflicted because of her circumstances and didn't know how to handle this?

49,q6j8qo,1634034925,"Very negative IRL experiences with intimate partners, over being short. Advise please.","I'm a 5'5"" 26 year old male who is visibly muscular in clothes, handsome, have a full short beard, am lean and dress and groom well etc.

I  have had 3 relationships in total that have lasted 3&gt; months, the two latter finishing at the 6 month mark for reasons outside of  physicality I believe.

2 of them were around 5'1"", and the other exactly my height.

I've had around 3 one night stands, 2 were my height, 1 was around 5'1"".

All girls were between the ages of 18-21.

Unfortunately,  some of these girls have said some deeply hurtful things in their times  with me that have continued to linger and stack up on top of each other into one big pile. I give this stack importance simply because these  women were all close or intimate with me and focused on one single  trait. I'll list them.

**Girlfriend #2 (Same height, very overweight)**  \- Leaving her room one time for a date, around 4 months into the  relationship, she said walking behind me ""I feel like I'm with a child"". This in the moment left me absolutely stunned, and I didn't know how to react. As I was just happy to be in a relationship at the time around 3  years ago, I just stood there in silence with my back to her, then  proceeded to walk out the door as though nothing was said, and onto the  date.

She wasn't a nice person, I  think this comment aligns with this but... I'd have NEVER called her fat  or anything similar, yet she seemed to think this comment was okay? (In  retrospect, I hated how I acted such as much as she did, and wish I  walked out, got in my car and never spoke to her again).

**Girlfriend #3 (5'1"", slightly overweight)** \- After standing alongside each other while talking to a very tall guy,  6'5""+ from across the room, we go back up to her room in her student  residence. After about 5 seconds of us both proceeding to change, she  out of nowhere says it to me in what I'd describe as a minorly concerned  voice (it wasn't neutral) ""You know we'd have very short kids mind?..."" Again, I was stunned for a moment but then replied, ""Yes... so  what?..."" She responded assuredly ""Nothing? Just saying"".

This  girl was very empathetic with issues like body shaming and had very pro-social views. She never criticised anyone on their looks in the past,  but it was clear to me in this moment that she likely was lamenting during our conversation with a taller guy, how we must've looked together as a short couple, mind fixated on our children would look the  same.

**One Night Stand #3 (Same height)** \- This girl clearly loved my beard and muscular physique, based on her  fixation/ actions in the club related to the two. However, after  spending hours in the club, and walking home for 45 mins back to mine,  randomly, completely off topic and out of nowhere while I was lying on  the bed and her to the side kneeling on the bed... ""You're a small man"".  I audibly paused while continuing to look away for a moment to show I wasn't necessarily happy with such a comment. She quickly realised she  messed up when noticing I wasn't instantly replying, so followed up with ""I mean height, not muscles"" as though that was supposed to reassure  me.

This girl is ginger, I'm sure she's been on the other side of such a description many times in her  life... yet thought this was a good idea?

So  that makes 3 girls out of 6 major interactions, that have randomly, out of nowhere, brought up my height in a derogatory way, each time being close to or absolutely, audible criticisms or complaints.

Yes,  evidently the girlfriends found me physically attractive enough to date me for 6 months, and the ONS visibly found my physique and beard attractive enough for me to take her home (hard to show your personality in a loud club). However, clearly these comments are indications of clear resentment to this innate trait of mine, and it's not good.

\- I never bring up height in any context with girls, it's never on my mind when in female company.- I never criticise a woman's appearance, so these aren't simply backlashes for past transgressions.-  I'm quite confident and extroverted, have a handsome face and great  physique I strongly believe there is no projection on insecurity or lack  of confidence.  
\- ""It's just the trash taking itself out"" --&gt; 6  women is a decently sized pool in the 13 years since puberty, and 50% is a huge proportion. Simply categorising half of these people as being  assholes seems like a strike against the average young woman.

but my questions are:

1. WHY do so many young girls think this kind of behaviour is OK? You'd be hard pressed to find a guy call a woman he's sleeping with obese... yet here I am with 50% of my interactions with the opposite sex involving  these things (IRL examples with intimate partners/ flings, not just OLD)
2. Are  more and more younger women becoming extremely shallow, placing height as something that will could make them resentful even 6 months into a  relationship?

Most importantly:  
   
3) **How  do I come to terms with these comments about me, stop having them come  up from time to time, and not develop a concern around my short stature in future relationships? If 6 months isn't long enough for resentment in  partners to fade, then what?**

**TLDR**:  3 out of 6 sexual partners have made derogatory, negative comments  about my height out of nowhere, for no reason. What does this say about the younger generation of women? Are younger women being extremely shallow? How do I come to terms with these experiences about my short stature?

I am more ""sexually successful"" than half of my friends, I feel like this subreddit could be of great help to me mentally.

51,q6jdso,1634035534,Does Pulling Away in a Relationship Important?,"I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (19F) for a few months now. Things are great. For most bit, whenever we talk, the honeymoon phase is still there.
However, I've noticed a thing in recent times about the amount of effort and value in the relationship. She was the pursuer initially, she asked me out, hinted about wanting to kiss, etc. With time, I developed an attraction towards her and started making plans to meet or to talk on the phone. It hit me yesterday, that if I don't call, maybe she won't.
I had a frank conversation with her and she gave an answer on the lines of ""I don't call because I know you would"". Though she assured me she enjoys talking as much as I do. 
My question is, does putting in efforts or showing affection to the person I love actually make them lose my value? And if I slowly start pulling away, not calling, waiting for her to initiate etc, my value will increase? Or is it just not worth the efforts? 

tl;dr:- Feeling like girlfriend doesn't value me anymore since I put efforts. Should I pull back?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6jdso/does_pulling_away_in_a_relationship_important/

53,q6je67,1634035578,The Best Advice I Usually Get Is From Random People When I Least Expect It. (Partially Advice/Also Venting to Get Things Off My Chest) (Long Post),"I wasn't going to make this post, but feel like I have to, now that I really think about it more. I currently work with some ghost tours for charity during October, and occasionally do a lot of community events as well as a way to get to meet people. So the first week of the ghost tours, there was someone on the tour who had a really peculiar and odd energy about them. They seemed like they really didn't want to be there, and it was so obvious anyone around them could tell that they didn't want to be there. At one point of the tour, as we were walking from one stop of the tour to another, I found myself in the back of the group and they started talking to me on the walk to the next area. Me being polite and happy again to be helping out on the tour and doing my best to look kind and helpful and approachable if people had questions... ""So, are you enjoying the tour and the stories?"" They answered, ""No, I'm old enough to have my own ghosts."" I wondered why they were even there if they didn't like ghost tours or weren't interested in ghosts but since that day I couldn't stop thinking about that quote as if there was something there I needed to hear for myself... 

And then, with a little bit of communication with my guides and thinking about the quote way too much, it kind of hit me what they were saying, and the reason I needed to think about it. They were old enough to have situations or people haunting them from their past as opposed to actual ghosts. It is absolutely no secret or shouldn't be a secret to anyone that I am trying to manifest a relationship for myself, more than anything right now. It's not a ""I need this person/sex/distraction to be happy"" kind of thing that most people think when they hear someone is desperately trying to  manifest a relationship. Its the fact that I've set certain goals and ideals for myself and my future life, that I want to achieve, and I've achieved most of them already, except for a successful relationship from the ground up, and the rest of the things I see in my future that I'd love to do, I don't want to do alone or in some cases can't do alone. Its also the fact that I have a severe lack of what I would consider good or best friends compared to most people, and the thing I want most is companionship. To me this was a blatant message regarding my attempts to manifest a relationship coming from out of nowhere, and has happened like three times before with other people that I would never see again afterwards. The advice part of this post is to always pay attention to your surroundings, even the smallest details. The universe gives signs in the least expected ways.  In this instance, this message to me was to look into my past and try to clear all the ""ghosts"" that you have surrounding my manifestations, to attempt to clear out the old for the new. Its something that I'm attempting to do, so it could be a message for me.

I always have been good at pointing out messages about relationships to other people when they are clear to me thanks to my guides. I've told one girl who had given up hope about the guy that he liked that they would end up together and they did. I've told another girl over text that she would have someone come in for her as well, and picked up an energy of a ""Shaggy"" personality or look which she told me later ended up true, and I never even met that girl. I knew my friends were breaking up before they did, and I knew who the girl's next relationship was going to end up being and it was. I however sometimes completely neglect to recall the times that my hunches have already been accurate for me as well, because relationships haven't been successful for me, but there have been hunches about manifesting for me that ended up true. One example was feeling like someone was into me even without proof, only for it to be confirmed later by someone else. That girl was underage though so obviously nothing happened with it... Then there was a 2017 case where I was going to tell a crush I was into her, and my guides were telling me whatever I did to not tell her over social media, and I was set on telling her in person until she told me she would be too busy to talk with me in person, and then because I didn't want to chicken out another day I went ahead and told her in a message when low and behold one of her ""friends"" got ahold of her phone and saw it and decided to cause drama between us, so I take responsibility for not listening to my guides on that. Both of those incidents are things I long exorcised and leave in the past and dont think about or worry about, because in my mind they are resolved. But there are three situations in my mind that I'm still doing my best to exorcise. 

Here comes the venting part, and the stuff I need to get out to work on: The first in order from least significant to most significant was the other time someone had a crush on me, when I was doing a show in Greensburg. Her family tried to tell me she liked me but she denied it so I believed her and didn't push it because I already had enough drama with the incident from 2017 that I didn't want to be taken the wrong way. I saw her give me a stare as the family left after the show while I was busy working clean up and couldn't catch up to her and I never saw her again. The thing that makes this somewhat hard to exorcise is the ""Never knowing what could have been"" I only saw her that once, but when its rare for someone to show interest in you, when it does that sticks with you and becomes hard to let go of, because it doesn't happen often.

The second is how much it angers me how I've been so unsuccessful in my relationships, when an uncle I have that wasn't in the best place at all could still get three successful relationships, including having one while his car was sitting in my garage taking forever to be repaired because he wasn't doing what he needed to do to repair it. It just irks me and I don't understand why people like that seem to deserve relationships, but people like me who try their hardest with their lives don't seem to be. That's something I see a lot and not just with him which is why its so hard to let go of. 

The third and most significant one is letting go of someone who you genuinely liked. This one is the toughest because its one I can't even explain why its still around to myself. I haven't held on to something this long before but when you haven't seen them in like two years since you left wrestling, but they still cross your mind occasionally no matter how hard you've tried to let them go, including in the middle of the night during a vacation you are supposed to be enjoying, that shit gets to you and you know there was something deep there.

61,q6kgf2,1634039662,The lovely interest everyone gets is part of why they feel good/confident; with 13 years of trying the most that I've had happened is getting lied to and scammed. How do I have things go like how they do for you and anyone else instead of I? (M 25 )," 

\-I feel safe enough assuming that the people here like being in a relationship. I feel safe assuming that most people here have been in at least one if not many more than that.

Also is there those, like me, who hasn't been able to get even one if their life so far. To all those with this going on, I'm sorry that you know how it is and what it's like. It's... well, hurts in a very special type of way. I'm sorry that you personally know about it.

&amp; If you happen to be like me, who has no family, no friends or people to even speak to really...

Well, you can guess how and what that's like. Pretty much everyone'll know loneliness but, for most, it's just an absence of a partner that makes them feel alone. Generally they still have friends. Generally they still have parents. Generally they still have family. Generally most people do seem to look pretty good, which'll help them most of their issues of loneliness.

But... What about those orphans that can't attract anyone? The friendless and those that don't have family; I measure their sadness would be one that's quite stark, The things like those are so easy to spot; but I think this would be only if your experience is the same.

\---

For some, I bet it's every single day that they get new attention. new interest, new matches and new messages. Moreso for women than dudes, but I include them too.

I hear women talk about just using their accounts for a confidence boost (I guess it is some kind of nice to know that you have a few hundred/thousand people interested in you and wanting to talk to you + whatever other fun. It beats 13 years going by with only getting like maybe 7 matches and 10 messages + 0 dates/relationships)

I see bios about comatose partners of certain women that want to have fun while their boyfriend can't know. Mostly though, I see bios that don't even have anything. + There's these women that don't even show any pictures of themselves.

Would you like to know what they all have in common and what they have over me though? Each and everyone would do better than I. Not even one would go 13 years of trying to date or be in a relationship without it happening.

On that hand where dates and interested swarms and banished loneliness are stands another beside, but instead of the one that has nice things that only others are allowed, let's speak about what my hand shows now. (some figurativity here, don't think too hard about it and take it literally)

\---

\-A ... rejection? (Let's call it the modern kind, I guess, where the person asked just doesn't even say anything... Pretty shitty that's even a thing if I may say, for some reason I bet they don't like it much when someone they really like won't even say anything to them) So the first attempt, this try of mine, didn't go too well. It makes me sad, but I'm not mad about this one or anything. Sad that she couldn't speak is how I am.

\-This second person was one of the closest I've ever been to having something actually happen. However...Well, she moved away, supposedly.

(the story, highly shortened)

We spoke for most of a certain night, spoke about meeting up the next day, and a plan was made. It was really sudden honestly, but it made me pretty happy. That next day, when we were supposed to meet though she messages me about an hour before, after I get fully ready and everything all of a sudden I get some message saying that she doesn't know if she wants to meet up still. Supposedly some other guy that she had over for the morning was really creepy and it made her not want to chance meeting with me anymore for fear that I was/could be creepy too.

The reason was understandable to me, most of my fun comes from the fun that others are having and it clearly wasn't the best time for something to happen.

I really just wanted her to feel better again and have things be like how they were going for us.

Now, I'm not sure if everything, or nearly everything was a lie. Of what she said about it. It could've just been that the morning dude was far better than I so she aborted me away, Better looking, more like what she's after, rich, who the hell knows, but I wonder the reasons and I wonder the exacts.

I guess it's time for what was really hurtful here. after she talks about this morning dude being really creepy, I asked if she'd like to possibly set up another hangout, whicever day and whenever she'd like. Months or whatever from now I told her I'd wait.

She just said no and that there's something else in a different city that she wants to date.

...None of these make me feel great, but this one just feels tormenting. I don't know if it was some kind of game or just bad luck on my end, or if all was actual truth.

I feel like the one hurt most by it all though, I mean, it's terrible to say, but she was able to spare some mega-creep some time and let him in her house and basically gives me the middle finger he earned.

I feel slighted, I guess.

Now... well, she told me she's moving away and I haven't heard anyhting back from my wishes of wellness for that.

...

\---

the humour I often see seems to mostly be harm. It's what people find funny for some reason. Most seem to take emotional harm lightly and as a joke but what does getting orphaned to do someone? Is it physical, or is the effect mental/emotional?

When a village is bombed, and all the people die, the ones you know, the ones you didn't, and you end up the only person alive... The pain there, is it physical or is it mental/emotional?

What I want seen here is how hurting feelings and thinking nothing of it really makes you quite atrocious; you're quite like anyone who drone strikes or kamikazes a place.

A Warlord is what you're like if you find hurt feelings, pain, and suffering enjoyable or if you don't see wrong in it.

What makes me speak this all is the next ""relationships"".

\-This third woman was so so gorgeous, omg... It really hurts me knowing that she doesn't want anything to do with me.

To me, she was what perfect could look like and she brandished it all so well. I only heard her voice maybe 3 times but I really wish I could've heard it in person at least once. The moon on her face was so pretty too...

What was it that happened between us? Well, super simply, we spoke for about a week, she said that she likes my weird vibe, likes what I say, She didn't like how much I would write though, it caused problems for her so I spared her my usual and gave her what she wanted.

But... 2 days before my birthday she sends me a a few photos , asks me a question which honestly I hate to say that I forget, and then suddenly says as I prepare myself for a few pictures for her ""okay... listen, we don't really have much in common and I don't like the vibe between us""

... That's where this one died. I'm not sure what hurts me the most with this one. One thing I do want to say though is I don't know how she can determine whether we have much in common or not when she never really would say much and never really talked about herself.

This one... it made me mad when it happened I won't lie about that. Sad too, my anger about it is mostly gone though and it's sadness now

I personally feel like some better looking dude came along; this lady was clearly a model and I can't describe her properly. She was wondrous, let's say that.

I really would have liked to have actually know her, It torments me that that's not what she wanted though.

\---

(For you sadistic people and pretty much everyone else too I guess; you'll love this one. If it's happened to you, how'd it make you feel, if I may ask? It made me want to call tall buildings my friend, honestly... The others, with nothing like that going on, how do you think it'd make you feel?)

For this 4th ""lady"", well, I can only hope I don't come across any others like her in any way and I really hope you don't either. a lot has made me suicidal and nothing's really came as close as this one.

What the hell's wrong with her? Mmm, it's hard to say where I should start.

At first, she was promising and incredible. I've never felt anyone be as interested in me as she was. I've never felt as much care from anyone other than her or my Mother.

She, well, she made me feel loved. That's what she gave me and it's something I've haven't really felt. Maybe twice, at most.

It was fucking beautiful.

But... what I felt was false. What I felt was onesided, and honestly what I felt was only warm on one side. What I gave to her was where warmth came from and in the end everything she gave me was about as cold as landmines.

Why's that? well, it's because everything was a lie. Not on or from my side, I gave only truths and promises.

Like when she made me feel so badly about her living situation and about what her family does to her that I said that I could be the Brother she should have had, not those ones that sexually torment her with their father.

Like every stupid creation I ever gave her to help her feel better. I gave a message that was bascially ""I know that we're on opposite sides of the worlds and that our cities are different. But, if we slept around the same time, would that be like resting together?"" I don't know how that seems to you all, probably corny or just stupid or something but all I meant with it was nothing but sweet.

Fun fact I feel you should know, this lady was a 22+ hour flight away (supposedly). Sex is not why I was interested in her. I liked her sexually, she was super cute to me, but I ***liked*** her. I wanted life to be better for her and I even told her that it's fine for her to say that her life could only become better with me gone from it and I would gladly leave if it'd make her happy.

She never told me that though, so I figured everything was fine. :)

""I don't know what talking to me does for you but for my it makes me really happy and it makes me feel so less alone.""

\^ I gave a lot of random things like that and the other to her, usually I just felt like it's something she could use hearing, I know it'd make me feel great if someone put anywhere near the same effort for me and I figured it'd be that way for her to since her life was pretty similar.

\----

Between us sounds something probably pretty, I hope. It sounds like something going on, doesn't it? A relationship... Well, I thought we had something to.

I am the biggest idiot though for thinking that and for anything of everything I ever said or did for her. ..I'd... if I could go back I'd rather take all the time spent on her and just watch it disappear. I don't even want it back I just want it gone.

...I wish I could have taken that time I gave only for her away and give it to my Brother. He died before I even met her, but those bonus three months with my brother would've been beautiful and I can't ever have that.

...

(I spoke of something I probably shouldn't have, fair warning that I may seem more upset or kind of mad now, I'm sorry for it.)

She was a liar. The worst and biggest one I've ever known. Liar doesn't sound like nearly enough for what she is, she's awful.

This change is sudden, huh? Would you like to know why? It's what she lied about.

Everything.

She told me that a member of her family died recently, but this was untrue I later found out. She told me that she's forced upon and touched by her family, this was untrue, she's never been touched in any way like that. She told me that she's poor, but she is very far from poor. She told me that she likes me, that she thinks I'm attractive and that I'm even hot, but actually she just says that I'm about the furthest thing from what she finds attractive.

She even told me that she's never been in a relationship... But she's actually been in one for the last 6 years.

...

There are some lies I'm leaving out. Here's to quarter of a year wasted on the worst person I know. thanks lady...

\---

I tried to keep these all in order, form oldest to newest.

I've been here for like 2 + hours writing though so I'm going to be quick with this one.

for this final woman, I ruined everything. It was just and only me. I wish she wasn't so sudden to banish me away, but it's all because of me that it happened.

I'm not sure if it sounds like I did something really bad, but I kept ""flying off the handle"" when I was chatting to her, in her words. I never felt like I was, but she surely did, and I hate myself for not honouring her wishes more properly.

What hurts me here though is she's one of the best looking people I've seen anywhere in my life and I made it so she couldn't want anyhting to do with me when she surprisingly was interested.

So interested she even agreed to go out with me. :)

Even without the looks aspect it was still absolutely horrible of me.

TL;DR Well, that's all of my experiences really. Anything that was more than clear disinterest or pointless talking. Or scammers lol...

The last 4 of those are from this year. So since 2009 There's been 5 opportunities. All went to crap though and some were just torturous.

A lot of people ""go through"" like hundreds of interested people a day. However, it takes me 13 years just to get lied to by someone I like a lot.

I want advice for having things go the way the likely go for you. I doubt anyone's gone 13 years of active trying just to have nothing happen except atrocity.

13 years go by for me and I can't even get one relationship; 13 years go by for pretty much anyone else but especially someone great looking and they'd have dipped into half of the city likely.

Supposedly I'm kind of cute too! so WTF, I really don't get this stupid bullshite

I mean, I know why most people feel good and I bet it's cause they can get relationships. I think 13 years of trying's going to make someone feel pretty bad, I mean, there's people who don't even have pictures or anyhting that do better than that. I can try and do worse than anyone lol.

I love it...

(I guess I never actually put a question... ; With 13 years a lot can happen. For most of anyone dating, they'd have likely had some things happen with all of that time. 13 years hasn't been enough for me to get even 1 relationship though.

Instead of only being good enough to be treated badly, lied to or scammed, how can I be treated how you likely are and how can I have things go like how they do for anyone instead of me?

13 years of trying has likely earned you, reader, much. Relations, fun, joy, interactions +whatever else too. Heartbreak is likely within that time too, sadly.

So recently I went on a date with someone I met online. The date went fairly well and we agreed to go on a second one. Just before we were about to meet  she cancels on me.

I was annoyed as I was already on my way to the date location, and I said I was done with her. However, she was very apologetic and we talked through the problem and my concerns. She also offered to organise the next date so I gave her a chance. Although, I've noticed that there has been a significant change in vibe (noticeable from me).


For me it feels like I am meeting for the sake of it, and I think she may feel the same way. Is there anyway of saving this? Should I end things before the date or see how the date goes?

I'm not experienced at dating, she says she wants a longterm relationship and I do too, I know I'm young (she's 19F) but both of us have been messed around a fair bit and I've not dated in three years because I couldn't find someone who wanted the same things as me.

Is sleeping together so soon the red flag it used to be? Am I walking into something that's only going to hurt me?

68,q6lm8c,1634043540,Is she just scared of a serious relationship or not interested in me?,"Hi all, a bit of a long post, TL, DR at the bottom,

So recently I (21M) have started dating for the first time. After crushing on this girl (23F) for about 12 months, I finally asked her to hang out with me one-on-one, before asking her if she wanted to date. She seemed very keen on the idea, and our 4 dates (and one hangout) have been great so far. She also hasn't really dated much before, so the whole experience is mutually exciting and nerve-wracking.

We're both pretty shy and introverted types of people, but she really opened up to me quickly while I was still getting used to being around her. We were taking it pretty slow and just getting to know each other first, but after the third date, I felt like something was a bit off. She said she had a friend who comes back to town who she hadn't seen for almost 6 months, so we didn't see any of each other for about a week, which was fine, but she also wasn't really getting back to me over messenger. I asked if she wanted to come over to my house for dinner one night, and she said yes, but after not seeing her that week I decided we should just go for coffee again, just to catch up instead. The fourth date was great, I felt totally relaxed and comfortable talking to her about anything, which is unusual for me, and I felt like we totally clicked and it was going fantastic. I messaged her again that night letting her know I had a good time, and we should meet up again. She didn't respond.

The following night I tried messaging her another question, separate from anything else just so we could chat, still nothing. The following night I ended up running into her at my gym, and we started chatting again, making no mention of the 2 missed messages. She then mentioned that she is about to be super busy with uni, as it is her final unit and she's got a major assessment due, so she needs to ""take a raincheck until about November 5"". I was disappointed to hear that, but I kept chatting to her and when I was sure we were alone, I told her that I really liked her and wanted to see more of her, even if it was just for like an hour or so here and there because I wanted to see her and didn't want to wait for like a month. She then admitted to me that she is super scared of having a serious relationship, but doesn't want to have a casual thing either, but still really likes spending time with me. On the fourth date, she mentioned that part of the reason why she's never been in a serious relationship was that she sucks at texting back, and really enjoys her independence and alone time. At this point, while talking to her I could tell she was becoming uncomfortable, so I told her to just let me know if she changes her mind about seeing me soon, and then I left. I'm not going to message her for a few days now and going to give her some space to think.

TL, DR: Started seeing a girl who I really like and who says likes spending time with me, but is also saying she's scared of having a serious relationship and really likes spending her free time alone.

I really like this girl, but now I am not sure if she is interested in a serious relationship with me, or if she is honestly just terrified of having a boyfriend. At this point, I think she is worth waiting for, but I'm not sure if she's going to be ready for a relationship in the near future or not.

Also worth noting is that I haven't been physical with anyone before, as in never even kissed or held hands, and I get the impression that she is very much the same way, from the ""not a casual relationship type"" comment that she made, and just from observing how she interacts with other people and the general vibe that she puts out. It is possible that she is nervous about that aspect of it. We have only hugged each other at the end of the fourth date, which I initiated.

If anyone can offer their 2 cents or has been in a similar situation, please let me know. Thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6lm8c/is_she_just_scared_of_a_serious_relationship_or/

Ive been on a couple of really nice dates, enjoyed their company, felt like I clicked with people, but I just didn't like them enough.

I've also had another guy I met in a club that I spoke to for hours, he was lovely and fun and we just connected, but when he went to kiss me I really didn't want to, I just didn't feel it. 

When I describe what I want to friends they say that's a relationship but I'm scared of the thought of someone being in my space, I have my own place and love my own company, and I know I'm jumping ahead here, but the thought of not having my flat to myself makes me feel sick. And I don't understand why I'm struggling to really fancy someone. I feel like I keep looking at people so in such a platonic way, even if they're ticking all my boxes.

I would question her about things she’s told me, and she would get defensive and ask why I would question it. She’d tell me one thing and somehow the truth would slip out later if we were around her friends or family. She’d lie even about the simplest things no one else would care about, like how much she spent on a new exercise bike. The small things I caught her in would bother me but for some stupid reason I didn’t think she was lying about the more important things. I never thought she would cheat on me or do anything detrimental to our relationship. I wanted to work with her through her lying problem and tell her she didn’t have to constantly lie about the stupid things in life to make her look better or give her better self esteem.

77,q6nmsu,1634049497,How do I (24F) attract/find the type of guy I like?,"Hi!

I’m a university student and I meet quite a lot of people, and I enjoy that, but I would like to start dating someone. 

The problem is that I don’t meet a lot of men of the kind I’d like to date, which is: someone humble and hardworking, honest and helpful and stable. 

I don’t think I seem like the kind of girl a man like that would want. 

I mean, I hang out with people who party a lot (I also go to parties because I enjoy talking to people and dancing. I don’t get drunk and I don’t sleep around or anything). 

I don’t dress very casual (I like my dresses and handbags). 

I’m also a little shy around men, which might make me seem stuck-up, even though I try to smile and be friendly. 

So…I guess I don’t come across as very approachable. Or interesting. Surrounded by a group of drunk (but very lovely and smart) girl friends in a pub. 

I think the ideal solution would be to meet a potential in some situation where we would get the chance to talk to each other. So he could see that I’m not shallow or vapid or stuck-up. I have a lot of hobbies, I care about other people and I can be very affectionate with people I trust. I hope to find someone who values that.

I had a match come through over the past week and a half, and the volume at which I received messages from the person on a daily basis was larger than the usual amount from a ""promising"" match. I'll preface all this by saying I enjoy fluid conversations with matches where we both exchange messages of substance throughout the day just about anything, but in this instance, it was as if every time I picked up my phone, there was a pile-up of texts from the moment I started my workday until bedtime.

I tried to corral the situation by offering to talk on the phone, which we did twice, thinking if we did, we'd be able to get all the conversation out there. They conversations went just fine, but a half hour after we got off the phone, the messages continued. It all began to feel overwhelming and I felt a bit suffocated by it. The moment I really took a step back was when I had a particularly busy day where I was not able to message the person, and they remarked how they hadn't heard from me all day but were expecting to. While we had previously discussed meeting, I opted not to mainly because of the volume of messages concerned me where I was worried this might turn into an unhealthy co-dependent communication style.

I don't know if there was anything I could have said to the person to remedy that, though, such as telling them I appreciated messaging, but could not be available to message all day, if they would have been able to change their pattern, or if it would have ended up offending the person.

All I know is that when my weekly phone usage report came in over the weekend, it was up 40% due to this.

Everything was fine until we decided to talk about our futures, turned out she had no plans just opposite to me who had planned almost everything about my life. But she was not in my future plans because it was something I had been planning since I was kid and that's why I wanted to talk about her. Things started getting weird after this conversation, we fought and didn't make up for the first time. I started feeling she was hiding something from me, she had started acting really weird. When I asked her she told me she was having sexual thoughts about her ex also she told me she is more excited by texts from some other guy she was talking to (she had mentioned him earlier too, but I was cool about their friendship), she said everything has gotten monotonous. After hearing all this I was broken. So I told her let's take a week off think through this.

After a week we met at a party. She asked me how I was, and said ""what are we going to tell others"" this broke me even more. I was thinking of fixing things up but It seemed like she didn't wanted to. So we talked once again and decided to stay friends. I let her go because I didn't wanted to be someone who is suffocating in a relationship. 

We texted each other once or twice a week. This went for 4 months. When we started talking a lot again. 

At this point of time I was thinking that maybe she never lost her feelings. My feelings were always there all this time I was just trying to deny them because I wanted to move on. So once again we talked wether we could workout it out again. But she burst in tears and told me she slept with THAT guy after a month of our breakup(the one i mentioned earlier) and that guy moved to some other city and just left her. She said now she's realised the worth of our relationship and now she's ready to do anything for me, she just wants to get back. But I told her I couldn't now. And we again decided to stay friends.

Now ! I know that she's my best friend. She's the only one I've always shared everything with. As a friend I accepted what she did but as a boyfriend I won't be able to. Now we do have normal conversations and we can hangout normally. But still everytime I see her i get thoughts about what things she might have did with that guy. It was a perfect relationship why it had to be ruined this way. 

She wants to get back now but I don't want to. She says things like ""I will always wait for you"" ""it's you or no one"". But I don't know what to do. Iam too broken to get back with her.

We met back in January and started hanging out a lot. We connected and had fun being together. We made it official couple months later but we both knew he was going to leave for school across the country. We ended up breaking up after realizing long distance was going to be difficult and didn’t want to end up hurting one another. Yet, after breaking up we still hung out and acted like a couple. Brought me around his friends and coworkers who considered me his girlfriend. He would even mentions future plans with me. I had the blanket from our first date and offered to give it back but told me to keep it. His last week here we spent every day together and spoke almost every day after his move. Recently he confessed to me that he was on Tinder and didn’t want things to be weird between us. We were broken up and all. Told me he still wanted to be friends and keep me in his life. He knew his friends loved me and didn’t want to ruin the friendships I built with them. Then he told me his mom wanted to help me with my career. (I never met his mother and didn’t even know she knew I existed) I asked him why was he doing all this. He said he really cares about me and wanted to be there for me and help me any way he could. 
I care deeply for him but it just has me confused on why he wants to keep me in his life and even meet his mother who I never properly met. Why have me so close in his inner circle? Makes me wonder if he even felt the same way I did for him since it seems to be easy for him to keep me in his life like that. I don’t know what to think. I knew long distance wouldn’t work because of my severe anxiety and it wouldn’t have been good for me but it’s all just a weird situation. Weird to me in the sense he still wants me close in his circle and all after everything that happened between us. I really fell for him so to me is like why are you doing all this when you know I feel this way for you? If he is seeing other women why keep me around.

I'm back in the dating pool and confused. I went on a date with this guy that really seemed like my type, liked him otherwise. We go for the first kiss and he bit my upper lip, like right of the bat. I was dumbfounded. I have playfully very lightly bit SOs before when making out but definitely not on the first date. Has this happened to anyone? would you go on another date?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6oifc/first_date_bit_my_lips_is_this_normal/
89,q6ok64,1634052096,How to get approached by men,"I just moved to a foreign country, and started using Tinder again to hopefully make new friends. I get a lot of matches, but nothing’s a success yet, as you know how Tinder actually is. But that’s a different story.

I’m wondering since I get good response on Tinder aka lots of likes, is there a way I can translate that to meeting someone the normal way in real life? ‘Cos I think meeting guys online isn’t working for me; I’m better at communicating in person.

So, what do you think makes a woman approachable in public? Like, for a guy, what makes a woman look comfortable to be walked up to and talked to in person in a non-aggressive way? My friends say I don’t seem approachable in person, and kind of intimidating, and would want to change that! I want to meet guys the normal way. 😔

TL;DR: What makes a woman seem approachable that guys will be encouraged to walk up and talk to her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6ok64/how_to_get_approached_by_men/

I wasn't in town for the past two weekends so I haven't hit her up. It didn't feel overly romantic but we both had a good time - nothing overly extraordinary. I hadn't been on a first date in years, so wasn't really sure what to expect. We just had like good laughs and stuff, felt like I was being somewhat charming. It lasted for about an hour and a half (two drinks each, 7:30-9PM). She would laugh at most of my jokes, and kept playing with her jewelry (if that means anything haha). She had to go because her boss had been texting her to complete a task before the next work day - which I don't think was a lie because she is an assistant for a high ranking government official, and warned me before the date that she never knows what time she will get off work. I was also pretty ready to end it because I was getting tired and had work in the morning. I texted her the next day something along the lines of ""hope you got home and finished your work okay. Thanks for coming out, I enjoyed it :) "" She responded minutes after ""Yeah I got back and finished everything! thanks for the drinks :) I had fun""

We didn't mention anything about scheduling a second date while we were there, though she did tell me about a good brunch spot in the city. So I'm thinking about asking if she wants to show me that spot this weekend. I know I should probably ask regardless of what anyone says on here because its best to ""shoot your shot.""

So we are gonna have a first date &amp; I don’t mind picking the place so I asked what food she’s in the mood for 

She says “cheap food 😂” which I absolutely love how frugal she is

Plus she’s from a different country moving to the US barely so she also has no experience with the food in California so I think that’s good on my end 

Anyways I’m thinking of course not some big fancy restaurant that looks like a place you’d have an anniversary dinner 

but rather some diner or an iHop breakfast for dinner with a nice table we can just talk for a while

Or do you guys think fast food is best? 

My only other idea is food trucks but there’s not much place to sit &amp; talk. We also both love playing chess so she asked me to bring my mini chess set",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6oy2j/date_says_she_likes_cheap_food_when_i_asked_what/

95,q6p7h6,1634053906,Strange feeling to go back,"So I’ve been single for around 5 years now and it’s because I just don’t think I’m at the point in my life where I’m ready for a girlfriend since i am a young entrepreneur trying to make ends meet. But my ex from years ago always appears in my dreams I rarely think of her since she cheated on me with multiple guys. Her sister contacted me late 2018 to ask for help on getting her out of an extremely abusive relationship where she seemed to have Stockholm syndrome with the abuser. She mentioned me to help get her out and I did all I could to convince her and it worked. But then she kept going back on and off with him so I kept getting blocked by her so I was over it and kept my distance away. I don’t know how she is now but I’m sure she is okay but every few months she will appear in my dreams and get me thinking about her. The dreams aren’t the same, some are us running from zombies and others are her screaming to never let her go. It’s just such a weird situation to be in I could contact her family but is that even the right thing to do? It’s just strange Like why do I even want to talk to her she treated me poorly like I was a second choice to her so why do I feel the need to check up on her because my dreams tell me to?

98,q6pw4g,1634055801,"Met a girl online, second date was a bit awkward, not too sure what to do now","**Kind of a preface:** *I am 25M. I'm often described by people who know me as a little weird (like quirky and ignores social norms) but still very charismatic, and overall a good guy. That said, I've struggled with self-esteem and anxiety for a long time and that's really limited my dating skills (I go on dates, had a handful of relationships, but I'm definitely much less experienced than others my age). I got out of a 3.5 year relationship in April of 2020 and since then, I have mostly been focusing on myself both physically and mentally because I know I cannot find someone who likes me if I can't like myself first. I also find I have unreasonable standards and I don't end up having any interest for most girls I match with or meet. I'm very proud of how far I've come and I have gone on a handful of dates just casually.*

*That said, I matched with a girl on Hinge and asked her for coffee a little over a week ago. I wasn't expecting much going into it, but within 15 minutes of meeting her, I felt something I haven't felt before. Our coffee date ended up lasting for three and a half hours and went really well, I could obviously tell she liked me a lot too. As soon as it ended, I actually texted my buddy and told him ""I think I found the one"". We've since gone on one more date in which my feelings have only gotten stronger (Like I'm not in love with her but I do know that if I keep getting to know her, there is almost a certainty that I will be in love with her).*

*I've made 2 posts (*[*Post 1*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2k92o/second_date_has_been_planned_texting_in_between/) *and* [*Post 2*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3nsf6/first_date_went_really_well_but_idk_how_well_the/)*) turning to reddit for help already. I know I lack experience and knowledge of dating norms so I would love to get some more advice and feedback. I'm definitely more logical than emotional and I know there is no ""right answer"" but I love to hear how other people would approach this situation.*

**On to my current situation:** In my ""Post 2"" linked above, I talked about how we had our dinner date and it didn't go too well. However, after thinking more about it and talking about it with friends, I've sort of realized it was more my anxiety and low self-esteem, and the date didn't go as poorly as I thought. There were some things that could've been interpretted as red flags but in hindsight, there were a lot of green flags that I missed. Now I wish I kissed her and didn't say goodbye so abruptly but alas, what's done is done. 

[I texted her after the date, we joked a bit about the pizza and sort of ended the conversation there](https://i.imgur.com/qHHkdse.jpg). As I had planned, I left it there for a couple days to give her some space as I knew she had a really busy Thanksgiving weekend (she basically had a long day at work the day after our date followed by going to her sisters right after, then her grandparents, then back home to prepare for Thanksgiving with her family, finally with another long day at work today). [I sent her a quick message on Sunday to ask about her Thanksgiving.](https://i.imgur.com/C9XTjtG.jpg) She replied but then left it at that. I don't want to overthink things but I'm guessing she was just busy with Thanksgiving and then having a stressful day today (basically first day she's working on her own).

That leads me to where I want advice. My current plan is to wait a bit until Friday to just say hi again and see how her week went. She already told me she had a lot of plans for this upcoming weekend during our date and with work, I want to give her some space. I was thinking I would ask her out to do something the week after when I messaged her on Friday (I'm thinking Halloween at the local amusement park). Is that a good plan? What do you guys think?

Also, part of me wanted to message her today to wish her a good first day but I stopped myself because I feel like that might come across as a bit too clingy. I'm definitely an affectionate person that likes giving attention but I can respect it when people need space and I have a feeling she might be overwhelmed right now (that or just not interested in me). Either way, I feel like although wishing her a good first day might be a nice gesture, I think I have a lot more to lose from doing it than I could gain given the circumstances.

If you made it all the way here to the end, I just wanted to say thank you for your time. I appreciate any and all feedback :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q6pw4g/met_a_girl_online_second_date_was_a_bit_awkward/
