Some stats/facts:

43F been told I look younger. Keep myself in shape/dress well/grooming etc. Never married/single too long. I work on equivalent of Wall Street - you'd think great male-dominated field. Not met anyone I'm remotely attracted to. Just secured another job in another part of town but it's for a smaller company (25 employees and I'm now C-Suite Exec). I'm not averse to meeting someone through work but in my existing job I met 20+ different people PER MONTH and not met anyone I like in the 6 years I've been there. I am basically Frasier - I was watching reruns recently and he says ""my God, prisoners on death row can find someone to marry them and I can't find a single (wo)man!"" 

Other than working in a male-dominated field for most of my career, these are the things I've tried:

\- Gyms 

\- Tennis club

\- Private members' clubs (x3!) - the members club organised different events but not really 'singles events'. They did host a singles dating agency event once but when I followed up subsequently it turned out they had a tiny handful of men and no way to verify if they were also legit without paying $10,000+ to join the agency. 

\- OLD - minimal success but none of the questionable experiences some of you on this thread have reported either so am open to trying that again

\- Vacations (not tried singles only but travelled on my own a lot)

\- Hanging out in parks/coffee shops etc.

\- Asked friends to set me up 

I have another question: for the ladies or guys who are now in successful relationships with a woman - has anyone successfully frozen their eggs in their 40s and had healthy babies? I am fortunate in that financially I can do this but I'm also realistic it would be a surrogate who carries and even then chances of a full term successful health pregnancy might be minimal.

I'm going to talk to him more about this, but until then I'd appreciate thoughts/experiences/etc. on what organic relationships mean. For reference, we have been dating about 3 months. 

Does this mean I have no control? What if there are things I want/need - if he is not already doing those things of his own volition, should I not ask, because that means I am forcing something? For instance, I feel sad when we go days without talking, and would appreciate even just a quick text. Do I just wait and hope he starts doing that one day? 

Do organic relationships have the relationship escalator? Like, how do you know when you are committed? Are there any milestones that come with organic relationships? 

If I'm honest, to me this feels like he has all the control. I don't believe there is anything he wants/needs from me so all of these things are coming from my end. If I'm just waiting and hoping that one day he will start doing these things organically, then that makes me a much more passive participant.

For instance, I joined Bumble a couple weeks ago and I've been getting a decent number of matches finally.  So far, every single first message I have received have all been short sentences like ""Hi, how are you?""  And that's fine because nobody wants to spend a lot of time writing messages if they're not sure if they'll get a response.  

So instead of just saying I'm good, I try to strike up a conversation and ask about something on their profile, and I try to leave it open ended that doesn't require just a yes or a no.  But still, most of the time I receive another short response and nothing else.

We kept meeting up and then I asked if he wanted to actually try dating (instead of just coming over). He said he had to think about it because there was a woman he wanted to be open to still see.

A week later he wanted to have ~the talk~ with me. He laid out what he was apprehensive about due to the trauma of his ex, he was open to exploring something long term (maybe forever if it was right), and he said he’d be monogamous if that was a deal breaker for me (it is a deal breaker so he agreed to it).

Yesterday I went to sleep over and the excitement was gone. He pretty much got me into buying dinner because he said he was driving, and the sex was less exciting. We overheard the people in the apartment above having sex and I felt sad that their lives were so routine.

What can I do to make it still exciting and fun with this guy now that we’ve agreed to monogamy and to actually explore commitment? If anything, I want it to get even more exciting and fun, it’s one of the ways a relationship can progress.

What should I do? I don’t want to drop this relationship yet.

Please be gentle. Sorry for the novel. 

I (F43) have reconnected with an old flame. We met through OLD about 4years ago. Neither of us were in a place for a LTR, were both in a casual frame of mind, and we hit it off. Big time. The intellectual and physical chemistry was insane. We were comfortably FWB, communicated regularly and could talk for hours. 

Fast forward a few months and he went totally radio silent. I didn’t find out what happened until he reached out a couple months later. Life shit went south, as it’s known to do sometimes. I was sympathetic. We communicated intermittently for the next little while but didn’t see eachother. I met someone else, and started a relationship, which came to an end after two+ years (this past Jan). 

Cue reconnection about a month ago. He reaches out, we get to chatting.  It was friendly and flirty, and we’re both single. He came over for a visit a two weeks ago, and it was just like we both remembered. Fast friends. Easy conversation. Common interests.  Insane physical chemistry. We talked for hours, made out a little (yep, still hot), and then he went home; we both seemed eager to rekindle and both seemed to be on the same page re: not looking for LTR, but also not booty calls… more like taking a lover (FWB). I even bought some new lingerie the next day because hells yes girl, of course I did. 

Communication following the visit was quick and easy that night, and a bit the next day. And then I didn’t hear from him for two days.  Which, fine. No biggie. I responded, and then another two days before I get a response. This pattern continued throughout the week.  Only ever getting a brief response, no back/forth conversation, but he often included a question for me to respond to, so there was a hint of engagement. Then no response for six days. I sent a follow up message on day 3; nothing. I recently sent a message asking for an explanation (but not expecting one). I intended on deleting his contact info, letting my past stay in the past, but felt compelled to ask anyway given our history. He responded within minutes with an apology, saying essentially he had meant to respond, and that he had been busy but definitely wants to see me again, and soon. 

Now, I’m not as invested at this point as I was last time. And yes, I came to understand the circumstances of that situation, but I had been devastated at the time.  I think I needed him to come out the gate strong in initiative here, given our past, and especially if I was going to share my bed with him. And this feels disrespectful. My spidey senses are on edge, telling me something is off, but I’m not certain if that’s the situation, or if it’s me over thinking it.  If he were a new connection, I’d have already sailed that ship. It’s our history, and missing his friendship+ and connection that’s giving me pause. 

Is this what a normal start to FWB looks like? I’m usually a “three days no response? No dice” kinda girl with OLD, but this one is throwing me for a loop. I don’t expect daily communication, but is it unreasonable to expect something a little more responsive than this?

I’ve been on a few dates with a sweet man who lives a few hours away. We both love nature and the outdoors. The first date was a simple hike. Some brief hand holding. A pileated woodpecker swooped by us. 

On the second date, we had a picnic by the river. We found a nest of Great Horned owls and observed them for a time.We sat and talked and ate, getting to know each other better and watching folks out at the park for a Sunday stroll. He let his hand rest on my lower back. I asked if he’d like to lay his head in my lap, and I scratched his head and rubbed his neck and shoulders. We hugged goodbye. And I gave him a few plants for his garden. 

On the third date, we went sailing in a little Sunfish sailboat. We navigated the waters, found a little island filled with birds, glided along the Gulf of Mexico. We laid on the beach together afterwards, kissed a bit, snuggled, fed each other cherries and gazed at the clouds. 

Our fourth date is coming up. We are staying for two nights on a Sail bnb- a sailboat that has been converted into a floating Airbnb. It is very basic- it includes a bed, a dinette, a battery operated fan, and a cooler of ice. That’s it. We’ll use a dinghy to ferry ourselves and whatever we bring onboard. There’s no bathroom or AC, although there is a truck stop nearby (LOL). We’re both ok with roughing it.

After getting out of a 10 year marriage, I decided to sign up for tinder. I’ve talked to a few guys here and there, but recently met a guy who seemed really cool and we had a lot in common. He asked me out to dinner after chatting for a couple days, and we met at a restaurant last night. 

From my perspective, we had a great time. Had a lot in common had a lot to talk about. He too has been through a divorce, and hasn’t dated much especially during the last year. After dinner, we went to a local carnival, went on the Ferris wheel and some other rides, and laughed a lot and had a lot to talk about. He had taken the train to meet me, so after the carnival I drove him to the train station where we sat and talked while we were waiting for the train. When the train came he hugged me and kissed me on the cheek, and told me that he had a great time and then he’d like to see me again. I told him that I also had a great time and that I like to see him again, and drove away feeling really happy and positive for the first time in a long time. 

Today I get this text message from him: 

“My enchiladas didn't like the tilt-a-whirl, but I on the other hand had a great time 😉. You're a really fun person to be with. Please keep in touch. If there are any shows you're going to and you're looking for company, let me know. And if you'd like to come out to (his town), they're performing Shakespeare's The Tempest outdoors July 17 though August 21.” 

Maybe it’s low self-esteem, maybe it’s the emotional abuse that I’ve dealt with for the last 10 years that makes me question how people view me, or maybe I am correct in my assessment that “keep in touch” doesn’t sound like he’s too into me or would rather just keep it as friends.

She is 45 years old and got divorced 4 years ago with 2 kids sharing custody with her ex. We had messaged back and forth for about a month. Then she invited me to visit her city. We had 3 hours driving distance. She suggested we could spend some time together this weekend to see if we click. I think it’s a good plan. So I reserved hotel room for 2 days and drove here yesterday. Yesterday when I was on the way, she told me that her feet got hurt at home. She sent me a picture that indicates it is real. I was a little concerned about it and asked her if we could cancel the meetup. She texted me it is okay. She doesn’t want to break her promise. Then I continued the driving and came here. As planned we were about to have a meetup last night for a dinner once I arrived. But she has feet issue and asked for canceling. I think it is reasonable to do that and agreed. Today we had a lunch meetup and hangout a little bit. Then I drove her home. Before she got home she said we will meet tonight for dinner. But just now she texted me again that her feet is not so good. She want to stay home and ask for another meetup tomorrow. 

  Sorry for the complicated text here. I hope to explain what has been happening and ask your suggestions. Before I came to her city, she suggested I book a room with 2 beds and mentioned to me she had never had casual sex. Weird? Then I said we don’t have to live together. She suggested I can live at her home when I come here. I told her it would be too brutal for me to live at her home for the first time meetup. She agreed. Basically the meetup plans kept changing.

I dated a guy in college for about six months. We were in love, but I think at that time I was too intense for him (fair). There was fault on both sides.

A few years after college, we reconnected and unexpectedly formed a strong friendship. I got married and he was the first one to hold my newborn son after my then husband and me. We texted/talked every few weeks and hung out every few months, even when he eventually got married too.

We’d been close friends about 12 years when we both separated from our spouses. During that period we slept together once. My friend was very traumatized by his ex-wife’s infidelity and thought it had happened because he was undesirable as a man. I wanted to show him that wasn’t true, and I didn’t really regret the decision.

Our friendship did suffer for a while because we realized we’d cultivated romantic feelings for each other once again but sensed a relationship wouldn’t work long term. But we took time and space and eventually the friendship seemed like it was returning to baseline.

When my divorce was final, I entered a new relationship. I also moved to his part of town. My friend had a long-term girlfriend by then with whom he had a fairly superficial partnership. I didn’t judge because it seemed to be what he wanted. 

Over the pandemic period, my friend faded me out. He was never super proactive over the years, but he always responded to my overtures and checked in if he hadn’t heard from me for a while. The next thing I know, he was leaving my few messages on read and not even RSVP’ing to an important virtual event in my family that he once would have had a front row seat to.

I think that over the last year, I’ve blocked out the hurt and resentment of being ghosted and just tried to move on. It has been seven months since I last reached out, and reflecting on the situation, I guess I’m not sure why this silence happened when it did.

I've met some very nice women and am seeing where that goes.

However, I've also met some women whose behavior or assertions greatly surprised me.  I'm curious \\whether these represent a shift in social norms of which I'm simply unaware.  

Men dating women, have y'all experienced these?

1.  Being yelled at for: opening the door, pulling out her chair, standing up when she arrives or leaves the table, trying to pay the bill and telling her not to worry about it.
2. Descriptive dislike of your physique.  I realize no one is everyone's cup of tea.  That said, I didn't realize how blunt criticism would be.  Apparently muscles are unattractive.  They are hard, uncomfortable when cuddling, and unattractive to some women.  Visible disappoint in the lack of a spare tire or ""Dad bod.""
3. Being asked why I exercise so much.  When I explained I have a heart condition and my choices are fitness and lower body fat or heart attack, one woman made a face and sound I thought usually reserved for tasting foods smelling of Sulphur.

The second one caught me off guard as the last time I was single (admittedly measured in decades) muscles were a GOOD thing.

Don't get me wrong here.  I've also met some really nice women.  I certainly don't need any external validation to know I'm awesome. I just smile at these moments and shrugged.

But it never occurred to me that this would be a real thing.  I mean, sure people have their preferences and I'm not going to be everyone's cup of tea.  But I figured if you meet someone in person there is a certain level of being nice and respectful that we all try to maintain.

For the record I was still as kind and respectful as I could be to these women and we amicably parted ways.  

I think maybe they didn't realize the potential impact of what they said?  But I have to imagine if I had commented on their bodies in such a detailed way on a first date they would have had a stronger reaction than I did.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,52157,public,self,This dating stuff is weird and different,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/od1b5o/this_dating_stuff_is_weird_and_different/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He lives an hour a way and has made the effort to visit twice. 
Personality wise, he’s very sweet but also a little reserved.
The issue: he completely disappears on Friday nights and reappears Sunday evenings. He won’t even return a text so I don’t bother him with one. I’ve let him know that this behavior is quite jarring (each time I wonder if I’m being ghosted) and he acts like he understands but does it again the next weekend.
He’s not married, no kids, I know this to be 100% true. I don’t know if there are any other women in the picture but I guess I couldn’t be upset if there was because we are not exclusive. My problem is the complete drop in contact on these days. I can only assume he’s up to no good.

And what he said in the message was rather negative. So I replied, pretty much saying ""wow you're cheerful (sarcasm), have a good life"" then he replied asking if I was saying I wasn't interested. I confirmed and told him I thought he might want to reconsider the bunny line. Now he keeps messaging sounding like he wants to pick a fight... asking if I wanted someone to dance to my tune or what. I'm just rolling my eyes at this point. (Catch a hint, dude, this won't change your outlook.)

However, I was also extremely sexually attracted to him. I had also imagined crazy, wild sex with him. The problem was that I could never really get the words out of my mouth to explain what was really going through my mind. I’m not totally sure why this is an issue for me, but what I can conclude is that we really never spent a great deal of time together over the few years dating. Plus, a great deal of our communication was through texting. This is where I did not open my mouth and set clear boundaries.  Every time we got closer and I began feeling more comfortable sexually, then we wouldn’t see each other for awhile. I can’t take complete blame. He did have other issues he was dealing with, but other than a couple questions asking what I wanted, he never shared any of his fantasies with me either.  This leaves me with regret, and paraphernalia that never got used, because I never opened my mouth.
