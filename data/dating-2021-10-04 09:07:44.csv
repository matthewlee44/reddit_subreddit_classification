1,q16ej2,1633357314,Does He Hate Me Now?,"So I met someone who saw and respected me as a guy. Who also respected my boundaries. Who didn't act like a controlling jackass. Who I also found extremely attractive and liked being around. As a trans guy people like that are almost impossible to find. It's like finding a unicorn. Especially the respecting my boundaries part.

Anyway, we spent a lot of time together and he has treated me nicer than all of my ex's combined. Never ever left me on read. Always acted like he was happy to see me and have me around. Didn't always make me text first. Didn't totally ignore me outside of sexual matters. Walked me home, offered to chase off anyone in the neighborhood who messed with me, always offering to fix stuff around the house if something broke. Always telling me how attractive I was. No one has ever shown that kind of interest in me. And showed definite interest in me without acting pushy about it.


Then stuff happens with us. And he told me I was incredibly good. Then we kind of awkwardly pretend nothing happened for a few days or rather I do and he teases me about it. Then suddenly he tells me he wants to keep his distance and that he doesn't generally get along with people like me...whatever that means. I don't understand. We didn't fight. We didn't argue. Nothing happened. And now suddenly hes avoiding me and acting like he is suspicious of me or something.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q16ej2/does_he_hate_me_now/

At the beginning he was going through a rough time and I felt sorry for him so I basically paid for everything and now I regret that Bc it set the tone for our entire relationship. Even when he had money he still wanted me to put forth something financially. Sometimes he would make me pay him back for the dates he took me on. Even when walking he would always wait for me to start walking first before he started walking, basically waiting for me to lead us. He also wrecked my car. When I moved out of the apartment we were living together in, his mom confronted my mom about not paying the rent however I have NEVER not payed the rent I always sent him my half to send to his mom Bc her name was on the lease‚Ä¶ so that means that he took the money I sent him for my half of the rent and lied to his mom and said I didn‚Äôt pay. I always had to make the decisions about EVERYTHING Bc he was so indecisive. Whenever we had arguments I was always the one to try to communicate and talk our problems out and he would never want to cooperate. He would just be silent and then finally try to talk about it wayyyyyy after we already moved on from the situation. I wish I never met him, but I guess I needed to have this experience so I will never make the same mistake again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q171dx/lessons/
13,q176by,1633359763,"Why is there so much men's self-improvement advice, but almost no good, tangible dating advice for women?","I'm a woman and fell down the rabbit-hole a few months ago of men's self-improvement channels, and even if I don't agree with everything there's absolutely some gems about dating advice for men. 

I really enjoy a lot of The Roommates and Todd Valentine. 

Why is there no tangible advice like this for women? The only advice always seems to be 

* ""don't be fat"" 
* ""be kind"" 
* ""stop going for men with options"" 

where as a lot of men's self-improvement advice actually talks about places to high to meet quality women, how to attract the women you want, how to convey your value, how to ""keep her hooked"" etc. 

Why isn't there any tangible advice like this for women? 

I'm tired of reading that the only things that matter for men is looks and kindness when that's obviously not true. Even taking myself out of the equation, I know tons of beautiful, kind women who struggle with dating or attracting anything more than casual flings.

I feel some of the men's advice could apply to women, but most of it doesn't because of the differences between men and women's socialization. The cozmo articles about ""how to keep a man!"" are generally full of empty platitudes.

Basically  flunked a whole semester. Thought I wanted to play guitar for a living. I  rode a naive wave a for a couple years. Tried to move out of state and  had a real rough time.

So many women I see my age own a home, have done a lot of travel, have many years of building a career, etc.

When  I explained to my last date that I went back to college at 25 I didnt  know how to swing my early 20s in a positive way. I just made no real  progress and that is a turnoff.

So  comparing myself to these people suck. Like how many continents have  you been too?! I've flown maybe twice to see family haha. You own a  home??? My apartment is nice haha, Im far from having the kind of money  for a down payment...

It also  makes me wonder how Im seen. How can I spin my early 20s lmao. I like  who I am now, but I cant really impress ya with my past. If people are  cool with that then great, but part of me thinks people, particular  women, may be looking for a guy on their level on those things.

Then maybe I should date younger like 24 then? Well as soon as I start talking to them I often immediately feel a disconnect.

I  dont know if Im the only one who feels this. I just feel slightly  intimated buy some of ya'lls achievements.

17,q17myk,1633361159,Does she like me?,"Hi y'all I'm a 20yo male from Italy, (I'm sorry if there are some errors) and I've never been in a relationship before... 

I've just started going to college and I met this 19yo girl, wich seems pretty interested in me. 
But I don't know if she's really into me... She's already in a relationship but idk anything bout it.

Maybe I'm running my fantasy too much, but I think she is sending me lot of ""subliminal message"".

1. First time we met she immediately took me in sympathy, and seemed interested in me, asking me some questions

2. Second time she seemed even more interested, she kept touching me, and *ùò¶ùò©ùòÆ ùò¶ùò©ùòÆ* she also came really close to me and she touched me with her breast in a way too comfortable way. But overall she still seemed like a friend. This happened in the afternoon and at the end of this she asked me if I wanted to go out with her in the evening. 

3. So later that evening I went out with her and some of her friends, nothing special happened. A typical Friday night in company of some friends.

4. This time I've met her in the underground while we was directed to college. She was with one of her female close friend, she greeted me with a ""warm hug"" (idk if it's the correct way of saying it) and then we talked a bit. 
She asked me if I had a cigarette, and I told her I didn't bring them with me, still, she touched me trying to find them in my pocket. Then she and her friend talked about her relationship, i didn't really understand what she said at the beginning of the phrase, but it ended with: -I see him (her boyfriend) as much as him! (me). 
And her friend replied with : -When will you break up with him? (In a jokingly way I think, not really sure).

5. Ok so later that day we're doing the same lesson, and she sent me a photo of her and later tagged me in an Instagram story, still it seemed to me as a jokingly way.

I have to admit she seemed a really outgoing person and I've seen it pretty well that Friday evening. Btw I'm more of an introvert myself, maybe even a bit socially awkward, but I always try my best.

6. Now today she met me again at college, I was with other girls and we was in a study hall. She greeted me came really close to me and again she touched me (even with her breast again) we talked a little, she asked me if I wanted to go to lesson with her even if I don't follow that same course. 

Then she asked me to go with her at one of the lesson we attend together tomorrow, sadly I couldn't book the lesson (For anti COVID regulations) and I'll have to follow it online.
She encouraged me to go anyway with her in presence and now I'm really thinking about it.

At the end when she had to left us she surprised me with a kiss on my cheek, that seemed (at least to me) something more than a friendly greeting. Maybe I'm wrong? 


In the end i don't really know what to think, I'm almost certain that she likes me, but I may be wrong I'm not really good at understand woman and their signal. 
Maybe she's interested I mean her body language seems pretty clear, but she's in a relationship and I don't really know what to do. Should I say that I like her and risk to ruin a friendship?

She answers texts right away and shes acting like she knows what she wants. She told me that if it was okay if she told her mom and her family about me, which I didn‚Äôt mind of course. 

Anyways when I got home, I texted her letting her know I had a great time and told her that I look forward to Wednesday and she told me that she can‚Äôt wait either. So I went to my instagram and went to follow her back. And when I saw her profile, I was stunned. There were all these pictures of her in her bra and underwear looking scandalous. She is very attractive, but some of her stuff on instagram made no sense, she was telling me to not think of her that way, but then I go to her profile and see all these sexy photos and guys commenting saying these dirty slangs. Even her highlights were her in the same outfits and she had these songs saying very and I mean very inappropriate words. Saying things like eat me.

My question is - What the heck is going on!? She was telling me she was a virgin girl and I was her official date that she ever had. I won‚Äôt hold it against her if she had sex before and if she‚Äôs trying to do better and not be a hoe. But why the heck would she share her instagram with me after telling me these things about her? What is going on?

I didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt think of myself as particularly attractive, average maybe. Some good qualities some bad ones. But a recent experience made me consider what makes you attractive.

I live in a middle European country and look let‚Äôs say genetically ambiguous, if you see me, you could think I am a Turk, maybe an Italian, maybe a Spaniard or even a Brazilian. 
So I went to a self-described Latino Bar/Club with a few of my friends. This was my first time since about 3 years and I assumed only really hot guys get approached for talking and dancing but what I saw confused me. 

Firstly, I was the first of my group to arrive, I am not a hugely extroverted guy, I can bullshit and use some charisma for social interactions but I won‚Äôt just approach a different group and start talking and dancing. So I sat down on a couch doing my best fake confidence act, taking up space, sitting straight, wearing my black leather jacket and half-turtleneck drinking my beer. Then out of the blue, a small Mexican girl walks across the room, I haven‚Äôt noticed her thus far, I assume she walks past me and I give her a big smile as I was told to do. I am then baffled at her actually sitting down and talking to me in english. We talk for a moment, she excuses herself to the bathroom and leaves. (I dont see her again) 

My friends arrive, we drink, we dance and I see everywhere (imo) average looking guys dancing and then making out with attractive girls to my confusion. Me being the loser guy or just bad club dancer that I am can‚Äôt get any girls to dance with me and none come to me. Then later I sit down where I sat before and again to my surprise, this time an older (than me) italian girl/woman smiles at me, lifts her glass, I do the same thinking nothing of it until my friends nudge me to go talk to her. I do and immediately remember why I don‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs loud and I can‚Äôt hear a thing. We drink our glasses and she leaves. 

Later (around 3 am) we are in line to get our jackets and leave but because the line takes forever I start to dance again and a brasilian girl gets away from from what drunk me assumed was her boyfriend (probably wasnt) and comes very close to me and dances with, me again completely confused just do small talk with her while she has her face as close to mine as her size allows until we get our jackets. 

None of my pals, even the girl was approached. I have to figure out if that was a lucky streak, normal, I am secretly hot or latinas are into me. 


I have no experience from clubbing so someone wiser please tell me what to take away from this? 

How the hell do you talk to girls at the club? What do I have to do to get a dance? Am I not as average to unattraktive as I thought?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q17v86/how_to_talk_to_girls_at_the_club/

Anyways when I got home, I texted her letting her know I had a great time and told her that I look forward to Wednesday and she told me that she can‚Äôt wait either. So I went to my instagram and went to follow her back. And when I saw her profile, I was stunned. There were all these pictures of her in her bra and underwear looking scandalous. She is very attractive, but some of her stuff on instagram made no sense, she was telling me to not think of her that way, but then I go to her profile and see all these sexy photos and guys commenting saying these dirty slangs. Even her highlights were her in the same outfits and she had these songs saying very and I mean very inappropriate words. Saying things like eat me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is - What the heck is going on!? She was telling me she was a virgin girl and I was her first official date that she ever had. I won‚Äôt hold it against her if she had sex before and if she‚Äôs trying to do better and not be a h\*e. But why the heck would she share her instagram with me after telling me these things about her? What is going on? I‚Äôm supposed to be going on date with this person Wednesday and I don‚Äôt know what her true intentions are now. I know she told me she‚Äôs looking for a husband and want to be a Christian woman and I‚Äôll help her of course.  She was telling me she wants to become a Christian and that her mom and her family want to meet me and she‚Äôs already acting like were dating and she‚Äòs arranging future dates. But what do I do? I believe in second chances, but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening. Why didn‚Äôt she take the photos down before I followed her? Did she accidentally forget or is there something I‚Äôm not seeing here? Ideas?

25,q183rg,1633362550,Can‚Äôt stop thinking of my ex and need to vent. Opinions are encouraged,"I am 29yrs old male, my ex girlfriend is 24. While we were together, her family would make rude/back handed comments to me, on more than on occasion comparing me to her sisters boyfriend, he was clearly their favorite.. these comments would hurt my feelings. When I would address it with my ex gf, she would somehow make it into my fault or tell me that I do not like her family. Her mom caused a lot of problems in our relationship. A few examples, when my ex gf moved in with me, her mom first tried getting me to take their family cat into my home, my mom is very allergic and told them this often (I want my mom to be comfortable visiting my home). After I said no, my girlfriend was very upset with me. A month later, her mom was requesting that we take in their family dog that is 14 years old. To this I said no, my girlfriend again was upset. I then told my girlfriend if she really wants to take in the dog that is her choice. She said no she does not want it, just wanted the option (so why get mad and cause a huge fight?). My grandmother, who was like a second mom to me past away, the weekend of her funeral her mom and boyfriend had a trip planned and requested we watch their two dogs (14 &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; 15) years old. I had three relatives staying with me, I declined to watch the dogs under these circumstances, again, I was the bad guy. 

What caused the breakup: her grandma out of state had her 80th bday party. For months my gf and I believed I was invited, finally able to meet her entire family and see where she spent summers growing up, we were both very excited. A month prior to the trip, her grandma says no boyfriends. This greatly hurt me, my grandma had just passed and again, I felt belittled by her family. I was upset and we argued a bit but I let it go. The weekend of the trip, I wanted distance from my ex. She did not allow this, texting/calling all the time. We ended up getting an argument one of the nights (about me not being allowed on the trip), I regrettably said hurtful things and hung up the phone. She did not speak to me for days. She came back home, read a pre typed breakup message on her phone (majority of which was around me not liking her family/getting along with her family), which was clearly written with her mom and sister. She would not allow me to say my peace. 10 minutes later her family showed up to my home with a uhaul and let themselves into my home. When leaving her mom would not let her say bye to me. We have not had communication since that day, mid June. I wish that my ex could have seen my side and have had my back, or Atleast supported me. However, her and her family are perfect and do no wrong, so when I would say anything I was terrible, I could not have feelings. After a while, I stopped addressing the rude comments that were made to me with my girlfriend because it would only cause a fight. I kept them to myself and tried spending little time with her family the last few months of our relationship. This also got me in trouble.. I could not win.. ever. I renovated my kitchen for her (and me, but mainly her, she loved to cook), she would often complain it was taking to long, house was construction zone, not able to go out and have fun because I was working on the kitchen, would not come with me to pick things out for the kitchen. I could not win. I am curious of others perspective of the situation‚Ä¶ thank you for your time and support. 

TL;DR - 29m seeking advice on ex gf 24f behavior &amp;amp;amp; family behavior, was I the one in the wrong? Should I have been more easy going and let things go? If in a similar situation, what would you have done? Any advice or perspective is appreciated.

We exchanged numbers, and that very night, we had a video chat. The next day, we continued talking all day while planning to meet, Wednesday evening, we talked on the phone and set up a time to meet the next evening. Our conversations were lengthy and got personal, so it very much felt like there a high potential for success here.

I rearranged my entire evening to make the date, but when I got out of the gym, there it was: a text saying they had booked another client for an appointment on their side hustle job as a barber, and because they couldn't pass up getting a new client/the money, he cancelled. I was very understanding, but disappointed since I planned my evening around the plans. I didn't make much an effort to contact him on Friday, but he reached out once that evening, and a few more times on the weekend about how busy he was. Nothing on Sunday. I messaged him today, and so far, nothing.

This is always the cycle with people on dating apps, though. It's as if people start the week matching someone new, the connection seems strong, they're expressing how highly interested they are in you, and they give you impression that by week's end, you'll be lining up a date together, until \*poof\*, they're gone.

34,q190r1,1633365080,Things I've learned from online dating,"1) The spark is just another word for sexual attraction.  If you get the ""I had a good time, but I didn't feel a spark / romantic chemistry"" it just means they don't want to have sex with you.

2) Don't lie about anything with dating.  It'll crash it.  Even small lies can ruin trust quickly.  She/he can't have a relationship with someone they don't trust.

3) Just because the date went awesome doesn't mean there will be a second one.  I recently went out with this woman and our conversation was smooth as silk.  Authentic snorting laughs were had, and we made out at the end.  She talked about how much she wants to go out again, and then boom ghosted when I texted the next day.  That one still messes with my head.

4) Most first dates, almost all, don't turn into a second dates.  I get the impression people get excited going on a first date, but when they realize it's just another human sitting across from them, they go back to swiping looking for their instagram dream match that doesn't exist in real life.

5) Men crave youth and beauty and women crave social status.  There I said it.

6) Dating a doctor / lawyer / high end professional kind of sucks.  You just never see them since they're married to their job usually.  Sure they have a swanky apartment and nice car, but who cares when you guys only hang out once a week while they're doing laundry.  I have a few friends in those fields, and they all agree that their job usually killed at least one of their prior relationships.

7) Coffee dates don't work well.  There's nothing romantic, sexual, sensual about sitting outside a Starbucks knock off 1 pm on a Wednesday.  I have never had coffee dates turn into anything ever.  It's just dry chit chat with caffeine making people even more nervous.

8) No one is more busy than someone not interested.

9) Honest closure hardly ever happens with dating.  Either it's a ghost, or a cliche break up message.  No one wants to hurt another persons feelings, so they usually say some generic ""Our personalities just don't click well"" type of thing.  One woman told me I wasn't catholic enough since she was so used to using religion as a way to reject guys.  I'm very catholic lol.

10) If you just want to get laid, have your first date at a bar well into the evening.  A few drinks in may be enough to get it flowing.

11) It's best to approach dating have little to no expectations.  It makes it easier that way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q190r1/things_ive_learned_from_online_dating/

1. Plus a child that comes with a babybdaddy.

Meanwhile the other parent  works full time, and pays child support. (In this case, baby daddy has another baby mama he deals with). 

They live off of the government and their parents and expect to be a stay at home mother because humans weren't meant to work so much.  


2. The partner can't hold a job so you just tell them to quit working since to can't rely on their income.

Frankly, I don‚Äôt have any desire to seek out a serious relationship right now. I‚Äôm young and quite inexperienced both romantically and sexually, so I wanted to explore casual dating a bit. I once matched with an older guy who explicitly stated that he wanted to find a FWB, which I didn‚Äôt see as a big issue. In fact, it could‚Äôve been a perfect arrangement for both of us because I wasn‚Äôt looking for the love of my life either.  We met several times for coffee/dinner and then ended up having sex at his place. To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt fully ready for it, but he kept insisting, and in the end I just decided to go with the flow. Sex itself was kind of awkward and underwhelming, but being so close to him physically made my attraction a lot stronger, and I started to fantasize about how much better it will get after we become more comfortable with each other. The kicker is, he texted me the same evening saying that he suddenly realized that sex outside of relationships isn‚Äôt truly satisfying for him and that we should break things off. I was so taken aback that I didn‚Äôt question his reasoning at all and just accepted that that was the end of it. On a second thought, I found him doing a 180 really weird, considering how eager he seemed prior to getting intimate. Now I‚Äôm left wondering what forced him to change his mind so abruptly, whether I wasn‚Äôt attractive enough for him to stick around, if my shyness caused him too much headache, what I could have done or say differently, etc. Besides, I constantly catch myself wishing he gave me a second chance and ‚Äòsaw the light‚Äô so to speak... I even stalked his social media and now have a strong reoccurring urge to reach out and suggest that we have some fun one more time. However, I understand that it will most certainly lead nowhere and only make my humiliation worse. 

Basically, this experience left me mentally unwell and highly insecure about my behavior and appearance. It‚Äôs been one week since we parted our ways and I‚Äôm still not over itüòî

P. S. I know that what has happened to me is kind of ironic though because from what I read online, most women searching for commitment are often being lied to, strung along and just plain used for sex. I, on the other hand, was completely fine with seeing each other casually, but he still bailed on me due to craving something more meaningful (in his words).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q19thb/how_to_get_your_selfconfidence_back_and_move_on/

A month goes by and I bring my first date home, where I've been living with my mom during the pandemic. We had fun, got drunk, made out, she asks me to put on some pink floyd and we start having sex. But then I fail 3 attempts, even tho she was really nice about it, we laughed, talked, made out and tried again for a while until it goes bad.

The next few dates with different girls were awesome, it never happened again, even when having sex in my car out there.

But then, last saturday I finally brought someone home. It was a second date with a very nice and hot girl that I'm kinda falling for. We had some drinks, mushrooms, got a little stonned, made out, and guess what, she asks me to put on pink floyd. We start having sex and BANG, failed again.

Now I don't know if beeing in my place triggered me, or listening to the same songs, creating the same environment, or because it's the first girl I kinda got attached to emotionally since my breakup. 

I don't know what to do, how to stop thinking about it while trying, you know? After the first time I was like ""dont fail, dont fail"" the whole time.

I am not a model, but I know I am an atractive girl and we are always laughing are asses off when we are together. Two weeks ago I told him it would be cool if we watched this old Japanese movie together, and he invited me to his house. I was hoping he would make some moves and maybe invite me to stay the night over, but the movie finished and he didn't say anything about doing anything else so I didn't want to impose and left.

I'm by no means shy, so this time when he proposed to watch a movie again, I told him to come to my house, and actually got my small computer in by bed instead of going to the living room and watching it in the TV. When it was like 4am, seeing that maybe he was not getting the clue, I told him to just stay the night cause I live pretty near the university and we had class the morning after.

When I‚Äôm texting a girl, I pretend to be happy and confident. Everything they‚Äôre looking for. But the reality is, I‚Äôm lonely and miserable and just want a relationship. But obviously mentioning this, or showing desperation, will scare people off.

I‚Äôm 27 and I‚Äôve lived alone for around 10 years. I‚Äôm a natural introvert and gave up making friends years ago. I‚Äôm really frustrated that everyone seems to get into relationships so easily, and for me it feels impossibly difficult.

52,q1at39,1633369960,Dating Partners with Relationship Trauma,"Hi! 

I (29F) have been dating a guy (31M) for about 4 months. We are dating exclusively and have been since we essentially met but have yet to put a title on it. We‚Äôve met each other‚Äôs best friends, we‚Äôve gone on a decently long vacation together, and we see each other on a regular basis. 

I‚Äôve recently restarted therapy to address some things I‚Äôve noticed about myself while being with him that I‚Äôd like to improve on (communication, responses, reactions, etc). 

My guy also has some dating trauma. Really only 1 major relationship (7-8yrs) and it ended 2yrs ago and fairly poorly (she, in so many words, essentially ghosted him). Based on what I know of him as a person, he moves very slowly - not just in dating but in all aspects of life lol. 

Vulnerability for him is difficult but he says the more I share the more it actually helps him in sharing and processing his own stuff. And seeing me go to therapy and actively working on myself is getting him thinking maybe he should do therapy too. All of this I think is amazing. 

While we have been exclusively dating for 4 months, just without a title, and I‚Äôm ok with this for the immediate foreseeable future, it feels like everyone around me is almost boxing me into a timeline. Say things such as, ‚Äòoh you should be in a labeled relationship after 3 months.‚Äô

Given our individual relationship trauma, I‚Äôm much more sympathetic to his willingness to take it slow. 

I wanted to see who else has dated someone with relationship trauma and dating slowly. How‚Äôd it turn out? How‚Äôd it go in general? Any advice? :)

I feel like these timeline narratives give me anxiety even though I know it‚Äôs really up to me and him on when to move our relationship to the next step.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1at39/dating_partners_with_relationship_trauma/

58,q1bjzs,1633371966,I don't know how to feel about this,"Hi, thanks for reading this.

I(25) met my boyfriend (25) abit more than a month ago. It's my first relationship and I fell for him hard, because we had really great conversations, and we're getting along perfectly.   
He's an absolute sweetheart, treats me very well, is very honest when I ask him something, but he is extremely quiet. I feel like I'm doing alot of the talking, bringing up topics, asking him questions. I just don't really know how to place this. I know he mentioned he can be socially awkward, but he doesn't make an effort to ask me any questions. At the same time he's not uninterested. He's a very attentive listener, but if I don't initiate the conversation, there's none. We still do have great vibes, when we talk and we share the same humour.

A few days ago I've seen him expressing himself in a very vulgar language online, one that I don't like. My family has seen some of it and it led to a fight (... I might've tried to defend him) and led to them not wanting to meet him. I know I defended him, but it doesn't mean that it didn't irritate me.  
I've talked to him about my concerns. He explained some of his behaviour with his friends groups and upbringing. He told me he doesn't talk to me this way, because he already guessed I wouldn't like it. He's changing his language according to the people he's talking to and he didn't see an issue, although he said he can see my point of view. All of this really didn't help me to feel better.  
I'm just deeply confused and I'm trying to understand. Does it mean he's not his natural self around me? My family isn't helpful, they just want me to break up with him.

He made verbalized before we met the first night that he is a gentleman and not in this simply for sex. I stated I understand that men and women have needs but that I don‚Äôt want to rush into anything. He seemed respectful of this. At the beginning of the date he said he never has women over to his place, the last time was 3 months ago. 

He initiated a second date, there was a mutual attraction. We were both more handsy this time, we did end up having sex. I never have sex on the second date, but this seemed to just naturally happen this time. At one point he made a comment ‚Äúwe‚Äôre just having fun right now. No pressure.‚Äù I asked him when he last had sex, he said 2 months ago. 

After the first meet I gave him my number to use instead of the dating app. He hadn‚Äôt put it in his phone yet. So we were laying there and I said ‚Äúyou know what you should do?‚Äù He asked what? I said ‚Äúput my number in your phone.‚Äù Then moments later he said ‚ÄúI plan to delete my profile soon.‚Äù So I said ‚Äúoh really?‚Äù And his response was ‚Äúthat site is gross.‚Äù To which I agreed, and said I can‚Äôt be bothered with it anymore either. 

He told me we should set something up for this week (he wants to watch a specific movie with me.) He said it would have to be after the weekend (the one that just passed) because he has his kids. I didn‚Äôt text him all weekend because i was working but also because I really wanted to be respectful of their time together. 

He only seems to message me every two days, except last weekend we messaged for the whole weekend regularly, he didn‚Äôt have his kids then. I know he owns a business and has his two kids, who will obviously be a priority to him. They sound like really good kids.

72,q1cfk2,1633374306,How to get over jealousy/insecurity in a relationship," 

Hey everyone,

I've been dating my current girlfriend for about a year. I don't think the specifics matter too much, but she was previously out of another long-term relationship before we started dating. She has a pretty big past of sexual history in college but she is completely loyal and I have no reason to believe she'd ever cheat on me or anything like that.

Anyway, I've started to get insecure about everything. And I know, 100 million times over, that none of this is her fault, and that is it my OWN problem, and I am looking for ways to overcome it or reframe my mind. When she's out at the bar with her friends, I instantly get worried about what's happening. I often worry about the sex not being good enough for her, my dick not being big enough, etc. Again, she gives no indication that these things are falling short, it's just me. Sometimes I get insecure when I think about her sexual history, and think about how she's probably been with much more attractive men. Sometimes I think about how she's done things that she tried with other guys that she doesn't want to do anymore (anal, etc).

The other day we were out shopping and she was telling me about her best friend can be really mean to her, and said a few years ago they didn't speak for months. I asked what the fight was about, and she told me that she was seeing a guy in college and that her best friend tried stealing him from her. and that made me depressed, even though it was before I even fucking knew her! Like my brain is seriously so fucked up, this really shoudn't make me feel any type of way, should it?

Basically, I'm really fucked up in the head and it's all my own doing. Is it a confidence issue? Why am I so insecure about literally everything? I love her a lot and want to be with her but I can never get out of my own head, I'm always caught up on stupid bullshit like this.

It usually takes a lot for me to work up the courage to open up about any issue with my boyfriend because there‚Äôs always the good chance he‚Äôll immediately jump to breaking up. I‚Äôm growing tired of it, especially since the majority of these are not, in my opinion,  dealbreakers or breakup-worthy offenses. 

For instance, one time he tried to surprise hug me while I was under the covers; he didn‚Äôt know where my face was or the fact I was wearing glasses, so he ended up smashing into my face and breaking a part of the glasses. I was pissed, but the next day, I just asked if he could take me to get them fixed so all was good, or so I thought. My boyfriend later revealed he thought I was going to break up with him for that. It didn‚Äôt even cross my mind; all I wanted from him was an apology (which I did get) and to just make sure to not jump on me while I was under the covers next from then on.

Something less severe, but one he also suggested breaking up over, was the time I expressed that I was frustrated that he wasn‚Äôt ready to leave to the zoo when I arrived at his house. We made plans that I would drive to his house and he would drive us to the zoo. After my hour-long drive, I was surprised that I had to wait for him to shower and get ready; what was he even doing in that hour? And he woke up earlier than me as well. He wanted to break up for this because I told him I was annoyed.

I have asked him why he frequently suggests breaking up over anything I express displeasure at. He said he can‚Äôt stand to see me hurt from his actions and doesn‚Äôt want to hurt me anymore. He also feels like I deserve better/ a better person, and thinks he‚Äôs not good enough for me.

I feel like he‚Äôs just constantly giving up on the relationship and throwing in the towel before even trying to do better or differently. There are also bad, creeping thoughts that I have, like wondering if he‚Äôs so quick to suggest breaking up because he wants me gone, if there‚Äôs ‚Äúsomeone else,‚Äù and wondering if I‚Äôll be blindsided one day with an actual breakup.

We haven‚Äôt broken up yet because I‚Äôve always managed to reason with him or calm him down. But like I said, I‚Äôm growing tired of it, and have pretty much grown to expect ‚Äúwe should break up‚Äù from his lips. I just want him to understand that I start conversations about problems in the relationship because I believe in trying to be a better person.

I own up to my mistakes and try to change so I don‚Äôt repeat those mistakes, but I guess doing this is hard for him? Or he just doesn‚Äôt want to do it? I feel like I need to have a conversation with him about this, but I don‚Äôt know what else I can say.

Tl;dr- Boyfriend suggests breaking up after any issue I bring up, even ones that aren‚Äôt dealbreakers or a big deal. I wish he could just knock it off, but I don‚Äôt know what more to say to him if I bring this up to him again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1cr4q/bf_23m_suggests_breaking_up_every_time_we_have_a/

I think we well and had a great time with each other. But I haven‚Äôt heard from him since I went home yesterday afternoon and when I was leaving, he didn‚Äôt kiss me goodbye. 

I didn‚Äôt go for it either, I was sorta nervous to be honest so we ended up giving each other a quick hug as our goodbye and then I said ‚Äúit was a pleasure meeting him‚Äù and left. We didn‚Äôt discuss hanging out again and I feel the goodbye we had wasn‚Äôt really like a ‚ÄúI want to see you again‚Äù type of goodbye üëãfrom him since he wasn‚Äôt nervous or shy to hit on me or kiss me the first time‚Ä¶

But I could  just be overthinking bc maybe he was nervous too after spending some time with me and being sober, he wasn‚Äôt when we initially met so maybe he just had some liquid courage the night before when coming up to me. 

Well I was just wondering, given the facts I stated of our encounter, would I look desperate to be the one to text him the very next day telling him ‚ÄúI had a good time and I hope to see him again‚Äù?

He hasn‚Äôt contacted me since I left so not sure if I should take the initiative so soon or just give it a couple more days to see if he texts me first.

84,q1d24f,1633375937,"I'm attracted to a man I met back on college days, but I have social anxiety and don't know how I can start/mantain a conversation with him. Any advices?","First of all, sorry if I make any english mistakes, that's not my native language. So, I'm 23 F, and the first time I've seen this guy was back on college, on 2019 perhaps. But he never caught my attention, as I thought he was gay, cuz there were some rumors that he was, and I believed them. We never even talked back then, as we weren't even from the same classroom, we only studied the same subject, architecture. But some days ago, I found out that he dated a girl some months ago, so I think he might be bi, or even straight, I dunno, but suddenly I feel so interested on him now. Some of my friends know him better, so I asked them about this guy, what did they know about him and so, one of my friends said that my crush told him he wanted to try dating boys, cuz he was curious, and that he dated a girl some months ago, but the relationship was kinda... boring. Meaning, he is indeed gay or bi, but I'm not sure if he even likes girls anymore. He might be just curious about boys, or maybe he don't even like girls at all, maybe he had that compulsory heterosexuality thing, I dunno, it's possible. But then, here comes my dilemma: 

I felt interested on him, but I am so effin shy, and I have moderate social anxiety. Meaning, I got anxious, and couldn't sleep or eat well for like 3 days before I acted up and did something to call his attention for the first time. I did something a little stupid tho, I admit. I went to his instagram and liked one of his old pictures (we already followed each other ever since college, can't even remember when did I start to follow him), and so I sat back and waited for him to like back one of my pictures, or DM me, or... anything, whatever, I just wanted a signal back, and it never happened. He never answered anything back to me. I know, this was a kinda stupid action coming from me, but it was the less destructive way I found to call his attention, cuz if he didn't like me, he would just ignore me, and life goes on. It would hurt way more for me if I started a conversation and he ignored me, or if we just made small talk and never went forward, I would feel ashamed for the rest of my life about it. 

But the thing is, I've been running from hurting myself for way too much time. My entire life. And I wanted to try a little harder on this one, cuz it's so hard for me to feel attracted to anyone... It happens like, 2 times a year, if I'm lucky. When I do, I tend to think about the person all the time, cuz I never know when it will be the last time I'll feel attraction, heck, this might be the last one and I may never know. I graduated from college already, which means I'm not gonna see him face to face again so soon. But I wanted to talk to him online, like on instagram, I wanted to try something with him, but I'm SO bad at conversations. My convos usually last until the ""how are you? good, u? yeah, me too."", I'm terrible at this. I'm an introvert, which might add to that. And plus, I'm so afraid of be thinking a little too high. He is an extrovert, and he is handsome, strong, intelligent, while I'm below average, I'm thin, a little intelligent but not nearly as he is, and he has a lot of friends, while I'm a little bit of a loner. I keep thinking, even if he does like girls, why would he even like me? That keeps bothering me a lot. Plus, there is a chance he kinda knows how much of a quiet girl/loner/weirdo I am, cuz we went to a college trip together once, and spent a few days on the same city, maybe he doesn't even remember me there, but maybe he does. Maybe he remembers me as ""that weird girl from that college trip"". I dunno, I'm so confused. 

Oh, also, one other thing, the first thing I actually said directly to him, was like, last week (this was AFTER I liked his old photo and he ignored it), he posted something funny on his instagram, and I replied with a similar pic from the same artist, and he laughed and said ""I liked that"" or something like this. Then I said one more thing, hoping he would keep talking to me, but he just sent some laughing emojis and it all ended there. I don't know what to do, or if I even should keep trying. I feel like a teenager. Plus, there is no way I can get to him and ask ""are you gay? do I even have a chance?"" lol even his friends don't know if he is or he isn't for real, so I'm kinda troubled at this too. My friends who know him says he is very kind, that he is funny, that he is a good guy. I wanted to approach him so much.

86,q1d70n,1633376298,Is it a turn off if a guy doesn't escalate towards sex after a great first date?,"I'll try to keep this story brief. I (27M) had a first date scheduled for Friday night with someone I met online. Then Friday rolled around and I was not feeling great mentally for a bunch of reasons completely unrelated to her (bad week at work, personal life stress, etc.) I thought about cancelling  but I hate living with regrets so I just rolled with it. We were meeting for drinks and I figured I could be home and in bed in an hour. 

Of course, just my luck, it ended up being the best first date I've ever had. We talked for hours, we were constantly laughing and touching each other, we kept seamlessly going into topics that are way too deep for a first date then back into light banter. We both, unprompted, couldn't stop mentioning how great it was going. While I have no idea how things are gonna turn out, I really can't imagine how a first date could go better. 

There was a lot of touching and sexual innuendo, and while it's not like she was throwing herself at me, I definitely think we could have had sex if I had been committed to escalating. But to be honest, I still didn't want to have sex that night (with anyone!) If I had to, she certainly would have been my first choice, but I still was just not in a good headspace for that. I had been feeling depressed and unsexy all week, and  I told my roommates that I definitely wouldn't be bringing anyone home, and a million other reasons made me feel like I just wasn't in ""the zone."" I knew I wouldn't be able to give it my all, and I didn't want our first sexual experience together to be unpleasant. Obviously I didn't say any of that, but we ended up just kissing goodnight and agreeing we'd see each other as we left the bar. 

Now I'm just wondering if I really blew something. Women, would you feel rejected/lose attraction if you had a great first date and the guy didn't even try for sex at the end (despite there being a clearly sexual vibe)?

Two of of my RL guy friends ask me out in a sweet way, but i had to reject them, cuz i had no interest the same way they had in me, i felt bad but i didn't want to start a relationship with someone i didn't like that would just end up hurting their feelings.

The third RL guy friend ask me out shortly after that, saying how beautiful i was and then he kept asking questions if it was okay if I give him head, the answer was no and he still will come back to ask me if it was okay he can kiss me, i needed him to understand that i wasn't interested, and the more he tried, the more it affected the friendship, i just blocked him. It hurt to block him cause he was still the nice guy I met at high school until he was being creepy i felt bad but relieved. Now the fourth guy I met online was very different.

Since I turned 18 years old I have dated close to 40 women. None of them felt mutually afterwards and promptly went back to their ex or put me in the Friendzone.

It seems I also attract the more ""damaged"" type of women. Nothing wrong with that, but I myself don't always know how to handle baggage. Even though I have gone through some serious stuff in my lifetime already.

About a year ago I followed advice from my friends and went to dates with the mindset ""I want the date to be fun and have no expectations"". My dates started to get better and better, but it almost seems like the rejection I get afterwards keeps getting more painful.

I just can't seem to have that romantic click with a woman and it breaks me apart at times, because I have felt empty and lonely for years on this aspect.

Right now I don't know what to do. My Best friend (woman) says it is better for me to focus on my career and school. She also stated I should stop using dating apps like tinder and such because online dating doesn't work for me in her opinion.

We matched on Hinge a few days prior and had exchanged numbers, texted back and forth for a day or so, and agreed to meet up (his (32/m) initiation) - this happened in less than a week's time. 

The majority of the date had all the good signs - easy, flowing, and engaging conversation, occasional physical touching, and an inexplicably great goodbye hug (not an awkward, quick one like at the end of bad dates - it's like we got as close to each other as possible in those moments and hugged a little longer and tighter than you normally would).

However, I'm thrown off by a few things that happened towards the end of the date. At one point, he said he ""sucks at dating"" and would ideally like to meet his next partner by being friends first and then evolving into a relationship. Then, instead of hinting at a next date, he invited me to participate with him in upcoming group events he was¬†*tentatively*¬†planning on scheduling. (To top it off, I'm the one who had to send him a post-first date text the next day.)

I guess my question is, if this guy were into me, why would he invite me to a \[tentative\] group hang instead of scheduling another date?
