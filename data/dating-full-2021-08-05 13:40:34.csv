Even with being pretty much unable to find a hookup or romantic interest, I’m not going to lash out angry at women.

Women do have problems regarding dating. I know a lot of guys here refuse to believe dating as a woman is anything but sunshine and rainbows. Now I can’t speak on behalf of all women but it seems like dating isn’t that at all. My girl friends have shown me their Tinder convos and it’s just not great talking to some dudes. Then when you meet up they have to worry about if the fuse will literally kill them or not if the date doesn’t go well. They also have to navigate whether or not guys are being true to their word and aren’t lying to them just to fuck. Guys don’t have to think about these things. 

Ladies, y’all can be just as cold as the guys here can too. Dating as a average normal guy fucking sucks. We barely get any matches online, we get rejected and labeled creepy in person, and we can’t just wait for women to come to us because we’re expected to make all the first moves. Guys especially in my age bracket often have little to no success with women and it’s grating. It’s depressing. Also the few of us that do get dates, if we want a relationship we invest significantly more time, effort, and money because we are expected to if we ever want to find love.

But I digress, dating isn’t easy for anyone. It’s hard to find love for all of us and it makes it a whole lot harder when you have people telling you that you have it easy while you’re struggling. Let’s just try to be a little more compassionate to each other. Trying to invalidate others experiences does nothing but make everyone’s dating more of a struggle.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,938482,public,self,Can we please have more empathy to problems of the opposite sex?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oyhuyo/can_we_please_have_more_empathy_to_problems_of/,all_ads,6,,,

It seemed like if someone gave me the slightest bit of attention or made me laugh, I would start developing a crush on them. But I have learned to take a step back and look at it from another angle when I get too caught up in my crushes. 

For example, I got a crush relatively recently on someone, and then I thought about it. He has no job, he sleeps during the day and is awake all night, it would be long distance so I wouldn't be able to see him often, and it would be very hard to maintain in those conditions. The guy might be funny and nice, but when it comes down to actually pursuing a relationship he isn't fit for me. And it has helped me get over it in a way that doesn't hurt my feelings.

I used to get hurt a lot getting crushes that just never worked out. I started dating someone way to quickly because of this and realized at under a year we just weren't compatible. I let my crush on them get the best of me. I did it out of a desperate attempt for love, not because they were actually someone who i loved. 

So when you get crushes, please make sure you are looking at it from all different angles before you decide to move ahead with pursing them. Think about their lifestyle, their goals/aspirations, etc and make sure to put the whole picture together before you start trying to date them.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,938495,public,self,Crushing on someone doesn't mean you should pursue them,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oyi2oj/crushing_on_someone_doesnt_mean_you_should_pursue/,all_ads,6,,,

We just clicked from our very first date, then from the second one we did almost everything, we kissed on the second, got back home at sunrise, she was clearly into me. Every time she clearly said how good she feels with me. We had sex, it was great. We had dinners, romantic stuff, I could just see her letting her go, we could spend hours together talking. Then suddenly she came out saying she was seeing me too ahead and that she feels great when she's with me but doesn't feel that spark when she is at home. But we talked about it and she instantly changed her mind. Then we went out twice, did a half day ""trip"" together, where she clearly showed how she was into me, she told her friends and colleagues about me. 

But then again this time she suddenly came out with this thing that she doesn't feel that spark, those butterflies that you want to see the person, I don't understand. She kept saying she feels good with me, could spend hours together, but she can't continue like this. And I'd say she's absolutely right about this, but I hardly believe this, she was clearly into me, as she kept telling me by herself, and I can see it in her eyes, but then she randomly comes out with these doubts. So last time I tried to save it but didn't happen so I didn't push too much. 

I know it's only been a month, but she was my lifetime crush, and I had the courage to ask her out and it fucking went great for all this time. What should I do? Let her go? Even if she clearly showed interest in me although she had some doubts, I saw her really confused about this, she said all these things crying about bad she felt in this situation. If she would have said that from the beginning I would have believed but now it seems hard, it's almost impossible she didn't feel anything all this time.

In mid june I met a girl on tinder and we immediately had a great connection. I'm 31 and I have a lot of dating experience, especially with online dating, but the connection I have with her (she's 33) was really unique. So after 2 weeks of intense texing about basically everything and even our very personal problems we decided it's time to meet in real life.

On friday evening (june 25) we met at her place and had a long walk (with her very cute dog), had great conversations and the vibe was really good. After like 2-3 hours we went back to her place and just chilled on the couch. We then had some drinks and laughed a lot an the vibe was awesome. We were getting really close so I asked her if I could kiss her and said ""well, give it a try"". And then of course we kissed and it was fantastic. In the hours we kissed a lot, we even cuddled and looked eachother in the eyes and said some nice things etc. It was incredible intense. The date ended after 8 hours when I said ""well I better go"" because really late and I think we both didn't want to spoil it by having sex.

So after that we planned the next date for the upcoming friday (july 2) and had some great conversations. But in the week before the second date she told me that the breakup with her ex was just 2 months ago and it's still a big issue. It's not that she wants him back but that she's really hurt by it and hasn't really processed it. I was her first date after the breakup and she's really not sure how to go on. A few days later she felt better though and the second date was still on. It was basically as fantastic as the first one. We had a great walk, great talks, great kisses, said some nice things and really enjoyed our time. 

But 2 days after the date she sent me a very cold and distanced message that she doesn't want to date me anymore, that it's too much pressure and yeah that it's over. I was really shocked and felt so terrible because I never that coming. And I couldn't really process it because I had no chance of talking to her in person and to have some clarity. I told her that I accept it but I can't unterstand it.

But as chance would have it I forgot my sunglasses at her place at the second date. So I asked her if I could grab them sometime and we agreed for a short meeting a few days after the message. And when I went there on thursday (july 8) I asked her for 5 minutes of her time to talk about it because I needed some clarity.

We talked for an hour and she told me that right now she's like a shy deer that runs away when it's too much and that our second date was too intense for her to handle. So her cold message was some sort of safety measure. I told her again that I accept that but it's hard for me to cut someone out of my life when we just had such a deep connection and some great talks. And after the meeting I went on a 3 hour bike ride to clear my had. About 3 hours after the meeting she texted me ""that was really incredibly brave of you to talk about your feelings like that"".

After that we slowly started texting again and after a few days we were back to ""normal"" and even a bit more. We started sending eachouther voice messages and talked for hours about her breakup and current situation in general, about my personal problems and really deep stuff. This went on for like 2 weeks. Because of work she's leaving town for 2-3 month at the end of august. And she told me that her actual plan was to meet someone ""stupid"" on tinder to have a good time after the breakup and before she needs to leave so that there's no complication. However that didn't really work with me because our connection is too intense and she really appreciates me for being emotional and very intelligent. And that she never talked to someone that understands her as much as I do and she would like to continue the thing we're having on the exact level.

On friday (july 23) we had a third date and it was very intense again. This time we skipped the walk and just met at here place. Again, great talks, great kisses, nice things and then we even ended up having sex. And after that we cuddled again for like 2 hours and she told me ""it really feels pretty pretty good with you"".

A few days later (july 26) I finally asked her if we finally want to buy some tickets for a very impressive art exhibition that we talked about alot and she said yes. So we bought tickets for the next friday (august 6) and we're both really looking forward to it. However in the days following I felt that our contanct was getting slower and slower. I know that she has a really pressuring job and because she needs to leave soon, there is a lot of preparation going on, but it still felt kinda different.

And yesterday (august 4) she texted me that she has another down phase and would like to go to the exhibition but more relaxed and as friends. I asked her what that means and she told me that she's thinking a lot about the breakup again and how hurt she's really is, that she needs to be alone for some time. That she can't give me anything at the moment and she feels like she's playing with me and is sending mixed signals. She doesn't want to be like that but right now that's just how she is. She really really likes me and feels a very special connection but she's not ready for that and that the connection is just too much for her. We talked about it for some time and I told her that I'm still cool with meeting her once every few weeks and I love talking to her but she doesn't want to give me hope or leave me on the hook because she doesn't want to have a new relationship right now and she can't tell how long she needs to fully process the breakup.

After that we decided that we're not going to the exhibition together but we want to meet up next week for a short talk or walk. I told her that I really need the personal interaction to fully grasp the situation and probably to have some closure.

So, long story with a sad ending and a burning question that I couldn't answer yet: Should I stay in touch with her? She's a really interesting person and the job of hers is just wow, so I still want to know how that works out. Should I stay in touch AND maybe ask her when she's back in town in november or december? Or should I just make a cut and close the chapter? 

The last option probaly is the healthiest but I can't really just cut her out like that. I don't know how that works - but head just keeps spinning.

We talked about it for some time and I told her that I'm still cool with meeting her once every few weeks and I love talking to her but she doesn't want to give me hope or leave me on the hook because she doesn't want to have a new relationship right now and she can't tell how long she needs to fully process the breakup.

After that we decided that we're not going to the exhibition together but we want to meet up next week for a short talk or walk. I told her that I really need the personal interaction to fully grasp the situation and probably to have some closure.

So, long story with a sad ending and a burning question that I couldn't answer yet: Should I stay in touch with her? She's a really interesting person and the job of hers is just wow, so I still want to know how that works out. Should I stay in touch AND maybe ask her when she's back in town in november or december? Or should I just make a cut and close the chapter? 

The last option probaly is the healthiest but I can't really just cut her out like that. I don't know how that works - but head just keeps spinning.

I got a situation going on right now and talked to a lot of people about it but I simply can't let go so I thought: Why don't I just ask my beloved reddit? I mean I've never posted before and I was lurking but I think now might be the time to get your opinions. So thanks in advance! :)

In mid june I met a girl on tinder and we immediately had a great connection. I'm 31 and I have a lot of dating experience, especially with online dating, but the connection I have with her (she's 33) was really unique. So after 2 weeks of intense texing about basically everything and even our very personal problems we decided it's time to meet in real life.

On friday evening (june 25) we met at her place and had a long walk (with her very cute dog), had great conversations and the vibe was really good. After like 2-3 hours we went back to her place and just chilled on the couch. We then had some drinks and laughed a lot an the vibe was awesome. We were getting really close so I asked her if I could kiss her and said ""well, give it a try"". And then of course we kissed and it was fantastic. In the hours we kissed a lot, we even cuddled and looked eachother in the eyes and said some nice things etc. It was incredible intense. The date ended after 8 hours when I said ""well I better go"" because really late and I think we both didn't want to spoil it by having sex.

So after that we planned the next date for the upcoming friday (july 2) and had some great conversations. But in the week before the second date she told me that the breakup with her ex was just 2 months ago and it's still a big issue. It's not that she wants him back but that she's really hurt by it and hasn't really processed it. I was her first date after the breakup and she's really not sure how to go on. A few days later she felt better though and the second date was still on. It was basically as fantastic as the first one. We had a great walk, great talks, great kisses, said some nice things and really enjoyed our time. 

But 2 days after the date she sent me a very cold and distanced message that she doesn't want to date me anymore, that it's too much pressure and yeah that it's over. I was really shocked and felt so terrible because I never that coming. And I couldn't really process it because I had no chance of talking to her in person and to have some clarity. I told her that I accept it but I can't unterstand it.

But as chance would have it I forgot my sunglasses at her place at the second date. So I asked her if I could grab them sometime and we agreed for a short meeting a few days after the message. And when I went there on thursday (july 8) I asked her for 5 minutes of her time to talk about it because I needed some clarity.

We talked for an hour and she told me that right now she's like a shy deer that runs away when it's too much and that our second date was too intense for her to handle. So her cold message was some sort of safety measure. I told her again that I accept that but it's hard for me to cut someone out of my life when we just had such a deep connection and some great talks. And after the meeting I went on a 3 hour bike ride to clear my had. About 3 hours after the meeting she texted me ""that was really incredibly brave of you to talk about your feelings like that"".

After that we slowly started texting again and after a few days we were back to ""normal"" and even a bit more. We started sending eachouther voice messages and talked for hours about her breakup and current situation in general, about my personal problems and really deep stuff. This went on for like 2 weeks. Because of work she's leaving town for 2-3 month at the end of august. And she told me that her actual plan was to meet someone ""stupid"" on tinder to have a good time after the breakup and before she needs to leave so that there's no complication. However that didn't really work with me because our connection is too intense and she really appreciates me for being emotional and very intelligent. And that she never talked to someone that understands her as much as I do and she would like to continue the thing we're having on the exact level.

On friday (july 23) we had a third date and it was very intense again. This time we skipped the walk and just met at here place. Again, great talks, great kisses, nice things and then we even ended up having sex. And after that we cuddled again for like 2 hours and she told me ""it really feels pretty pretty good with you"".

A few days later (july 26) I finally asked her if we finally want to buy some tickets for a very impressive art exhibition that we talked about alot and she said yes. So we bought tickets for the next friday (august 6) and we're both really looking forward to it. However in the days following I felt that our contanct was getting slower and slower. I know that she has a really pressuring job and because she needs to leave soon, there is a lot of preparation going on, but it still felt kinda different.

And yesterday (august 4) she texted me that she has another down phase and would like to go to the exhibition but more relaxed and as friends. I asked her what that means and she told me that she's thinking a lot about the breakup again and how hurt she's really is, that she needs to be alone for some time. That she can't give me anything at the moment and she feels like she's playing with me and is sending mixed signals. She doesn't want to be like that but right now that's just how she is. She really really likes me and feels a very special connection but she's not ready for that and that the connection is just too much for her.

She really really likes me and feels a very special connection but she's not ready for that and that the connection is just too much for her. We talked about it for some time and I told her that I'm still cool with meeting her once every few weeks and I love talking to her but she doesn't want to give me hope or leave me on the hook because she doesn't want to have a new relationship right now and she can't tell how long she needs to fully process the breakup.

After that we decided that we're not going to the exhibition together but we want to meet up next week for a short talk or walk. I told her that I really need the personal interaction to fully grasp the situation and probably to have some closure.

So, long story with a sad ending and a burning question that I couldn't answer yet: Should I stay in touch with her? She's a really interesting person and the job of hers is just wow, so I still want to know how that works out. Should I stay in touch AND maybe ask her when she's back in town in november or december? Or should I just make a cut and close the chapter?

The last option probaly is the healthiest but I can't really just cut her out like that. I don't know how that works - but head just keeps spinning.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a situation going on right now and talked to a lot of people about it but I simply can't let go so I thought: Why don't I just ask my beloved reddit? I mean I've never posted before and I was lurking but I think now might be the time to get your opinions. So thanks in advance! :)

&amp;#x200B;

In mid june I met a girl on tinder and we immediately had a great connection. I'm 31 and I have a lot of dating experience, especially with online dating, but the connection I have with her (she's 33) was really unique. So after 2 weeks of intense texing about basically everything and even our very personal problems we decided it's time to meet in real life.

On friday evening (june 25) we met at her place and had a long walk (with her very cute dog), had great conversations and the vibe was really good. After like 2-3 hours we went back to her place and just chilled on the couch. We then had some drinks and laughed a lot an the vibe was awesome. We were getting really close so I asked her if I could kiss her and said ""well, give it a try"". And then of course we kissed and it was fantastic. In the hours we kissed a lot, we even cuddled and looked eachother in the eyes and said some nice things etc. It was incredible intense. The date ended after 8 hours when I said ""well I better go"" because really late and I think we both didn't want to spoil it by having sex.

So after that we planned the next date for the upcoming friday (july 2) and had some great conversations. But in the week before the second date she told me that the breakup with her ex was just 2 months ago and it's still a big issue. It's not that she wants him back but that she's really hurt by it and hasn't really processed it. I was her first date after the breakup and she's really not sure how to go on. A few days later she felt better though and the second date was still on. It was basically as fantastic as the first one. We had a great walk, great talks, great kisses, said some nice things and really enjoyed our time.

But 2 days after the date she sent me a very cold and distanced message that she doesn't want to date me anymore, that it's too much pressure and yeah that it's over. I was really shocked and felt so terrible because I never that coming. And I couldn't really process it because I had no chance of talking to her in person and to have some clarity. I told her that I accept it but I can't unterstand it.

But as chance would have it I forgot my sunglasses at her place at the second date. So I asked her if I could grab them sometime and we agreed for a short meeting a few days after the message. And when I went there on thursday (july 8) I asked her for 5 minutes of her time to talk about it because I needed some clarity.

We talked for an hour and she told me that right now she's like a shy deer that runs away when it's too much and that our second date was too intense for her to handle. So her cold message was some sort of safety measure. I told her again that I accept that but it's hard for me to cut someone out of my life when we just had such a deep connection and some great talks. And after the meeting I went on a 3 hour bike ride to clear my had. About 3 hours after the meeting she texted me ""that was really incredibly brave of you to talk about your feelings like that"".

After that we slowly started texting again and after a few days we were back to ""normal"" and even a bit more. We started sending eachouther voice messages and talked for hours about her breakup and current situation in general, about my personal problems and really deep stuff. This went on for like 2 weeks. Because of work she's leaving town for 2-3 month at the end of august. And she told me that her actual plan was to meet someone ""stupid"" on tinder to have a good time after the breakup and before she needs to leave so that there's no complication. However that didn't really work with me because our connection is too intense and she really appreciates me for being emotional and very intelligent. And that she never talked to someone that understands her as much as I do and she would like to continue the thing we're having on the exact level.

On friday (july 23) we had a third date and it was very intense again. This time we skipped the walk and just met at here place. Again, great talks, great kisses, nice things and then we even ended up having sex. And after that we cuddled again for like 2 hours and she told me ""it really feels pretty pretty good with you"".

A few days later (july 26) I finally asked her if we finally want to buy some tickets for a very impressive art exhibition that we talked about alot and she said yes. So we bought tickets for the next friday (august 6) and we're both really looking forward to it. However in the days following I felt that our contanct was getting slower and slower. I know that she has a really pressuring job and because she needs to leave soon, there is a lot of preparation going on, but it still felt kinda different.

And yesterday (august 4) she texted me that she has another down phase and would like to go to the exhibition but more relaxed and as friends. I asked her what that means and she told me that she's thinking a lot about the breakup again and how hurt she's really is, that she needs to be alone for some time. That she can't give me anything at the moment and she feels like she's playing with me and is sending mixed signals. She doesn't want to be like that but right now that's just how she is. She really really likes me and feels a very special connection but she's not ready for that and that the connection is just too much for her.

After that we decided that we're not going to the exhibition together but we want to meet up next week for a short talk or walk. I told her that I really need the personal interaction to fully grasp the situation and probably to have some closure.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked.

Do not fall for this. Do not be me, spending 9 months with someone, spending 3-4 days per week together, going on trips, meeting their family and friends, having deep conversations…only to be told they’re not ready for anything serious.

I think I’ve never been ghosted (I’m 30), at least not by anyone I knew to this extent. Not gonna lie, it does suck at first cause you don’t know why it went from hot to ice cold so quick. Just be straight. We’re not strangers. I know I’m dodging a bullet here, but it sucks cause she is a cool ass girl.

So I worked with this girl for a few months. I never made a move cause she was in a LDR. Little to no contact over next year, but I’m into her and I know she digs me to a certain extent based on a couple things I won’t say to not make this any longer. Couple months ago, invites me and old coworkers to her bday party. We fall asleep on couch together. Nothing happened.

Hit her up a month later, invite her out for my bday. We go out night before and night of. We have a blast. Bunch of her friends meet up, they all love me according to her. Sleeps over both nights, but barely hookup (too drunk/hungover for sex). Morning after, watch movies, cuddle, caressing, she initiates make out with me. SHE kisses me on lips goodbye. Her texts later, very into me, complimenting. So I’m like ok this is different.

Next week, invites me to her friend’s party a couple weeks out. After two failed meetups that weekend, in my head I’m like forget it.

We text few days later, reminds me that I’m going to the party with her, asks if I want to watch a movie. Comes over. Watch a movie, foreplay, have sex, but I can’t finish lol. Don’t think it was bad for either us, but I know I’m better. I’m a confident dude. Was just overthinking. After, she cuddles, lays head on my chest, caressing my chest, initiates make out with me. Asks me if I want her to stay or leave. I say stay. Sleeps over. She kisses me on lips goodbye in the morning while I’m sleeping.

Text her almost a week later, no response till next day. Says she’s been busy. That party comes a few days later. She never hits me up. I knew she was ghosting, but a couple days later, like an idiot, I ask if she’s free later in the week. Apologizes for being so busy, asks what day, I give a couple options, she picks Saturday. I say cool Sat night and she hearts my text. Ghosted on saturday. Never hit her up again.

A week later, my friend sees her out and tells her that she’s “kinda” ghosting me and is working shit out with her LDR. Don’t even know if she was ever single, on a break or whatever. Her working it out doesn’t bother me. We weren’t dating and I was fine with just a NSA hookup whether it was one time or more.

It’s when SHE started showing lots of affection, intimacy and inviting me out where I was like ok, i’ll ride this wave. But since she ghosted after a night of sex, I’m like was it the sex? It would SUCK to get ghosted cause of that. But why stay, be intimate, kiss me on the lips goodbye in the AM? Was she just using me for some sex cause she needed it? Fine, I like sex, but why all the intimacy, why hang out with me and be all over me in front of your friends and invite me out to hang with them?

We danced,  made out a bunch, had an overall good conversation and were with each other for 3+ hours. After a while, she wanted to go to another bar so she asked me if I knew anywhere more fun. I suggested another bar so me her and her friend left together to go there. This to me was an obvious sign of comfort. 

During the walk I asked her a question about why she broke up with her ex (we talked about our exes earlier), and she didn't answer. After the question I noticed her interest drop slightly. One example: I told her to follow me on IG at the first bar (she did) when we got to the 2nd bar I told her that I followed her back and she said ""when did I follow you?"" Keep in mind she was not that drunk if drunk at all that night so she was obviously being aloof. But when we got to the 2nd bar we continued to dance, hold hands and make out so I thought I had regained her comfort. 

Towards the end of the night I left the 2nd bar with her, her friend and a guy her friend was with and this is how the convo went
Me: ""hey, I'll walk you home!"" 
Her: ""oh you don't have to! it's a far walk."" 
Me: ""well you never know these streets can be dangerous"" 
Her: "" I walk up and down here all the time haha"" 
Me: ""well it's fine I got you"" (paraphrase) 
I wasn't being pushy and it was more of a ""hey, I'll come along with you"" kind of vibe and she didn't object me from walking her home any further. She also never signaled to her friend that she was uncomfortable. 

Anyway I walk her all the way back to her place (no hand holding) while her friend and the guy she's with are behind us. During the walk, she asked me questions, gave me her number after I asked and we even talked about setting up a date. I get to her apartment building and I didn't make a move to come up and she didn't invite me in so she just initiated a kiss goodnight, which I took as a sign of comfort and I walked back to my car. 

I texted her a couple days later to setup a date and she barely responded and was obviously not interested anymore. I was moving on but then I found out after doing some digging via a mutual friend that she was hiding her stories from me. I also think she muted my stories although I cannot prove that. 

Unless there's something else going on, like maybe an ex back in the picture, the only other action I did that may have made her do this would be the walk back because everything else I did in the night would not have elicited this. 

Maybe she became uncomfortable because I know where she lives and I can see her posts on IG? At the same time I'm also thinking, if she thinks I'm THAT creepy why not just block my number and instagram or at least unfollow me off Instagram?

I really liked this girl and I would hate for her to see me as a creep.

As a man there is so much you have to do to be considered stable datable, physically, financially, emotionally, and behaviorally.

If you’re under 6’0 you’re less desirable to a lot of women, under 5’10 undatable to most, 5’7 it’s pretty much over. If you’re uglier than a 7/10 you will get pretty much no attention from women and you have to be in shape (even girls that aren’t in shape won’t settle for a guy out of shape).

Men always need to be financially stable which isn’t that big of a deal, but so many women around me just want a ATM. Like guys already invest so much money to attracting a girl, then girls expect the guy to just give them money for shit. Like I got into a fight with my ex because I wouldn’t pay for her nails to get done and all of her past boyfriends did.

Then any emotional problem is disgusting to women. I’ve went on dates with girls with major emotional problems and all the women I’ve been dated have been either incredibly insecure, have been attention starved or just straight emotionally immature. Yet women say they smell out those behaviors and would never date someone like that, when if a guy wants to date, he just has to accept the majority of girls are like this.

But what makes me the most upset is that they have the audacity to say how low the bar is for men. Like men don’t have to do everything to make a relationship or romance or even just sexual chemistry happen. I’ve never received a gift from a girl because it’s not expected. I’ve bought many gifts though. I’ve never had a girl take initiative to plan a date or even just something as small for pay for a mean for both of us. The most I’ve gotten was that I got a girl to split a mean because I was sure I didn’t want to see her again, and she complained about me being “broke”.

At first she seemed fine but as we all now, at a certain moment you reach your breaking point. That moment felt about same period me and my ex broke up so we both needed someone to support on. 

Over the next months we got a lot closer to the point that i even started to like her. At first i tought it was just something that whould pass so i tried to ignore it. Over the next months, Everything seemed fine and i even started online dating again. 

Late April, she got an appartement to live in where me and one of our friends E went to help assambeling cabinets. Around that time N had something going on with the brother (L) of E, so she wanted to have a talk with her about it. I at the time was supporting her since i just ignored my feelings that i tought was just something temporary. 
E went home at the end of the evening while i stayed over at her place. When we were watching tv she tomd me something that to me sounded like her confessing she liked me. However, i wasnt sure about what she said but she refused to repeat it.

A few weeks later, N did a small house warming. When we all arrived, everyone started drinking (except me, since i dont drink). When my friends have had some alcohol, they are verry relaxed and open, everyone kissing everyone. They often tried to jokely kiss me except N who made it clear that she whould NEVER kiss me since i was her best friend. 
She whould tell that so often that it almost seemed like she was trying to convince herself.

Lets fast forward a little to late June, finals were over and E invited us over for a poolparty we do each year. Little did she know that 2 days before that, L (the brother of E) cuts all contacts with N since he was afraid to fall in love with her. 
N was realy emotional at that time and after we had dinner, she started drinking and got wasted. When she was drunk, she pulled me out of my chair and asked me to slow with her, she didnt gave me much if a choise there. 
The rest of the evening, she was sitting on my lap, hugging and holding hands, she even gave me a few kisses on the cheek after wich i relised that i realy was in love with her all this time.


Some time passed, it was the last weekend of Jully and i invited everyone over to my place. After everyone had eaten, we started playing some drinking games, N was sitting next to me in the couch with her head on my shoulder and my arm around her, holding hands. At a certain point i got the dare to give everyone a kiss (cheek counts too, we all agreed) so when i gave everyone a kiss on the cheek, she seemed a little disapointed that i didn't gave her one on the lips (wich was verry obvious). After that, she often layed my hand on her butt what made me think she was feeling the samr way i did. 

After some more rounds of truth or dare, i got te dare to ""learn"" N how to french kiss. When someone sayd that i could skip if i wanted to, i didn't want tonlet my chance go and did kiss her wich she seemed to enjoy since when i tought it was done and pulled away, she was still going. At the end of the evening we were all looking who whould sleep where. N made it clear that she wanted to sleep with me (wich isnt anything new since we often sleep together in one bed) when we then were alone for a few sec in the kitchen, we had a moment together and started kissing eachother.  After that she tried to make excuses not to sleep with all the others (wich i wasnt planning on) so we went upstairs and slept in my parrents room (they were not home and are okay with it)

When we layd in bed, we started kissing eachother after wich i sayd ""so you like me too"" on wich she responded with ""let's not overcomplicate things""
When we then were about to sleep, i wanted to give her a last kiss on the cheek but since it was dark, i kissed her on the lips after wich she started kissing me back and we made out. At a certain point she said ""okay, stop"" wich i asume was becaus she tough we whould have sex. She felt asleep on my chest while we were holding hands and i was so happy.

Next morning, i woke up before she did and went downstairs becaus i still had othe guests.
We didnt talk about it anymore since we never realy had some alone time. Later that evening i texted her that we maybe should have a talk about it, on wich she responded that she was drunk and that it was a stupid idea, because i'm her best friend. While also telling that i'm a good kisser (good to know :p)
After wich i confesed to her and she appolagised.

I now do think that she might have some feelings but becaus of what happend with X (her ex-best friend) and L, she doesn't want to risk losing me aswell. 
She did tell that she was drunk but honestly, she wasnt that drunk (maybe 4-5 beers spread over 5 hours) in September, we all go to her place so I'll see how things turn out then and how she's acting.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

I just wanted to know if you guys could guide me on what to do, as I'm just broken right now...

So... I had a friend... We had a really cute relationship, we just didn't made it official. But those were really lovely times... We used to chat all day long...

""Lovely"" I guess, we had some really hard times, but we stuck together and made through everything bad that happened... We promised to stick together and always help each other...

But that didn't last... The friend just stopped being her lovely self and started always talking in a pretty serious tone. I tried reminding her that I loved her and all, and when I did that she kind of just ""cut the dialogue"". I tried it like 3 times and all the same thing...

Well, that was some days ago... I thought I was going to be fine... Today I saw something that just got rid of any doubts I had... One day we had one of our ""cute moments"" at her steam public chat. Like calling each other sweet and those things...

Well, she deleted it.

I just don't get it... Why won't she just tell me... I just feel like the one I loved was fake all along...

On one of her ""serious mood"" talks, we were talking about a friend we had, she just suddently said that she found him pretty annoying from the beggining... Like... What...? We were both really friendly with him, he was a nice person...

I just feel like I've been lied for since I met her... Part of me wants to hate her... But my love for her still burns inside of me... I just want to pull my heart off my chest right now...

I still have her contact... I don't know why she doesn't do anything. Trying to hide it from me just hurts me even more... I don't even talked to her on those days. I don't like talking with that serious person. I don't even know who I'm talking to. Well... She doesn't seem to care about it...

While reading through this subreddit encountered so much negativity. Hard to believe that so many people want to quit dating. Many of whom are blaming some outside factor and also kinda are blaming women for how easy their experience is (which I would not only disagree with but actually claim that the opposite is true). Let me give you my perspective.

I am a below-average-looking guy. Not special in any way, studying computer science which isn't quite as attractive as medicine. Still, I'm doing just fine when it comes to dating. Obviously, I can't just go out with everyone I like and it does take more effort than for others but I'm doing really fine nonetheless.

There will be some unlucky guys who do everything right and still can't get laid but I highly doubt that this is the majority. Now you can downvote this post or insult me (If you condescend to do so) but I'm not trying to shame anyone here. If anything I'm trying to give some of you guys hope by saying that you are the problem. Because if I'm right than you have the ability to change it. And I really believe that you can change and find someone great. 

I really hope that all those posts are just some people venting. Please don't give up on dating it's fun, exciting and people are what makes life worth living.

We also have arguments over how he finds it acceptable to call other women hot. He even said he ""asked all his guy friends and they say they do it and their partner doesn't react"" and he tells me I need to accept that no man is only attracted to their partner which hurts but I accepted it.

I found some philosophies had some pros but found some philosophies take things to an extreme. Like The Rules for example. Sure some principles are valid but it's too extreme for me and I'd rather bend some rules to suit my personality and risk levels. 

Anyways, some of these philosophies (there are forums here on reddit for men and women) I find tend to make finding a mate a game and I find that problematic. It's like an achievement. Do people find following strict dating strategies to backfire? Since I've read female ones, some of them seem too strict for me. Like only go on proper dates, not coffee dates. A Steve Harvey book said don't have sex for 3 months. Dating should be like how a company has you on probation for 3 months and then you get benefits (sex being the benefit)  I'm all for having standards but sometimes these seem too extreme for me. I've asked people online who are married and in many cases, they have sex within 3 months and largely don't seem to follow these rules. I would think if someone had these hoops for me to jump, it would be a turn off but at the same time, I can understand how some people become hyper vigilant when dating because they've been burned in the past and so they think by being hyper strict when dating will prevent bad stuff from happening but someone can meet all the requirements and do all the right things and still hurt you. There's no guarantees in life. Finding someone is risky. All you can do is minimize risk but you can't make risk 0. 

I don't know how many here are in marriages or in long term relationships but I think having that hyper vigilant mentality is setting yourself up to fail to find someone. You are specifically looking for someone to screw up so you can reject them. I know for me I have written down what I am looking for and have written down the character traits. I frame it in a positive manner. For example I have written that I want someone who is health conscious and makes physical activity a part of their life. I don't write ""someone not fat."" I guess I know I am flawed so we have to accept that potential partners make mistakes. Certain behaviours are not acceptable though but I think we need to be aware of the difference between a deal breaking flaw or something they can work on.",False,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,938719,public,self,What do you think of extreme dating strategies?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oyn5n2/what_do_you_think_of_extreme_dating_strategies/,all_ads,6,,,

I haven't been asked out or anything but I do think maybe some guys from my gym might be interested. But the thing is, I joined the gym to meet people but as I'm getting to know more people, I'm starting to fit in there and actually kind of like the people there beyond just for dating, and I'm little nervous about what people will think of me. I guess I think I come off as a conservative girl/kind of shy... I am a little nervous about altering that identity. I know it's dumb, but with online dating, let's say I slept with someone and it didn't really work out, it's so easy to just cut ties and it doesn't impact my life at all. But if I went out with a guy from my gym, let's say we did eventually hook up and he starts to lose interest, I'm just nervous about people talking about me (I know it's not pc but sadly I think girls can still develop a reputation :/).

I feel like this is a silly question, but I didn't really date much in high school or college, not until online dating became a thing. Now I'm kind of retroactively going to the normal way of dating lol. Any tips on how to deal with this? Maybe putting off sex a little longer? Just stop caring so much (if that's even possible lol)?

About 5/6 weeks ago I met a girl(24) who I instantly clicked with. Walked her home from the pub that night, she wanted to take me in the bushes and fuck me but I was not ready for that kind of thing as it had been a while for me and said I don't want to not hear from her ever again, so I took her out for a sober lunch next day and invited her round the following week. Wined her and dined her and had some amazing sex(her words she used several times the day after 🤣). Meant to be going for another date later in the week, she blanks me the night before and cancels. Fast forward to now, turns out she got back with her ex that night(they broken up 2 months before I met her and apparently he was a dick).
A couple of weeks ago, a girl I was seeing in 2018 asked to go for a drink. She invited me back to hers, but she told me not sexy time cuz it was her time of the month. But still kissed, spooned etc and almost did the dirty 😏😏
She too within a week went back to her ex. (Again 2 month break up before she text me)

I see posts on Reddit about girls getting fed up the guy wont commit or take it seriously but I also see posts about girls getting scared that this guy might be bf material and they just ain't ready for that. Which are both fair enough but how do you figure it out? Am I just getting my hopes up way too early, should I hold off the wine and dining and sex, give it a few more dates and perhaps try not to be a rebound 🤔 or am I just overthinking?

It's an Emotional minefield 😂

So there's this guy that I've been kinda crushing on for around a month. He is a colleague of mine and literally the nicest, sweetest, most gentle and loveable man I have ever met. Since I'm a very introverted and shy person I had to work up all my courage to initiate a conversation with him, but I was so sure about him that I actually did it!! (Still proud of that today)

Our first conversation went really well, he asked many questions and we laughed a lot, making me fall even more for him. It seemed like he was interested in me as well, but he's generally a very outgoing person and friendly with everyone, but like... I had hopes and apparently just interpreted too much into his actions...

Since we don't live that far apart, we usually walk the same way home.
Today before our shift began we were kinda chatting about work and random stuff and agreed on walking home together.
After our shift ended he got off his phone and said to me: ""I'm sorry but we can't walk together today, my girlfriend is coming to pick me up""

I'm telling you guys, my heart broke the second he said ""girlfriend"". I absolutely get why he would be in a relationship tho since he is really the most flawless person and every conversation with him is just so effortless and comforting. 

I'm happy that he is happy, but at the same time I'm so devastated that I will never get to experience the treatment his partner gets (especially since he is so sweet towards people he doesn't know at all/ that well, imagine how sweet he is going to be with his girlfriend!!).
I feel like I still want to befriend him, since I really love his personality and feel really comfortable around him.

Also I'm glad that I haven't known him for really long (~2 months) so I didn't ""waste"" that much time on crushing on him.
It still hurts a lot because (as childish as it sounds) he really felt like ""the one"". I've literally never felt so comfortable around a guy, not even my ex boyfriends (2).
But I guess I wasn't the only one who thought that way and someone got there before me. 

In conclusion: I only want him to be happy, even if it's not with me... &lt;/3

So I see wildly conflicting opinions on this; from a quick google search I’ve seen people ask about this exact age gap in the past and get laughed at because you’re both young and some people genuinely can’t see why it might be weird. On the other end of the spectrum, you have people saying that people who are 23 and want to date a 19 year old are predators because there’s an inherent power imbalance and your brain is still developing at this age range. Its a really common opinion I’ve seen in people my age a younger, especially on places like Twitter. I feel like the truth lies somewhere in the middle.

So here’s my situation. Met a girl in work, we hit it off pretty well, instantly had that kind of joking around/teasing kind of flirty vibe. I thought she was older than me tbh, I look younger with a baby face and she looks older. Turns out after getting to know her she’s 19. As soon as I found that out I felt bad, am I some creep for finding her attractive and even flirting with her a little?

I instantly kind of wrote her off in my head after that, but honestly it feels like a hard call to me. My instant reaction was to feel bad and pull back, but It made me think about the fact that I was an ugly duckling in school, and cause I look very young I’ve noticed the girls who tend to be into me are like 19 or 20; girls my age and above see dating me as like dating their little brother lmfao. I’m friends with a girl who’s 20 and she refers to me as her ‘little bro’. It’s only at a younger age I’m kind of seen as like a prospect because I look around that age too. The last thing I’d ever want to do is be one of those horrible, creepy dudes who actively seeks out way younger women just because they want to emotionally manipulate them, but I don’t really know what else to do.

I’m in this weird situation where if I date the people who I hit it off with, I’ll be a creep. If I don’t, I’m just kind of alone. Usually it doesn’t bother me, but kind of hitting it off with someone new and having to cool the excitement off sucks. I would never went to pressure a girl or use any difference in maturity to manipulate them, and I get for a lot of young women dating predatory and abusive older dudes makes them very unforgiving of age gaps, but I honestly feel like the difference between 23 and 19 isn’t as substantial as some make out. I think they’re very much similar stages in life.

So basically, I wanted a real second hand opinion. When the advice online ranges from ‘of course that’s fine that’s barely even a gap to ‘there’s a massive difference in development and to bypass that you must be a sexual predator’ it makes it hard to judge what the right call is in real life. Dating is just really hard and when I have so little success while having to turn down the people who tend to be interested it just feels really lonely. I completely see that there’s a difference that should be taken into account with an age gap like that, but I also don’t think it’s insurmountable and I think it probably depends of the specific 2 people involved. But maybe that’s just me not thinking straight.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,938881,public,self,What age gaps are acceptable around your late teens/early 20s?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oypmfn/what_age_gaps_are_acceptable_around_your_late/,all_ads,6,,,

Being asked ""to hang out"" is so vague. To me, it means hanging out as friends but to some it can mean let's go on a date.
The importance of choosing the right words is crucial in the dating scene and I'd even argue that it's necessary for friendships too.
Wouldn't it be nice if you met someone and they straight up told you ""hey I want a long term friend"" ""I just want a friend for now until i figure things out"" because losing friendships is just as painful.

I seriously hate second guessing and receiving indirect texts, LIES too just to make me feel good.
It doesn't make anybody feel good to find out it was a lie, to torture themselves with questions and having to fill the gaps because the other person has an inability to be honest.

Being clear is a likeable trait and if somebody reacts bad to it, they showed you their true colors and you just dodge a bullet. It's literally a win win.

I think most of the times people don't because they don't know what they want, they are afraid of losing somebody or to be met by negative emotions and conflict, they have a hidden personal agenda, none of the two parties have to courage to ask where they both stand, and also because it isn't a familiar thing to them. I can't shame anybody for this, a lot of us weren't taught how to do it.

Let me lead off by saying that I (36F) don’t have a ton of dating experience, at least not when it comes to number of partners, I have always been in long term relationships, so I have learned that I did not make the best decisions here, but come on! My last relationship was with the absolute love of my life. We were together 10 years but he passed away. That boy loved me dearly and never did a thing to hurt me. A year after he passed I started dating this guy (32m). 

We dated for over a year, and things were good until 2 months ago. I found out he went on a date with another girl, and whether or not anything else happened I don’t know, but I do know that when he went out with this girl, he hid all my stuff, so I felt like he had every intention of bringing her back to his place if he wanted to. Like an idiot, I considered forgiving him. We were on the fence for a couple of weeks when he told me he needed to end things. He said he had been unhappy the last couple of months, not wanting to shower, eat, or do anything. Sounded like depression to me, which I know he’s struggled with in the past. He said he needed to be by himself to work on himself, but that he still loved me, and maybe we could try again someday.

I saw him the next week, planning on keeping it platonic, when he told me he still loved me and that we should be together. We ended up hooking up several times over the next couple of weeks, with I love you’s being exchanged.

So the last time we were together was the weekend before his birthday. I texted him on his birthday weekend to see if he wanted to do something, but I felt like he blew me off. A week later, we still hadn’t seen each other outside of work (bonus we work together! Yes, bad idea #1) so I stopped over and got all my stuff. He texted me later that night to tell me that he wanted to tell me before the rumors started that he was “talking” to another girl that we work with, which I am not a complete idiot, I already suspected this without him telling me. I accused him of being interested in her before we broke up, to which he replied he’d only thought of her that way for the last 3 weeks (if you recall we were just together 2 weeks prior to this). 

Now I am angry, but trying to be amicable, because we do all have to work together, and I actually really do like the girl he’s talking to, and she didn’t do anything wrong. But then the last couple of days this boy is completely ignoring me. Everything I say/ask him is basically met with a grunt as a response, even when it is work related things that I need to talk to him about. He is ignoring me like I am the one that did something wrong, while I think I have handled this in the best way I possibly could. All I want to do is tell this new girl how crappy he has treated me, because she just got out of a relationship where her fiance cheated on her, but I am being a good girl and staying out of it. It’s just so frustrating! I have never been treated like this, and it all just came out of left field and snowballed so quickly. I don’t even know if I want to trust someone else, all I hear about is people cheating on each other.

TLDR: boyfriend cheated on me, dumped me, told me he still loved me, then started talking to someone else.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,938914,public,self,How do you go from I love you to dating someone else so fast?!?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oyq8vn/how_do_you_go_from_i_love_you_to_dating_someone/,all_ads,6,,,

This is for that kind of guy. 

So, these days girls who get approached by type 1 guys get attention and validated into thinking “obviously I’m physically attractive and I work hard to stay that way, so all guys should want to be with me”. 

Fast forward to say the gym and she’s working out in a corner with her headphones on and type 1 guy who’s putting the creep vibe out walks over and gets her number whiles type 2 guy across the gym that she finds attractive is doing his own thing and may look her way but never walks up and is as forward as a type 1 guy- so she leaves frustrated about why he isn’t acting the same way. 

Well ladies, let me break down some reasons why the type 2 guy seems distant and uninterested when in reality he’s not and deep down he’s actually a confident guy with some solutions. 

1. He’s doesn’t pick up on subtle signs. Looking his way and playing with your hair is not enough to draw him over. SMILE!! 

2. Look like your having fun don’t look all blank faced and think he’s just going to approach when he’s thinking you look all closed off. Be open! Wave at him, motion for him to come over and that will indicate you’re open to talk

3. Approach him! Just because “society” says that women are “the prize” doesn’t mean that you’re diminished by actually opening up to him first. Women FEAR rejection. I get it. Way worse than men.

(Mods I read your pinned no soap boxing post and I tried editing this in a way that won't be construed as that, I genuinely want advice and maybe here some stories from other men/women that won't make me feel like such an artifact.)


I am a 25 y/o male and have never been in a relationship before. I have friends. People love me. And I don't mean that in a bragging sense. I have just always been well received by almost everyone I come across. Despite this I have been everything but unsuccessful in any other form of relationship other than a casual friendship. I care for people. When people are upset I share their emotion and seek to help. I genuinely care and want nothing but the best for the people around me. But I can't help but to think that this alone has been my downfall. 


In any friendship that I thought could become more (even when I am absolutely convinced they feel the same) I have always gotten the ""I don't want to lose you as a friend"", ""I don't want to hurt you"", or my favorite ""you're like a brother to me"". Now, I always respect this and am appreciative of the transparency. But why is this always the case? Am I just less of a man for having emotions, caring and putting effort into relationships? Whether it be platonic or potentially more? The times I shot my shot and approached someone (respectfully of course) I was labeled as a creep. Im not the most attractive guy in the world but I know for sure I'm not some beauty and the beast situation waiting to unfold. 


When I go to other men about this its almost always ""should have just tried fucking her"" or some other insanely misogynistic response. Sex is cool but is it really that out of the ordinary for a man that just wants a meaningful relationship? I feel deprived. Socially, physically and mentally. I've never found myself just wanting a hug from a woman more in my life. I've never felt so deprived and void of physical contact in my life despite not being a virgin. I've never felt so emotionally alone in my life. I've never felt so used in my life. 


Guys, Im not trying to throw a pity party. But I am just sad. I want someone to love so bad. I want my effort to be recognized. I wish people weren't so afraid of ""losing you as a friend"" and just take the chance sometimes. I've tried dating apps. I have genuinely tried. Selfie culture and documenting your every outting is almost a requirement. I deleted all social media other than reddit 2 years ago. And I was never the kind to just take pictures or videos to begin with. I know this hurts online dating but it just makes me feel more isolated.

I’ve been chatting to a girl for about 6 weeks now, everything has been pushed back due to COVID, moving etc, but I am scheduled to see her Saturday. Last night she sent me a text with words to the effect of could we be friends if it doesn’t plan out. She then went on to say she’s seeing someone she is very interested in, but wants to see how we go. 

I can’t budge that this is a massive red flag but also silly of me. On one hand I think what the hell just go and see how it pans out, on other I’m thinking in respect of people I’ve previously dated there was never this dynamic. I honestly feel terribly cringe thinking I should not bother but I’m finding it hard to consider properly.
