As well I am trying to like myself in terms of looks and character. It all sounds like good plan yet I think these do not have end goal. At once I want to be better but from the other I would be happy to have someone on that journey so I can share happiness and hopefully make the other side life better along the way.

Before we met up, we talked on the phone every night for 1-4 hours and we'd occasionally have a video call as well. 

We went on date 1 two weeks ago and it went well. 
Then on date 2, we had sex. I'm not sure if this was too soon (I've never hooked up with someone before), but we both felt intense chemistry and agreed on it. 

The next day, he didn't text me, which led me to believe that I was being ghosted. This was a big fear of mine that I expressed to him; I get attached easily when I get physically intimate with someone. He reassured me that he wouldn't ghost me. 

Anyway, after not hearing from him the day after having sex, my anxiety got to me so I sent him several texts, some of which accused him of ghosting. I also apologized for wasting his time and expressed uncertainty about the situationship, so to speak. 

Once he finally read the messages, he was shocked and told me he had been asleep for most of the day. He also told me that my behavior of assuming the worst of him is a big red flag and that he doesn't know how to proceed. 

I apologized profusely and told him it wasn't going to happen again. After that, I realized he stopped texting me as often as he used to so I took this personally which resulted in another minor argument. I didn't say anything rude to him and just told him that I expect more communication with my partner. Then he decided to correct my grammar (English is not my first language) and tell me I was overreacting. This triggered a lot of anger and led me to say the following  (in the heat of the moment).""I regret having sex with you so soon."" He took this personally and came to the conclusion that me saying that was another red flag. I got confused and apologized profusely again, which seemed to calm things down. He asked for some time to think and got back to me the next day. 

Turns out he wants to continue dating me exclusively, but take a step back, which didn't make sense to me considering the fact that we're still seeing eachother and having sex. He also told me that he wants to proceed with caution because of the ""red flags"" I presented earlier. I agreed, except now I don't feel satisfied with the way things are anymore. He stopped sending me good morning texts, barely talks to me, and avoids touchy subjects. He ""wants to get to know me better"" but insists on watching TV shows together instead of talking. Now I'm feeling extremely confused and even more anxious than I was before I started dating him (I have generalized anxiety disorder).

Your date will convince you to buy and trade your bitcoin on a fake trading app that will later disappear. I fell for it 😭 but remained calm and tricked my scammer and got my money back. BE CAREFUL!

Details:

I met an Asian guy on Grindr (a gay dating app) and in 2-3 weeks I was subtly convinced to deposit all the cryptocurrency i had and some more (total of about 6500 dlls) into a fake trading website. Then they shut down the website with my money and my ""profit"" (total of 7700 dlls) 💵

I couldn't believe i had been scammed but googled ""Bitcoin Chinese scam"" and found a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/na8oax/asian_guygirl_from_online_dating_mentors_you_to/) on Reddit that talked about the Pig Butchering Scam. Of all these stories, I read 2 people were able to trick their scammer and got their money back.

I decided to also come up with a shitty excuse and told my scammer I had more money to invest and ""Customer Service"" then told me they were going through an upgrade, when in reality, they were ready to block me and get away with my money. They then redirected me to another website, I had to register again, and they ""transferred my funds from the previous platform to the new one"" and this time I withdrew all my money and the profit 🤑 with the excuse that I wanted to ""make sure my wallets were synchronized"" and wanted to test that i would be able to transfer more funds into their platform. They let me withdraw the money 😂😂.

Then I told CS i hadn't received anything and they EVEN SENT ME another 180 DLLs for ""Loyal customer"" or something like that! 😂😂. I kept telling them i still didn't get my 7K but of course they didn't buy it but it was too late for them 😂

So if you were tricked into sending your Bitcoin to them and you're still in touch with them, act normal, there's still hope. Make an excuse and get your money back! I hope it's not too late. I almost blew my cover 2 times but i was patient and i tricked them!

I made a YouTube video about it. It's like 40 minutes long, sorry, but i wanted to give u guys details, numbers, screenshots, everything i had so other people recognize if they're falling for a scam and escape.

Just for background, I’m 6’2 Asian MALE. I’ve been getting a lot of matches (like 40-50 in the 3 weeks I’ve had the app) and about half of those matches result in conversation. But I’ve only set up like 3 dates :/ but am still conversing with like around 8 people.

My first of those dates is coming up, but I’m very paranoid about my profile making me seem way more attractive, physically, than I am. I’ve never had much success with girls, am in my very early 20s, so I can’t help but think I’m not physically attractive. I always focused on school and studying and “hanging out with the bros” and so I also never developed skills in talking to girls. Also I had a really toxic “friend” in high school and middle school who’d always call me ugly or something; I’ve since cut all contact with him. But I also had an event when a girl in college asked me out (I wasn’t interested), and gotten a couple dates with a girl I was interested in, but didn’t work out (and was devastated).

Though somehow, I got these matches, but I partly attribute them to having 2 really flattering photos of myself. I do have 1 pretty standard photo (a photo I took for employee badging lol, and it isn’t as attractive as the 2 others I’m talking about). The remaining 3 photos don’t really have my face in very clear detail. So I really can’t help but thinking I’m going to disappoint when I meet these people in real life.

I’m just scared I have “deceived” these people. But on the other hand, I do have my badge photo which is a picture that I don’t think really looks good.

That being said, Im looking for advice other than ""just go for it"" or ""be yourself"". 

There is this gorgeous girl (22F who I (22M) have always had a crush on that hit me up out of the blue asking what I was doing Saturday night. Me and this girl have gotten close to hooking up a couple times but its never happened, mostly because over the years Ive had bad anxiety which has effected my confidence and have a pattern of blowing it with girls. Ive come into myself a lot since then, gaining some confidence, part of which was manifested in a much more flamboyant Instagram presence. I suppose she must have come across my account recently and been attracted to what she saw, because the other night I got a notification she followed me and liked a recent post. I promptly followed her back, and liked her recent post, as the gen-z fairy tale goes lol. Since Ive been feeling more confident, because there was established sexual tension between us, and admittedly because I was a little tipsy when I read the message asking what I was doing Saturday night, I send the boldest reply I have ever sent to a girl, saying ""Hopefully you? Respectfully ;)"" She must have appreciated the boldness, as she replied with a winky face saying I should come hang with her. However my unorganised ass compliantly forgot that Im working the closing shift at the pub I work at on that night. So I replied that I was actually working and forgot, but asked her out another night. She responded with ""Should I come just come to ur place after then? ;)"". To which I regretfully had to respond, ""how about I come to you :)"". 

She hasn't responded since :( I imagine its for one or a combination of three reasons. She lost interest after the multiple counter suggestions (hanging out another night, and then hanging at hers not mine), she lost interest because she put together that I probably live with my parents right now (I do) if I am avoiding my place, which could give me the impression of immaturity, and/or she lost interest because she also lives with her parents and perhaps theres no viable place for us to meet up for a late night booty call. 

So since the last text is from me, asking if we could hang at hers, and I am obviously interested in turning this situation back in the right direction, ie maintaining/regaining her attraction to me, what would be some things I could say to do so? I was thinking I could say something as simple as a follow up like ""does that work for you?"", but I feel that might be too dry, or I could say ""hey come back :)"" which perhaps acts as a wholesome display of venerability. I was also thinking given the way I perceive our rapport (assuming my insight is correct), that perhaps those sorts of texts would be counter productive. 

My current thinking is that if she was initially very receptive to me after the ""hopefully Im doing you Saturday"" (paraphrasing) comment, then perhaps a equally bold double text would be the way to go. Ive also been told by her friends before that she doesint like guys who try to hard. So I was honestly thinking sending a question mark and a winky face or something like that on the night of would be a confident move. However I could be completely miss-guided and that it why I am here. I really dont want to blow my shot with this girl, because although its essentially pick up advice Im looking for, I genuinely like this girl but think the situation is that breaking the ice of having first meet up is going to require that ""I play the game"". So please let me know what you would say, or what you would do, all advice is greatly appreciated :))

TL/DR: I want to double text a potential date after being left on delivered, but I dont want to come across as trying too hard. She was responsive to boldness in the past, and unresponsive to perceived immaturity/neediness.

I (M23) have had a crush on one of my friends (F22) for a while. I’ve never felt such a strong emotional connection with anyone else and I really felt like I had a shot with her. I confessed to her a few months ago and she said she was in a hectic stage of her life and wasn’t looking to date anyone. 

Now a few months later, she seems to be falling for this guy she met. As her friend, I support her and just want her to be happy. But as someone who still has feelings for her, this really hurts. 

The big issue that is getting to me is comparing myself to this other guy. This other guy is, I would say, a bit better looking than me. I’ve been feeling insecure and bad about myself because I guess this guy offers something for her (looks or personality wise) that I just don’t have.

So we met and both enjoyed each others company so just kept hanging out. Around July we were outside eating and she asks me “do you have any feelings for me?” I answered “i dont know” because i really didnt know. I never had a relationship before nor have i had feelings for anyone before (Im about to turn 27 and she just turned 23) so she said “ok well are you ok with us seeing other people?” I said yea sure you can do anything you want. I also said im not deleting my dating app so dont delete yours either. A few days later i facetime her and say i would rather us not hangout with other people she said “ok so that means we are dating then” i got scared and said no wait nevermind. She got a little annoyed and said you are giving me mixed signals. This was the biggest mistake of my life. So we kept hanging out and we would go out to eat, kiss, cuddle, sex, hold hands, shower together, text and facetime often. She would call me out of nowhere and be like “i just got off work, let’s hangout and cuddle tonight” She would stay at my place and i would stay at hers. I know at one point she had feelings for me. She even invited me to spend a night at her parents house which is far away. I denied it idk why but i did. She called me and invited me to two baseball games and i denied it. She told me she wants to do more things outisde and i was like yea ok and never attempted to. Again major regret. So it’s november 2nd and i got random urge to tell her goodbye. I was afraid i was getting feelings for her and i was afraid of dating and i thought i am getting a new job next year so i would have to say goodbye anyways (of course after i realized i wouldnt have to say goodbye) so i thought let me try to end this now before either of us get stronger feelings for one another. I text her out of nowhere “hey im sorry but i dont want to hangout anymore” she was confused so we facetimed and she was very angry of course and said well whats the reason and i didnt have the courage to tell her so i just made up an excuse like i just havent been feeling well. So we said goodbye in text and that night it hit me like a train. I loved her all along and wanted to date her all along but i was afraid of dating and was denying my emotions. So a few days pass and i ask if she could talk she says ok and we facetime. I was about to tell her hey i feel i made a mistake and i want to hangout again and i actually want to try dating for real and i have feelings for you. Before i could say that she says “so you remember how you said its ok that we can see other people?” I said yes and she says “i have a boyfriend now” i was devasted but i said i am happy for you and i quickly ended the conversation. Every night since then I have cried. So november 11th comes and i show up to her work and she had no idea i was coming. I told her i had feelings for you all along and i wanted to date all along but i was afraid. And i told her how different everything would be if we were to date one day like we can do so many fun things outside and i mean that. At the end of our talk which lasted about 3 minutes she says “you should have told me sooner” a few tears fall from her eyes and she opened her arms for a hug- of course i gave it to her. I asked if it doesnt workout with your new boyfriend if you would give me a chance and she kind of shook her head yes but just stayed quiet. I said do you think it will workout and she said “i think so i like him alot and we only know each other for around a month” so she knew him at least 3 weeks before i told her goodbye then 3 days after i said goodbye she is officially dating him. So she is dating him after knowing him for around a month so is that a rebound? Did me saying goodbye push her to date him? So i sent a long text on the 16th saying how everything would be different and i know how i feel and i know what i want which is a relationship. I gave her some compliments and again said if it doesnt workout with your boyfriend to keep me in mind and just some other nice things. She replies “i appreciate everything you said and i will consider you in future. Again it just sucks you didnt tell me before and then pushed me away” i replied “Biggest regret in my life so far. You
are perfect in every way. I think
about you everyday. I will try not to
text you for a long time but like i
said if you need anything i will be
here. I will miss you more than
anything. And remember i would just need
one chance to prove everything to
you” she said “thank you and i understand” i then replied “ I truely dont want to lose you. The woman of my dreams was in front of me for 8 months and i realized it too late. Im devastated” she never replied to that. Her birthday was yesterday and i texted her happy birthday but she never replied. And i like everything about her. Her face is beautiful, body is beautiful. Her personality is perfect. She is the woman of my dreams. In the 8 months of spending time together, we never had one arguement or got angry with each other, we were always on the same page. I asked her at the end what she didnt like about  me and she said only the fact that i put my self down like for example i would say im not tall enough or handsome enough but i was mostly joking. I also know she didnt the fact that i didnt try to do more things outside and also when she met me at my house sometimes she would wait outside for 15-20 minutes and never complained or got annoyed. Those are the 3 things i know she didnt like but everything else she liked about me. She liked my tattoos, said i look good with my shirt off. She said she liked how i have good hygiene and i am clean. She said i am a great kisser and cuddler. Might be too much info but i made her cum at least twice everytime we had sex. I made her dinner around 10 times and she always enjoyed it. One time something really bad happened at her work and i went over and held her while she cried in my arms. I would cuddle her to sleep every night that we hungout. I spent all day helping her move into her new apartment. She liked holding hands and i always did. So what do i do? Is my only option to wait and hope her relationship doesnt workout? When should i contact her again? I said goodbye on the 2nd, saw her in person on the 11th, texted her on the 16th and said happy birthday on the 25th. I really dont want to lose her. She is beautiful in every way, her personality is perfect. She is the only girl i talked to and spent time with since march and she is the only girl i wanted to talk to and spend time with. I told her that in person too on the 11th. If i could just have the one chance in the future i could show her how much i matured and how i would always embrace my emotions, and how much she really means to me, and how we would do so many fun things outside. There is a very high chance i would consider spending the rest of my life with her. I asked a few people for thier opinion and about half said she still has some feelings for me and to not give up all hope. The other half said she has moved on so just forget about her.

We made a rule to not bring people back to avoid hurting feelings and I didn’t seek out dating anyone but I recently met someone through work that just blew me away. We started dating and instantly I’m so into her I can’t believe it.

Very intelligent
Nerdy
Athletic
Assertive
Really pretty
Shared hobbies and interests
Terrific career


It’s very difficult to move on, as I’m facing the reality of how difficult it is to find someone like this, let alone date them. I feel like I had a one in a million chance and really fumbled things.

Most women on OLD apps have seemingly self absorbed selfies with Instagram filters, talk a lot about brunch/drinking, have lackluster jobs and few are nerdy/intellectual. Most prompts have so little content to them. The few that are nerdy usually are not very athletic or attractive. It’s just a very rare combo to find.
Im very picky, and this is my first time using OLD apps ever. I feel that by giving me the ability to see what most women in my city are like, it’s made me feel hopeless, because now I know ahead of time what kind of people I will meet in real life. At least in the past, I could tell myself there are plenty of women who have all those things.

So we met and both enjoyed each others company so just kept hanging out. Around July we were outside eating and she asks me “do you have any feelings for me?” I answered “i dont know” because i really didnt know. I never had a relationship before nor have i had feelings for anyone before (Im about to turn 27 and she just turned 23) so she said “ok well are you ok with us seeing other people?” I said yea sure you can do anything you want. I also said im not deleting my dating app so dont delete yours either. A few days later i facetime her and say i would rather us not hangout with other people she said “ok so that means we are dating then” i got scared and said no wait nevermind. She got a little annoyed and said you are giving me mixed signals. This was the biggest mistake of my life. So we kept hanging out and we would go out to eat, kiss, cuddle, sex, hold hands, shower together, text and facetime often. She would call me out of nowhere and be like “i just got off work, let’s hangout and cuddle tonight” She would stay at my place and i would stay at hers. I know at one point she had feelings for me. She even invited me to spend a night at her parents house which is far away. I denied it idk why but i did. She called me and invited me to two baseball games and i denied it. She told me she wants to do more things outisde and i was like yea ok and never attempted to. Again major regret. So it’s november 2nd and i got random urge to tell her goodbye. I was afraid i was getting feelings for her and i was afraid of dating and i thought i am getting a new job next year so i would have to say goodbye anyways (of course after i realized i wouldnt have to say goodbye) so i thought let me try to end this now before either of us get stronger feelings for one another. I text her out of nowhere “hey im sorry but i dont want to hangout anymore” she was confused so we facetimed and she was very angry of course and said well whats the reason and i didnt have the courage to tell her so i just made up an excuse like i just havent been feeling well. So we said goodbye in text and that night it hit me like a train. I loved her all along and wanted to date her all along but i was afraid of dating and was denying my emotions. So a few days pass and i ask if she could talk she says ok and we facetime. I was about to tell her hey i feel i made a mistake and i want to hangout again and i actually want to try dating for real and i have feelings for you. Before i could say that she says “so you remember how you said its ok that we can see other people?” I said yes and she says “i have a boyfriend now” i was devasted but i said i am happy for you and i quickly ended the conversation. I have cried quite a bit since that goodbye text to be honest. So november 11th comes and i show up to her work and she had no idea i was coming. I told her i had feelings for you all along and i wanted to date all along but i was afraid. And i told her how different everything would be if we were to date one day like we can do so many fun things outside and i mean that. At the end of our talk which lasted about 3 minutes she says “you should have told me sooner” a few tears fall from her eyes and she opened her arms for a hug- of course i gave it to her. I asked if it doesnt workout with your new boyfriend if you would give me a chance and she kind of shook her head yes but just stayed quiet. I said do you think it will workout and she said “i think so i like him alot and we only know each other for around a month” so she knew him at least 3 weeks before i told her goodbye then 3 days after i said goodbye she is officially dating him. So she is dating him after knowing him for around a month so is that a rebound? Did me saying goodbye push her to date him? So i sent a long text on the 16th saying how everything would be different and i know how i feel and i know what i want which is a relationship. I gave her some compliments and again said if it doesnt workout with your boyfriend to keep me in mind and just some other nice things. She replies “i appreciate everything you said and i will consider you in future. Again it just sucks you didnt tell me before and then pushed me away” i replied “Biggest regret in my life so far. You
are perfect in every way. I think
about you everyday. I will try not to
text you for a long time but like i
said if you need anything i will be
here. I will miss you more than
anything. And remember i would just need
one chance to prove everything to
you” she said “thank you and i understand” i then replied “ I truely dont want to lose you. The woman of my dreams was in front of me for 8 months and i realized it too late. Im devastated” she never replied to that. Her birthday was yesterday and i texted her happy birthday but she never replied. And i like everything about her. Her face is beautiful, body is beautiful. Her personality is perfect. She is the woman of my dreams. In the 8 months of spending time together, we never had one arguement or got angry with each other, we were always on the same page. I asked her at the end what she didnt like about  me and she said only the fact that i put my self down like for example i would say im not tall enough or handsome enough but i was mostly joking. I also know she didnt the fact that i didnt try to do more things outside and also when she met me at my house sometimes she would wait outside for 15-20 minutes and never complained or got annoyed. Those are the 3 things i know she didnt like but everything else she liked about me. She liked my tattoos, said i look good with my shirt off. She said she liked how i have good hygiene and i am clean. She said i am a great kisser and cuddler. Might be too much info but i made her cum at least twice everytime we had sex. I made her dinner around 10 times and she always enjoyed it. One time something really bad happened at her work and i went over and held her while she cried in my arms. I would cuddle her to sleep every night that we hungout. I spent all day helping her move into her new apartment. She liked holding hands and i always did. So what do i do? Is my only option to wait and hope her relationship doesnt workout? When should i contact her again? I said goodbye on the 2nd, saw her in person on the 11th, texted her on the 16th and said happy birthday on the 25th. I really dont want to lose her. She is beautiful in every way, her personality is perfect. She is the only girl i talked to and spent time with since march and she is the only girl i wanted to talk to and spend time with. I told her that in person too on the 11th. If i could just have the one chance in the future i could show her how much i matured and how i would always embrace my emotions, and how much she really means to me, and how we would do so many fun things outside. There is a very high chance i would consider spending the rest of my life with her. I asked a few people for thier opinion and about half said she still has some feelings for me and to not give up all hope. The other half said she has moved on so just forget about her. Do i give up hope or wait maybe one day she will give me the one chance when she is single again?

I would cuddle her to sleep every night that we hungout. I spent all day helping her move into her new apartment. She liked holding hands and i always did. So what do i do? Is my only option to wait and hope her relationship doesnt workout? When should i contact her again? I said goodbye on the 2nd, saw her in person on the 11th, texted her on the 16th and said happy birthday on the 25th. I really dont want to lose her. She is beautiful in every way, her personality is perfect. She is the only girl i talked to and spent time with since march and she is the only girl i wanted to talk to and spend time with. I told her that in person too on the 11th. If i could just have the one chance in the future i could show her how much i matured and how i would always embrace my emotions, and how much she really means to me, and how we would do so many fun things outside. There is a very high chance i would consider spending the rest of my life with her. I asked a few people for thier opinion and about half said she still has some feelings for me and to not give up all hope. The other half said she has moved on so just forget about her. Do i give up hope or wait maybe one day she will give me the one chance when she is single again? I am afraid the more time goes by the stronger her feelings for the new guy will become and the more she will forget about me",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130049,public,self,I want her back and most likely to be with forever,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2xxyr/i_want_her_back_and_most_likely_to_be_with_forever/,no_ads,0.0,

My boyfriend has always been close to his mum, where he drives her around for everything as her relationship with his dad isn't good eventhough they're still married. So I've always gotten a feeling he's the stand-in for his dad, especially since he's the eldest child.

Now that his mother found out about us dating, I've noticed a pattern of her needing him to do stuff on days that we meet. Due to distance and work, we only hang out on weekends where we spend both days together. It has never been an issue earlier on, back when she didn't know about our relationship. But now that we made it official and he told me that he's been telling his mum about me, she starts making plans on weekends too where she needs him to be there. 

The first instance was her wanting to go to some park and needing him to drive her there, but eventually it got cancelled for some reason. And now, she wants him to drive her to see his grandmother so he cancelled our date. Another instance of this was us having a Teams meeting during the lockdown where we were supposed to watch a movie and play games, but he left me waiting for an hour because his mum wanted to use his laptop.

Am I being unreasonable for feeling some type of way? I just feel like if we were to get married one day, I'll never be his first priority. It'll always be his mum at  her snap of the finger.

I should also mention that he brings his mum up a lot. If I'm talking about something I've done, something I wanna do, it'll be 'Oh my mum likes this too' or ' My mum this and that'

Sorry for the long post, but I don't want to leave out too many details. I’m using a throwaway because the girl I’m dating also casually uses reddit as well. Ok so I (26M) have been dating a dating a girl (24F) since March 2021. We agreed to take things slow since she got out of a bad 3-year long relationship (guy cheated on her) in November 2020, so we’re taking one step at a time in getting to know each other, but recently we’ve agreed to be exclusive (I assumed exclusive meant dating, but to her it apparently means dating without attaching labels).

To give some background to our relationship at the moment, she seems really interested in me and includes me a lot in her inner circle, since I’ve met a few of her cousins, some friends, her siblings, and even her parent accidentally while I was picking her up. I only mention this because she seems interested in me and she wouldn’t have introduced me to them if she wasn’t. We also talk about our futures a lot, how she'd help me settle in my new place when she gets back from her trip and she said she’s looking for a long-term relationship, which I am as well. We've even had nightly phone calls with each other that would last for 5-8 hours, since we never run out of things to talk and joke about. We also text daily with each other (not excessively, they're hours apart especially during work, but they're usually huge paragraph texts, which we both tried to shorten, but like I said, we have so much in common and things to talk about) and she talks about me a lot to the people in her life I haven't met so far.

Weve kissed one time, but she seems to want to take it slow. 

Since we’re taking things slow, we havent had sex yet other than hand holding, cuddling, and acts of service towards each other, like paying half for everything, pet names and getting each other small things we know we both like. We’re also going on a weekend getaway together too in the coming weeks (mutually agreed to not have sex on this trip, but sharing the same bed) before she goes on her trip with Frank.

Anyways, I knew early on she planned a week-long trip for early August 2021 with a guy (we'll call him Frank) she was friends with since undergrad before we met and she told me this near the start of us dating, which they eventually fully booked the flights and hotel 2 months after we started seeing each other. I’m not the controlling type and encourage her to be her own person, so I was obviously supportive of them going on the trip together. I believe they planned this trip sometime after she and her ex broke up with each other, so I was nowhere in the picture when they made the plans and since we haven’t attached labels yet, I’m just trying to be supportive.

Over time I started learning a little more about Frank. So apparently Frank did a separate 3 month trip on his own in Europe, where he apparently hooked up with a lot of girls, which was new to the girl I’m dating, since she thought he wasn’t like that. Around the same time I started learning more details about this trip they’re going on, such as they booked one of those hotels that chooses rooms for them to cut costs, so it’s possible they could be sharing a bed together for an entire week. I’m not the jealous kind and we haven’t officially attached labels to us yet, but I can’t help but feel slightly insecure that there is a risk of them hooking up on the trip.
Apparently her ex was threatened by him, but at the same time he did cheat on her, but everything I know about her past relationship is through her perspective and obviously I know there are two sides to everything.

We had a talk over the phone after I found out about them possibly sharing the same bed for 7 days for their trip, where I mentioned I'm not comfortable with this and asked if she would be uncomfortable if the roles were reversed and she has the same thoughts on this as me that she would let me go on the trip, but she would be equally uncomfortable with the idea of me sharing a bed with someone else for an entire week, but they also booked all the tickets and they obviously planned this before I entered the picture, so I didn't want to get in the way. She also said she hopes they get separate beds, but they won't know until they check in.

Basically I just wanted to hear everyone’s thoughts on this. Like I said I have no problem with them traveling together and I honestly wouldn't have interjected even if we were officially a couple, like if they shared a room with separate beds, but I just can't help but be a little worried with them sharing the same bed for an entire week and that Frank might try to hook up with her on the trip. I mean, they did talk about this after she broke up with the last guy, maybe he had other intentions (I don't want to delve in speculations there). Is this normal for me to feel like this or am I being irrational? Other than this, everything else seems perfect.

Posting on my alt account because a bunch of people in my life know my main. 

I'm a 32-year-old man and I recently got out of a long, bad relationship. This week I decided I was ready to put myself out there and download some dating apps. I'm primarily using Tinder because I don't have enough good and recent photos for Hinge. Since the beginning of the pandemic, my ex and her friend group all isolated themselves off, so I have no photos of me doing fun things because I didn't do fun things while isolated. But I digress. 

I matched with a couple people right away this week. Sent messages, chatted a little bit, asked for phone numbers, texted, planned a couple dates. Sounds good, right?

Because of the holiday, my first date was booked for today. This woman is the one I'm most interested in from my matches. I asked if she wanted to meet in the afternoon or later, she said afternoon. I probably messed up by not planning a time. Maybe I messed up by planning for Friday on Tuesday. 

I texted this morning around 11am to see if 3pm worked for her. It's now approaching 4pm and I haven't heard from her. At this point I'm trying to take the L and move on. It's just hard because I have nothing else going on. I'm bored and lonely and really needed this.

Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me.

I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds. Then, I came to my senses and realized I should be moving on and walked away. Problem is that I’m finding it really hard to move on. 

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she’s drunk? Why did she say that we don’t get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I understand people might see me as the bad guy for going after a girl who just got out of a breakup, but I would rather get rejected immediately than wait around for her so that I can move on.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130076,public,self,Is she attracted to me?

Soon after starting to talk, B and I hung out for the first time, it went really well, we had good conversations and we hung out again the next week. He told me he liked me about a month ago, in both a romantic and sexual way, and wanted to be FWB but with the romantic stuff. I told him I liked him as well, because I did, he told me nice compliments and called me pretty a lot, he sent goodmorning and goodnight texts and asked how my day was, he encouraged me to get a job where he worked, and so I did.

But about two weeks ago he's gradually started to slow down with the talking, he doesn't reply as fast anymore, he doesn't compliment me as much anymore, he doesn't send goodnight and goodmorning texts, says he can't hang out when I ask, and is overall pretty dry.

I asked him if he had lost interest, and he said ""no, i just don't really feel like talking lately"". Part of me doesn't believe this, part of me does, because I know his life isn't the greatest right now, but with the gradual decrease in contact, his answer was not convincing.

What I'm trying to say is that were really good friends but I love him too much to keep my feelings a secret any longer. I'm starting to think about starting off small, like initiating a plan to hang out with him alone. Though, whenever I ask ""Hey, wanna hang out?"" by habit he is always certain I mean my cousin is coming along too. We once made a plan that I'll go out with the guy, same expectation of all three of us being there, and after a few minutes my cousin would call me saying that he can't make it because he doesn't feel well, and if the guy feels uncomfortable after 10 minutes I'd immediately leave. But I just don't find that fair and want to think of another plan to ask him to hang out one on one without meaning it in a date way.

Basically we have been texting and snapping every day as small talk, but not at the frequency that we texted in the past.  It was his idea to consider rekindling in the future (when I chose to break things off with him dealing with personal stuff), and I reached out 3 days ago to check in.  Basically I’ve been planning on asking where his interest lies as of now in rekindling based on how he responds today.

Anyways my last 3 texts were: last night telling him to go to bed when he told me he was exhausted after thanksgiving with his family, me telling him I was barely waking up this morning, and me telling him I had a long day and am exhausted like half an hour ago (which was many hours after second message).  The last two texts especially are similar in length, content and energy to how he messages many times.  In the midday today, he responded to a Snapchat picture I send to everyone (like including my close female friends) but didn’t text me.  Is there something to make of that (like basically a slow fade or more to do with not having much to say to the second message)?  After I responded to his Snapchat message (as a chat) is when I casually sent the third message.  I’m hoping that it doesn’t come across as clingy on second thoughts.  As background, I should say he used to double text me few times, especially to say good morning if I didn’t say much to the previous night’s message.

I also should mention that in the past he would always start and continue convos throughout the day even if there was not much to say.  The past few days-we were both mutually continuing convo by both asking and answering q’s, but he isn’t keeping it going throughout the day when there isn’t much to say, as he would in the past.  I’m noticing yesterday and day before, I’d see a text from him around the times he saw my snaps or viewed my snap story.  Which makes me think perhaps he’s on his phone less when he has extended family?  Or maybe it’s a sign he’s being friendly but definitely no longer interested?  Or is waiting to know my direct intentions behind reaching out after a while this week before texting like he used to?  Either way, I’ll move on depending on either his responses lessening or if he lets me know he’s not interested if I get around to asking him.

I don't enjoy anything I do. I don't enjoy it because I have goals but I can't reach them, and it makes me extremely angry. I am self goal directed. I always have goals never without one but I never achieve them. I have very bad eyesight. -4.00 eyesight with -2.00 astigmatism. And extremely tight eyes that prevent me from driving. I have driven it I don't anymore because now it's so bad, not even coming out the driveway I'm already so bad of a danger and I can't keep my eyes open even right now. And at my life just started a online grec accredited real estate course but with my social behavior and manner I won't be successful. I can't talk properly and I mumble. I've got scoliosis and congenital cervical vertebrae fusion and also retrolisthesis in lumbar spine. I can't even read what I'm writing my eyesight is very bad. I need to move out this house because I'm having alot of family problems and moving out 100% will solve it. But with another person more problems will come to. Everyone thinks I'm always procrastinating but nobody will ever know how many articles and research on many topics I've read. I learn alot of things every day always. I'm addicted to learning every day but only things I'm interested in like nutrition and exercise. 
I think I look like a creep and a rapist. Even though I'm not. I'm very hairy and with my looks I look like a bad guy. I guess I'm a bad guy but I've done withing wrong. But I've never raped anyone and I'm not a creep. I don't know what to do.

We decided to stay friends (because that always works 🙄) and after a couple months I foolishly went back one more time to see her for her birthday back in September as a friend. I got there and it was like she was herself again, always smiling, having a good time, she was holding my hand, telling me she misses me and how she wants to get back together but she needs to be mentally ready for it and I accepted and didn't push the matter. We ended up having sex multiple times in the 4 days I was there (another mistake) and everything was good. I would say about a week after I returned home we got into an argument about something dumb and it turned into stuff about us and my time there, it basically ended with her saying she only wanted me to see her for her bday for sex and some other equally hurtful things. This was obviously quite upsetting to read (we were texting) and the conversation ended soon after. It was weighing on my mind for a few days but I didn't do anything about it, but while I was out one day she texted me, we got talking and I asked her to tell me if she really meant what she said because it was really dragging me mentally and her response was just ""Idk"" I never got a real answer but I feel like isn't true. Anyways, months down the line and shes become a very toxic person who everytime I speak to has nothing good to say and always insults me in any way she can find, we haven't spoken in over a month but I still find myself thinking about her every day and reminissing about when she wasn't this way and wishing things didn't go the way they did and I feel it really bringing me down. Something about me is I get attached to people very easily and It's hard for me to forget people due to tht and a good memory. Anyone got any reccomendations to help me keep my mind off of all this because I feel like this long after I should be completely over it and she shouldn't be on my mind. I try to distract myself with my hobbies and collage but it always seems my mind gets the best of me and I can't stay away from that part of my brain.
