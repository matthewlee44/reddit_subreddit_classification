Not a long relationship, 9 months but one where we were invested in each other.

Long story short, it all came to a head last month and we had a heart to heart and I told her I was just scared of getting hurt again (divorce 2 years ago) and I didn't realise I was guarding myself.  I thought long and hard about my feelings for her over that weekend and realised I was falling in love with her.  So I told her.

This then triggered her to evaluate her feelings and the relationship and she said she didn't feel it like I did.  This hurt as she wanted more from me and I gave it to her along with my heart.

We took it really slow for the first couple of months Things have been getting more serious and with it truly fantastic in almost all ways. We really like each other and this week during some pillow talk we told each other we love each other. It was really sweet and feels true and authentic to us both. 

We both have kids, and she's really busy with a new job and other ""adult life"" obligations. I have more free time. We both make efforts to see each other as much as we can, it's about 2-3x a week. 

Lately I think that I've been putting too much emphasis on ""my love language"" needs. I really identify with ""words of affirmation"" and ""physical touch"" (not sexual based). But here is where I feel the problem is. She's a bit of an introvert, self admits that she doesn't like to text much, and doesn't like to talk on the phone. I'm the type that likes to text and talk if we can't be together. So when I know I won't see her for 4-5 days I get anxiety. 

At first it feels like I'm not getting what I need from her. It feels like a void, unbalanced, like I've been unintentionally keeping ""score"". It feels like this whole love language idea is making me co-dependent, making me tie my value to her. I've directly stated that I need more ""touch and words"", and she's said she'd work on it to try harder, which I absolutely love.

It feels like the beginning of the same old pattern of losing myself while seeking validation in another. I know it's not healthy, I've been working on myself and preparing myself for this exact thing! 

How do I stop it? I've been telling myself what it is, to do my own thing, take care of myself, take care of my kids, etc. And in all honesty I'm doing those things. I've maintaining other friendships and relationships. I've been riding my all my different bikes and going indoor rock climbing by myself. 

I want so bad to be able to have a conscious relationship/partnership with this woman. I don't think it's fair to put all of this on her. I want to be able to give her what love I can without the expectation of receiving it back from her. I don't want to change for her or her to change for me.

I got so many different perspectives and suggestions that truly helped my attitude and responses to him.

I wound up asking him to dial back his enthusiasm and frequency a bit, and made sure I followed through with communication by phone and initiating texting with more “substance” myself.

As some people suggested, he said he wanted me to be sure I knew he was genuinely interested and was happy I “reeled him in”.  I told him it was truly about me and my overall dislike of texting, and that I appreciated knowing is intention was to be considerate and show interest. 

Every phone call has been stellar, and our conversations are easy and fun. I find him incredibly attractive in personality and looks.

I lived about an hour and a half from him at the time,  across the state line. We met in person twice and I had to drive there and back both times as he does not have a car.

Fast forward to now. After losing my father to Covid last May, then getting Covid myself but recovering,  I relocated 900 miles away to the Deep south from the Northeast for a fresh start, to escape painful memories , and in search of affordable housing. In less than a year I managed to set myself up in a new city, find a small duplex I love for $400 a month (less than half of what my rent was up North) and after a few false starts at a couple jobs I am working full time doing a job I love. And they seem to like me too. I even completed a short vocational training program at a local community college in my new city and earned a new professional certification. All in less than a year. Its been a wild ride. 

Anyway my one remaining living relative (mom) that Im close to is recovering from a health crisis and Im headed north in June for a week to see her and handle some other business. My friend that I met 18 months ago wants to see me and I would love to see him too. Maybe for some intimacy maybe not. My thing is this. I am coming up North at my own expense taking approved but unpaid time off of work. Im paying my own way including transportation meals spending money hotel etc. He told me that the week I am approved to be off work is inconvenient and I should reschedule my whole trip for days that he is off work. I say that I will be in his city for two days and he should call off or schedule off for at least one of those days to spend some time with me since I  am paying my own way and travelling almost 900 miles. Am I wrong for feeling that this is all one sided if he refuses to do this? I already drove at my own expense to meet him twice. And while its true that I have to come up North anyway Im still going out of my way to stop in Baltimore for two days to see him. 

Frustrated. And want to say the hell with it.

My name is Michael Stahl and I am a journalist in New York City. I am working on an article about online dating profile critiques that are posted here on Reddit for the digital publication InsideHook.

If you have posted an online dating profile on Reddit, seeking tips and/or approval, I would greatly appreciate the chance to interview you.

You absolutely may remain anonymous if you like -- totally up to you. Interviews can be conducted in any number of ways, i.e. phone calls, message chats, emails through Reddit or personal accounts.

Here are my credentials:

My website: [www.MichaelStahlWrites.com](https://www.michaelstahlwrites.com/)

My work for the publication: [www.InsideHook.com/author/michael-stahl](https://www.insidehook.com/author/michael-stahl)

And if you go to the (NSFW) subreddit PLASTT, scroll down a bit and look to the right, you will find that my identity is confirmed in the Shout Outs section. The mods of this subreddit have also approved this message -- and for that I thank them!

If you're open to being interviewed (or have questions before you agree to one) please reach out to me, here or through my website, as soon as you can. I would really like to speak to both men and women, and people from culturally diverse backgrounds as well, to create as full a representation of this experience as I can.

Thank you so much! Looking forward to hearing from you.

(Impossible coincidence?) Friend also lives in the city with his wife/4th? cousin... I guess they're members of the same tribe.. Sounds a bit freaky (cousins marrying) to my American ears, but the last guy I dated described arranged marriages in his (Middle Eastern) tribe too. I guess it's a way of life.

Well after our video, we'd texted just a bit. He'd never been too forward or trashy (no aggression/unwanted pics). Quite classy, although I gleaned that he's extremely lonely. His was the last text in that thread. I had left it at that (and so did he) until yesterday, when I reached out and he happened to have the day off.

 He agreed to meet, though he kept messaging about seeing his apartment and maybe I could leave my car at his place and we could visit his neighborhood bar, driving in the same car. Normally red flags, though I recalled from dating a Frenchman, some guys are suuuper insistent on driving or (in the case of the Frenchman) flying together. 

Well we first meet at a restaurant. I'm not as attracted in person as in pictures/video, but don't assume he is either and definitely trying to be open minded and optimistic. I think it was that his style was just nerdier or something than I'm used to (he's in engineering). Anyway, conversation is a bit tough, in part bc he only began learning English when he arrived in US 3 or 4 years ago. Also, at one point he described both of us as ""shy."" Probably true, although I felt that he didn't express much curiosity about me. Then again, I had such a hard time understanding his accent, I was almost scared to ask questions, for fear of having to give the blank face or keep asking him to repeat himself...  Awkward, for sure. 

After dinner (he insisted on paying), we'd discussed the possibility of checking out the bar by his place, though he kept inviting me to his home, saying we could drink and talk on the balcony. Plus he mentioned that the bar got more noisy/boisterous the later it got. It felt like a quandary. I very much wanted to continue talking, but the thought of a loud bar seemed unacceptable. For communication, or if it turned out to be a really fun bar/night, that might be worse, bc I didn't want to get carried away drinking.

So (maybe completely stupidly), I agreed to drinks on his balcony. I was also having visions of that show, Married at first sight, where Dr Pepper goes in to inspect the home, see what she can learn about a person. I'm just nosy.

It basically turned out to be fine. We communicated more freely, he and his place were interesting to me. But then half after midnight, I felt like.... date's over. Possibly bc he mentioned something about kids (in the future). Now, I'm not totally opposed to trying to have kids with the right person, but ... I don't know? Someone not looking for kids is probably a better match for me.

Other potential red flags:  his birthday came up and I tried to clarify his zodiac sign. He said something completely off kilter. Who the heck thinks they're a different sign than they actually are?? Could he be adopting a different identity, like as a refugee? (Not the first time I've wondered this about a date.) Other potential red flag: 2 toothbrushes in the holder.

Well... I felt ready to ""digest"" everything. He walked into the living room as I was putting on my shoes to leave. He was having NONE of it. Now, I am absolutely not a ONS kinda gal. I'd like to get married someday and don't want to date if there's zero chance of that. Plus, I need time to get 100% comfortable with a guy, in and out of the bedroom. 

But he talked me into staying longer. _Neither of us have work tomorrow_ / _We're having a nice time_ / _Pick a movie for us to watch_ / _If you get sleepy, I'll make you comfy, let you wear my clothes_ .. etc. It was like... almost violently friendly/accommodating. I feel like there's a movie scene somewhere in the back of my mind that captures this sense of overwhelming hospitality, (maybe when Jerry S. and his father argued over who pays for dinner.) Generosity and gregariousness seems like the basic demeanor of Mediterranean and Eastern people, as far as I can tell. He kept saying _This home IS YOUR home_

Anyway. Ok, I give in. He's looking more adorable and I'm getting sleepy and cozy, in his arms. He starts kissing me. We end up making out with some serious heavy petting, but I have to put my foot down at some point. First date sex is simply not going to happen and (as I've had to do numerous times on dates with guys who it seems are only out for one thing), I hold my ground. He makes it known that he doesn't understand why. (I can't believe even at this age, I'm still putting the brakes on my dates!) However, he didn't push things too far. We fell asleep. I woke up early to leave, kind of gently shaking him to say goodbye. He mumbled some sort of acknowledgement.

Now what, I wonder? At one point in our conversation, I'd suggested something about maybe just being friends, I'd help him with his English. He looked down, seeming to not really like that. 

If he was just looking for sex, not a serious relationship or marriage (with me, anyway), I guess I'll never hear from him again. Obviously, if we continue dating, we should talk about what we want from our futures. But at this point, I guess just wait to see if he reaches out. Or should I assume this isn't MY guy and (mentally) move on? (tho I don't feel like getting back on any apps right now.) Or did I already somehow handle everything all wrong?

Any opinions or insight? ... Do a background check? I'm pretty sure he really does work where he said he does, and is from the country he claims to be, so wasn't feeling rushed to do that.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,48782,public,self,Last night's first date,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nivd3p/last_nights_first_date/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,e06d24a4-275e-11e9-9b74-0e6a6c05416c,Casual Conversation,,

Tomorrow I’m going hiking with somebody and it’s our third date. I posted about him a couple of weeks ago and said that there were some red flags on our first date where he seemed a bit over-eager and talked over me quite a bit. He and I were both traveling for work, and so I didn’t see him again until last night. Between then and now we texted quite frequently and I’ve come to really like him. I had a great time with him last night, also. 

But, (Isn’t there always a but?)He really doesn’t ask me about anything about me and he talks mostly about himself. If I offer some thing about myself he does seem to listen very attentively. And he does seem to remember things I say. But he’s not asking me questions and at this point I think I probably know a great deal more about him and he knows about me. I would say 80% of our conversation is about him. 

So my question is this. Would you say something? I think communication is important and I think there’s a good chance that this may be a difference in communication styles. There’s also a chance that he’s just selfish or self-involved. When we’re hiking tomorrow if he still doing this after a while I was considering saying something very simple like, “I’ve noticed that you don’t ask me a lot of questions about myself and it makes me feel as though you’re not terribly interested in me as a person. I’d like to believe that I’m incorrect. I’m hoping that maybe this is just a difference in communication styles. What do you think?”

Or, would you think that this man is 49 years old and if he doesn’t know by now to do this it’s probably simply not worth pursuing. As much fun as I had last night and as much as I have enjoyed getting to know him, I considered not seeing him again because of how much this bothers me. 

So talk to him about it or just let it go? Thanks!

Also, if you look at my post history you’ll see that I am separated and not fully divorced. It seems like whenever I post, I get lots of advice about how I shouldn’t be dating at all- regardless of what I’m asking. I get that some people think that and you’re welcome to your opinion. He and I had a thorough discussion about my status and the level of a relationship that I can commit to right now, and he understands.

I’m 52 and been single for awhile like 5 years from a serious relationship.  I am still sexually active but more of FWB. 
So I matched with a woman.  She is definitely not my type and I am not hers either.  But we met and there was some kissing, which was long overdue and very good for both of us.  So we were talking about then next step and she has only had sex with her husband for the past 24 years. 
So we are in the phone.  Her friend tells her to be honest about what she needs, what she’s used to and what she enjoys. 
I am completely into this because I enjoy satisfying her more then myself.  
So her expectation is what she has been doing for the past 24 years.  2-4 hours of sex every time.  
Every time for 24 years.
I have had them when I was younger but that was I call a marathon session.  Stay in bed all day. 
She’s had no quickies (which she thinks is a 30-40 minute session) which is what I’m used to as normal.  A quickie is 10-15 minutes for a spontaneous, hey meet me in the Starbucks bathroom thing.
I thought she was joking but dead serious. 
I really don’t think I am interested anymore.  Even if I meet her and it’s great.  It’s still wouldn’t be a 3 orgasm over a couple of hours. I am not worried that I am inadequate.  But there’s not really a way for me to feel that I was as from her perspective. 
Lots of other issues that are secondary. 
But my question is what would you do?  How much of a train wreck is this? 
I see a good friendship.  But probably not much on a serious nature.

The whole time we were dating he was badmouthing his ex, such as (these are his words) she was a narcissist, bipolar, verbally and mentally abusive, not a nice person, and mean. He never felt he was wanted. For example she would call him fat all the time and tell him she'll leave him if he doesn't stay fit. They broke up a little over 6 months ago and not following each other on IG. But he said the one time she texted him brought up a lot of pain (he even posted a meme about it on his IG). So he blocked her text.

I felt genuinely sorry that it happened to him. His stories made me really hate his ex. I really cared about him (probably too soon) and I made sure he feels appreciated and wanted all the time. He was nice to me. But I guess I was invested too much too soon in this relationship. And it's all my fault.

I found out that right after we stopped dating, they are following each other on IG and the ex made her IG private. Yes, I did a little stalking. I'm just guessing they're reconnected. Old habits die hard, I guess. 🙃

I got a Bad Date bingo, last night.   


*  Looked nothing liked her pictures 
*  Extremely critical of me and basically everything. 
* Was a hot mess coming off a recent divorce and also couldn’t stop talking about the (very recent) end of her first post divorce relationship. 
* Made many incorrect assumptions about me and didn’t ask a single question to get to know me, or find out anything about me. 
* She’d say awful things, and I thought she might be being sarcastic but she wasn’t. Or sometimes she was. But it was always my fault for not understanding how she communicates, and unacceptable that I had to ask for clarification.
* She did one of my least favorite things, arguing angrily with me about something I actually agree with anyway. 
* “Corrected” me about several factual things that I was not actually wrong about. 
* Was elitist and treated me like I was lucky to go out with her ... based only on aforementioned incorrect assumptions about me. (Was surprised to discover I had any creative ambitions, because I'm ""not an artist"" and ""work in payroll or something."" (I do not work in payroll. I write and paint daily.)
* One-upped everything I did share about myself.

We are both 42 and met in September. He moved in around February- I was not in a rush to start dating him but he swore I am the one and still stands by that. I am at a point in my life where I'd really like to have a real partner to love and cherish and treat well. I love him but he rubs me the wrong way often. I cant help but feel uncomfortable about his attitudes towards women. He's an obvious flirt (with attractive women only) and while I'm not trying to draw attention to my jealousy he has pried it out of me a few times when sensing something is wrong and then made me feel stupid or called me crazy for sharing my feelings. 

One big thing that bothered me quite a bit that I'm not sure if I'm being irrational about is that he keeps company with a lot of kids in their early 20s, and is still friends with younger girls he's been with. One girl is 22 and he slept with her 2 years ago when she was 20 and he was 40. To me this seems like a red flag, but he played it off as totally normal- I mean, I know its legal but honestly it bothers me and feels predatory. Another girl he says is just a friend that's 24 and calls him her uncle- he told me not to be worried because she's too young for him, yet I know about the other girl that's 2 years younger.  He does have other friends our age group, and I like most of them and they like me. But it bothers me that he wants to keep close ties to such young women. He at first tried to introduce me to the 22 year old and I firmly told him I never want to meet her... maybe that was wrong but that's how I feel. I have met and hung out with the 24 year old and have slowly accepted they are just friends (although I cant see what he's getting from the friendship, she seemed immature for her age) but he seems to be upset with me for questioning him at all, and sort of turned it around on me as being a jealous weirdo. 

There are other things too that have degraded my trust, but only because they have aroused my suspicions- so far I don't think he's actually done anything I should worry too much about.  Im typically not the jealous type, I feel I am attractive and talented and a great catch, and yet I'm left feeling insecure instead of reassured. I am worried this guy is going to get bored of me and leave me in the dust. But, he swears I'm the one and says he wants to get married, and that he would never hurt me.

The fact that I approached them is a small victory for me.

Long version: My ex-fiancee and I decided almost 3 years ago that things just weren't right for us so we mutually agreed to end our relationship. We have maintained a friendship though we aren't as close as we used to be which, I feel, is natural. I only recently began to consider the possibility of dating again. 

Historicaly, I've either been set up by friends or women have approached me. A lack of confidence and a fear of rejection (among other difficult things) manifested themselves back when I was a teenager. I certainly did not have good role models when it comes to relationship when I was younger either. There have been times when I've been totally clueless when a woman is expressing interest in me, too!

I regularly visit the gym and have made conversation with these 2 women in the past so, after I finally decided that ""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", I stuck up conversations and found that they have boyfriends. I asked one if she would be interested in talking more which is when she told me she has a bf but also said she's open to making new friends. I felt a littte awkward after that exchange, TBH. As for the other, the conversation was a bit more casual but I found an opening and was able to ask if she has a significant other and she said she did. Our conversation continued to flow so that was more comfortable overall.

For someone who has had lots of challenges when it comes to feeling confident enough to ""put myself out there"", I view both of these experiences as victories for me. It's also been that way for me when it comes to just making friends. I usually make them through work but am interested in widening that circle. I have made some nice friends at the gym - we'll workout together or just socialize a bit. I've looked into some volunteering at a place I support through my membership but they are holding off on that for a little longer. I looked a little bit online at Meetup and may dig more into that. I consider myself a more reserved, introverted person but that doesn't mean I want to be a hermit living in a cave for the rest of my life, either. Having a companion would be nice to experience life together and if it leads to an intimate relationship, then that would also be quite nice.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading this lengthy post. I've lurked in the sub quite a while and have commented at times but this is the first new post I've put up here.

Reaching out for opinions online from total strangers is perfectly normal right?

I have a second home in a very rural area in the mountains where cabins and homes are spread out. The area provides loads of recreation year-round and is a popular place for tourism. This summer, my plan is to do more hiking and get out to areas I haven't yet seen. I recently met the neighbor lady who is a full-time resident out there and she needs someone to hike with so it's a perfect setup.

We've been on a couple of hikes now so we've spent many hours in the woods alone, walking, climbing, and talking. It's great and I look forward to the next one. We laugh and relate with each other but are very different in some ways as well. We are neighbors. She gave me a quick tour of her house, I did the same a week later. We borrow things from each other and can talk comfortably about many topics. 

2 things:

**I'm developing a crush on this woman.**

**She's a widow of just over 2 years.**

I'd just like to hear some opinions so I can maybe turn my brain off about it. She grew up in a foreign country so any little signal at all that I pick up on is most likely not a signal and just wishful thinking on my part. My brain is telling me to not rock the boat and be happy with what we have but then my other brain is telling me to ""shoot my shot"" and possibly mess everything up. 

The widow thing is huge. She was in a very good marriage full of travel and adventure and I believe she still struggles with the loss. I wouldn't say we flirt at all in the traditional sense and she has in no way lead me on. She's a super-intelligent, talented woman who hasn't yet figured out what she wants next in life. I've been divorced for a year with 1 post-divorce STR under my belt.                  ",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,48913,public,self,Any advice?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/njnf4o/any_advice/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,

So, about an hour into our hike I just simply asked him why he wasn’t asking me more about myself. I told him that it felt concerning to me that he wasn’t asking me more questions and seemed to indicate a lack of interest in me as a person. But, I also pointed out that I was really enjoying his company and found him to be a very kind and considerate person- so I assumed it was a misunderstanding of communication styles. 

He was completely stunned that I would think he was not interested in me in any way. He told me that he felt like if he was quiet and allowed me to talk, I would be more likely to share the things that were important to me- and that he had been waiting for me to do that. We talked about it for a while and for the rest of the day met in the middle. He did ask me more questions but I also spoke more openly. We had a fantastic time. I think he’s awesome and look forward to seeing him again.

He was a good guy and I was proud of myself not picking another a.hole like I did for a husband. 

He had trust issues because of his previous marriage and just would stop communicating with me or breaking up a few times because he was trying to protect his feelings instead of resolving issues by talking. I was patient with him as I understood that feeling. He came around each time and apologized so we moved on. 

Everything was going well and we were having so much fun together. I didn't have big expectations as it had been years since I was in a relationship and I just wanted to be happy in the present without thinking 10 steps ahead. 

We were gonna meet today. He called me and told me basically he is breaking up with me because: He has only 4 years left until his kid turns 18 years old (When he said he has only 4 years left I thought he had cancer or something) so he doesn't have to deal with his ex. However, I have 10 years left before my kids turn 18. He doesn't want to take on responsibility for my kids and my crazy ex and doesn't see himself being in that situation. 

He has not met my kids or my ex-husband. He only knows what I tell him. I am going through some stuff with my ex-husband but nothing about the kids at the moment as custody got resolved even before I met this guy. 

I am shocked that he would break up with me today for this reason. I knew he always had issues with resolving conflicts but I didn't think he would break up with me for this reason. He knew from the beginning I had kids and not a very nice ex-husband.

I've started OLDing again. I talked to one guy and we had a decent conversation. We planned a date for the weekend. The afternoon after our first and last phone conversation he calls and said the battery went out on his truck. OK, that's tough. He said a tow truck driver was there but he was charging $75, but he only had $30 and left his credit card at home. Poor baby. He said he had called his brother for the $45 but the brother wasn't answering. I told him OK, try your brother again he might answer now. I hung up and blocked him. He started back to back calling and texting me. Asking how can I leave him out there, and he thought I had his back. I never even met you but now I'm your emergency contact? For a bs emergency, I told him to call Uber. But I blocked him because he said he had triple A, but it would take them an hour. So you rather ask me then wait an hour. He sent me his cashapp ID.

I talked to this different guy on the phone about a week. We met and were planning our next date. He says babydoll whatever you want or need I will finance it, you don't have to worry. I said ok. But I wanted to laugh in his face. I probably make more money than he does. Hearing this had no effect on me at all. Anything I want or need I can pay for myself that's why I go to work every day.

However, it’s also the biggest game in town for modern dating. But personally, I find it MUCH more pleasant and successful when an in-person meetup happens sooner rather than later. 

Endless app messaging and texting is boring. I don’t care how cool we both are. Also, keeping it entirely PG for days and days is sort of odd, but going down the sex-talk road before meeting in person is often a bad choice for a host of reasons. Getting a daily “good morning” or “how was your day” text from someone I’ve never met just ends up feeling blah. 

The solution is pretty simple. Within the first 48 hours, ask for a date. Something simple, short, and inexpensive or free. A coffee, a walk, a drink if you’re so inclined. Meet in person in a public place. See if you vibe. No you don’t have to buy dinner or plan something extravagant. Just hang out for an hour and chat. 

Nothing, including phone calls and video chats, can take the place of talking in person. And nothing makes it clearer whether or not you’ll want to keep seeing each other. 

I’ve had SO many guys keep messaging for days without asking for a date, and I’ve reached the point where I usually drop out after 3 or 4 days of this. I just don’t have the energy. If I really see potential, I might hint around; if they don’t get the hint, I’m out. 

I want to be clear and say that YES, I know women can also ask. But years of dating have shown me that—especially in the over-40 demographic—guys don’t really love it when women do the asking. Hints maybe (“I wonder how we will get along in person!”) but not the actual ask. It would be great if that gender bias weren’t true, but there you go.

I am, my certainly, not in a glass house throwing stones. I have a spouse that had an affair (of which I had no idea and happened to be out-of-state with my first cousin’s wife!) and then held the pieces together for our then 14- and 16-yo daughters. Currently manage an ex-relationship with a true narcissist and - the icing on the cake - live NEXT DOOR to his parents/my former in-laws. It’s a Lifetime Movie of bad on which I’d change the channel if it wasn’t my life. 

And, yet, I’ve surprised. I’m here and still hopeful. I feel like I’ve grown and (mostly) moved through it as time has passed, we’ve divorced, I realized my resilience and strength. 

But I’ll never forget my female lawyer saying to me at the end of it all that what she sees as a result of decades of being a family attorney specializing in complicated divorce is not a person coming out and blaming the opposite gender for faults, it’s doubting her/himself in a future relationship.

So I dabbled in the dating world premiere-covid with an app. It was likely too soon (and pre-covid). Chatted with one guy who seemed great - wanted to only meet at bars and hook up post wife. Second guy seemed fairly great - nice, talkative, common interests. Only when were offhand talking about dealbreakers did he confess to having an affair, staying with her until literally the week he asked me out. 

I missed the signs. I know we’ll have over forty “baggage” from a live lived. But how do I know to trust the possible partner? One version of an end of relationship is all we hear. Intentions that focus on self-needs or self-preservation at this stage. 

I don’t know. It seems so risky. But I’d like to believe I’ll be someone special for another someone. 

Just venting, I suppose. But would love to hear from others that feel the same way.

Matched on OLD, and we have met for coffee once and two dinner dates. We have a lot of fun during the dates and our texting styles really match up well (neither of us likes to text much, so this is great). Conversation has been great. Good kisser! 

However. 

I've initiated all three meetups (plus one more proposed meetup that didn't happen because he was busy). I initiate almost all of the texting, when we do text (mostly to make plans). Which is fine, I don't have any truck with gender roles. However I do want reciprocity and I don't want to be doing *all* the initiating! 

So on our third meetup (second dinner date) I mentioned this explicitly twice, like, ""I am looking for a partner who can reciprocate my effort in a relationship, like planning dates and just making stuff happen for us,"" and later at the end of the date, when he told me he would love to see me again, I said, ""Let me know what we're doing next time!"" 

That was last Thursday. There has been only one contact between us since, and that's when I texted him on Saturday morning from my solo camping trip over the weekend. He responded to my text immediately but no contact since. Normally that's fine by me! But now my friends are contacting me to make plans for the upcoming weekend, and I'm almost fully booked up already. 

Should I warn him that my plans for the weekend tend to get firmed up by Tuesday or Wednesday, so if we want to meet over the weekend we should plan something now? But that would be me initiating contact and initiating plans *yet again*, and I really don't want to do that. I want to sit back and see if he is interested enough to do some of the work.

He has one adult daughter, age 26. Things I've noticed over the last 7 months:

She's *the* most important person in his life. He has 0 secrets from her. To the point where I have to specifically ask him to not share our conversations with her if they're going to remain private. Totally get kids coming first, I have adult kids as well- but this seems extreme.

Physical closeness. I come from a physically close family as well- but she will climb into bed with him and cuddle, and even pouts if I'm there...like a girlfriend who doesn't want to share. Again- I'm not a stranger to physically close families, but this feels...creepy at 26. 

She dresses in the style he finds sexy. As in: Everything he's told me he'd love to see me in regarding colors, clothing type, makeup style and jewelry is stuff she wears. 

There are other, little and less obvious things: I've caught him lying about where he's been and it'll turn out that he's been with her (why lie about visiting your daughter??). He won't say no to her or draw *any* boundaries about anything- He will go to great lengths to avoid upsetting her. The only argument I've seen him willingly have with her was over the fact that he didn't like the guy she was dating. 

I've been wondering if I'm reading into things, but something recently came to light that was a full stop for me. W/o going into detail, he basically helps manage distribution of her pornographic material. He claims he never sees it, but I'm not sure that matters, because regardless: I believe that there should be a CLEAR AND FIRM boundary between sex and your kids, and this, to me, is at the very least WAY too blurred for me to handle.

He says that part will stop- but I'm not sure I can get past it because to me it's a sign my instincts on the other things are right on.

Am I a overreacting? Or is this all as creepy as I think it is?

She and I are getting older and both hear a bio clock ticking.

We broke up three years ago when our relationship became toxic she left for a job halfway across the country for  50% less and in a career she hates. I really have no idea why she took the job, maybe to get away from me.

Over the last three years, we talked every day and I visited her numerous times and her me. I feel like I'm getting better but she has severe depression, is full of hate and resentment. Part of her resentment is me never proposing after in the relationship for 5 five years (we broke up at 9 years).

Anyways I say all that to say this. She and I are getting older. She made it clear she wants to have a child and wants to have plenty of sex while she is in town.  We are both single. I do want a child,  I always imagined my first child would be in a loving marriage. Online dating has been a dumpster fire for me and although I've dated a number of women none of them was anyone I would want to settle down with by choice.

This seems like an opportunity to have a kid before its too late. My only concern is my ex (who I love) is horrible at making decisions.  For instance, she makes shitty financial AND health decisions all the time and then I have  to bail her out, OR she just suffered the consequences without saying anything. She is horrible at long term planning.  However, I know  she will be a loving mother.  To be honest I'm kind of worries this is my last opportunity to have a child with someone I love... But  I'm not really sure what to do.

Any advice?
