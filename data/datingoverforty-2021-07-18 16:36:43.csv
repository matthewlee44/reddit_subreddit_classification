So my GF (43) and I (46) broke up yesterday after a little more than a year together.  It was about a month in the making.  We had gone on a vacation with her kids, and her ex and his GF last month and since we got back she's just been distant.  We talked about it, and there were some things on my end, minor, that occurred, but in her eyes they were a lot of small things over time, building up.  

At the same time I had been questioning the relationship as well recently.  I just wasn't getting from her what I wanted in a relationship.  So we broke up yesterday, she came by today to drop off her key and we talked for a little while and we both are hurt by this, but we both know it's for the best.

Then how come it hurts me so much?  I'm really sad cause I really loved her, but I know I'll overcome the broken heart and I'll eventually be happy again - but it really hurts right now. :(

Doesn't help that I live alone (divorced a short time before I met my GF) and I don't have many friends in the area to hang out with and take my mind off her.

I found out about the affair during the 1st week of June and that was my worst week. As days progressed, I got better and I felt more at ease with my decision. We don’t have any children so it’s easier I guess. 

I ended up having a really awesome summer fling about 2 weeks ago but he is now on deployment and we agreed that there would be no point pursuing anything while he is away and even maybe when he comes back. We are okay with that. :)

Now, I’ve gone out a couple of times and I look really young despite being 41 years old. With how young I look, I keep attracting younger men. Last night,  a really nice and cute guy who was about 6’4” hit on me and we totally clicked. It turns out he’s only 23!

With that being said, my friends are thinking I should just get on some apps so I could screen by age. I cannot make up my mind because I for sure don’t want anything serious but also perhaps need to be distracted while waiting for the divorce to be finalized. I’m in California so it’s gonna be at least 6 months for things to be officially done done.

When you read a profile, and all seems great, you dig the humor, and then you happen on a detail that isn't exactly a dealbreaker, but TMI, and you wonder what kind of person would put that in their profile...

Does it ever turn out they're actually on  your wavelength, or is that jarring detail a telltale sign that you've got different societal boundaries?

For example, this guy mentions, in a metaphor style, that he shaves his private parts - I just can't fathom why that would be something that makes it onto a profile, other than it's a joke gone horribly wrong, or his aim is to make women think about his junk - I'm tempted to ask him straight out, but feel it is bad form to start the conversation on that kind of topic...

I am meeting a coworker (sort of)/friend that I’ve been friends with for many years now for some drinks, as we do once in awhile to catch up.  This time he is working on call so we’re hanging out at his house so he doesn’t have to lug his laptop around. Nothing special about that-I’ve been there a few times in the past. 

Anyway, it hit me like a ton a bricks that I have crushed so hard on him since the day we met. We have this amazing chemistry together and I think everyone could see it. But he has this personal policy of not mixing work with his personal life in any way. I think we broke that rule many years ago. 

So now that I’m back to dating and I’ve adored this man for years, should I just throw it out there and tell him when we meet up?

A lot of what went wrong is obvious, some moderately mysterious, but two things are absolute twilight zone to me. I ask for your guesses/intuition/gut feelings about what these might mean. In the interest of brevity, I won’t write a novel unless specifically asked. 

My wife filed for divorce. I knew it was coming. She denied the intent until they day she told me she wanted a divorce. She put all the marital assets out of my reach, told me she filed for divorce with her attorney, and told me tomorrow I will have the police remove me from the house. The part that stumps me is she said, “I am divorcing you because I love you.” Any insight into that?

A very brief conversation took place. I mentioned her having placed all the cash into accounts I can not access and truthfully didn’t have access to enough cash for fuel to leave town for family. I was informed she didn’t think I deserved any money, or that I should get any of the proceeds from the sale of the house we bought together when we married. That’s not the confusing part. When I told her I did not want an argument and that I would not resist her efforts at a divorce but did demand 50% of the house proceeds so I could restart my life, she said that everything she is doing is because “she is just trying to do everything she can to help me.” Thoughts? Sound like a concerned friend?

I think it will be important for me to come to some conclusion about these statements to properly heal (is that the right word?) after this divorce. Thanks.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/onb77k/what_did_she_mean/

25,onlrg3,1626724335,I’ve never felt so old. I know it shouldn’t matter but the truth is that it’s eating me up inside.,"Yesterday at my (47F) favorite spot, a young man sits next to me and strikes a conversation which seems purely friendly from my standpoint. It was just social and pleasant for the majority of the time, not flirty or weird. At some point we were chatting about the housing market, skyrocketing prices, etc. As part of the convo I said something like, “I know I’m prob a lot older but….” (details not important). His response was along the lines of, “so are you in you’re 40’s, 50’s thereabouts?” The context for his question was appropriate but hearing someone’s guess include a possibility I could be even older exploded in my brain. Just a few months ago I would still hear guesses that were way younger or comments to that effect. But not so much recently. It hit me: I’m there. Not only do I look my age, at least one person thinks I could be in the next decade. I almost heard the explosion in my brain. It gets worse…

As he gets more and more tipsy I decide to ask for the check. Before I go he says: “so I know you mentioned you’re older, but would you say too old to come have a drink at my place?”  I say, “definitely”,  with a friendly smile. His response: “oh,I’m sorry… Though I’m guessing it must be sort of a compliment to be hit on by a 30 year old.” I was MORTIFIED. I can’t even put into words why it’s upsetting me so much. I cancelled an upcoming date as soon as I got home. This other guy is 43. Being around another younger male is the last thing I need. I know I shouldn’t be but I’m so ashamed of looking my age.

26,onmdt7,1626726166,Online dating apps are crap.,"As a 45/M, I've found the online dating apps to be increasingly worthless and here's why:  First, it's almost guaranteed that almost all the apps you get get on your phone are full of fake profiles.  Even the more reputable apps seem to have quite the wealth of VERY good looking women that you KNOW aren't real because they'd never need an app to meet anyone at all.  Second, the women that ARE real on these dating apps all seem to be more interested in just satisfying their desire for some attention rather than actually being serious about finding a great guy to be in a relationship with.  At least that's my experience.  I like to think I'm a decent looking guy, never married, no kids, live alone in a house I own, nice job, nice truck, yada yada yada.  But it just seems like women don't actually WANT what they SAY they want on those dating sites.  They (and this is just my experience) are looking for the best looking guy they can find who will just give them a little attention.  

So, what do I do?  Speed dating?  Has anyone seen any success with that?  I've never tried it.

Do you live at your parents/step parents house? (Not since I was 18.)  


Are you married? Are you sure!? Are you separated/in the process of divorcing/ recently separated/ all of the above? (Am I sure? None of the above. Divorced 20 years ago, most recent relationship ended 2 years ago.)  


Are you sure you’re ready to date? (Yup, previous relationship ended 2 years ago.)  


How long have you been single, as in single SINGLE? (What the hell is single SINGLE?)  


Do you have kids? Like seriously, do they live with you? Do you live with them? (Are people lying about having kids??)  


Do you have a job? A real job? Do you support yourself? (Yes, like a legit adult job, with bi-weekly paychecks, insurance and 401k.)  


Are you on parole? (I can see this one as I have some family members in jail.)  


Have you ever been tried and/or convicted of a serious crime? (Seems like people were looking for a loophole, no, not ever convicted, tried, or even arrested. Also, when you have to add serious instead of just crime, something's off.)  


Do you work at a place that ends in E. Cheese? (I gotta admit this one is funny.)

So the other night we hang out and everything is going fine it seems. She's being pretty flirty and seems like she's having a good time. I drove around for a bit showing her where I live and stopping to get food along the way. I drop her off at the end of the night and we make plans to hangout today before she leaves tomorrow. I give her a kiss which she seemed a little reluctant about but gave me a peck on the lips. I was pretty disappointed just based on how we've talked before and how the night went but I figured maybe she would be more open If we hung out again before she left but she flaked on me today to meet up.

talk about and there was a mutual attraction. We ended going to his place and things happened. It was good but felt a bit insecure on his side which is fine the first time and not an issue for me. We made plans for Sunday evening and I ended up spending the night. Still lots to talk about in the morning and we both felt happy to be close to someone physically after all the shit that’s been going on in the world. 

Yesterday afternoon he sent a text saying we didn’t click but couldn’t put his finger on what it was and that there would only be one day for us to meet over the next month due to both of us going away for vacation. We had already said we would see each other that one day next week so what the hell happened?

I know that the general consensus would be that he only wanted sex but I didn’t get those vibes and he didn’t come across as a player either. 

I just feel bummed by the rejection and to add to that I think he actually blocked me on his phone.

This made me laugh because it is totally true. 

Also got me thinking... for those of those that have been single for a while, can you think of anything related to how you thought dating/remarrying would be that is the complete opposite of what it is like in reality?

I'll go first: When I was getting divorced back in 2014 and was in the market to buy a place to live, I purposely set out to buy a house instead of a condo.  My logic was that if I ever get remarried, it would be a lot faster to sell a house versus a condo.  

Almost 7 years later, I still laugh at my thinking because:

1. I have zero desire to ever get married again.

58,oob9gf,1626815585,Dating in general and the reveal of your self-concept.,"I've read these subreddits for long enough to be thoroughly disgusted by the work we all have to do on ourselves BUT YET we still go out there \*expecting\* ""true love"" and for a potential partner to live and play by our rules, the rules that we think are universal but really just belong to US alone.  Our loneliness and drive to end that isn't going to find us that perfect person though.  I get it.  It's been a long pandemic, and in that time, our marriages have ended, our relationships have reached their tipping point into separation, our singleness has driven us mad with desire for new people, our dogs have become our bosses.   In the interest of perhaps nudging people's perspectives back into some sort of mental health, I've written some answers to common questions I see on Reddit.  Why? Because it seems like most of us need to refocus on ourselves, at least for now, before embarking on that relationship.

*""He is super sweet, age-appropriate, widowed, gets along with my kids, but is long-winded to a fault and has hygiene problems which I'm hoping I can overlook.  Should I accept his marriage proposal?""*    Uh.   Seriously?   You have just revealed to Reddit that you are so desperate to be coupled up that you will ignore basic hygiene in another person.    Now, look at yourself and ask ""why am I so desperate?"" and answer that question.  On paper.  With a pen.   Because desperation is not love.   Uncertainty is not love.   Straighten that shit out before you go back out there.

*""We started off hot &amp; heavy, but after 2 months, he's not returning my calls, and texts me only late at night.  Is he losing interest?""*    Again...seriously?    If your daughter came to you with this question, what would you tell her?   If you don't KNOW what you'd say, that means you may be in the habit of accepting the bottom of the barrel for dates.   If that's a possibility, ask yourself WHY you do that.  Why YOU do that.  Figure that out, fix it, then get back out there.

And on that same subject, ""*I think she's losing interest in me, but I can't tell, because she used to be so nice.  I can't back away unless she tells me specifically, in clear sentences, 'I'm losing interest in you', and if she strings me along and lies about it, then she's a BITCH and IMMATURE.""*    No.   No.   What has *happened* to people and their communication practices?    If someone is drifting away from you, and you notice it, and they are suddenly unavailable to you CONSISTENTLY, and won't make a future date with you -- OPEN YOUR EYES.  IT'S RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU.      It sucks.  AND it HAPPENS.   Learn to read nonverbals.  They are a thing.      *""Well then they are IMMATURE for not being direct.""*  No.  They are not immature FOR NOT LIKING YOU, OR NOT WANTING TO CONTINUE A RELATIONSHIP.   Quit making this into some sort of federal crime if a date doesn't work out how you want it to.   Some people are for you, and some are not.  Let them go.  Quit trying to ""make"" them into someone you can ""love"".

Lying, buying time, juggling, not communicating, bread crumbing, ""the fade"", negging, narcissists, gold diggers, learn to recognize this shit.  TRUST YOURSELF.  TREAT YOURSELF BETTER THAN YOU TREAT THAT OTHER PERSON.   If you can't, DO SOME WORK ON YOURSELF SO THAT YOU CAN.   Everyone has to quit trying to USE other people to cram them into their big void in the middle of their chest.  Chill out people!   You won't die of loneliness!   Tolerate it while you work on yourself!  You'll do better, you'll find a more appropriate partner, you'll be happier.   Why, because you can't force things if they're not right in the first place.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oob9gf/dating_in_general_and_the_reveal_of_your/

In her tinder profile says that she doesn’t want to text randomly about nothing, likes chivalry, where are all the good men yada yada yada.  Cut to. She starts texting me Monday (date was made on Sunday) talking about be laundry machines how her day was going etc.  I’m confused and thinking it’s one of those traps women set I respond in a timely manor but not too fast and try to seem interested but not too engaging but not too boring like texting jujitsu. Today same thing except then she hits me with, hey do you ride a motorcycle? Because if you do my friend says I have to cancel Friday.  

So I was actually offended because I don’t currently own a motorcycle but I used to own 2 Harley’s and sold them when my son was born to help with expenses and I just didn’t have time to ride but eventually I will buy another one.  So I responded that I guess we should cancel our date.  To which she replied you didn’t answer the question.  I explained I didn’t currently have one but used to and that I was going to own one again in the future.  Then she explained that her “guy” friend said not to date me if I had one because a good friend of his just got in a wreck and lost his arm and his girlfriend lost her leg.  

So here’s where the “asshole” comes out.  I then said Awe he must really care about you.  I then asked if she vetted all her dates like this or if I was special.  Then she tells me that he told her to stop dating and delete all the dating apps.  I said that it sounded like he had some feelings there.  She proceeds to tell me that they dated right after her 3rd marriage ended and “they” decided that they would be better off as friends.  I told her that this is where I take my self out of the equation and cancel the date because I know how this story ends.  I told her it sounded like there’s more to this relationship than just a friendship and maybe she should give him another shot.  She told me that I was being jealous of their friendship and it’s better she find out now.  I responded, that I don’t need to know either of them for the past 5 years to know there is something else there maybe not for her but definitely for him. And I left it with a peace.

I joined this r/ again because I started dating again.  I have a new attitude since the pandemic ended, and surprisingly to me, , my calendar is chock full of dates with high quality, smart, and accomplished women.  So, consider this a public service announcement.

*Your first sentence in your bio really matters to a quality man who reads bios.*

This is the sort of man who you want to attract.  Someone who has enough brains to 1) read and 2) care what you have to say.  So, kindly keep that in mind while you read on.

In another thread, I commented that I would insta swipe left on a womans bio if she wrote certain things because they implied frustration and a bad attitude.  Here are a smattering of pretty typical posts that I swiped left on just today.

&gt;Seems as though I need to put it bluntly that if your hitting me up for booty calls don't bother; I'm not a prude but lately this is what I've been attracting on here.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm a workaholic and I......

Got it.  No booty calls, but not a prude.  Works big hours.  You'll have to be flexable with your life because she can't be with hers.

&gt;I will not give you money.  Please don't try my patience.  It will not end well for you.

I'm sincerely curious what she would do if I asked for money.  Is she threatening to kick my butt?  Not that I would ask anyone for money.  I have my own money. I digress.

&gt;So, I did meet a guy on here, but he turned out to be a game player and was a narcissist, so no narcissists please!

This is probably my favorite one, as this lady is advertising that she's already prime to be manipulated by a narcissist because she's already fallen prey to one.  All they have to do is run the standard narc game on her and she'll fall for it again.

But here's the kicker:

&gt;Fun loving, easy going woman looking for the real thing.

Oh wait, I swiped right on her.  Anyone wonder why?

Why I'm writing this:  I'm focused on having fun, living my best life, and finding like minded women who want to do the same.  I was not always like this.  I was married for 20 years, but went through a scorching divorce, and had enough trust issues to fill a warehouse as recently as six months ago - and gave up ever dating again.

Then I fixed my attitude.  Because you can't catch bees with vinegar, you need pollen.  Your first sentence can do the same.  Or it can alienate good men who otherwise might swipe right.  Your choice.

We talk a lot about living in a touch deficit,  and looking for non-sexual touch opportunities. We also talk about sex, but not too deeply, as we agree it it can easily dominate the conversation. I am looking forward to becoming sexual with this person, and I am monogamous.

I don't want to rush exclusivity - but I also don't want to become sexual with partner who may be also sexual with other people during his dating phase.

I know this question comes up a lot on these threads....

75,oopjbs,1626872930,I didn’t used to be paranoid,"But like others, online dating has changed that. 

Yesterday, had a great conversation with a very nice woman. We had previously exchanged a few text messages. She has a weird work schedule and would get back to me about when a good time would be to meet in person. 

I had a scheduled zoom meeting at 1130am and our conversation was reaching that time, so we had to stop. During our conversation, the person I was meeting over zoom texted me to ask whether we could meet 30 minutes later, which was fine with me. 

I figured I should thank this very nice woman for our conversation, so sent her a text at 11:38am doing just that. Said nothing about the 30 minute delay because I thought nothing of it. 

So now my online dating paranoia is such that she had a problem with the time when I sent the text. Did I lie to her? Was I ignoring someone at work just to text her? 

Haven’t heard from her since and I didn’t necessarily expect to (neither of us are really into the random text exchange thing) until she worked out her schedule. 

If she changed her mind about me during our conversation, that’s all good. But if she changed her mind because of a misinterpretation due to the timing of a text, that would suck.

Curious what the women here think about my (42M) job status,"Hi all, just found this sub because I'm about to get back on the OLD sites so I figured there were subs to check into.  I don't have a ton of experience on the apps, just a few brief periods here and there in the last 3 years since my LTR ended.

I was reading through [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/omzz0a/standards_too_high/) about standards, and I feel like I meet all of the mentioned ones except I'm curious what women my age feel about my job status.

About a year and a half ago I quit my office job to become a carpenter/handiman of some sort.  I've just always loved working with my hands and being stuck in an office was sucking my soul, and I happened to be in a unique financial situation so I quit.  I have lots of savings, no debt, and my expenses are very low, so I initially took some time to help my parents do some remodeling on their home.  Then I started remodeling friend's bathrooms and doing work for friends of friends, and building this and that for people...  And recently I've stumbled upon a niche that I think can give me a good steady income.  I made a website for it and I'm about to start advertising locally.  All work so far has just been word of mouth.

So I'm curious to get some honest reactions to that.  How does it sound?  Does it worry you?  Is it impressive?  Lol, I honestly have no idea.  I don't seem to have any shortage of work being offered, but I get that it's not a paycheck and there's no 401k matching, etc., although I still contribute to an IRA and I pay for health insurance.  I figure if it starts to not work out, I'm not worried about securing a job if I need to.

I'm not sure how to advertise that.  Is ""entrepreneur"" a scary word to women looking for a partner?  I figure some people use that as some sort of code for being between jobs, so I worry that's how it will sound.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ooutwe/entrepreneur_goodbad_curious_what_the_women_here/

85,oow9bt,1626893194,He bought her a car,"First, about me: I am recently divorced and have been dating but haven’t really been looking to be serious with anyone. Until I met him. Then Everything changed. I’ve been dating a man steadily for a month now. We spend every moment possible together. He is an absolute dream. Checks every box. I’ve never been treated with more respect and kindness. He’s very attentive. Very loving. We have a vacation planned and yes, it’s moving fast but at this point in life, you either know or you don’t. We have a great time together and up until yesterday I had high hopes this was the man I have been waiting for. 
We have had discussions around an ex-girlfriend. Someone he dated for 18 months. It came up that she still reaches out to him.  So last night, I asked the question. Here’s how the conversation went:
Me: are you sure things are over with this woman?
He :Yes
Me: When was the last time you had contact with her?
He: a couple weeks ago.
Me: I guess the real question is, why does she still have access to you? If it is over, what is the point? 
He: well she kind of has to. And it’s not simple. I need to talk to you about it. 

My stomach literally begins to churn. I have to excuse myself. Regroup. Be calm. Patient. Listen for the answers. Then make a decision. 

Me: I’m listening.
He:  I bought her car for her so she could afford the payments and insurance. Her credit is not good. She makes the payments to me. I told her I want nothing to do with her and if she skips the payments, I take the car. I was just trying to help her out of a bad situation at the time. 
Me: (trying to thoughtfully and slowly digest this information) For how long?
He: 4 years. 
Me: whoa. That’s not a small deal. 

So here we are, trying to forge a new relationship, and suddenly I realize there’s a third person who will always be a part of it. At least until the payments are finished. I understand he has a big heart, wants to help out and this happened before he met me.  He didn’t have to tell me. He was honest. I appreciate this. I am struggling with the fact that, naively, I had him on a pedestal.  He was honest but I am completely scared of getting hurt. I am afraid the open line of communication between the two could get complicated.  She sounds manipulative and I can only imagine how the damsel in distress will play out. 
He says he wants nothing to come between us. He promised he would be open and honest with me about communication with her.  The only alternative here is that he payoff the car and give her the title and cut off all communication. That would costs him $10k. I would not ask him to do that but he asked me if that’s what he should do.  I said it’s up to him. Even if he isn’t with me, this follows him for four years. 
For me, I feel I deserve to be in a relationship that does not have this type of lingering issue. 
I honestly don’t know what I am asking from you fellow Redditors, except am I wrong to feel this way? Should I forget about it and trust it will be the way he says it is? Or should I ask that he come up with some alternative to get out of the situation?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oow9bt/he_bought_her_a_car/
86,ooy6fa,1626898958,Being Anxious and Having Negative Thoughts,"Well, I (45/M) got into another disagreement with the gal (39/F) I'm dating over my anxious attachment style because a few things she said triggered a very extreme reaction from me the other day and I  chose to address them rather but telling her what I need from my partner rather than stuff them into my emotional backpack that's way too full due to parental abandonment issues and cheating partners from my past.

We discussed things the last time my anxiety ran rampant and thought things were fine. Until I was triggered during what I thought was a milestone celebration for us and was going to define the relationship.

I tend to jump to conclusions or speculate if I feel my partner isn’t wanting to spend time or talk to me for example :

* being left on read when texting
* not giving a time when we can talk if she's catching up with friends (but stays on the phone with me for hours when she's not busy)
* not making future plans
* telling me about other plans she can make instead of spending time with me

Every time I get into a romantic relationship, especially if we’re not exclusive or have labels, and I start to feel ignored (whether imagined or real), I freak out. Negative thoughts and emotions flood my brain.

She's well aware of my past and my tendencies. So, today, when I started looking for reassurance and validation and expressed that I need that to feel better about things between us because she isn't willing to have the DTR talk, I was told "" this is too exhausting and I’m not sure if I want to continue down a relationship path with you"".

I responded by telling her that I’m not a bad person, That I feel a lot of shame and guilt with my anxiety. I told her that I was scared to lose her. That I had a biological response to a real experience.  That this was my coping mechanism to help me survive for almost 45 years and that need some help from her to feel more secure about things.

She responded -  ""It shouldn’t be only about JBow’s fears and insecurities and making him feel reassured. It should also be about what I want and need in a relationship and how I want to be treated.""

Part of me wants to try to mend things, but part of me wants to let go.

After being divorced and working on myself these very issues for the last 10 years,  I’ve learned it’s not as easy as going to therapy and “fixing” myself. I find that when my needs for external validation/ approval/ reassurance aren't getting met, my brain goes into “fight or flight” mode to protect itself. My brain *believes* it’s going to be left or cheated on again and my body starts reacting.

I realized that if I keep going the way I am, I’ll eventually push someone who I really care about and that I would never find a partner I'd be happy and content with. This ugly truth hurts.

89,op2wyc,1626914197,Total weirdness with this guy.....,"TL;DR  This guy is super sketchy and I know it, but I have just been so curious about what is going on with him for real. I know I will never figure it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dated this guy in the past. If you met him, you would think he was Mr. Wonderful. A total gentleman (but not really when you look at the red flags), very chivalrous, my parents LOVED him and he treated them so kindly, would bend over backwards to do things for me, was always doting on me - making sure I had eaten enough, buying me things I needed, and on and on...He was also quite good looking and had a very strong masculine presence, which I just melt over. 

Now for the red flags. They would be difficult to list because many are nuanced in his behavior and things he has said. I will start with...

1. When I first met him, he seemed to want to attach himself to me like INSTANTLY. He could not wait. He texted me NONSTOP all day long. He would text me, asking me to spend my life with him (I've only know you like one week, buddy) and constantly telling me how beautiful he thinks I am - like in an over the top way. 

2. I felt like he was interrogating me in order to glean as much info about me as he could and I felt uncomfortable and like he was staring a hole into my head. 

3. I felt fearful around him at times, like maybe he was thinking about harming me in some way. 

4. He would say to me ""I could eat you alive"" like all the time and I kept thinking ""maybe he just doesn't know how that saying actually goes??"". At the same time, I felt super uncomfortable - like fearful....and I don't usually feel like this around men. 

5. He would lie about something and then later give me some weird excuse that I knew was an excuse and try to explain away that he actually lied. 

6. He was always trying to get me to tell him I loved him and to commit to him verbally. It was a trap kind of thing. 

Anyhow, you get the picture. Even after knowing all of this, I would still spend time with him from time to time. In part, he really was great company and I would just explain away all the really weird stuff. Please do not judge me. In addition to this, I was intrigued by the whole thing. Like I wanted to figure him out. 

So, after not having seen him in quite some time, I stopped by his place to visit the other day. He asked me if I would like a glass of wine. I remember thinking upon entering - ""I hope he isn't planning to do something to me"". I thought wine sounded like a nice idea, so I said ""sure"", but I was watching him like a hawk. He goes into the kitchen and reaches for an already opened bottle. There is only enough wine left in the bottle for one glass. He pours me the glass. You know what I was thinking, I am sure. I wasn't going to drink that wine. It amazes me because I know that HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING!!!! Suddenly, he gets this weird little smirk on his face and says ""actually, Let me give you a glass of THIS wine."" It was an unopened bottle and he pours me a glass. 

I KNOW I need to stay away from him, so please do not lecture me on this. I know that the curiosity thing lands people 6 feet under. I know it. It's like he KNOWS that I know what he is thinking.

94,op9q70,1626942586,Men dating younger versus women dating younger,"Throughout history it has been mostly men who sought out younger partners. Old Hollywood celebs who are dating women less than half their age prove the point and are usually met with a reaction of barely hidden envy (by men) or moral outrage (by women).

Yet could it be that the dynamic is changing?  Inspired by an earlier post, the question whether it is ok for women to date younger comes back so OFTEN in this sub, and is always answered with overwhelming positive reponse from women:
- Dozens of women commenting they indeed date younger, often MUCH younger: 10 to 20 years and they love it.
- Many women confirming they are being hit on by young guys in their 20s
- Most women who date young say they see this mainly as casual, romance, sex but rarely for LTR

Online has made it a lot easier for 20 year olds to get in touch with 40 year olds and vice versa. In real life I dont meet college age people through friends, hobbies or even work, but on a dating app people of any age can just slide the age bracket up or down.

So has OLD become the great equalizer here? Men will still look for younger women, but unlike IRL, online they cannot reach or match with them unless younger women actively set their filter to (much) older men. And very few women do. Outside of Hollywood I personally dont know any guy in my friend or work circle who dates younger, at least not 10-20 years, perhaps 7-8 years max   but even in those cases they all met previously IRL, not online. Online most of my matches were always within 3 years up or down (even when I had filters set to much lower LOL). I believe on OLD it is much more rare for men to succesfully connect with younger women.

But for women it seems it has become both easier and more accepted to date younger. May be most women on OLD look for a relationship, bur for those who seek casual or sex there is no shortage of potential candidates of ANY age. Then why on earth would they NOT go for a 20-year younger, fit guy? I met quite a few women on OLD who were totally transparent to me that they were having casual sex or FWB with a much younger guy. Men would do the same if they could, but there is a lot more ""competiton"" on OLD for that. Of course if you want a relationship as a woman then OLD in general is more difficult.

Interested in getting the views of this sub on this topic:
- Do you feel there is still a negative stigma attached to women dating younger, or is it becoming more acceptable?
- Older men dating very young women - is this even still happening on OLD? How do people react?
- Is OLD revesing the trend and will we see more women but fewer men date young?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/op9q70/men_dating_younger_versus_women_dating_younger/

The horn dog (sorry guys, but he's not even hiding it) who just wants to get I to my pants is more fun to chat with than this. I'm actually tempted, because he sounds like a good time. But I am sort of looking for a mental connection too.

I'm not a people person/great communicator myself, so all this effort leaves me exhausted. And I wonder if the ice is just a bit thicker, and I need to chisel away at it a bit more, or if they're just not compatible to my style of communication and I should save my energy for different prospects.
