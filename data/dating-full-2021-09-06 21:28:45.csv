First of all before you even try make sure you study up and work on your social cues. Next understand that you need to be respectful and nice to people no matter the situation. Also remember to follow some regular guidelines. Don't follow people, don't approach someone from behind, don't interrupt someone doing a workout or reading a book.  


Now for the unpopular opinion. No matter what you do you might get seen as a creep, or a weirdo. That doesn't mean you are one and the other person has no right to call you that or treat you as such if you where completely respectful with how you went about the approach but you can't control someone's reaction. 90% of the time a person's reaction to you is based upon something that has nothing to do with you. Think about the last time someone randomly talked to you that you didn't know. If I am having a good day then I am very receptive, if its a bad day I close down the discussion right away. 

The basic principle behind this is to have some self-respect. As long as you approached in a nice way and where kind then if the other person calls you a creep or see's you as weird then that THEIR problem, not yours. We are social animals, if you get offended by someone walking up to you in a nice way and just showing minimal attraction then its you who has the problem.

I get approached by gay people (I am bisexual) quite frequently and have never seen it as weird unless they where creepy about it.

So, let me start of from the beginning, we both are from the same school, she's is a year senior, and we have known each other for about a year now. 


The first time we meet was during a debate competition, both of us were representing our school, we didn't win, but spending time with her during the competition, made me fall for her, I mean I loved the way she carried herself, how gracefully she talked, and god she looked gorgeous. We talked about our likes-dislikes (Messi-Ronaldo), learned that we are exact opposites, and other stuff. So, that day came to an end, and we went our separate ways.


After maybe 2-3 days, on my way back home from school, I heard her calling me from behind, she was also walking home with one of her friend, she came up to me and said ""your so full of attitude hahh, you didn't even bother talking to me after the competition."" And, after that day this started happening frequently, I used walk home, and she would find me every other day on our way, and we would walk till her home. She even started calling me Mr. Attitude. After a while I started expecting her, and about a month later she started waiting for me outside our school. We used to walk and talk just about anything. 


At the same time another competition was announced by the school's cultural committee, which was going be held in a different city, where the students would get to stay for 3 days, I thought this would be a perfect opportunity for us to spend some more time, so I told her about it, and she agreed, and then both of us took part in the school round and won, and were selected once again to represent our school. So, we went on this trip, and spent a lot of time in each others company, we used to listen to a lot of music, she used share my earphones, one bud with me, other with her. And during one of the days, when we were having lunch, she asked ""we are exact opposites, right"" I nodded, she continued ""and I've heard opposites attract"", dumb me just smiled, and didn't know how to react.


So, that trip ended, and now we even started walking to school together, so we used to meet before the school starts and after it ends. Between our walks I used to ask her stupid questions, just so that I can know whether she likes me or now, like once I liked ""I get invited to a lot of parties but most of them are for couples, would you join with me next time I get invited?"", she said yes. 
This other time she was asked to host a function at our school, and she requested the coordinators to choose me as her partner. And used to complement me alot, she talked about incidents that happened with me, with her friends. During one conversation she mentioned how soft my hands were, and asked if she can feel my hands, and then we interlocked our fingers.


On our way back home, she used hold my jacket, fold it and would keep it with her, till her house. 


And during our school's annual fest, where I was the host, she bottomed my blazer, fixed my sleeves (even though I didn't ask). She even started linking arms with me as we walked. All my friends thought she was my girlfriend, but god I hope that would've been true.


All of this has been happening for the past 1 year, and now she's about to leave for college, in 2 weeks. I've never confessed my feelings to her, because I fear I'll lose a beautiful friendship.

I (41M) recently had a second date with a woman (34F) I met on Bumble. She said yes that night to a third date. Still, I'm concerned about a sudden absence of communication. Below is a summary of our connection:

FIRST 3 WEEKS: I was out of town and could only call/text. First call was a ""holy s---"" connection. Lots of calling/texting from then on...both of us saying pretty heavy things and ""feeling the feels."" But...the woman smartly suggested we make sure the chemistry was there in person.

FIRST DATE: We kissed the moment we saw each other and never really stopped. She invited me to her place after. Passionate make outs, romantic moments, playfulness, cuddling...

POST-FIRST DATE: Woman suggested we talk more on second date, which made sense. Take it one date at a time and make sure non-physical connection was also there. Daily texts continue but less frequent and no longer romantic or suggestive. I matched her level.

SECOND DATE: I picked her up this past Friday, and she kissed me right away. Strangers at the restaurant commented on how ""ridiculously cute"" we were. Went back to her place again. Not as hot/heavy as first date, but that was kind of the point. It seemed clear to me we got closer, and I felt more confident. She said yes to a third date.

AFTER SECOND DATE: If not for one text I sent - a super brief exchange - I likely wouldn't have heard from her at all. It's been almost 3 days since the second date. She did warn that despite our connection, she likes her independence, her routines, and doesn't like always being available. Case in point...no one (her mom freaked out) heard from her until the day after our first date.

THOUGHTS: Either (a) she has real feelings and is being guarded/level-headed, (b) she feels confident in our connection and is reverting to her normal communication style and life, or (c) something's up and she's not telling me. 

She hasn't cancelled our date, which I plan to call her about tonight. If she wasn't feeling it, she's had 3 days to tell me. Communication and openness have not been a problem for us.

I (M34) work as a teaching in a K-8 school. I work in a high-needs special education program and am interested in a girl (27) who also works as a teacher in my program. 

For context, I’m going through an amicable divorce right now…my ex moved to Spain and, long story short, she’s been jerking me around for a couple years now. We briefly separated two years ago, right at the time my co-worker started working at my school. 

During that period of time, I started to get to know my coworker (light flirting here and there) but it never went anywhere because my ex and I got back together. At this point my coworker didn’t work in my program. I felt it would have been easier to ask her out, given that we don’t really have to work closely together. I did come close to asking her out before my wife and I decided to give it another shot.

Over this past summer, my wife and I officially decided to end things. My coworker now works in my program, which means we have to work pretty closely together these days. Our conversations have been purely work related since last year, and I’m bummed out because now I really want to ask her out.

Their cousin and his girlfriend(amanda) have 2 kids together and one on the way. 

I don’t like the Amanda because if she wasn’t with him she would try and get with my boyfriend. 

Amanda has disrespected their mom and whole family, I cannot understand how any of them can tolerate her. 

My boyfriend wants me to be friends with Nora even though she plans to move in with Amanda.

The first time I met Amanda her house smelled like garbage and she didn’t shower in probably 2 weeks. 

Amanda asked my why I don’t have a bunch of materialistic things. Mind you I live in a luxury apartment with 65inch tv and a 2017 car. 

But she didn’t care to be rude, after that I unfriended her on everything after finding out what she messaged my boyfriend from last year. 

Then I was told by someone else she talked all this smack about me being disrespectful and being a drunk.

I’ve gotten advice online to stay away from both of them. Now I have been arguing with my boyfriend to be friends with Nora although I wouldn’t want to since she’s friends with Amanda. 

It’s not that I don’t trust her it’s that no matter what her being friends with 2 people that don’t like each other is a problem in itself.

We live close by one another, which I've never experienced before in a relationship.

We are both fortunate to have our own places but I stay over at hers far more often than she stays at mine because she has a dog to care for.

We did decide to give each other some space at the very beginning of our relationship but I found that I'd stay quite late at her place which meant walking back to mine late at night which I would rather not do. She told me that if I stayed late then I could just assume that I would stay over at her place.

Over the last couple weeks, I've wound up staying at her place for several days at a time. **She hasn't raised any issues with this** but I'm conscious that I also have my own place and **I don't want to feel like I am overstaying my welcome**.

We've talked about moving in together so I see these extended stays as like some sort of a trial run for living together.

This is new territory for me because I'm not used to dating someone who lives so close to me so I don't know how these things are usually handled.

My questions:

1. Do I continue to stay over at hers for extended periods? We both enjoy being with each other and, since it's mostly at her place and we're mature adults, if she feels uncomfortable with the situation then it's open to her to raise it.
2. Should I  raise it with her and see if we should define some boundaries? If so, does anyone have suggestions on boundaries?

Throwaway account, sorry if this post is stupid

I have never dated before, living that crappy homeschool life where you don't actually meet people your age and such. I'll be turning 17 years old very soon (Male), and I have 0 relationship, or really even social experience at all. I really only just started making some friends, but they are all older than me, and I'm still kind of the odd one out, being the non adult.

I have no way to meet people it seems. Soon hopefully once I'm getting paid from my work (training to become a martial arts instructor) I'll be able to afford a phone, maybe that could change some stuff? I've no idea at all. I don't think I'm that attractive, I'm not too smart, and everything I say is forced, because I basically never talked until little under a couple years ago. I am not with the latest trends, I don't use any social medias, and I don't play games much. Oh, and I also can't seem to meet girls IRL, since I don't go to school.

I have a few hobbies, and I don't think I'm a terrible person. My main issue is finding people. Are dating apps something that could work for me? I just don't know what to do! I have come to Reddit because literally nobody in my life will help me. My parents say ""You have plenty of time"" well yeah, go figure. But guess what? I am lonely, I want a girlfriend. Someone I can enjoy being around, somebody to talk to, someone that I can spend time with. I WANT that. And I want it now, is that too much to ask for?

I don't even care about sex or making out or any of that, that's just a side bonus I suppose. I just want somebody who can make me feel better and someone who I can be with and enjoy life more with. I'm not looking for a hookup... I'm looking for a relationship that could go somewhere.

Anyways, this post is probably not going to go anywhere. I'll get 3 different responses: Join a club/activity, go to school, get a job. All of which are unavailable to me. But I am honestly desperate. I have a fairly good life. But, I have a bunch of stuff I don't care about in my life. I'm nothing like my family at all. I may even be adopted lol.

Anyways, thanks for your time, anyone who responds. I just wanna feel better and such. I don't want to wait to become an adult to even have a slight chance, so I'm doing anything I can. Dating sites are kinda scary, but if they work, I might try if it is possible. Are there any good date sites? Or even just sites to make friends? So sorry if this is a dumb or illegal post...

So anyways, been talking to this guy I met online for the past month and we’ve been talking every day and even talking on the phone once a week. He got drunk at his brothers engagement party this weekend and was texting me really sweet things like he really likes talking to me and we get along so well and he really hopes we work out and stuff like that. Now normally, he doesn’t say that kind of stuff to me. His personality is way more sarcastic so he says it but in a different way that’s kind of hard to tell sometimes. So, me being the extremely anxious person that I am, I started to wonder if he really meant those things. I was debating on asking him if he did for the past 2 days and after talking with some friends who said drunk people usually say things they would normally be too embarrassed to say/the day the truth, I was feeling confident that he meant it and I asked. He responded with “I totally forgot what I said” (he told me he remembered everything by the way) and when I responded with “Dude, really?” he dropped a bomb on me I wasn’t expecting. 

He told me he doesn’t have time to date right now. He is a paramedic with short staff cause of the pandemic and with covid being bad again, work is going to get worse. He is also about to start his masters degree in psychology which he says each course will require 8-10 hours a week of his time. Literally two days ago, we were fine and normal. I was even gonna ask him to hang out finally after originally saying I wasn’t comfortable because of covid and he understood. So yes, we’ve never met in person and he does this. Anytime someone says they don’t have time to date, it’s such bullshit. If you really liked someone, you would make time no matter what.

About 4 years ago my mental health was at rock bottom. At this time I dated a girl very briefly who dropped me pretty quickly because I was a wreck.

Fast forward 4 years, we have had no contact and end up at the same school. I'm recently out of a fairly long relationship and feeling much better mentally.

First week she flirts a lot, almost making me uncomfortable, and I stay very cordial since my main focus is to not make this awkward for anyone. She's very physical with me and we obviously have sexual tension. Brief text convos but she's not giving me much over text.

At the first party she's pretty forward and fairly quickly suggest we go somewhere else. Once alone, I  ask her for a kiss, which she hesitates to, which surprised me. We talk about a lot of things, our history etc. and she's very scared that things would become awkward, but we kiss in the end. She made sure to call us ""friends"", emphasizing how much she appreciated my friendship in the beginning of the school year and how she didn't want to jeopardize that.

After this, she still flirts, and is still fairly close physically but not as much as the first week. I'm almost certain that she's talking to at least one other guy, who I think is her main priority.

I'm not really sure, but I think I would like to try to date her more seriously, but I don't know what to do in this situation. I'm not sure she would want to date me. In real life, she's pretty forward with me, but practically completely cold over text. I reckon if she would like anything to do with me, she wouldn't be cold over text.

I am supposed to meet the friends on Saturday. We've been seeing each other for aboit a month, 2 x avg per week meet ups. 

I am generally easygoing, can make friends fairly easily, haven't ever really been concerned about ""meeting the friends""

However, last night I started Sobbing (alone) because I realized a memory from EXACTLY 10 YEARS AGO was making me anxious. 

Memory: 

I had just started seeing a guy, he introduced me to his mom, and he took me to meet his friends. I thought it was going somewhere... I later found out he was just showing me off to another girl he wanted to date, and ghosted me, and married the girl he was trying to make jealous. 

It was very hurtful. 

Now, this current guy hasn't DONE anything to make me feel like this is what he is going to do, but neither did the last guy... 

Should I share this fear with new dude, or no? 

On one hand I feel like being vulnerable and sharing my feelings is good, and healthy, but on the other hand, I don't want him to think I'm accusing him of doing this, which I am not, I just haven't met friends this early since that last time 10 years ago. Maybe I could tell him that happened to me but not tell him it was 10 years ago?

Basically I (21F) met a guy (21F) on a dating app and immediately hit it off. When we met, we spent 7 hours together just walking around town, talking, and getting dinner. I felt like I could really open up to him and he was opening up to me too. Things were great afterwards; he’s on a vacation now so we’ve been texting back and forth when he’s free. 

However, yesterday I found out that one of my friends went to high school with him and she is actually really close friends with him. For some reason, immediately after I found this out I lost the desire to pursue a romantic relationship with him.

This feels like such a stupid thing to abandon this potential relationship over but somehow I can’t shake the feeling. I don’t know if it’s having a mutual friend or something else….It might also be that he doesn’t feel “special” to me anymore because somebody I know is already close to him.

About two weeks after we started talking, he traveled for his brother’s bachelor party. Of course I mentioned that I didn’t mind and even told him that it was fine if there were strippers there. For the first few days, he was very attentive, but there was one day where he ignored me for the most part- and that night, I received a recording through text overhearing a conversation about how attractive neighbors they had at the apartment who were girls were and how their asses were out by the pool. I felt disrespected because I should’ve never had to overhear or receive this message. Although he claims it was his brother and his friend on the message, there’s no way to prove it wasn’t him and he did feel pretty damn guilty. Long story short, for the two months after, he continuously tried to make things up to me, although I was always offering to go halves with him on any dates that we went on. But he listened to me and reassured me because I have terrible relationship anxiety. Then, he introduced me to his parents - something he had never done with any girl before - and invited me out to dinner with the family. We were starting to do well and I was starting to feel more comfortable around him. Last week, his brother had his wedding, which he invited me to and during the event, he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend. But I asked for his cell phone, which he was willing to give me along with his password, until he may have realized he had something on it, took it from me, and started to delete several things, which defeated the entire point of why I wanted to see his phone in the first place (due to a violation of trust during the bachelor trip) and began a four hour disagreement where I kept asking him what was on the phone that he had to delete and what he was hiding from me, as well as why. He told me there was only one girl on a social media network that wouldn’t leave him alone - and when I asked him if that conversation still existed so I could see it, he told me he’d already deleted it. He also told me that he hadn’t been on a dating app for God knows how long when I asked him. Without seeing his phone before he deleted anything, of course there’s no way I could tell whether this or anything he said was true. He initially wanted me to stay an hour into the discussion, but after missing speeches, fireworks, and even the cake at his brother’s wedding and having his parents, aunts, and even the brother getting married come out to ask him to come back into the event, he eventually got exasperated, asked to walk me to my car, and after three hours talking with me, asked me to please leave. Plus, when I kept asking him if I could go back in with him after he started crying, he got so frustrated he threw his hands in the air and said “it’s over” when I asked what I could expect. Because I was so mad, I deleted him from FB and IG. He’s still following me on IG but has me restricted and deleted me from his dating app. Plus, he’s started messaging and liking other girls pictures. Has he moved on? Why is he still following me on IG? Why would he restrict me? And what should I do next: should I message him to try and apologize for stealing him from the wedding for almost four hours? Or leave it alone and wait for him to message me? What do you believe the odds of him messaging me will be? He has told me he loves me and I’m the only girl he’s ever brought home to meet the family. The family loved me before. If we even get back together, will this situation change our entire dynamic? He was willing to do anything for me before.

EDIT: I should have made it clear that during that time, we both made a commitment to only be dating each other exclusively, even if we didn’t have the title. I was the first girl he ever brought home to his parents - and the first girl he introduced to his friends that he was seriously dating too. Plus, he endlessly told me how much he loved me.

TL;DR After trust issues in the past, I took the guy I was dating away from his family for nearly four hours during his brother’s wedding - he wasn’t present for the most important parts, all because he wouldn’t prove himself trustworthy.

&gt;1. Anyone more than 10 years older than you, or (if they’re near your age) someone in a relationship 5+ years old.

Have you ever heard a “romantic story” from anything pre 2000? It’s terrifying. Like, “I saw her across the bar but could reach her before she left, so I looked her up in the phone book went to her house and asked her on a date, and the rest is history.” Awful. 

And even dating before 2016 was drastically different. Now 40% of couples meet alone, that’s a massive amount. Even if you aren’t meeting online, you’re dealing with things like social media, texting etiquette and a bunch of things that didn’t really exist in the level they do now even 5 years ago.

&gt;2. Anyone who is physically attractive 

Look, I’ve made this mistake too. My best friend is a 6’2, handsome D1 athlete. He literally told me that telling a girl in a bar cute pick up lines works. I tried this, I got laughed at and a water in my face. He was dumbfounded as that shit literally always works for him.

Attractive people don’t have game. They don’t need it(lucky them) so there’s really no point in asking them. Especially with online dating when your bio barely matters and your appearance does. Just take advice from people uglier or as attractive as you.

&gt;3. If you’re a guy, any woman

Now here is where I lose people. 

Women are great for meeting women. But dating advice isn’t necessarily great. I have the feeling that when women give advice to a guy, they’re giving advice under the pretense that the women already likes the guy. They don’t give advice on how to get the woman to like us.

Men are very simple(shallow) creatures. If someone asks us what we want in a woman,  we say a pretty face and hope the rest fall in line. Women however are not as complex so it’s not as easy as getting a girl to tell you how to get another girl to like us.

I’ve worked a ton on myself, have done therapy for years, own a successful business, and take great care of myself and how I present myself. I have lots of hobbies, amazing friends, and goals. Still, I feel like something huge is missing. 

I’ve had plenty of 3ish month short term relationships that I never felt excited about, or that were straight up abusive. I now live in a big, liberal city (Denver) and have been to countless queer meetups, all the dating apps, bars, coffee shops/spaces, art shows, and queer events. Finding someone my “type” feels impossible. I’m feminine and into androgynous women or non binary people. Most people here feel very wholesome, clean cut, into hiking, fishing, &amp; Patagonia types. 

I only find myself truly into people who are edgier, artsy, tattooed, or punk vibes. Anyone I’ve met here like that is either taken/poly, a chaotic mess, or a f*ckboy. I feel like I’ll have to move somewhere like New York to find someone, but my whole life is here.
