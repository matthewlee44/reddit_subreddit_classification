We met on tinder and talked most days. He was fun to talk to but he was from another state so I wasn’t taking it seriously. We became friends on Snapchat and began snapping most days. After a month I was going to let the conversation fizzle off since I figured we’d never actually meet, but he was pretty persistent in talking to me everyday. The conversations were getting more in depth and we started sending long voice messages to one another. In September we both returned to campus at the same university and decided to meet, I thought he’d want to hook up or something but we ended up talking for 6-7 hours, the entire time he was as far away on the couch as could be. He wasn’t what I’d thought he’d be in person so I was a little hesitant warming up to him, but the more time I spent with him the more I liked him. In October he kissed me, and things just…changed. I normally don’t enjoy being within close proximity of anyone but I couldn’t get enough of him, I know it’s likely the honey moon phase but I’ve never had this kind of chemistry with anyone. In December we were talking and I briefly mentioned dating, he said that it wasn’t something he felt prepared for, it wasn’t that he had an issue with commitment (neither one of us are sleeping with anyone else) or anything but that a relationship came with pressure and expectations he didn’t feel prepared to deal with alongside school. I respected his answer and said I could understand that. We continued talking and hanging out like normal, he did give me his sweatshirt and we had a small argument over whether it was something appropriate for me to hold onto, I think he wanted me to hang on to it so I’d have a piece of him around even when he wasn’t, I know it hurt him a bit when I returned it but I wasn’t comfortable having something around that made the boundaries of what we are really blurry. Recently I asked him to clearly define what he saw me as, I needed to know if I was just a friend, friend with benefits, a potential partner, just some kind of direction. He said he saw me as a friend he enjoyed having casual sex with. I was a little hurt by this since he means more to me than that and I explained how I had feelings for him. He said he’d understand if I wanted to cool things off and I said it was fine if we continued like how we were, since we both graduate in 2023 I figured I’d rather enjoy another year with him as is than nothing at all. I told him tho that I’d be going on dates and talking to other guys if he wasn’t interested in me that way, he said that he didn’t want to prevent me from meeting anyone else. So we’ve been continuing as normal, but what has me totally pissed off is he still says romantic things. We were talking about marriage and modern vs traditional views, when he says that whoever marries me will be lucky, whether it’s him or someone else. It trips me up how casually he mentioned himself, and he does this every time we talk about the future, he’ll mention himself first and then backtrack. It has me frustrated, because for someone that sees me only as a friend he doesn’t act like it, he seems so confident that in the future we’ll be together. It has me conflicted because I don’t want to wait on someone that might never be interested in me, at the same time I feel like I’m looking at my future when I see him. When I look at him I can understand how older couples say they looked at their spouse and knew they’d marry them. I’ve talked to hundreds of men, I’ve never felt something like with him, and while I don’t want to waste my time, I know he’d be the one that got away if I didn’t.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162652,public,self,Friend Zoned (kind of),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t4pwps/friend_zoned_kind_of/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

We are developing a sexual intimacy game centered around couples at any stage of a relationship that is hosted as a mobile application &amp; on website. The intent is to determine what your personal preferences are and if both parties coincide, appear into the various game types; while removing those actions that are off the table. We hope it will create good conversations between the couple and result in some great foreplay. Intimacy is always fluctuating and should never be stagnant.

* What are some things you would be interested to see in a mobile application for mixing things up in the bedroom?
* At what point during dating do you discuss your sexual preferences? Do you know what you like prior to getting into a relationship?
* Are you happy with your sex life? Why or why not?
* What games have you played during foreplay to get you or your partner turned on?
* What was the most positive discussion you've had with a partner? What was the worst?
* With over 150+ sexual games to play with your partner, 300+ sex positions, LGBTQ+ compatible. What service can Dsire provide you to increase your bedroom/foreplay needs?

Then the next day (saturday) we went for dinner. Now, usually i overthink things and i wait for the guy to make all the moves but i felt natural with him so i asked him if he wanted to go somewhere after we finished eating to get another drink. then we left and went to one of the cities sights with the view of the city and talked even more then we ended up walking for like 2 hours and talking. 

then we went and got something to eat again (like 5 am at this point, i’m in spain so it’s normal), he let me take a bite from his cheeseburger. and he was supposed to leave at 6 but then we ended up talking a whole other hour and he just kept asking me questions. it all flowed with him so naturally and atleast in my end we got along great, i felt like i could be my weird self and he matched it. then when we left we hugged and said it was a pleasure to meet you. all in all it was a 10 hour date, of just walking around and talking.

i know it’s like “DUH he likes you” but i’m not sure because before we met up he was like “i’m here mainly to make friends or whatever” and that he wanted to talk with a foreigner. so i’m not sure if this was just an education for him and we’re just friends now or if he liked me, because if it were me i’m not hanging out with a friend for 10 hours when i could be sleeping.

i texted him and said i had a great time and that i would like to see him again. he said “that’s so sweet, i’d be delighted to see you again. id be up for anything” then i suggested a couple mueseums and he said “i’d love to, either one is fine” then i picked one and he said “let’s gooo, well we’ll talk to figure out a day. i hope you have a good day at school tomorrow 😊”

Ever since then he’s been texting me consistently. He texts me in the morning and at night. He had a costume event today and sent me all the pictures he and his friends took. He texts me random stuff like “i just got new jewelry” or “i got a 10 on my presentation today!” and i said was joking about something and he said “hahahah i can’t, that made me laugh, seriously i really dig you”

Here's what I originally typed out but then realised that the tl;dr above is a better question:

I am a straight 28M.

It just all seems so unpenetrable to me.

Online dating is very demoralising, perhaps it gives you a sense that you're worse than you are (not that I'm not always trying to get better!). So I figured meeting people the old fashioned way is going to be more successful but... how? Where do you go and what do you do or say? Even e.g. a bar seems too contrived. Meeting women naturally doesn't happen for me either - I don't have any friends that are women and dating within the workplace is an absolute no-no.

So what's the catalyst to start even attempting dates?

I really need an objective view from a male.

A 30M that I have been 'talking to' (we haven't confirmed we are exclusive but he has told me that he is not talking to anyone) for 8 months now. We are continuously messaging, we talk on the phone for a good 90 mins every other day and we see each other nearly every week but our work schedules make it difficult. He initiates most of the dates.

The other week, he was out and got drunk. He randomly called me (I missed it, I was asleep) and then messaged me 'I love you' at midnight. He then messaged me 'I love you' again at 4am. 

I spoke to him about this the next day and just spoke about how cute it was that he was thinking about me. I didn't want to go into too much as I know he isn't the emotional type and I didn't want to push it. I asked him if he would joke about something like this and he said no.

*I am fully aware* that being drunk can make you do things you wouldn't normally do and sometimes, for no reason at all. But honestly, from a mans perspective, was this just a random thing you would do OR is there some truth to it? Could it be that he has some deep feelings for me but not to the extent of love?

He's amazing. He's smart, handsome, funny, and kind. I like him a lot, and I'm pretty sure he likes me. He's even flirted with me a couple of times in the past. I don't know a lot about his only relationship from the past, except that they dated for five years, and broke up because she came out of the closet as a lesbian.

I've never had a boyfriend. Two years ago, I would've been very insecure that he has five years on me in terms of experience, but it's probably a good thing that he's more experienced. I've accepted that at my age, most people will already have been in a relationship of some sort, and there's nothing wrong with that.

I'm just insecure to tell him about my previous experience. There was an encounter in which I met this guy on a trip. We hung out for a couple of days. One night, another guy tried hitting on me (just for sex), and he got upset at this guy, and to make him back off, he told all of our mutual friends that he liked me. Of course, everyone told me what he said.

I stupidly went up him and asked him if he liked me. I just thought he was really awesome, and while I wouldn't say he flirted (because the guy didn't have much game), there were definitely hints that he liked me. So I asked him if he liked me, and he told me that he actually had a girlfriend the entire time. He never bought her up once. Afterwards, he got really mad at our friends for telling me what he said.

At that point, I should've just let it go, but I liked him, and I figured that we could be social media friends at least. No, I wasn't trying to seduce him; but we live thousands of miles away. I didn't think there'd be any harm in being social media friends. Also, since he denied saying what he said, I thought that if what our friends told me was completely made up, then, he wouldn't have any issues following me. He left it pending for a couple of weeks, and then rejected it. So I blocked him.

I have to admit, for the rest of that year, I just felt a lot anger and resentment towards him. I'd picture the two of them going to dinner, spending time at the mall together while he carried all of her bags, texting each other for every little thing that happened that day. And I wanted to be in her place.

That's why I think he'll think less of me. Because I was that girl. It doesn't matter that I was deceived. Doesn't matter that my feelings were there by the time I knew he was taken. I was that girl.

Being on and off for 3 years, my gf does not give me a solid path forward regarding us moving in together anytime soon. She says she wants to save up money and live on her own first AND THEN we can move in together at some point. Realistically, it could be 1.5-2 years before me and her move in together. I dont want to give up my apartment in the South in case things fall through. Things have been going well recently however, the more time that passes and the monthly rents go by, the more I begin to resent her by not giving me a solid plan for us.

Long story short, we matched on tinder and talked for a little on there. We found out that he was acquainted with a close friend of mine and moved our conversation to snapchat. We talked for about a week on snapchat before him and our mutual friend were at an apartment kickback together and invited me there.

I went to the apartment kickback to meet him in person for the first time and we hit it off. We talked on a balcony alone for about 30 minutes until we moved to the couch and his arm was around me. We hung out for around a total of 3 and a half hours which was filled with nonstop talking and flirting. We found out that we have a lot in common and he seemed awesome. Before we parted ways he said, ""I will definitely see you again."" Ever since, I looked forward to seeing him again and I loved talking to him + he said he felt the same.

Fast forward to last weekend and he invited me to another party. I was super excited to see him again and put time aside to go although I was about to have the busiest day ever the day after. I went with our mutual friend and right when we walked in he said hi to us. After that, he disappeared and was pretty much running around the entire party. We didn't have a single conversation that night, except for his friend trying to be my ""wing man"" which really didn't work out. Something that I thought was weird was that whenever I would go to a different area, he would then magically appear, but still ignored me. I ended up getting a little bothered and had a friend pick me up. It's weird that he invited me to a party to barely acknowledge me.

The next day I didn't talk to him at all until it was later in the day; I had a very busy day. He asked me if I had fun the night before, and I did not know if I should've told him the truth so all I said was, ""Yeah I had fun."" I debated being straight up with him, but I wasn't sure if I would seem ""dramatic"" if I told him no. 

I feel kinda weird talking to him now, especially because I don't want to waste my time entertaining him if he's not interested in me. I don't know how I should approach talking to him anymore.

This story is going to be a crazy one for a lot of you here. I met this girl online and we got along pretty well, i found her attractive and found out she lived in south east asia. I live in America which is a good 4000 miles away. At the time she had a boyfriend and talked about wanting to be poly and how she explained this to her bf, who is also online and in america, and her bf basically responded with that she will be a housewife and have his kids in short. Obviously she ended up cheating on him with me. I told her to just break up with him and she did. Things obviously didnt go well between us, we broke up, she found someone else and i talked to her occasionally. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to in some way find someone irl that wasnt 4000 miles away. This just resulted in me knowing the list of problems i have to fix, losing motivation when none of those problems got fixed at all, and then becoming more depressed. The girl and i ended up talking more, and she invited me to some poly relationship thats all online because, again, the dude shes with is in america aka thousands of miles away. This dude seems to be mentally worse off than i am since hes constantly having mental breakdowns. The whole relationship feels like a power struggle. I dont enjoy it. She gives me a lot of emotional affection so its not as one sided as it sounds but at the same time, the distance, the dynamics, everything is just not how id imagine a relationship in my mid-20s to be like. Ive talked a couple times about flying her here since weve been talking so much for like three years but she wants to meet her main bf first who is broke so thats not happening for a while i guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im debating if i want to break this off. I know that this feels more like getting something i dont deserve. I havent worked hard enough to prove i deserve a woman. But my loneliness, despite the bs, makes me want to keep her around. I also know its been 8 years since ive been with a woman in real life. The things that prevented me from keeping a stable, strong relationship back then still plague me to varying degrees today. As far as i see it, none of them are resolved. If i distance myself from this girl i will be alone again. Some days she makes my days better and is also relatable. I wouldnt have spoken to her for so long if we didnt get along well. Im not sure what exactly to do because what im doing now seems like a waste of time but its a good cope for a bunch of stuff i cant fix.

I feel like this situation is really complicated but I’ll try keep this as short and to the point as I can. Basically I’m really into a girl in my work, the most I’ve been into anyone in a long time. She’s smart, she’s fun, we have a great laugh together, and it was that kind of way that she felt so out of my league that at first I didn’t even consider her as a possible romantic prospect, so I just acted completely normal with her. We’d always tease each other relentlessly, but occasionally got into deeper talks and over time we’ve become at the very least pretty good friends. I really just love being around her.

In the past couple of months the flirty vibe was growing and I started getting a crush on her. She’s single, I’m single, we were flirting a lot and started messaging outside of work, and that messaging quickly turned to her kind of half-jokingly suggesting we should grab a drink together outside of work sometime. I’m 23 and I’ve never dated anyone in any capacity or had any romantic life, so I kind of shied away at first and for a variety of reasons we weren’t in work together for about a month, the messages dried up, and I thought I’d blew it.

We’ve both been working together again though and after a couple of shifts back together it was the same as it’s always been, arguably more intense. The teasing’s gave way to constant hugs, excuses to be holding each other’s hand, sexual jokes, and I told myself that if I ever got the chance again with her I’d take it. After one shift about a week ago where we were glued together and had a great time she messaged me afterwards and, again, quickly it turned to her joking about us grabbing a drink again. I decided to ask her for real if she wants to when we both have days off, and she seemed genuinely interested; she told me that she couldn’t do a certain day so it would have to be sometime this weekend instead but that we’d make it work, and that once the rota was finalised she’d get back to me with what day she could do.

So I felt amazing. I was organising a date with a girl I’m really into and who it genuinely seemed like might be into me. Then this weekend it’s all kind of changed and I realised, since I’ve only worked there for a few months, I didn’t have all the context I should have. Long story short, her and a dude I work with who she’s really good friends with kind of almost had a relationship going. From what I can gather they were sleeping together here and there but it kind of fizzled out when he recently started seeing another girl we work with. This was all news to me and a lot of others, but it came to a head at a couple of staff nights out we had over the weekend where that dude and that other girl were all over each other and telling everyone they were now dating, which the girl I’m into was upset about because she’s clearly still hung up over him. He spent a good bit of the nights out we had trying to comfort her and she was pretty upset but trying and failing to hide it

Things were a little weird between us over the weekend. It felt like after that she kind of avoided messaging me at all to follow up on our plans and when we were out with our work friends she was kind of distant at first; taking to most others in the group but not really me at all at first. This kind of settled; we got talking and I just didn’t bring the idea of a date up and tried to focus on just cheering her up, asking if she was okay and taking her mind off things. The last day or two since then she’s been really affectionate, more hugs and stuff, and it weirdly feels like there’s a weird distance between us since all this came out but at the same time it’s brought us closer. Like she feels bad about being around me or something but when we’re together she’s grateful for the emotional support and being able to just enjoy herself.

Anyway. My head’s kind of all over the place and I don’t have a clue what to do now. I didn’t realise I was walking into a minefield, it all seemed so simple and easy and I let myself fall for her quite a bit assuming it was going well, but clearly there’s a lot of complicated drama I was unaware of. I’ve spent days in work having people gossip about her romantic life in front of me and just had to bite my tongue, it’s been kind of soul destroying lmfao. Nobody has any idea we’d arranged anything and I feel like now if we did go on a date it would just throw a spanner into the works. I think it’s just not the time for her, even though I think it’s clear there’s something there. 

I feel like my best approach is just to cool off and be chill about it. She has enough drama and confused emotions right now without me putting any pressure on her for a date. I was thinking I’d just not bring up the drinks idea again, let her bring it up if she’s still into the idea and if not just focus on having a good time when we see each other and being there for her where I can. I feel like I’ve done a pretty good job cheering her up where I can and giving her space where she needs it and I feel like that’s all I really can do. It’s really tough; it feels like, to me anyway, she got a little distant after this probably because she felt guilty about leading me on before being struck by the fact she’s not over someone else, but at the same time the fact she can just relax about it around me and have a good time has made her warm up to me a bit too on a deeper emotional level. It does, however, mean I’m left in a bit of an emotional limbo where I have zero idea where I stand, while everyone around me gossips about the whole situation constantly, and it’s really tough. 

So basically, my main question here is, what can I do to make all this easier on her and maybe keep my chances alive too? I feel stupid for letting myself fall for a girl who’s not over someone else, but it’s not her fault and emotions are just messy.

I've read women write about how much it turns them on to be having sex with a guy who literally sees her as beneath him and as a piece of meat. I kinda don't understand this fully.

I figure it might have something to do with their father treating them poorly so this is what they equate to love. Or something like that.

We've been texting none stop for a week, including voice messages, videos, pictures, good nights and good mornings. Everything is going great except for one thing - he hasn't asked me on a date. 

He told me he recently got out of a relationship, so I didn't wanna push it, thought I'd give him time. Its been over a week and I texted him saying that basically if he's not interested, he should let me know and I will understand. He said he really wants to meet me but there are things beyond his control, that he promises to fix soon and then we will meet. 
Weird, I thought. 
So yesterday I decided to check his Twitter page. He has his @ listed on tinder, but doesn't specify if its Insta or Twitter. But It's both. 
Turns out his ex gf broke up with him on a day that we matched. It came as a shock to me, because when he said he recently got out of a relationship, naturally, I assumed it was at least a few weeks, not the day of.

I didn't tell him I know and don't know what to do now. I know it will take him months to get over this girl since it sounds like they were in pretty serious (I love you's) relationship, I'm not sure how long tho. 

I honestly feel like I wasted my time getting to know him. Because if I knew from the get go, I wouldn't even begin talking to him in the first place. He told me he got on tinder to take his mind off of it and we just happened to have this unexpected great connection, he didn't plan on it.

Know and respect that every woman you meet and find attractive has considerable personal sexual agency. Expect that most women has had sex with someone else before she has met you.

I am of the belief it’s better to find out sooner rather than later whether you feel okay with her sexual past.

As such I have complied a list if mental **ASSUMPTIONS** I make that have aided/ protected my sanity in dealing with women. These assumptions are not meant for you to judge irrationally, but are to used as a resource to help you evaluate a woman. Likewise they prime your mind and make you aware of some, but not all a females sexual behavior as it relates to her past sexual history and relationship dynamics. This strategy is contrary to the “Don't ask, Don't tell, Don’t worry about it” model.

The primary first goal with these ASSUMPTIONS is to determine as best you can if she is or not suitable for long-term commitment, by **your standards**, not hers, you’re the prize and the barrier to the relationship. It’s up to you to disprove these assumptions, so use them as a checklist against her sexual history or what you approve of, not what the internet, media , church or your family and friends tell you what you should approve of.

The additional sub goals are to remove the veil of ignorance from men eyes, keep men's psyche from being shattered and make your mate selection somewhat logical, consistent and fair.

Reality doesn’t bend to our “romantic” idealizations. With these ASSUMPTIONS you don’t need to violate anyone’s privacy/ trust, but **rather, from the start**, like the moment you meet a woman, you would already have an informed and realistic image of the current state of a women’s sexual agency as it relates to her sexual behavior.

Even, if majority of these behavior ASSUMPTIONS are not true for ever woman, know that they *can* be true, so you must do due diligence, and what are the odds that *none* of the ASSUMPTIONS are true. And if you two have turbulence or break up, and you find you the “truth”, don’t be surprised or depressed, because again your mind is already primed.

You and women have the right to decide whether you want to be with a certain partner based on anything we choose. This is why transparency is paramount and research is king.

So, if you don’t care about her sexual history ignore this post.

However, if you are curious about a woman’s sexual history, want to protect your psyche and not be totally blind sided, then read further.

**ASSUME the following about** ***every*** **woman you are attracted to, dating or married with (even if you have been married for a while):**

1. She has a body count of *at least* 20 to probably more than 50 sexual partners (this includes oral only)
2. She has participated in an orgy (MFF or a (gangbangs))
3. She has had at least one abortion where the pregnancy is not due to rape or incest
4. Multiple one-night-stands
5. Involved on/off with a married man, or least considerably older man prior to meeting you
6. Has cheated in the past
7. Has had some sort of desire or sexual experience with a woman
8. Participated BDSM
9. Has had anal sex
10. Has had past treatment for an STD
11. Used or uses party drugs
12. She has engaged in prostitution/ stripping, sugar babying or cam girling
13. Has filmed a porno or has considerable amounts of amateur sexual photos/ videos with exes that still exist online or in private.
14. She is or was an Only Fans/ Snap or similar site/app “creator”
15. Thanks to Instagram she has gotten flown out for a sex adventure
16. She has an account on every major dating site/ app including fetish sites
17. She may have been engaged or married in the past and hiding the fact
18. Assume she has participated in some sort of real-life scheme/plan to finesse men for money either through a sham relationship, illegal scam or financial domination

**ASSUME further:**

1. When you’re asking sexual history questions, she will play coy and pretend she is holy, pure and innocent and sexually conservative. She will not be totally open about her sexual past by filibustering or being vague about the answer. In fact, she may even outright lie.
2. That she is still friends with the guys (or girls) she had sex with via Instagram, Facebook, or has their phone numbers.
3. Any straight male acquaintances she has, even those you have met in your social circle, especially those she went to college with, has banged her either individually or in a gangbang.
4. Any female acquaintances you both mutually know, again especially those she went to HS and college with has participated or watched her get gangbanged or at least they know “stories” of her past sexual history.
5. She has tried or will still have sex with her gay male “besties” if she got horny during a night out partying, and that THEY will/have sweep it all under the rug from you.
6. All of her female friends, and gay male friends will aid in the fraud and deception of her sexual past from you and run cover for their “sisters” current and past behavior.
7. If she isn’t older than 31, then her fun phase isn’t some “fun times another lifetime ago”, but most likely recent, even, right up to the beginning of her relationship with you.
8. She will emasculate you by doing kinky things with others in past that she had no emotional attachment to and lie to the you (the one she says she has an emotional attachment with) about what she willing to do. Essentially, she finds her past lovers more attractive and more worthy of sexual experimentation. This is particularly true for “Christian women” or church girls.
9. Assume as she is dating or married to you, she is cheating right now, or at least has her back up plan ready and that you may even know who her backup plan is.

**ASSUME, especially if your married:**

1. You are a “Plan B” after for sexual fun phase especially if she is older than 30. Your only meant to provide her with financial security and help her create a child. It’s not about love.
2. She is only having duty sex with you, infrequently as possible at a rate far less, far less than during her previous “fun phase.”
3. She gave her best sexually to the other guys in her past, and now she expects you the current husband to be satisfied with her sexual half-effort.
4. She will rationalize weight gain and sexual infrequency as being your fault.
5. If she stated going the gym in the last few months – she’s not getting in shape for you, she’s getting ready for the next guy.
6. Again, she is cheating or can cheat with someone at the gym, while traveling, work or local neighborhood and that there is considerable incriminating evidence in chat logs/ DMs/ text messages.

**If your married with children or considering this, then ASSUME:**

1. Home pregnancy tests are imprecise and also can be scammed to get you to commit to marriage. Positive tests are sold on the black market (craigslist) or otherwise obtained easily. So, before you make any commitments or public announcements, make an appointment with your health care provider and get a Quantitative blood test (or the beta hCG test) not a Qualitative blood test. The Quantitative test measures the exact amount of hCG in her blood. So, it can find even tiny amounts of hCG. This makes it very accurate.
2. The child may not be yours so make sure you immediately get a paternity test.
3. If your soon to be married, assume some of her old exes and other women that know her past will be invited to the wedding. Get the guest list and interview everyone about your fiancé’s past, especially during her college days.
4. If all her guests give the approximately same answers, or give overly vague answers, either they are telling the truth, or they have been coached and are running cover (see ASSUME Further #5&amp;6 from above). If she wants to have a private ceremony, with no guests from her past, scrutinize this heavily.
5. If your already married, pull up the old guest list and get to calling or otherwise contact her current friends (male and female) and get details.

**Therefore:**

1. If you discover her past, she will try and talk about it and work it out to get you to ""understand."" She will tell you everything you want to hear. She will say that she cared too much about me to share or was scared and that she has changed. She will cry, she will say ""she was in an abusive relationship.""
2. She will tell you everything you want to hear to boost your self-image/ego and salvage her image. She will suggest relationship/ marriage counseling and that counselor will usually tell you to “not be so jealous”, “your jealously makes her feel less secure about the marriage” or “the past is the past.” The counselor will then suggest “therapy” for you or ""prayer."" She might even get her friends to talk to you. Commenters on Reddit will tell you the same just ""forget about her past she is with you now.""
3. Men be more inquisitive on her past, if she ducks an dodges your questions, assume that this is your answer (her total behavior (tone, body language, mannerisms, not just her words)). Then you should become even more inquisitive to be sure (double down). However, it must be said, you can never know for sure, but still trust your instincts to make the final decision on keeping on ending the relationship.

I was with him from 17 up until I was 31. I have never dated or experienced any of the trials and tribulations of the dating world since I was in a committed relationship from a young age.

Anyway, a couple months ago I decided I was ready to start meeting new people. I only want casual though since I’m not ready to commit myself to one person again just yet. But more a regular fwb not a one night stand. Friend being an important part if you know what I mean, would like to have things in common and have a laugh etc.

I matched with a guy on a dating app and we hit it off straight away. It was great! We set up a date really quick (it was me that asked since I’m not one to text for ages, would much rather see if we vibe in person).

Went for drinks, conversation was flowing and we were having such a laugh. Before long we couldn’t keep our hands off each other and the date ended in us having sex. It was great!

We text for a bit after with a view to set up a 2nd date in 2 weeks since we were both busy until then. But then his replies got slower. After about 4 days of nothing I reached out to see if he was still interested and he said he was, he’d just been super busy but then he stopped responding again! I reached out on the Friday morning of the weekend we were supposed to meet up seeing if he still wanted to and he didn’t respond (there’s a theme going here lol). I saw he was online but was just not reading my message. So on Friday evening I blocked him. I was sick of waiting for my phone to ping and it be him. I know I was def more into him than he was into me and if he’d just told me it would’ve been no big deal. Just hate being strung along.

But then I started feeling bad so I unblocked him on the Sunday morning to just out right ask him what his deal was but he’d blocked me 😂 what a mess. But basically, I feel bad for blocking him in the first place. Like I’ve denied both of us closure? I am so new to all this, I haven’t a clue what I’m doing! Did I fuck up or am I overthinking it?

Our convos were pretty dry but he asked me out after a week
and I hesitated at first but then said yes so we set a day for our first (and last) date. 
It took place at his flat- I drove one hour to see him. He lived with flatmates but that didn't bother me, there wasn't mutch privacy. We watched a couple of Netflix shows and had some food- he noticed that I was a little reserved but I had told him before that I wasn't a dater and that I never had my first kiss etc. I basically have zero dating experience. 
I was kinda nervous and he was the total opposite, very chill and  high, kept going outside to smoke some more. He kept asking why I was sitting so far away, came closer to cuddle me and I honestly liked it. He tried to instigate a kiss but I backed of because i felt that it was to soon for me, but I still enjoyed his presence. We didn't have a real conversation, we talked about deeper stuff at the beginning of our date but that was it. 
We had only known each other for a week then so I guessed that it would get better with time, he was a bad texter and communicator but I liked him in person. Days went by and he asked when we could meet again, It was Christmas and New Years season so I had a very full schedule and didn't really have time then.
 Our conversations still were dry and he would forget the things I would tell him about me, all we ever texted was ""wyd"" and how are you. He would say that our conversations where like this because I was too shy which absolutely isn't the case, I'm unexperienced not shy with men though. Whenever I tried to shift the conversation it felt like he wasn't interested, but he sometimes would try to find common interests too.
The chemistry wasn't really there and we didn't know 5 things about each other after one month of talking.
I started to feel uncertain about us and then asked him if he wanted to meet again; i asked three times and he would cancel each time. I was the one asking him out and I was the one who'd have to drive an hour to meet him, however even a little walk outside was not doable for him. When I expressed my frustration and told him that it wouldn't work between us because of the distance and our busy schedules he got angry, told me that he was stressed because he was looking for a new flat. I then said that this solidified that it wasn't the right timing for us, wishing him the best and hoping he would figure things out, but still we had to go apart.
This was the beginning of a week long back and forth, he kept wanting us to try again but would be mean in the same breath. I wanted to talk it out on a phone call but he insisted on doing it per text. He'd say that he doesn't know why we are arguing because I wasn't his girlfriend, that he too wasn't texting other people, that I younger and lived with my parents so i didnt understand what he was going through. He'd say that he didn't like people who run from hardships and struggle, that whe should overcome them together even tho he had told me to not write so much because I wasn't his girlfriend before- so there really was no ""us"" or ""together"". 
We ended things on a sour note and i was pretty sad being that this was my first dating experience if I can even call it that.
 It's been a month now and I sometimes still think about him, I still get a little sad. He's more on my mind now than he was back when things were good between us.
Was I too harsh for wanting to end things?

We met in person at some event last year, both thought the other was really cute, hit it off, been together ever since.

And there hasn't really been any major disqualifying issues for either of us like there usually are.

Sex is frequent and great, won't get into specifics but it's like my dream sex life. We go out all the time and do all the couple things I always wanted to do.

I've dated a decent amount in the past, but usually it was very short / not serious through OLD.. we meet, there's something obvious that won't work, we ghost and move on, that sort of thing. It's been years since I've been in a real / proper relationship.

On paper this is basically what I wanted, this is what makes sense at this point in our lives.

But the problem is I feel like my interests and lifestyle preferences have been so warped by being single for a long time that I kind of don't even care / want it. Maybe part of it is making a good amount of money which has allowed me to get way too comfortable for the past 5 years or so, idk.

Like I just want to chill, do my online stuff, game, do a lot of (relatively safe) drugs, and work on my own projects.

All of this normal-people stuff I wanted to do to feel connected to humanity, I mean even the sex stuff that I've fantasized about doing for ages.. I don't know.

I feel like I'm always pushing myself to put in the effort to enjoy it, but I really just want to be alone for 12-14 hours a day and do my own thing.

I dunno if this is just growing pains that will subside, or if the relationship just isn't for me, or something else.

But I'm very hesitant to just drop it because it's so hard to find people that are attractive enough, have the right dynamic, compatible life / location, sexual compatibility etc., and I have all these memories of feeling detached from humanity and feeling like I'm not advancing that area of my life as I should.

MY boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 1yr and 7 months now, we both have had a pretty stable loving relationship up until the last 3-4 months.

So at some point my bf wasn't super happy with staying the country we are both in, due to work and other difficulties he wanted a break from his surroundings, he decided to go on a vacation. I was initially invited along but then along the way the plan changed due to some circumstances.

Now up until this point we were both happy and committed to each other, my bf even sent me flowers a day before we left.

Also we are not in a LDR, we live in the same city and meet often and are familiar with each others social circles and share social circles too.

Now my bf leaves for another country ... lets call it XYZ, he has gone there with another guy friend who is showing him the country, for the first two weeks he was there, he was being very cute on text and sending me his usual amount of messages and what not.

Then a few days before New Years day we have a small argument, we also don't really argue at all so it was a bit unsettling for me to not have him around so we could be fine post argument.

Also in the same time frame he is following new people on insta, people he meets along the way, he also tells me about these people.

Insta has this feature where it shows you accounts to follow if someone mutual has followed that person, I had started getting a few random account suggestions from people of this XYZ country. I didn't make much of it.

One day after New Years day, I by mistake click on one of those accounts, its a girl, (lets call her X) and she is posting a bunch of random insta stories. She has a few stories up of my boyfriend having drinks in a wider group of people.

Now on New Years day my bf and I spoke and also the day after we spoke just fine, and he did tell me he had drinks at various places later. He though doesn't mention this girl and I try to not read anything into it. Though this girl X is putting hearts and heart eye emojies next to my bf in her stories.

Once again I am not making much of it.

Later I am speaking very normally to my bf and he is speaking to me much the same as he always does. He is also telling me about his day as he goes about it.

Now the next day on the same girls story I see that she is watching a movie and the later shopping (in which some of the pictures I see my bf's back and I can tell its him because of the shirt he is wearing, which I got him)

The same evening he calls me and I ask him what he was yup to and he says just dinner, and doesn't mention movies or shopping.

Then we have a small argument again. The next day he goes to another city, so this girl isn't posting any other stories of him anymore because they aren't in the same city now.

Next day he gets back and it seems like he hasn't hung out with her since no stories and he also calls me and tells me he was hanging with friends.

The day after I see him having dinner with her one on one in the girl X's stories. He once again doesn't mention this to me.

The next day he apparently goes on a walk with her, he mentions the walk/run but doesn't mention her to me.

ALSO DISCLAIMER he is being perfectly normal and sweet with me - calling me and texting me good morning every day.

Then after this he gets on his flight back home, the whole time messaging me constantly and informing me where he is and what not, and no I wasn't asking him where he was. Even when I fell asleep and he was in the plane he would be messaging me telling me when he landed what he was doing during his layover and what not.

When he gets back he goes back into the same routine him and I had, being sweet and cute and everything else.

A week later I see on this girls X story that she is video calling my BF and then he is showing her a sunset by the beach, I know its him, because he sent me the exact sunset a few mins before.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background on X - she doesn't live anywhere remotely close in terms of countries to me and my bf, and my bf never intends to visit this XYZ country again for a vacay.

Later I confront my bf on what's going on, because at this point it made me super uncomfortable and previously I had stayed tight lipped because he is on vacay and meeting new people - so I should read much into it.

My BF admits to flirting with the girl, and she flirted a lot with him too, he says it was nothing more than that, and that the X girl is friends with his hosts in the XYZ country so she would often hang out with all of them and when his hosts weren't around she and him would end up making plans to explore the city since she lived their her whole life.

Now its been 2 odd months to this and I have been getting very angry at him constantly and he is being super patient with me, and has admitted he made a mistake flirting with her and never intended to hurt my feelings.

In my head I am stuck on - IS THIS CHEATING?

He admitted to the flirting himself, I didn't think he would have, he has been seemingly obsessed bf in general with me. I asked if he had feelings for her, and he said no to that and I asked if anything physical happened and he said no to that as well.  According to him, he was hanging around and yes crossed a line, and didn't mean to, but he said there was nothing more to it.

Over Christmas I (24m) found out that my partner(24f) had been cheating on me since 1 month into our relationship. Now before people jump the gun it wasn’t a lack of happiness or love for me. It was a sexual compatibility issue. I was uncircumcised and had phimosis meaning she couldn’t manipulate my penis the way she had for previous partners and it made her uncomfortable. We decided to stay together and I got circumcised recently in an effort to make things better (it was something I had been fighting for since before I met her and something I needed to get done anyway medically. 

But during our Christmas fight and our talks she told me her stance on sex and her sexuality and that she’s wanted to be in an open relationship since the start. 

Now initially I was against it, raised on a very monogamous belief about relationships. But I also have come to realise that my biggest issue is going to be feeling like it’s one sided and that she’s getting to do her thing while I struggle to find anyone. 


We agreed that I would get circumcised and she would start to do full service work as a compromise for now and we can reassess later. Now that I’m coming around to it how do I tell her that I’d like her to help me set up a tinder and help with my first date/ experience before we get started properly ?

TL;DR: finally got into a relationship with the one I loved for years and we dated for 7 months. We met 3 times towards the end and he broke it off with me because he said he felt nothing when he saw me and wanted to retract when I touch his hands. I don't know if his perspective on love is realistic or not. Can I still make it work? Is it worth trying to get him back?

I (F18) experienced my first love and heartbreak recently and it's been eating me alive. 

I met this boy (M18) when we were both 13 and have secretly liked him ever since. I did shoot my shot when we were 15 but he gently rejected me because we were never close. I was always too shy to talk to him and he mostly saw me as his friend's female friend. But I continued to just love him because I guess the heart wants what it wants.

Years later, when the pandemic hit, we slowly got to know each other through group calls. We went back to school briefly and he'd walk me to class which was something the old me would never imagine. Then quarantine again. The group calls slowly became just us because he said he loved talking to me alone. He said that I get him and he felt like he could tell me all his fears and insecurities in life. That was precious to me. I'd watch him do his homework through the screen and he'd offer to teach me mine. We continued to chat online and he said he liked me too and he's never felt this way before and we started dating for 7 months but it felt like a year since we've started talking for way longer. As friends, I told him that lovers meant keeping each other company. When he confessed, he asked if he can keep me company. 

It was like a dream came true. Though we didn't get to meet, we'd have these nice, sweet phone calls about life. He'd ask me about the years that I loved him for and we'd laugh about, he'd say he just never thought more of me back then. He said he loved me because I accepted him with all his insecurities and flaws but I saw none of that. I'd like to think what we had was precious. At first, I wanted to just take my life slow and do my own thing because I'll have years and years to spend with him. So I spent a lot of my time playing video games on my own and he stopped initiating our calls just to see if I'd take the initiative as his old relationship ended because he stopped messaging the girl and she just never messaged back. She was his only previous relationship and he told me it was also online and he was just immature back then. He finally called me and said ""I didn't know if I didn't talk to you, would you even talk to me..."" and I just lightly said ""I'll always be here when you need me""

Then I realized how it impacted him, I saw him like posts like 'often the ones that finally get with the one they love become less in love than the other' and 'if you get tired of me, then we'll give each other space. If our relationship becomes boring then let's nourish it. If we don't have anything to say anymore then let's find something to talk about. If we become strangers, I'll make you fall in love with me again.' He used to say he used to think about suicide but thought about the thing wa had going on and I just HUUUUU I started to shower him with all my love again though I didn't mention seeing these posts. 

We finally met 6 months in the relationship and our first date was cute. We hugged. Our second and third time meeting was at school and it would be a month later and we got to hold hands a lot for the third meeting. Sometime between, something happened to me, some drama stuff that's way too long to talk about. But, I went from this somewhat independent and cheery girl to this wreck that just constantly needed his company and called him from morning to night. I'd randomly cry and he would be concerned but then I pushed him away which broke his heart. He was there for me and told me he loved me up until the week before our break up. Our last phone call, it was the first time I lashed out at him due to my own insecurities and brought up some of his past pain and we never got to finish that conversation because my family walked in. He waited for me until midnight until he had to sleep. And I just- god, I felt so sorry. This was the first time I EVER fully lashed out at him and I didn't mean it. 

The second call never came and I didn't initiate a call because he seemed busy all week. We met Monday and he told me we were better off as friends. He said he didn't feel anything when we'd meet and wanted to retract when I touched his hand. He said he didn't know if loved me, but he tried. He said he loved the image of me he created in his mind. He said he thought of me as someone who was too perfect when I wasn't. And I just- nodded. He asked me multiple times if I had anything to say and I just shook my head. He patted me on the shoulder and said he did truly care for me and was happy when he was with me. He said I was the most cutest and interesting girl he's ever met. I cried for the whole day before thinking ""okay maybe I understand, I want what's best for him"" and texted him saying that I understand and I wish him well, even made a few jokes just so he won't be sad. He said thank you, he said I treated him well but he was just never able to cherish anyone. He said he hopes I can find someone that truly loves me. He even purposefully called me ""friend"" which wrecked me.

I thought I understood. But I gave it a few days and my heart just started to hurt. I just don't understand how he can say all those moments we spent together wasn't me. I don't understand how he can so easily give up on us after meeting for like 3 times. Was it because I lashed out at him? Was it because he was unable to adapt to meeting me in real life? Is ""seeing you makes me feel nothing"" a valid reason to break up? Is he just more comfortable talking through a screen? I- If it meant I can be with him forever, I would gladly settle for an online relationship. I never wanted any physical affection or anything, I just wanted to share the small things with him. Ahhh- I don't know. I don't have much relationship experience. Is there any chance of us being a thing anymore? Is working on an irl bond a thing? Sometimes I just think we missed out on adapting to being around each other. If i could have just been there physically through our talks- 

In my grief, I sent him a voice note asking these questions and he asked for some space. He's now given the aokay for us to maybe have one last call about this maybe about a month from now. 

I know there's gonna be a lot of ""just give up on him and move on"" but I at least want to have tried.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162664,public,self,What do you feel when you see the one you love?

I recently had my BFF over to watch a movie she had recommended. We were chillin until she paused, asking me for a quick $40 with no context whatsoever. Of course I had to ask why. She didn't bother answering, but rather got down and started giving me a BJ out of the blue.

The thing is, I knew she had a BF at the time. However, I was so baffled I didn't stop her. I tried questioning, but she kept telling me to shut up. I played along and we eventually had sex that night. 

The following day was kind of awkward. We never talked about what happened. Moreover, she didn't mention anything regarding the money she had asked for. She posted a story on Instagram about 2 hours after she left my apartment, stating ""I'm breaking up with my BF"" and ""I need some emotional support""

I'm so confused. I mean sure I had fun the other night, but I pretty much viewed it as a one and done kinda night. Her BF even approached me for any clues on why she ditched him.

Has anyone ever been in this kinda situation? I chose to ignore my BFF for now, because I'm not sure what would happen if I ran into her again.
