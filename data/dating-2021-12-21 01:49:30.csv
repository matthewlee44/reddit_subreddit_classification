1,rl9o53,1640073530,Have you ever been stuck in relationship with no support? How did you manage to find a way out?,"Very brief explanation here. I moved to a new city a few years ago to close distance on a Long distance relationship. Needless to say, it didn't work out.

I then found a new relationship, and a great paying job. Fast forward 3 years, intimacy is gone, we've argued enough times about it that its not even worth bringing up anymore. Its now at the point where I've been quietly asking myself what I am doing in this relationship other than staying for support reasons like car and rent. Which I admit, is a terrible reason to stay. 

Moving here and covid ruined me credit wise, and I made some poor choices. I see the error of my ways, but moving on is proving difficult as I need a vehicle to get to work, and need to save up to get enough for an apartment.

In short we are great friends that understand what each other is thinking because we're so similar. I'd have to say we're terrible lovers though. The only hope I can have is that I make out of this and somehow we stay friends. Not gonna hold my breath though.

I don't know anyone here and my family is far, so I just don't have the traditional means to just up and leave. My job is literally the most stable thing in my life now, and I plan to keep it that way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rl9o53/have_you_ever_been_stuck_in_relationship_with_no/

4,rl9xxh,1640074592,Does he really like me or Is he just using me?,"So basically i met this guy on tinder. When we first match he ask me something like ""do you see as a friend or a potential boyfriend?"" i was like it's too fast we've been talking for only like 3 days and he said he knew it's a very forward question but he likes me and we could be more than friends 

I wasn't interested in him at first i just talk to him because i was bored and lonely and our conversation is kinda boring not gonna lie

I once told him that i felt like we're not going anywhere because our conversation is sooo dry and he said if I don't wanna talk to him anymore i can just say it. He said he try to make this going somewhere but if I don't feel like we can then it's impossible so i said i wanna talk to him and i said sorry for saying something like that and we continue talking after that


I don't understand why he wanna be in the relationship with a girl who live in the different country with different culture and we've never even seen each other in person. He said the distance for him doesn't matter because he likes me a lot

He asked me something sexual and i said i don't feel comfortable talking about it with a guy who is not my bf and he said he thinks it's some kind of getting to know each other and to feel closer to each other and i was thinking to myself that why can't we talk about something else to get to know each other or is it normal to talk about sex with the girl you wanna be in the relationship with. He didn't force me tho he accepted what i want

Now we're dating and he's planning on coming to see me when he has enough money which I don't even know when. We're on the phone for hours everyday and facetime every weekend. I always initiate the call tho because he said he felt awkward to call people and i can call him anytime i want. When we're on the phone he doesn't really talk and i'm a quiet person so most of our conversation is just silence but it's fun when we talk dirty tho


I once asked him if he's using me for something sexual and he said he would rather choose someone near him if he wants something like that

I've been asking him for 3 days about his feelings like is he really serious about this relationship or he just ask me to be his gf for fun and his answer always yes he is serious about us (well no one's gonna say no anyway)

Yesterday i asked him again and he asked me am i really ready to be in the relationship because I doubt a lot and i said yes i am serious but i keep feeling like he isn't 

He asked me to be his gf but he never said he loves me and neither do i so this relationship is basically weird isn't it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rl9xxh/does_he_really_like_me_or_is_he_just_using_me/
5,rla1tl,1640075018,Helpful tip for mainly dudes!,"So first a little back story example to piggy back off of

I was at a bar one night and a girl I was chatting with mentioned that I looked exactly like Jason Segal. Now personally I don’t think he’s that great looking of a dude and I also don’t think I look anything like him but she did and that’s what’s important here. I continued the conversation with the question “well do you think Jason Segal is hot?” And she said yes which ended up turning into a night of us dancing till the bar closed and making out and so on and so on. 

Basically what I’m getting at is, if you ever find yourself making good conversation with a girl you’re interested in and she ever throws out the line that you look like so and so celebrity, always bounce off that with “do you think he’s hot?” And if the answer is yes then it’s a pretty simple and clever way to know if she’s into you! Which basically means you have the green light and 100% confidence to lead the rest of the night. And obviously that doesn’t mean just do whatever, obviously be respectful and what not. 

Also same thing goes for the ladies here! I bet it would be a bit more rare for a guy to say that you look like a celebrity but if it does happen it’s pretty easy for the follow up question all the same!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rla1tl/helpful_tip_for_mainly_dudes/

8,rla4lb,1640075345,Not sure if I (21F) have the courage to ask out my friend (22m),"I’m catching feelings for my friend and don’t know what to do.

we met 5 years ago on a discord server for people in marching band. (Yeah I know, super cringe). He lives in the Midwest and I live on the east coast. We started off as friends, we were still in HS and have a lot in common. Our friends groups combine a bit, my HS band had a discord server for ourselves and he is in it. He’s also in my friend groups Snapchat group. 

Fast forward two years, he starts marching drum corps and gets a gf on tour, they break up, and a few months after they’re broken up we start sending nudes and stuff to each other on Snapchat. 

Sometimes it gets pretty flirty, and this has been happening for around 2 years now. We got to meet in person during the summer on tour, our corps were in a few similar locations. It was awesome finally seeing him in person for the first time, but with covid we weren’t allowed to interact close. Our corps had to stay six feet apart which resulted in us eating dinner after a show in the parking lot facing each other, but six feet apart. We were lucky that at a few shows our tour buses parked next to each other in the lot. (Yeah drum corps is weird.) 

He’s planning on visiting me in a few weeks if covid cooperates, going to NYC for a day and some other places around here to show him. 5 days total. And we’ve been planning to hook up for real for a while. I’m excited, it’s like a little date too. He said he likes to cuddle. 

We are also planning a spring break trip to Disney world together since we both love the parks and he hasn’t been in a few years. 

I’m starting to catch big feelings though and I don’t know what to do. Sometimes I think he feels the same, but I can never be sure. The distance would make a relationship hard but I’m about to graduate college and I think we’d be able to make it work, but I’m too afraid to tell him I like him because it could ruin our little FWB we’ve had going on for a while and make our friendship strained or awkward if he doesn’t feel the same.

It’s always hard for me to try and figure out how band kids feel about me, they’re a lot different than regular guys. They’re used to doing band and being on tour for drum corps with a lot of girls they’re close friends with, so the line between friendly behavior and actual feelings is very blurry. I’m not sure what to do,

Also if by some freakishly small chance, if one of you marched in his drum corps or knows him from the marching arts world please please do not share this with him. I really like him and I value our friendship a lot, I don’t want to his post to jeopardize that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rla4lb/not_sure_if_i_21f_have_the_courage_to_ask_out_my/

Last two weeks somebody dared me as part of the 18 dares for my 18th birthday. One dared me to message and confess to my crush that I liked him. I messaged him that night and he told me we'll talk tomorrow. He was my crush before like long time ago and he's the only one that I could think of. We're not from the same school and he lives like an hour drive from where I am from. We didn't formally met and interact but I grew a crush on him. The day comes he didn't messaged me like he said last night but he added friend me on Facebook and he followed me back on Instagram.

 After that, he kept viewing my stories and I did the same for him. I admit I stalked his socials and view every highlighted stories and stuff. I kept visiting his profile on and back.  I grew a bit of an obsession for him in short span of time and I also liked him despite I can only see him through social medias. Based on his profile I didn't see any hint that he got a girlfriend like not even one, he didn't even mention anyone. But now a week later since I followed him, stalking and kept viewing his stories and my day. He began posting about this particular girl and limiting me and delimited after two days(that means I can't search for his profile anymore in fb) He then mentioned this girl, I presume, for the first time in fb for a sweet post, and one of his friend commented 'the girl from the south will probably be dead jealous' I am certain he's referring to me since I am from the southern area of the province and he's from the north.

 Based on one of the comments I found out that the girl was his ex. Just now, I again visited his profile and found that he un followed me in ig and blocked me in facebook. I am not mad with that I just want to know what the fuck is going on. What's wrong with him? I didn't even do anything, like I only view his stories.

16,rlamc0,1640077361,IMO childish relationship within friendgroup ( together for the second time ),"
So both are 16 y/o and were already together for exactly 2 months in April. Then he broke up because ""he wasn't ready and maybe it's better if they're friends""

After the break up they didn’t talk to eachother for 1 week. Like nothing.

Then over the summer holidays they messaged all the time but didnn’t meet up one. Then they thought about coming back together but they didn't because of school and so on...

The other day they got back together  but somehow the whole relationship is strange to me.

Both don't tell the parents ""because it’s akward."" even in April, no one told their parents.

In front of friends, don't hug/kisss because who knows why... in the meanwhile people in the same age leep making out at parties. 😂 

HOWEVER, IT’S FINE TO DO IT ON THE COUCH IN THE APARTMENT OF THE AUNT WHO LIVES ABROAD  😭😭

But the biggest problem is that we have been a group of three friends for a year and since they were together in April, I kept my distance  because I don't feel like being the third wheel. Especially because the whole relationship in April was a bit ridiculous to me (other friends saw it the same way as I did). I mean it still is…. And since they broke up in June, I didn't really want to do anything with them as a group... from October I invited them to my place for dinner a few times because my parents weren't there from time to time and things started to go back to “normal”

Completely unexpectedly, the two started dating again a few weeks ago and didn't tell me 🤡 because they were afraid of my reaction... but I immediately saw that they were dating again. And when I asked them whether they were, they were surprised how I knew that, etc. and since then I’ve taken a bit of distance again because I don't want to go again through what we went in June (if they break up) and TBH the relationship seems even more ridiculous to me than it did in April.

I mean if they are happy with their semi-relationship then ig it’s good for them, but i do not want to be part of it.

I told them my POV and they can't understand that I do not want to third wheel and that if they break up it’s going to be a mess again.

We both seem to come from different worlds - she works in the music &amp; party scene &amp; I work a desk job for a data company remotely - yet we also share a lot of commonalities in our personalities &amp; interests. The sex was great &amp; we even pulled an all-nighter just having deep conversations.

My question is should I reach out &amp; gauge whether she actually wants to stay in touch, or should I lose her number?

20,rlb6ag,1640079646,Hurt and confused....,"I have been in a lot of pain this week. And I'm sorry this is long... but I need some help.

I have CPTSD from previous relationships;

A fiancé who, after we got engaged, told me he cheated on me in the first year of our relationship (we were long distance and I had always given him permission to sleep with other people if the need came up, but I wanted to be told) so of course being told so long after made me question everything else. After we broke up and he wanted to stay friends, I did too, we continued to sort of see each other as we worked out our own things. He started seeing someone but never told me, despite still sleeping with me when I visited. He finally chose to tell me when I was stranded in the Alps with no way home because my Mother had driven off and left me alone and I was calling him for support. When I finally got home and asked him why he chose that time he got mad at me for being upset and blocked me and never spoke to me again.

After my fiancé I took 2 years to try to be happy with just myself. I fell for someone else. This guy told me he was interested but dealing with his own thing; I said I'd help and wait. He proceeded to promise to go on dates, getting me to visit, and we'd spend all day in bed. This went on for 3 years; 3 years I visited and every time he would say we would do other things, and we never did. I found out he had been seeing/ sleeping with other people the whole time; again I had said this wasn't a problem if I was told. In the last year he had made it seem like we were actually gf/bf. I found out through a random video he posted that he was in an official relationship that whole year... with someone else. I blocked him cold after that.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my current problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I have trust issues. Those issues come out in the form of anxiety, because I wear my heart on my sleeve and can't help trusting people automatically; especially if I have romantic feelings for them (which happens very rarely).

I took a yea after the last jerk who dragged me along to learn to love being with myself again; the next year or two I tried dating again but nothing clicked.

During this time my friend group got smaller and smaller because friends would ask me out and I would say no and apparently they didn't respect me enough to stay friends.

I became rather wary of friends asking me out, but I had a few friends I really trusted. Somewhat recently one of these friends (of 3 years) expressed an interest in me. I explained my previous issues and explained my needs in detail. I explained how much I needed him to trust that he could be open with me, and I needed communication. He said he wanted to try (multiple times).

I go down and visit him, first time hanging out not as friends, and I'm very nervous. But the moment I saw him again suddenly all the nerves are gone and I was just so happy to see him again. We clicked, and I really felt he did too. Everything was great while I visited.

A week after returning home, I see him post a video of him at a club with some of his other female friends. Not a problem for me, never has been in my previous relationships. Until one of the videos she was grinding her ass on him. This spiked my anxiety instantly. I didn't have any control, suddenly the PTSD crept up and I was overwhelmed.

I sent him a message trying to explain as calmly as I could why it bothered me. He was busy and couldn't respond right away so he said he would get back to me.

When he did, he said he couldn't deal with this anxiety and it was over.

So, here is my problem. This friend was someone who was always open and honest, always trustworthy. He sent me a message saying I could be open about my anxieties with him. I hadn't opened up about my anxieties in too much details as friends over the last 3 years, but I figured he had said he was understanding. He had said he was going to try. And he had said it was ok to be open about it. So maybe it was ok. . .

Apparently this was not the case, because he dumped me the first time it came up.  


**Word for word what he wrote when he said it was ok to be open about my anxieties:**  
*I will never stop from saying what you have to say or not let you express yourself in any way*  
*Doesnt matter which emotions youre going thru, if you need to express, do it (thumbs up emote)*  


**Word for word what he said when I asked him why he said it was ok to be open about my anxieties and then broke up with me the first time I was:**  
*Well I dont lie in that screenshot (screenshot of the message he said before), you can say what ever you want and I dont stop you from doing it*

&amp;#x200B;

I am a mess. I had such a hard time trusting people before this, I was struggling a lot with the idea of having feelings for someone again and was finally ready to open up. He knew all this because I had been open about it before going to visit. Yet despite that, he does almost a complete 180 in personality and I'm the one who suffers for it.

If I ever ""click"" with someone, or have romantic feelings, I am running the fuck away. I am blocking that person and never speaking to them again. I'll do what my other friends did. I don't want to feel this pain ever again and I cannot handle being betrayed again.

Anyway, of course I blame myself for all of this and hate myself because I can do nothing about it. I just have to hurt. Alone. *(All my local friends moved away during the pandemic, my younger sister and my Mom recently decided to band together to hate me for who knows what reason cause they won't tell me, and I have maybe one online friend I can open up to.

I've never had a long distance relationship before so it feels very different. Since I can't see him in person to get affection (once every two weeks from the looks of it) I rely on texts and calls.

We talked alot on the phone before meeting. And agreed not to actually date until we had met in person. He lives about 4 hours away from me. I don't mind the drive. He is very sweet but was more so before we met. I know he works alot but his ""tone"" in his texts changed big time. He tells me I can call on my break from work since I work late but there's never any emotion and he's usually distracted with his roommate.

I did some stuff I didn't think he'd be happy about and he didn't care. He's very supportive of me doing what ever makes me happy. But never seems to have an opinion when I ask for advice.

I have my second meeting/date this week. I know it's early but I don't know, the vibe changed. I want to bring this up to him but I don't want to sound to needy or unappreciative of the niceness he does show.

25,rlbqxp,1640082061,Is it weird to gift a vacuum robot for christmas?,"For some reason, I thought it was a good idea a week ago. He’s picky and has expensive taste in clothing so I thought to avoid gifts like that so I don’t gift him something he won’t like. Gift cards feel too impersonal. And finally, I settled for a house item because he just moved in to his new place and thought it’d be thoughtful to gift him something more practical to lessen his hassle. And who doesn’t like robots anyway?

But just yesterday, the package arrived and now I’m having second thoughts. Is it weird to give a guy you’re dating something like that? I don’t mind the price but now I’m thinking whether he would appreciate or be happy about receiving such an item. Perhaps I should’ve went with something more personal, still.

34,rlcif2,1640085254,Have I really been raped or not?,"Hey,

there is this thing that haunts me (F20) ever since one of my ex-BF broke up with me because of that. And it's my body count. I've never ever EVER said this publically and there are only few closest friends of mine, who know about this, but I have slept (don't know if I can call it 'sleeping') with 14 guys so far. It's a huge step of courage for me to tell it out loud even here on Reddit. I'm so ashamed of that. But last night I told my sister (F23) and described all the experience with all the guys. And she told me that I have been raped. I still can't stop thinking about that and I'm extremely sad because of the fact that I have let these things happen to me.

There is this one when I was 16 and a kinda good looking guy friend from an orchestra was 15 at that time. He always used to like me, but more than in a romantic way, I think there was some kind of a sexual tension between us two. On this orchestra event we got drunk and we started to kiss. He was with his GF only for a week at that time. And he asked me to have sex with him, so he wouldn't be a virgin anymore and be more experienced once he's gonna sleep with his GF. (This was super dumb and nasty and bad from him according to his GF, but I didn't think about it that much. I just liked that he likes me.) He was begging me and I didn't know what to do or say. So I did nothing. I didn't even manage to say a word and he pulled my sleeping shorts aside and stuck his D into me. My heart started to race. Then we had (a very very bad) sex in the drums stock. I felt so filthy and disgusting afterwards. 

My second (probably rape?) experience is pretty much the same like the one before. I was in a very unhappy relationship, lacked attention, sexual satisfaction, affection and the relationship was slowly dying. I went to a summer camp as a counselor 2 years ago and there was this guy (20 at that time) whom I've always liked. We got drunk one night and we kissed and I really wanted an emotional connection with someone since my BF at that time didn't give me any. I got naked and that guy was caressing me and kissing me. I know I was completely naked in front of him. But still didn't feel like fu\*king him. But suddenly he took his D out and stuck it into me out of nowhere. I started to panic so bad. I told him to get out of me immediately and started to cry. He was saying he's really sorry and I remember myself asking him in a hysterical cry: ""Why did you put it inside? Why did you put it inside?!""

I get so anxious thinking about all this... And I realized that there were only 2 or 3 cases of sexual experience when I really genuinely wanted it from the bottom of my heart. The rest happened just because I felt like I have to do it or told myself that I'm gonna sacrifice myself for him. 

My sister considers those 2 experience above being a rape.. I don't know what to do or think or how to get over all of this and stop hating myself for letting those 14 guys do these things to me. Was I really raped? Or am i just exaggerating? I feel like everything is just my fault and I hate myself for not being able to defend me.

Before you jump ahead to assumptions, I’m not even implying the ever common situation of someone doing a favor, on their terms, to ultimately receive something in return.

What I’m talking about, is someone doing you a favor in good will and good nature, so long as the favor you ask of can be turned into something they themselves would want

I.e.

Asking my older brother many years ago to buy me beer so that I could then leave to a party with said beer. He asked the brand I wanted, but still purchased the brand he would have chosen, even though he did not have or want any.

Or, today, im sick and my room mate asked what I’d like from Safeway. My response was “sweet iced tea and original pretzel crisps”

Since I am sick, none of the above was something she wanted a part of, however she bought me “peach tea” and “naan chips” and made a point to tell me that she bought those, because it is what she would have personally chosen

To be clear, I’m not mad about the favor lol. I’m genuinely wondering if this is a personality pattern in people, and if so, why??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rlck6a/oh_youd_like_a_coke_well_i_like_pepsi_so_let_me/

In my earlier encounters, I didn't use to cum AT ALL by penetration or other methods, but now when I had sex again with someone I figured that it wasn't just about that guy, I have started getting orgasms in general by penetration which is so fucking cool. It's like a kitty update (kitty 2.0) xD. 
Anyway, the things that I feel have changed in cases where I didn't use to cum and now that I do are: 
Stress levels : I was extremely stressed before and I use to think of sex as a distraction and didn't just use to do it for fun.
Kitty control : I started contracting/squeezing my kitty during sex and it makes me feel a lot better and every woman should do it as well.

40,rld02w,1640087233,Why continue talking?,"Brief backstory;

I (M39) Matched with her (F31) on Tinder, we get on extremely well, messaging each other huge essays. Swap numbers, continue over WhatsApp, messages become very sexual, have a video call. We finally arrange to meet, but she is insistent that we meet to have sex as we've wound each other up for 2 weeks.

We meet, from my POV it's amazing, we spend the entire evening together and are very compatible. 

She leaves. I get the distinct impression that although we both enjoyed ourselves, she is no longer interested. I'm gutted as I could really see things developing with her, but I accept it.

Maybe I'm terrible in bed, maybe she doesn't see it working out, maybe I fucked everything up, I don't know.

She messages me over the next few days and I ask whether she would be interested in some events happening in a few months, I essentially get a no. Yet, she continues to message (far less frequently) avoiding any kind of flirty/sexual stuff. 

It's PAINFULLY clear to me that she has no interest in continuing things, so why carry on messaging me? Ghosting sucks, sure, but that at least would have made sense. 

I don't want to confront her or put her on the spot, but it's frustrating not knowing what the score is.

Firstly, English is not my first language, so pardon me if I have some errors in my lingo. 

Secondly, I was seeing this girl (20F) for six months in a kinda friendly way, one with the nicest personalities that I ever saw, very caring for her family, she has that kinda homely beauty, even when she's unkept and her family is very hospitable and sympathetic and we have a good relation. So, a very important person in her life died recently (an uncle who basically raised her), 15 days ago, to be precise. Since then our contact has dwindled, with occasional responses and ""checks"" and small talks, but that it is, we were kinda open to each other, but I respect that she wants space and be alone in these grievous times.

We are on a kind of vacations (I'm an office worker and she is too, in another office),  I was thinking and bringing some gift (a local candy or cake) as a token of appreciation, without any pretension, and if possible strike a conversation.

47,rlenow,1640093204,"She left a lipstick kiss on the mirror of my bathroom, I'm stuck I don't know what to do.","I met this girl in college two years ago. We used to hangout with a group of friends and all of us were from the same country. We had good and fun moments, but we never got close or had deep conversations. 

*TL;DR after last paragraph*

Basically, she used to be just a part of my environment and I never got attracted to her or had the idea of flirting with her, and that was the case as well from her side. Matter of fact she later told me that she used to see me as a toxic person and I used to trigger her anxiety and overthinking. 

COVID-19 started and university closed, but we kept a little in touch. Maybe little chat once in three months. This semester we got back on campus, all of us who used to hang out in that group got separated. Many graduated and the others changed their uni so it is only me and her left. This allowed us to get closer and to open up about how we think and feel, sharing secrets and embarrassing moments... like best friends do. We found out we both have trust issues and we are scared of attachment and falling in love.

One night she was not feeling good and she came to my room and asked if she could sleep next to me tonight. No second thoughts in my head I accepted and didn't find it strange at all, I have slept next to female friends before, most of the time it went south... That night, we were pretty close, she was sleeping on my chest. She started playing with her nails on my neck. And I put my hand on her back and caressed her softly. One thing led to another then we started kissing for a long time in an erotic way... I mean not romantic. It didn't get further than oral sex. During the night she was giving me compliments of how hot I am and how I make her feel comfortable being with me. We stayed up all night.

At 7 a.m, we went out for a smoke, awkwardly laughing I said: ""We were just playing, that's what friends do."" This made her laugh and she said she likes the fact I'm cool about it, which makes her feel less nervous about the situation.

The next coming weeks, we had many sleepovers and we had a shower together once. We tried to have sex but her vagina is the tight type so we couldn't.
 She told me many things that make me want to try a romantic relationship with her like:

- I don't want to be with you in a relationship, but at the same time I want you to mine only.
- If you have sex with other girls, don't tell me I don't want to know.
- I'm addicted to you. 
- Why I can't hold myself from kissing you?
- I don't want this to stop.
- I want you inside me.
- I want you to be part of my life even after college.
- Can we go out once and spend night in a hotel then come back?

And many similar things cannot recall.

Last night, after we had a moment together (kissing, teasing, flirting) while we were supposed to be studying... She left a lipstick kiss mark on the mirror. I remove it today. But I really don't know how to respond.


TL;DR : ""I [23M] had a sleepover with my supposed new friend I discovered I had good chemistry with, but it turned south and we had many sexual settings thereafter, and no penetration involved. We both agreed we don't want a relationship and we just want to have fun. But lately things started to be more romantic and we both are enjoying it. Last night she left a lipstick kiss mark on the mirror of my bathroom. I have weird interpretation of symbols, so when I saw the mark it made me overthinking.

I (28 y.o. M) have slept with a girl (24). 

We have some pre-history together. She used to be the fiancé of a guy that I’ve been classmates in some university program. We’ve never been friends with him, just acquaintances. However, we attended some group events together and etc. I’ve always known her and him together being together (around 4 years) and engaged. We maybe had some short convos with her, never flirty or anything but I always thought she was really cute.

Some little time ago they broke up, I saw her on tinder and she gave me a like. Me watched but I didn’t message her for a while, and then decided to. We went out on 2 dates. She’s been pretty charming, but relatively distant. Last time we went out drinking, end up kissing and sleeping together. That was great but a bit awkward. In the morning she behaved friendly but definitely embarrassed. I took her home by car, kissed her and then I needed some time to think about it. I thought her ex situation didn’t bother me but I started thinking what to do now, how I feel about it and etc. also, she’s been pretty distant (romantically, physically) all the time prior to sex so it was a bit confusing.  So I didn’t message her for 3 days, she didn’t either. I hit her up with “hey, how are you doing?” And she didn’t reply me for a day already even though she’s been online and used to reply within 3h before.

61,rlgm9v,1640099378,Why crying in the moment of weakness a turnoff for most women?,"*Due to booming age of social media and ever envolving society. There has been effort to destigmatize the notion that man shouldn't be weak, show emotions and acts as crying is not a shameful act. Many women preach this destigmatization.

*But many women too don't practice what they preach. I get emotional during some sad/powerful stories and can shed a tear or two. **Every gf I've ever had that was with me during those moments reacted in a negative way, either they were creeped out or ridiculed me or something along those lines**. It's fine I get that as a guy I'm not supposed to show those kinds of emotions and I'm not ashamed. I would say that it is a turnoff for -at least some women- because they may be attracted to you for being strong, stoic, calm, level-headed etc.

*Also there are a lot of guys out there who get angry or frustrated over something small and can be verbally/physically abusive in response. Some women may be sensitive to this and see your emotional reaction as an indicator you might not be completely in control of yourself, causing feelings of discomfort/anxiety which becomes a turnoff.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rlgm9v/why_crying_in_the_moment_of_weakness_a_turnoff/

Because most guys probably just go for the hook up and I want to stand out.    But maybe they already want to hookup and that’s most comfortable.  Most recently, a girl was super touchy feely with me when we first met.  But when I asked her out for coffee and she turned me down.

Is it a turn off to women?  Especially if their already sexually attracted?  Because I’ve had plenty of relationships that start with casual sex and I feel like I’m the one being chased.

64,rlh9fr,1640101217,"F(29), he is M(35). What is a fair amount of time to expect a guy to contact you for a 3rd date/banging?","I let him know on Sunday afternoon about how the next time I'd like to bang this out (we went out on Saturday evening) after I submit my last final due on the 27th (I'm in grad school) (on Sat night he also told me he'll be back next week and is going to his hometown for the holidays)

He responded to the offer by saying deal and it's a great plan. I'm just curious as to what an appropriate amount of time is in the in-between gap, since he read my last message on Sunday afternoon. My last text was something like 'prepare yourself' after the earlier chat about when I'm free again as of the 27th.

So given that i am trying to adjust any expectations i may have, my reasoning is the following: i should get a merry christmas text or such at the very least/latest.

there is a time boundary where i let him know i am busy until the 27th if he cannot do that, then no. i see on bumble he's still logging in and in town so i presume i am being fair with the christmas thing.

today is tuesday night, so while i don't prescribe to the 'you gotta be texted back in 3 days or hjntiy' thing at this stage, i am also evaluating where i want to take this depending on what happens next unless he ghosts, which in that case, he did me a favor.

so what is fair here? we met on bumble, matched a month ago. when i asked him what he's looking for he said he doesn't know yet. i also drunkenly let him know on sat night i am used to being pursued by French men in a very overt manner (I am an American living abroad right now, this is another country). I mean the French are crazy passionate whirlwind so I'm used to that tempo but this is new to me, it wasn't said in a bragging way but in a 'i don't know how your culture works!!' sort of funny drunk way on sat night

it's too early for me to feel like writing him off but i think if i don't get a holiday text/check in, then how much more low effort can it get?

I can tell he isn’t a big texter. He texts me “good morning” every morning but then the conversation kind of fades out during the day, especially if we’re seeing each other that day. Also, when I leave his house I don’t hear from him until the next day.. and that kind of bothers me. He says that I’m not that good at texting and that I take hours to respond. I admit that I do, it’s just because I don’t want to bother him or seem “needy” (I’ve been called that in the past) when we’re in person, it’s amazing! We really connect and he is so affectionate. We really click when we’re in person. It’s just hard for me when I leave his house because our communication via text is spotty. The other day I asked him “what are we doing? Are you still talking to people on dating apps?” He tell me no he isnt. I think he’s lying because his location on Bumble has been changing a bit. Which indicates that he’s been on it. I just don’t understand why he’d lie. I know we aren’t dating, so it only makes sense, but I just don’t like that he lied. I can’t bring it up to him anyway because I’ll look like a creep.

(That probably isn’t true, but it’s my anxiety telling me) I’ve never felt like this with anyone else.. I’ve always been confident and easy going. I mean, I think I am being easy going to him, but in my head I’m going crazy. I know this isn’t normal but I really like him &amp; im taking it slow so I really want it to work.

81,rllcxy,1640112697,Why did he disappear after intimacy?,"I (f,23) have slept with a guy (27). 

We have some pre-history together. I had an ex fiancé for 4 years and they used to be classmates for same study program. They have never been friends with him, just acquaintances. We maybe had some short convos with her, never flirty or anything.

Some little time ago we broke up, I saw him on tinder and we matched. He messaged me after a month of match lol. We went out on 2 dates. He seemed to be very interested, we liked each other and he even invited me to a second day straight on the first one. He was very respectful, cute. I was more distant and he was trying to maybe be more romantic (not sexual). We discussed situation with my fiancé and as long as they never were friends, we were both cool about it. Second date ended up with drinks and I’d say I was the one who not initiated but added some spice to our communication that it ended up as  sleeping together. Sex was good, but there was some awkwardness in it. Usually like it happens on the first time with people you know very well and it’s just a bit embarrassing to fully open up sexually. I stayed a night after, but in the morning was more distant. He offered to take me home by his car (I offered maybe I go by taxi and he offered to help me still). During this drive he was trying to be also romantic, to hold my hand and etc. We did goodbye kiss. And none of us ever texted from Sunday. 

 I feel pretty awkward and vulnerable so I was expecting him to reach out first and to go from there. During dates we both stated that we wanted relationships, not a hookup. 

But after him not reaching out I’m feeling some disgust, vulnerability and I truly feel like kinda abandoned. Like if he doesn’t reach out on Wednesday, I feel like I’ll just erase this from my memory and pretend it never happened. Did he not like the sex, maybe he realized something else? Was he only after a hookup? I had a bit extra alcohol to drink but I truly liked him and felt connected, if I had knows it’s just a hookup, I’d never do it.

Prior to asking to sushi, I asked her if she has a boyfriend and she said no. We meet up for sushi, had a great time, went back to my place, drank, and ended up having great sex (I am not very big, so when I saw that she enjoyed it I felt so confident.) The next day, I take her back to her hotel and we meet up again that night for dinner and more great sex. She flies home the next day to the other side of the country.

Once she lands, she tells me that she feels guilty and explains how she has a boyfriend. I tell her, I think you should tell him and let him make the decision. So, he breaks up with her and she tells me to fly across the country to comfort her the next weekend and I agree. During this conversation, she tells me she was dating this boyfriend for a year and was also cheating on him, before me, with some other guy that she never felt guilty about to tell him.

I fly across the country to visit her, during the whole weekend she keeps telling me how she feels so guilty about cheating on her boyfriend. She mentions how it is some ethical thing with her Asian culture (why didn't you feel guilty when you cheated on him with the other guy?). The last night of that weekend, she tells me that he is going to give her another try whilst we fucked that night.

This went on for a month, I have been drinking everyday and feeling like the worst person in the world. We could talk for hours and days relentlessly. She was saying how we were lost souls that met each other. During this month with her boyfriend, she would talk to me every night saying how she misses me and loves me. But, when she was her with boyfriend, she would block me and avoid communication with me. This really hurt me a lot, but she said she needed to feel ""punished"" for cheating because it violated some ethical code with her.

Then after a month, she says she is in a lot of pain and needs to go to the hospital. She has one of her ovaries removed and is bed-bound for several days. During this, the boyfriend finds out that she is still keeping in contact with me and breaks up with her while she is at the hospital. She tells me to fly across the country again to take care of her. So my gullible ass, flies to her and takes care of her for a week.

After the week, I fly back home and she tells me how she wants to be alone. Her parents are not so fond of my race because of a war in the past. They think that she should date someone of another race and with a better job position. Recently, she is telling me how she does not want to talk to me anymore because I remind her of her boyfriend and feels so guilty when she is with me.

If the ex-boyfriend (TK) ever reads this, I want you to know that I was not the first guy that she cheated on you with, she used both of us.

I am not a good looking guy, so when she showed me this kind of attention I felt so in love and have been devastated by it. Everyday has been so rough for me, welcome to my shitty dating life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rlleum/my_great_dating_life/

I (25 F) work in a standard office job. We all work in sales, in fact. My colleagues (25 M and 23 F) clearly are drawn to each other and have a “spark”. He private messages her on occasion and they are attached at the hip whenever we have socials. He thinks no one has seen this but we have all saw him put his hand on her leg, and it’s a running joke that she knows she can go back to his place whenever.

They are pretty damn cute - even strangers in bars call them “lovebirds”. He tends to semi-agree but not say anything whilst she denies, but she has told me she likes him.

I’ve spoke to both separately as we are pretty close, and the only thing stopping them is work because our team is pretty close.

Just putting it out to you redditors on their behalf - should you ever date anyone at work?

If not, why?

85,rllj3b,1640113202,Help please,"I need advice

I’ve been on &amp; off friends with my ex since I cut it off 2 years ago to get well. I was a toxic person. He has been the one thus far to end the friendship then come back. We’ve been trying to see where it goes but he constantly tells me he’s not ready yet. He even said if his dad doesn’t accept me, he can’t be with me. All year he played mind games, then he of course came back and apologized. Trust was also broken through things I found out. I cut it off the other day bc I feel like I give more than I get back. My birthday was saturday, he had a funeral for his old coworker through suicide that morning. My ex’s brother lost his life that way years back. He also got into a car accident which lead him to only being able to drive back n forth to work(and funeral) until it was resolved. He said he wasn’t going to make it to see me but would make it up. I offered to get him uber rides to me. He declined, said he will still make it up. So later that night he told me he hung out with his boy which he walked to. (they live close by). I understand the passing of the coworker impacted him but how would he hang out with his friend but not me when I offered ubers? So, that’s what drew the line for me. There was some other things involved. I’ve waited 2 years and he’s been the only person I’ve been with since I met him meanwhile he’s had 2 girlfriends in that time. I truly love him and made a lot of efforts. It’s really hard. 

Did I overreact by cutting it off?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rllj3b/help_please/

Her birthday is on 28th December - I was thinking of messaging her then saying happy birthday, but am wondering if it’s a bit weird to have remembered that’s her birthday or weird to use that as a way in.

88,rllqfp,1640113748,I'm incredibly confused about if my boyfriend likes me or doesn't like me anymore," 

This post is probably very silly and dumb, maybe even childish, but I'm just confused and I wanted some people's opinions from here. Cause sometimes he makes me feel like he really likes me and then it feels like he doesn't care about me. It may be just in my head (cause I have many insecurities) or maybe there are good reasons to think so. Anyways:

At first, he used to text me very much with such long and sweet texts - that he missed me, he constantly wanted to meet me and several times he said that he was falling in love with me or loved me. But suddenly he stopped doing that and he seems much colder towards me. Please don't get me wrong, I know that you can express love in other ways that are more important and ""sweet texts"" aren't important at all, it just confuses me that he suddenly stopped that. I asked him a while ago if I hurt him or if he didn't like me, and he just told me that nothing really changed... Also he added that it's probably because he's usually gaming or sleeping at that time but I shouldn't feel bad. (He does play a lot and goes to sleep really late, like in early mornings and sleeps till afternoon)

By the way, I made it clear at the beginning that it's incredibly important to me that he should be always honest and direct about his feelings and if something ever changes, he should tell me instantly and it would be OK, cause it's better for both of us. He also acknowledged it and we talked about it several times and agreed neither of us would lie and always be honest with each others' feelings.

Then we would text each other every day, just simple ""how are you"" etc (he would do it every day too). But recently days pass and he won't even ask how I am doing. (By the way, when he showed initiative, I also kept texting him back and I also kept asking how he is, but when he started being colder, I don't do it either, honestly, cause I feel like I'm bothering him). Honestly I'm not experienced in relationships and maybe it's not necessary to do that every day...

We kinda set a habit and we used to wish each other good night. Usually it was me cause I go to sleep earlier, and once I didn't, and he texted me if he upset me about why I didn't wish a good night that day... lol.. Anyways we continued that habit until when he put me on read mode and stopped replying anymore.

He used to make me feel really loved but recently he wants to see me less often and I don't know, it feels like he doesn't care about me anymore... at least not as much as earlier.

However, we still keep meeting. When he's not outside of the city, we keep meeting once a week. When we walk, he's actually really nice and sweet. And when we meet at his apartment, he is also really sweet and amorous there and he does make me feel he likes or/and cares about me when we meet in person. I have good time, and I'm not completely sure about him anymore but he seems to do so too.

So, I don't know. Do some relationships get like that later? Or is he losing interest in me even though he says he feels exactly the same? I feel like there is no reason he would stay around with me if he didn't like me anymore, but at the same time him getting unusually cold suddenly confuses me.

I know texting does get boring and ""how are you"" stuff is usually the same, but it made me feel that he cared about me and him suddenly stopping it made me feel otherwise.

Yeah, probably a long and silly text... Please no judgement. I would appreciate all opinions.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rllqfp/im_incredibly_confused_about_if_my_boyfriend/
89,rlm4de,1640114845,How do i manage a weird situationship/friendship?,"Hey, so ive been good friends with this guy through my college for the last 4 months. We had instantly hit it off and have great chemistry. We also talk every single day even when we’re not in school together. But we only ever were friends, even though everyone around us always said there’s definitely something between us but i didn’t wanna believe it.

Well Friday night, our friends threw a party and him and i had been drinking, not heavily though. After about an hour of flirting, he made a move on me and we made out in front of our friends, and several times. He told me that he’d been wanting to make a move and dropping hints all semester and this was the perfect time. All our friends were cheering when they realized what had finally happened, since they made it their mission. Later that night, we also cuddled to sleep and talked a bit more about everything.

Next day nothing felt awkward, and we’ve talked about that night since and he’s made it clear he was happy about it. I’m just now confused on what he wants? Does he want to just be friends? I at the same time don’t want to have this discussion too early either and scare him.

90,rlm6ej,1640115013,"Hypothetical For People in Non-Married, Child-less Relationships","I've had numerous difficulties with dating and attracting a partner throughout all my 34 years of life on this planet. One of the biggest things I get told whenever I (understandably) express frustration with it is ""you shouldn't look for a person to complete you, you have to be happy on your own first"" or some variation of that. I'm assuming that most, if not everyone here on this sub agrees with that advice.

Assuming you do, question for folks in Non-Married relationships with no children: let's just say for arguments sake that for whatever reason, some outside entity (the government, the state, whoever) came down and said you weren't allowed to date anymore and forced you to cut off all contact with your significant other and that you must live as a single person from now on..how would you feel?

92,rlmjuk,1640116073,How do I solve my problem?,"Hello dear Reader. 

Your insight, opinion and advice is required. No it is truly needed. I, being on a frenzy made a previous post which didn't garner enough attention as I would want, actually it didn't receive any attention at all. 

The situation which I find myself is not unique, or at least I would like to believe it that way. There are probably thousands of people who have been shoved into the same scenario by Life. So, I need your advice. 

I am a student in a medical college and I am 20, male. I have never really had a relationship with most people let alone romantic relationships, but it hasn't prevented me from developing romantic feelings. And so, I did.

She is my colleague, I would describe her as very intelligent and beautiful. Basically we started off as friends and then these feelings grew. I won't like to expose fully why I developed this feelings, but what I can say is that she really gets some of my weirdest thoughts and we can joke around it and she is also really mature with dealing with things (I am not).

As time went on, I decided it's best I lay it bare, we would spend quite some time together in medical school. So, I told her that I had feelings for her. I recall saying first through text. She ignored it or kind of sidelined it and let our other conversations cover it. Sooner, she no longer picked my calls but still replied my texts. Our two-man study group slowly didn't happen again, which was one thing I really appreciated because she had this way of turning the most mundane into vivid imaginations. 

Then, when I finally came true she told me that ""I shouldn't let my interests ruin what we have, but let's see how it goes"".

The subtley bugs me because it made me appear selfish, I mean we do help each other out a lot. Though I am forced to believe her.

The problem here is that I find it rather difficult now to communicate with her, I have always been bad at initiating a conversation because I am always in my head, kind of like having the label ""introvert"", some call it shyness. I think it's both. It's a really long and winding story and I know that I made quite some bad decisions above, though it's hard for me to pinpoint exactly where.

I talk to both of them, more so Jackie, but it was really fun.

Anyway, after finals are finally over, I essentially get really drunk and black out with Alicia and a few of our friends in my dorm, and I tell Alicia that I find Ruby extremely attractive. Like I emphasized it a lot. Later, back at my frat house, i see ruby and jackie there but i'm too drunk to really interact with them and i eventually crash.

99,rln7xw,1640117955,My (20F) LDR with my boyfriend (21M) has been killing me lately,"I moved out of my hometown in September for university. It's about an hour drive from the city I live in currently, some people wouldn't consider such distance a long distance relationship, but I do, because of our busy schedules and the fact that I don't drive, which can make me travelling to my parents' house inconvenient.

We started talking and going out a lot in September, he would come see me mostly because he had things to do in my city regarding his work/business. I was really happy in a new city and I wouldn't come back as often to my hometown, I was busy, going to the gym, etc. And I didn't think that anything would happen with him, so I simply didn't put any effort to see him, it was him coming to me. We officially started our relationship in late October. 

I started coming to my hometown more often, I was there all weekends in November, I'd stay a night or two at his place, etc. Everything was perfect. I caught feelings, I wouldn't say I love him, but I do like him a lot, I cherish him and miss him constantly. I think it's a good thing to have feelings for someone, but it's been killing me lately. 

I lost myself a bit, not gonna lie, I abandoned my hobbies and started struggling in university a bit, the university situation has left me extremely stressed and anxious, because I have my exams in January. 

I noticed that he has been very busy with work, and I get it, I'm trying to do the same, get an education and build a future. That's the thing about him that I'm extremely attracted to. I consider myself very ambitious and I hate myself for losing that spark lately and not doing the best on my assignments. 

But the thing is, his effort changed. Maybe it's because of work, I try to be understanding, because I know what it's like to have a lot on your plate. But I miss how things were in the beginning. It's my first relationship, I don't know what to expect. We had a fight over this actually, I expressed that I feel like he doesn't care that much. Because that's how I started feeling. 

I don't know how we're going to close the distance after 4 years, I'm probably going to come back to my hometown which I don't mind actually, because he's close to buying a house there and that's what he wants. He wants to settle down and have a serious future with me, which is definitely worth the wait because I want the same. 

Sometimes we have our doubts, I think it's normal, and we talk openly about them, sometimes I don't know how I'm going to survive 4 years. I think it's okay to be uncertain sometimes.

The thing that's bothering me the most is me coming to my hometown all the time and him not coming to me. I feel like I'm doing all the work, it got tiring. Maybe I expect too much and I'm not appreciating him putting effort in the beginning? Maybe men get a bit tired of doing it all? Obviously I don't expect him to put all the work, the relationship consists of two people, they both have to put effort, I'm just talking about traveling arrangements which have changed. 

It's been messing with my head, university has been messing with my head too, I'm super stressed. He wants me to graduate, he's been understanding, and I'm not going to drop out because of him, I have dreams, he has dreams, and I think that's how it should be. 

How can I help myself? I'm sick of feeling this way. Nothing's going to really change until my exams in January, but after that I'll have more free time and I'm thinking of starting to take care of myself more. I'll start going to the gym again, taking care of my hobbies, maybe something will change if I show him that I have a life without him, working a lot on myself? He broke up with his ex girlfriend because she didn't work or study, had no ambitions and he got tired of it, maybe he changed his effort because he started to see that I'm doing less in my life?

I don't know, I'm feeling super stressed, insecure, I miss him, I want us to work.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rln7xw/my_20f_ldr_with_my_boyfriend_21m_has_been_killing/
