I say “seeing” because we have said we are interested in each other, but no dating is happening. We mostly text to keep in contact and video once every 1-2 months. 

He asserted early on that he wants to take things a day at time. He is open to a serious relationship, but said he is not thinking longterm right now.

**The problem**

Since we started this whole thing, his interest seems to have dwindled over time to the point where he just seems rather lazy and disrespectful towards me. A part of me thinks that he’s treating me this way because I was “too nice, predictable, and honest with him” which may have killed the mystery and the chase.

Examples of disrespect: He constantly makes fun of me even though I have said it bothers me (he claims he can’t distinguish between jokes and hurtful comments), bailing on me once when we were going to hangout, and sometimes taking several days (5 or 7) to text back without really explaining why he needed the time away.

There’s no animosity between us, he sees me in a good light — like nothing I do ever seems to bother him or significantly rub him the wrong way — but he treats me, what feels like, a toy.

**How should I proceed?**

Our main form of contact is texting every few days. I’m starting to feel sick texting him back, like zero excitement. I don’t want to force myself to text him, but I want to resolve the core problem here, so I put some few resolutions below.

*Bear in mind, this is a friend I’ve had for several years, albeit not the greatest of friends (more fair-weather friend, as I am realizing now), but still, I would to treat him with some respect.*

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Just distance yourself slowly.** Play it cool. Keep in contact. This approach is ok, but sometimes it feels a tad disingenuous when I’m sorta feeling sick texting him.
2. **Try to make things work**. Explain (again!) the things he’s doing that bother me. However, he really doesn’t like when I call him to talk about negative things. He likes when things are light, playful, and easy. This makes it hard on me because it’s like he doesn’t care.
3. **Tell him I don’t want to text for a while and explain the real reason why.** I don't want this to come across as a ""cut you off.""
4. **Text him that I need to taking a “texting break” for a while. No explanation.** 
5. **Turn things around by being more mysterious and seductive.** Get him to start respecting you more. Honestly, this feels like a lot work (why am I the one bending over backwards!). Idk if this would even work at this point, maybe it’s too late.

I am extremely hurt: I decided to leave the guy who was I was having a 7 month casual thing. It was all really great, we liked each other a lot, but he would not commit.

He was recently divorced and did not want a relationship. Isnt it ironic though that we managed to get into a ""relationship"" without labels. We talked everyday, shared everything, saw each other once or twice a week, traveled together and we also told each other we made each other really happy. He would consistently do a lot of traveling without me, and I guess saw other people as well. I didnt, I was too involved to see anyone else and I thought I could handle casual just with him. One week before, I said I would like to try something more serious one day but he had no answer.

This was the greatest relationship I have ever had, but while I was with him, I was constantly anxious because I thought that if I expressed my needs he would leave (he said he did not want pressure of any kind). The thing is, 6 months later I flipped, because not knowing what would happen the next day with us made me crazy (was he out with someone? was he going to find another casual gf? when would he invite me over? etc). Having no real commitment drove me nuts, so one day after talking to a friend I did a blitzkrieg attack (ended everything out of the blue). He is not good with emotions, so he basically just said he understood my position. Now I am sad that I might have hurt his feelings by saying I couldnt handle it anymore completely out of the blue. I want a long term relationship and having someone who was great (trust me it was the healthiest relationship) but could not give me the slightlest bit of reassurance that he was commited to me was killing me.

Now I am here, trying to let go of the hope that he will come back.

I’ve knew this girl for more than 7 years, we always had a thing when we were younger but nothing ever came of it. 

Anyway I’m just out of a relationship about 2 months so this Saturday past I thought that I’ll try tinder and get back in the dating scene. She showed up, I haven’t had contact with her in about 2 years so I thought “why not?” And just sent her a text asking how she was, we had a nice back and forth and I asked her for some coffee and a catch up, well couple of hours later we got our coffee and decided to go for a walk on the beach, we then just chilled and she grabbed my hand then initiated a cuddle, we remained like that for about a half an hour then got some food and she said we can do this next week if I would like and went back to hers and watched a movie. 

I texted her when I got home and said I had a great night and offered plans depending on the weather. She said she had a fun night too and she said we’ll see how the weather goes. I said cool and left it at that. 

Anyway I texted her today asking how her sun burn was (we both burnt really badly) she immediately replied “that it was a bit better lol” and I said “yeah like wise, how’s your week going?” And just haven’t heard anything  back.

We had a troubled beginning, as I was an addict and she was a “fixer”, but after the first couple years of up and downs, we really started to blossom. We both started studying in school, and our careers aligned and brought us even closer. She became my best friend, my partner, and a love like no other. There’s no doubt in anyone’s mind that we’re a special couple. Last year about this time, we moved in together, and things were great. Until they weren’t. 

The initial problem:
I relapsed early this year, and even though my partner years ago swore that she would never stay with me through my addiction again, she did. She stuck with me and tried to help as I struggled for weeks, and then months. Then the inevitable happened, she tried to put her foot down, I pushed her too far (emotionally, not physically), and she couldn’t take it. We split up, and were apart for just under 3 months, as I tried to clean up. She genuinely didn’t know if I would ever be back, and during this time happened to run into an old fling. They hit it off, and, well, ended up having a series of 2 “one night stands”- she swears that they were just one night stands and no strings were attached afterwards. Fast forward a bit, and we’re working back towards getting together. I’ve been clean, we’ve been seeing each other and are considering a future once again. Well, not a week after I thought we were moving in a good direction, she ran into “him” again, and had another one night stand.. but this time, she literally told me the *next morning* and said that it wasn’t right, and would be the last time. I tried to accept this, as we were still technically single, but it still hurt. Fast forward another month or so, and we’ve moved back in together; things seemed rocky at first but we quickly became ourselves again. I thought things were going well, like *really* well, but the other day, this started to come into question..

The problem now:
The other day we were on a visit to her family, and it was a great trip so far. One morning, however, as we were each sending our daily “Snapchat’s” to our friends that we have “streaks” with, I thought I noticed “his” emoji in the list of names she sent messages to. I tried to keep this to myself, but by the time we were on the road, she knew something was up. She asked me, and I blatantly asked if I could see her phone. She let me, and I opened it and confirmed what I saw; she had messaged him, but it just showed the one time from the morning. My girlfriend quickly explained that she had “accidentally selected his name that morning while sending the generic message she sends to all her streaks”.. I don’t know if I believe this, because his name isn’t near the top of the alphabetical list, but I let it go as such.. I did mention, however, that I would have blocked someone like that if I was in the situation, just to be sure nothing like this happened again; she totally blew this off and we let the conversation die. 

Then the other day, I caught her quickly swipe closed facebook as I approached her at home. She thought I didn’t see, but I did.. and since we share passwords (I’m not proud of this next bit) I went to the bathroom and logged onto her Facebook... and checked the search bar. Sure enough, his name was there and I quickly snapped a screenshot. A few moments later, when I finished in the bathroom, I refreshed the page, and it was no longer there. I went out to the living room and tried to be blank with her, but she started to catch on and got defensive before I could even say anything. She said “are we fighting, or what’s your deal?” And I said no, let it go, and have been playing nice since then.. that brings us to now. 

The questions:
I genuinely don’t believe my S/O would physically cheat, not cheat at all actually, but this evidence has just got me thinking the worst. So, is it possible she really accidentally messaged “him”? And what should I make of her hiding her interest in him? Are there any glaring signs im missing, or obvious other pieces of evidence for or against her cheating? I really *reallllly* want her to be innocent. In fact, I truly believe she is.

We planned a weekend together and that happened about a week ago, which was about a month since we first starting talking. It went great. You would think that the way we interacted that weekend we were a couple of some considerable time. We made out a lot, held hands non-stop, both of which she initiated first by the way. We were very physical but in an intimate and affectionate way. It was clear there was a strong connection there. We got along very well too and spoke and never really had any dull moments. Before I left she told me she was so glad I made the trip and to keep in touch. It was obvious the weekend was a success. However, I was still unsure what the next move was for me. I really liked her but I thought that if I made a move right then I'd be appearing too needy and moving too fast so I took things a little slower (even though I was ok with moving fast).

The following week after that (last week) I was busy with work and had a major setback there so I wasn't really 100% that week, but I still managed to text her throughout the week. But that whole week I was thinking how to escalate this thing because we both like each other. Then monday this week I tell her I want to come visit her again and she throws me a massive curveball. She basically said she didn't like how I didnt express my feelings about her and the trip. I realized I shouldve communicated better but tried explaining that I acted that way because I didnt want to come off as too needy and push her away until I was sure I knew what she wanted. Thats the whole reason I planned this second trip to see her. Now shes basically saying shes not sure if she wants something romantic, which doesnt make sense as she clearly did a week ago. I ended up telling her how I did feel about her and opened up but somehow its not really doing much. 

Just shocking as things were looking so great until that text. The texts in the last week were not indicative at all of her having lost any interest either... Looking back it seemed she wanted to move fast but again, I had met her just a month ago and as a guy 1) it takes a little bit to open up to people and 2) you dont want to come off as needy and pushing things too fast.

Heres another issue, I’m really not all that. I’m cute, but I’m skinny and flat and I sort of have a boyish figure. Defiantly not the beauty “standard” for a female. That often makes me want to settle, but I just can’t be in a relationship with someone who I’m not 100% attracted to.

For the first month, we were on totally different pages until one day after we went to the coast, I realized she probably wanted something more than I was ready for.

We went back and forth - she said, ""we can either be friends or work towards a relationship"" my compromise was, ""how about, let's see where this goes? No FWB arrangement, but let's flow with things..."" so the arrangement was take it day by day.

She brought up commitment recently, to which I said no - she then mentioned ""well, I would like that you start spending the day with me rather than coming over late and having wine then us sleeping together, I'd like to do things during the day, I need you to show up on time and I want you to plan things.""

I come over to her place at around 7-8 on Fridays/every other weekend, and this tends to be spur of the moment. She told me she would rather have me plan things, and that she is the one always planning/inviting me a week ahead. Ok. Well, I didn't/can't change things all at once... so... last weekend, she texted me on a Friday to invite me over for dinner the next day.

I didn't respond until after she called me the Saturday evening - I forgot to text her back about the invite. So, instead of calling her back I texted her around 6pm Saturday in response to the 7pm text she sent me on Friday about coming over for dinner. She texted me back with, ""why are you texting me this late to decline my invite - after I called you?"" I was with friends, so I didn't want to respond.

Later on, she said, ""You are being cruel. You know I don't like to be ignored.""

I didn't think anything of it. I know she has had a history of being cheated on, and she's in therapy for it, and I'm aware of that. She then texted me the following morning ""I cannot do this with you anymore - I feel like you don't care about me. I've been trying to see you for more than 2x a month, I want you to plan things, I want to know what's going on with you, and I get nothing. This is cruel and mean. All the best, but this can't go forward.""

I freaked out because I thought it was so disrespectful to break up/part over text. I don't want to lose her - and we are now taking space - I'm really angry with her for doing this, but I don't know how to continue. I want her in my life, but I can't deal with her thinking I'm being dishonest and her projection of thinking I'm doing something shady, when I wasn't - I admit, I also didn't tell her what I was doing - I thought if she had a problem, she would've called.

So I told her how angry and disappointed I was; she triggered me, and she knows I hate text messages (I prefer calling over text), and I hate it with a passion. She did it anyway, which I thought was very selfish. After I told her everything, she apologized and sent a letter. I wasn't doing anything bad or harmful to her - and I wish she would trust me that I wouldn't do shady things - she said ""had you told me what was going on, I would've been ok. I only see you 2x a week; I'm not even sure if you're still on dating apps - you don't like to text, you are ridged with planning...what else was I supposed to do?""

She doesn't live more than about an hour travel away. I would say we are together. I know she isn't dating anyone else but we haven't taken any big steps neither.   


We meet every so often. Sometimes I can be in her city for 4 days or so and we usually meet several hours a day as long as I am staying there. Sometimes I can visit 3 weekends in a row and sometimes it can take a month or two between meetings.  


I like to stay in touch with her when I am away but that isn't really her style. We haven't had any serious talks about it. She is just slow to reply. I am used to it taking at least a day before she replies. Sometimes she wants to chat for a while but it varies a lot.  


Every now and then she takes several days to reply and recently she went 8 days radio silence so I got worried that she was actually ghosting me. She wasn't. She is mentally ill so she was having an episode that lasted longer than usual. She closes down when I try to talk about it though. Like she is embarrassed to tell me what really is going on.  


Our dates when we meet in person are usually fantastic. The time in between are pain though. Our communication over sms is pretty bad. It makes or breaks my day if she answers or not. I usually just send her a simple message with a picture of my cat or something.   


Sometimes I get a quick answer and a conversation going and sometimes nothing for days. Then after 5 days I get a giant heart emoji or something and feel good again for a few days.  


I guess my point is that I let her make or break my day. I need to be doing normal stuff like working out and meeting friends when I am not with her. I am doing those things but I let her take up a too large part of my life when the time we get together isn't too much.

We get into a few arguments every now and then but it’s never been anything bad.

The only thing that’s been a strain in our relationship so far is how different our life philosophies are- I KNOW that sounds stupid but basically he is a huge realist and pessimistic. Because I was lost support from my parents for being gay, I have to work a LOT on top of school so as I’ve grown I’ve become very fixated on positivity. This makes me a very sensitive person and I def think I can be “toxically positive” in some cases for sure.

This gets in the way of our relationship sometimes because my boyfriend is very critical and sort of mean when it comes to jokes. He can also be unnecessarily argumentative which stresses me out as someone who’s admittedly very defensive. But we’ve talked about it and he’s come a long way with being kinder.

However, today I got a text from him saying “what the fuck is wrong with you” while I was at work, I was so anxious and confused so I ran to the back to read the texts, and basically he was really upset about a spill I didn’t realize I made and left. It got on his stuff so I think he’s totally in the right to be upset, but the way he spoke to me in the heat of the moment made me so uncomfortable and anxious. I understand that people just get upset sometimes and lash out but I feel like saying “what the fuck is wrong with you” and being that passive aggressive and upset over an accident is concerning.

About a half hour later he sent another text, this time it was really long but calm and communicative. He just explained that he felt that I wasn’t as respectful of his things as he was to mine. I think that’s a very fair thing to be upset about and I understood his point and ofc was very sorry, my concern only lies with how he initially reacted? He also never addressed the way he spoke to me in the heat of the moment.

I can’t tell if I’m being too sensitive or if this is a valid concern.

My boyfriend and I have been together for just over half a year now but we have been friends for 5 years. I met him online through playing games with friends and we had an on and off long distance relationship for a couple years. It never really worked out previously because I couldn’t handle long distance with all the stressors in my life. Overtime I was able to developer better skills for coping and handling stress so we decided to give it another shot. I love him, he is the perfect boyfriend in every meaning of the word... he’s kind, considerate, loving, caring, funny, like truly, he is wonderful. He loves me unconditionally and unquestionably, when we talk about problems he does his best to accommodate and talk it through with me (I try to be the same for him but only he could say if I really am &gt;.&lt;). I see him once a month if I’m lucky but there are no guarantees and it’s getting more difficult to plan the visits here just because we’re both a little more busy. (It takes a plan ride or a 6hr + car ride to get to each other )

So now the “issue”, it really is just with me, but basically it feels like there is a piece missing from it all. The biggest obstacles for me with the distance are the lack of touch and the lack of romance. It’s so easy in distance relationships to just get stuck in a routine, doing the same thing every day, and that’s what it has felt like lately. It’s hard to find ways to be romantic from so far away but it feels like he doesn’t try. He won’t make an effort until I’ve brought it up multiple times as a formal issue and even then he will probably just continue to do nothing. 

I suppose it just feels like he doesn’t listen and then I feel not heard and feel less inclined to share when I’m having a problem.

These are some characteristics about myself that I think attribute to my lack of success. I grew up super religious and sheltered. I went to an all boy school, so when I went to a public college I had no social skills and was at a middle school level in terms of dating knowledge and experience. 

That said, I’m no longer awkward and can hold a decent conversation. However, I am so worried about my lack of experience. If/when I finally do date, I would have no idea what to do. 

If you’re still with me, thanks for reading. In conclusion I’m feeling like I am wasting my prime years.

I myself objectively am very good looking, and it's why it only makes this all worse. Middle &amp; high school made me lost all my previous bravado confidence and self-esteem. I didn't develop proper social skills as a result. It also made me insecure about being 5'7. I missed out on my entire teen years and never partied, never had a girlfriend, never did anything crazy or memorable, no lifelong friends, and ofc never got laid. 

I graduated 2 years ago and I'm headed for the same trajectory for my 20s, still no partying, no hook ups, no girlfriends, nada. I dress much better, got ripped, grew my curls out. But I haven't been laid in over a year, with the only 2 bodies under my belt being from tinder. In other words I've never naturally been able to get a girl into bed. The last time I asked for someone's number was in Jan, she never texted back. The few friends I use to have &amp; cousins my own age have been getting action naturally since as young as 15. My entire family is good looking but I'm the only one who can't get sex. My older cousin came over the other day and bragged about these 5 diff hot ass girls he fucked when in Miami, 1 of them even being a young stripper that wanted to take HIM home, and that really made me feel shitty. Feel even shittier when the fam says I'm handsome and that I can get any girl I want, will be a heart breaker, and that I'll have to fight off advances by multiple woman. None of this is true for me but the same cousin will get hit on and called hot anywhere when I'm with him just by existing; drive thru, gym, I've seen it all. I'll never be whistled at or approached like him

Everyone says these are supposed to be among the best years of a young single man's life, it all only makes me feel like less of a man and ashamed. A lack of meaningful relationships &amp; friendships, lack of fun crazy but memorable wild experiences, shit everyone else here seems to have done and more when my age. I've already missed my golden years to begin chasing girls, and envy all of you, sex is something we need to feel generally happy, satisfied, and full. I also feel like a bum because I still live with parents and have no idea when I'm moving out, I was gonna stay here and pay for my room for my years of college (hoping to begin in August 2022 when 21) but by the time I'd graduate I'll be in mid 20s and still living with parents, and what girl wants that shit.

We kissed once, when we first met. He tried to pursue things but I wasn't in the right headspace, so we agreed to remain friends. 2 weeks ago, we drank outside with other friends. It's been the first time we've seen each other after a while (because of the pandemic), and we shared a drunken kiss. Since he has recently shared that he isn't interested in being in a relationship, I thought he wouldn't make a big deal of the kiss. 

Since then, he has already told me how he feels about me and he pretty much seems serious about being in a relationship with me. I haven't said anything back to him because I'm unsure of my feelings. Definitely there is attraction but I don't see myself getting serious with anyone just yet since I've just gotten out of a 2-year relationship.

I went from underweight, less attractive, and less confident to in great shape, much better styled and groomed, and much more confidence. I'm just trying to present my experiences objectively for context to help try and understand why it's caused such a difference in reactions from women. 

So I'm a 24 year old guy and the common consensus I see here on Reddit is that the more attractive you are, the more attention you get, the more receptive women are to you, let you get away with more, etc. 

While that has been true in places like Tinder (has absolutely exploded since), in real life my experiences have been the exact opposite; women were much more friendly and receptive to me when I was underweight and less attractive. Whereas now that I've improved myself quite a lot, I find that women my age are generally much less receptive/standoffish to me whereas everyone else (men, older women, etc) are significantly friendlier to me now. 

Recently, I was talking to a (quite attractive) woman I once dated and this topic came up and here's some quotes from her:

* ""Ngl I was shook at how how you were the first time we met""
* ""I can see why you'd get the cold shoulder from girls""
* ""If you came up to me, handsome as you are and introduced yourself, my friends would write you off pretty quick""
* ""Hot guys are hit on for something short term""
* ""Maybe your pool of people are relationship people and they assume you're not because you're hot""

I also find that I'm commonly either directly or indirectly assumed to be a fuckboi/player just based on the way that I look; e.g. before I've even had a chance to have a proper conversation with them.

So is there such a thing as women being intimidated/distrusting/put off by an attractive guy? Or by the ""wrong"" kind of attractive guy? Or is this just more of a comforting lie people tell themselves?

Anyway, I ended up giving him my number in a “what the hell kinda move” and deleted tinder. 

I feel like I can tell that he’s a genuinely nice person, just based on the few conversations I’ve had with him and snooping around his IG.

From the start, I've always had this kind of mental block holding me back from opening up and developing deeper feelings for him. I think part of it is that I feel most like myself (goofy, comfortable, etc) around him, and it reminds me of how I felt with my ex, so it makes me scared of getting hurt again. I recognize though that feeling like myself and comfortable around him is a great thing. He's attractive (to me), smart, values mental health/therapy, athletic, the sex is great (he's the only guy that's ever made me orgasm from sex alone), and we have a lot of common interests. 

But, there are also some things that I don't know if I like about him or not. He always makes us split the check on dates and sometimes just let's me pay for the whole thing and never offers to pay me back (please don't crucify me for saying this--it's just a personal thing for me--I like it when a guy pays for the bill sometimes and I do NOT have a problem with splitting but sometimes his behavior comes across as cheap?? I also always used to offer to pay for stuff with my ex and sometimes he took advantage of that so I guess that's why now I look for a guy that is willing to pay for stuff without being asked to). He is pretty messy but that's not a dealbreaker for me per-say, but it does get annoying when we always spend time at my place and never his because he says its messy. He always gives me compliments but get's kind of jokey (but he's kind of serious) when I say thank you and don't immediately give him a compliment back?  Which kind of annoys me sometimes, but again not a dealbreaker.

**NOW THE IMPORTANT BIT..**Here comes the big potential red flags (but I don't know if I'm overreacting). He spent a full 24+ hours at my place one weekend. Came in the afternoon the day before, and didn't leave until the next night basically. This was probably like the 7th or 8th time we hung out together. He was supposed to leave in the afternoon after breakfast, but he said he wanted to stay longer to spend more time with me so I said okay and I was actually starting to really open up more. Then he said he had to meet up with some friends around 8pm. We had sex around 7pm (as well as multiple times that day), and he left at 7:30pm to go home and get ready to go to the bar with friends. He told me this elaborate story about his plans with friends that night, and i told him I hope it would be fun. He also had a short talk with me before he left saying that he wasn't seeing anyone else besides me on dates, and didn't think we needed to use protection because he wasn't sleeping with anyone else either. I told him, we weren't exclusive yet and I think it's okay if he goes on dates, but he insisted he didn't want to see anyone else besides me. 

Around 8:30pm-9pm ish I go to this restaurant with my friend on study break to pick up takeout, and I see this guy on a date.... I didn't see any of the friends he said he'd be with...only one girl. It killed me a little because it actually seemed like they were having a great time. And then I wondered if he only stayed at my place longer that day because this restaurant was right next to my apartment. I texted him saying that I thought i saw him but I didn't want to say hi because he seemed busy, and he didn't respond to me an hour later, and said if I was still at the restaurant to come hang with them. He then called me and hung up. I called him back 3 times and he didn't answer until almost midnight. He said he was with a friend and wish I could've hung with them and that he just dropped her home. I told him I didn't believe him and that it was okay if it was a date, I just wish he would be honest. He started to laugh and said ""wow I can't believe you think I'm lying, let me give you a timeline of events!!"". He gave me some bogus timeline of events, saying his friends were there but walked out and he ended up messing up some times, kept laughing at me for thinking he was lying, but I stood my ground and I basically caught him in his fake timeline of events. Then he said his friends set him up on a blind date with his friend from class and left mid way during dinner so him and the girl could hit it off. THEN he changed what he said, he finally admitted it was a girl he didn't know (she wasn't his classmate) and his friends set him up but were never there to begin with and that he never made plans for a date and didn't know where the date would be. I told him it just seemed weird to me that he fucked me 30 mins before this date and decided to go on a date hardly a 10 min walk from where I live. He said he didn't plan the date to be so close to my apartment, his friends told him to go to this restaurant. **The thing is**, after he said that, I remembered seeing a notification pop up on his phone from a reservation website/text thingy before he left my place, but he had taken his phone quickly and I didn't see what it said past that so I thought it must've been for his hangout with his friends. So I still think he was lying. But, I got hurt because he didn't need to lie. I told him it was okay for him to go on dates because we aren't exclusive, but he still lied and kind of gaslit me when I saw him with my own eyes on a date. And I understand why he wouldn't tell me he was going on a date prior to that, but why lie after the fact after I saw him? 

He came to my apt the next day to apologize because he said he wanted to rebuild my trust. He choked up on my couch and said he really wanted to still see me and had wanted to become exclusive soon, and to give him a chance to prove that lying isn't like him and this was a one time thing. He said he isn't going on dates with anyone right now. I said okay, and he spent the night, as well as came over the next day. So we basically spent three days in a row together. 

**Flash forward a week later**, my best friend messages me about a guy she matched with on a dating app AND ITS THIS GUY. Not only that, HE MESSAGED HER ON THE APP LITERALLY A MINUTE AFTER CALLING ME TO TELL ME HE WAS AT MY APT AND TO LET HIM IN SO HE COULD APOLOGIZE. Literally, when I checked my call log, he called me to let me into my building, and messaged her on the app 60 seconds later while I was on my way to get him. After he choked up on my couch and everything. I texted him and told him I felt like he was manipulating my feelings and that he kept lying about things he didn't need to lie about. He told me a month ago he hadn't used dating apps at all since meeting me, he told me a week prior he wasn't seeing anyone else. All the while I keep telling him its okay if he wants to because we aren't exclusive yet. So why lie when you could just not say anything?????

He told me he just uses the app as a confidence booster, and that he only messaged my friend with the intention of never going on a date with her. I told him it doesn't matter whether he would have gone on a date or not, I guess I was just bothered again about the lying. Then he told me I misheard him and that a month ago, when he told me he hadn't been using dating apps since meeting me *he had mentioned a specific app*. But I only recall him ever saying ALL dating apps. So now I feel crazy and I'm second guessing what I heard.

I don't know if I'm overreacting or not, so I'd really like a second opinion. Please be kind, I'm really trying to keep an open mind and not be crazy, because I do feel a little crazy for even being hurt at him. And these events have been keeping me from opening up and falling for him, but I don't know if these are fair things to hold me back, or if I'm being my own worst enemy and overthinking it? Any advice is really appreciated, because I don't want to be unfair to this guy.

* Disregard for right and wrong
* Persistent lying or deceit to exploit others
* Being callous, cynical and disrespectful of others
* Using charm or wit to manipulate others for personal gain or personal pleasure
* Arrogance, a sense of superiority and being extremely opinionated
* Recurring problems with the law, including criminal behavior
* Repeatedly violating the rights of others through intimidation and dishonesty
* Impulsiveness or failure to plan ahead
* Hostility, significant irritability, agitation, aggression or violence
* Lack of empathy for others and lack of remorse about harming others
* Unnecessary risk-taking or dangerous behavior with no regard for the safety of self or others
* Poor or abusive relationships
* Failure to consider the negative consequences of behavior or learn from them
* Being consistently irresponsible and repeatedly failing to fulfill work or financial obligations

Then I realized this basically describes every single ""bad boy"" in any movie I've seen or any time I've known a woman who affectionately calls a guy this.

Also all the guys I can think of that I've known who checked off a lot of those criteria was very successful with women.

Examples of sociopaths in the media would be Christian Grey from 50 Shades of Grey, Reggie from Archie comics, Jeremy Meeks, Loki from the Marvel movies, etc.

I (M,27) have been in two very serious relationships for long periods of time and have probably been single for 5 months in my entire adult life. My first LTR (5.5 years) ended with my partner cheating on me relentlessly for months before breaking up with me. They were emotionally and physically abusive to me and l was pretty shattered by it. My latest relationship I ended because once again it was emotionally abusive. Within a month my partner was dating other people and sleeping with them (we had to live together and I had to have it rubbed in my face everyday). Needless to say I am totally shattered right now.

At this point I don't know how to gain some confidence. I have pretty bad social anxiety, which doesn't help matters. I have learned how to manage it pretty well, but the fear of approaching someone is very real. I tried OLD, but my stock is pretty love as I am probably like a 6 in the looks department and a pretty odd guy in general.

It was a success! I managed to make one new friend and we mainly socialized about school funny drama in our classes. I got to know my friends as well.
