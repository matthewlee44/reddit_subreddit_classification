3,rsc747,1640898350,The guy(20M) I've (21F) been seeing keeps cancelling on me,"I went out on a date with this guy a week ago. We had a really good time and connected amazingly well. We told each other we'll see each other again very soon .

A day later he texted me asking me to meet him. But at the very last minute he cancelled on me. His reason seemed genuine so I didn't think much of it. A few days later , he asked me to meet him again but cancelled yet again an hour or so before we were supposed to me. I was a lil annoyed this time but I told him it's alright. 

Today, he asked me to meet him again. I confirmed whether he'll actually be able to see me this time and he repeatedly promised me that he will come for sure. But an hour later after we were supposed to see each other he called me and told me it's getting difficult for him to come and said that he's really sorry for doing this again and again. I was visibly pissed this time and I told him I might not see him again. 

Tbh,  his reasons did seem legit but every single time we've planned on meeting I've cancelled on other people for him and him cancelling the very last minute every single time has been extremely inconvenient for me. 

I do really like him and I've really looked forward to meeting him. That phone call was the last we spoke. If he would've called me or even texted later to genuinely apologize I would've let it pass but he didn't. 

Should I text him or should I just let it be and move on? I'm very confused.
Also, was I in the wrong for reacting the way I did?

7,rscl2h,1640899358,Tips for communicating in my relationship?,"I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend (27) for almost 3yrs. I’ve been feeling emotionally neglected for quite some time now and attempted to communicate my feelings, but he either thinks I’m trying to be mean or argue, or just doesn’t seem to care or fully understand.

He just spends our time “together” watching movies, basketball highlights, and tik tok. When we do talk it’s about what he’s watching or he’s telling me to clean something. If I try to have a conversation, he either doesn’t fully pay attention or interrupts me as if I wasn’t just in the middle of speaking. His brother, who’s visiting for the holidays, interrupted me the same way and my boyfriend thought it was the most hilarious thing. It was so embarrassing and disrespectful.

Not sure if maybe I just need to word everything differently or just give up. I’ve let him know I feel alone even when he’s next to me, and that it feels like he doesn’t like spending time with me or talking to me or that I feel disrespected when he interrupts me. I’m always met with practically the same replies about how we were together the whole time, or that he thinks he has ADD or ADHD and it’s hard for him to pay attention (which I understand, but he hasn’t made an effort to get diagnosed or anything), or he just gets upset and ignores me more.

I know different people respond to different forms of communication, and maybe that’s why I can’t get through to him. All my friends irl aren’t really paying attention to what I say either and just tell me to dump him which is useless.

Now that we’re talking again, he tells me that he can’t really explain why he suddenly stopped and said that I should’ve initiated. I told him I’m the last person to text and joked that maybe I should also respond after a month to be fair. He then goes to say that Its my choice and I’m not obliged to talk to him and I told him “why so serious?” I proceeded to tell him that “if I wanted to stop talking to you I’d tell you not just suddenly disappear” and he told me “wow upfront”. I then said “just being honest” to which he replied “ok ok noted”.

That was his last message earlier and I left him on inbox. 

It just sucks how it feels like he can enter my life on whenever he finds it convenient. 
He replies hours later and I thought that now we’re talking again, it’d change but it didn’t.

10,rscz0b,1640900362,How to stay motivated about dating... when you are unsuccessful on it.,"I  am a 30M with a good job, own apartment and have several hobbies to do  at the weekend. Quite sporty, more on the skinny side and 6ft tall.

I  have been paying tinder for 6 months and recently deleted the app  because of the poor experience. I got around 10 matches per month and I  was able to set 4 dates in the whole 6 months. None of them went into a  second date or even a kiss.

1st  one was a younger girl new in the city, we were texting the whole  afternoon abot and I finally told her I was open to meet at the weekend.  She texted me a couple of days later and we decided to go for a walk  this afternoon. We spend a couple of hours talking, I think she laughed a  lot and we had a good time. When I tried to kiss her goodbye she  refused and after that she ghosted me. Now I think since she was new in  the city just went out with the first polite guy (clearly not a rapist)  who made her feel safe to go on a walk.

2nd  was an older girl, she wanted to meet right away the afternoon we  matched. we shared similar career profiles therefore we had a lot of  things to talk, she was quite sporty and she suggested seeing each other  again and going for sports. I didnt find the right moment to kiss her  but I wasnt worried since she suggested seeing each other again. A few  days later I tried to meet her again and she told me she was busy and  later on she told me she left the city. Now I think she was bored at  home and wanted to meet just for one afternoon.

3rd  was a younger girl, she is living in a little town and I am living in  the city, I told her she could come to my city and visit some places. Of  course she did, we spend the whole day talking, walking and having  drings. She clearly stated she does not kiss on a first date (aka dont  try to kiss me). I told her no problem, and I enjoyed the rest of the  afternoon  with her. Now I think she wanted to get out of her little  town and come to the city with somebody and I was a safe option for her,  polite, educated, not a weirdo.

4th  was an older girl with similar career profile at 2nd. I was working for  some days on her city and matched with this good looking girl. She  wanted to meet right away this afternoon. I told her I was only going to  spend a couple of days on her city but she wanted to meet anyway. I  bought a little gift for her because I am grateful with people that want  to spend time with me, I obviously wouldnt try to make any move because  we were not going to see each other again. We had a good time together  and I enjoyed the time with her. She CLEARLY stated she was bored at  home, new in the city and without any friends there, I didnt care about  this and told her that was great to match and spend some good time  together. But, Now I think, as the previous 3 girls, she just was bored  at home and kind of utilized me as a safe option to hang out when all  the main options are not available. Thinking twice, I should have  refused meeting her, it was CLEAR that she was not interested  romatically on me because I dont even live on her city, she would rather  dated another guy from her city if she had the option. I feel stupid  now.

4th girl texted me week  later, but we live like 2500km away. I didnt understand that though. I  answered politely because at this time I hadn't analyzed my whole  experience . Was she playing any game? I dont know. Now I am feeling  like shit, because I always try to care about them when I go on a date  and the very few dates I got after months paying tinder were just  utilizing me when they are bored when there is no other option.

Reading  many girls on this subreddit I learnt that when a girl is interested  she puts herself on your scope, texts you, waits for your answer and  they are really willing to spend time with you OVER the rest of the  things. I also learnt that attractive guys here have girls that  GENUINELY want to spend time with them.

I really think I have many things to share with a potential partner, either for something casual or something more meaninful. I am 0% clingy and I care a lot for other people. I am trying to put my self out there, but dont want to pay tinder anymore and my options are close to zero. How to stay motivated in this situation? I dont care about rejection, I understand that probably these girls utilised me when they were bored... OK, but I do care more about the lack of opportunities.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rscz0b/how_to_stay_motivated_about_dating_when_you_are/

13,rsd7yh,1640901021,How to get over the anxiety of being ghosted again,"Once upon a time I got ghosted by the person I was actively in a relationship with. We were together for 3-4 months and then one day, radio silence. It was obviously a confusing and anxiety-provoking situation, but what made it worse was he had made future plans with me and we had a flight booked to meet his family in the upcoming months. 

I now have a new relationship and am terrified of the same thing happening. I know it's not me, I'm confident in myself, self-aware, and have good self-esteem. But it really messed with my head and made me feel this anxiety of getting too close to someone will end with them ghosting me again. I don't live day-to-day with this person looking for signs or in constant fear, it just gets triggered when I don't see them for an extended period of time. 

It pisses me off because I don't even think people who do ghost others (and tried to eventually come back) understand how damaging it could be, or they just completely disregard how it will effect them in future relationships.

14,rsdedi,1640901483,Going out for a drink with a long-time friend of a friend: How does it usually end?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a guy (37m) that is pretty much a workaholic and have just been focussing on work and advancing my career the past few years.

As a result, and as you can imagine, I don't really get out much and me at social gatherings is becoming a rare sight, so I have virtually no interaction with the opposite sex outside of work.

In the last two years I have noticed a trend on Facebook with long-time female friends of my friends contacting me and asking if I would like to go out for a drink with them. Some of them I know from high school, others from my partying days in my 20's, some I've never even spoken to directly and others I'm a bit more familiar with.

My usual reaction is one of surprise as they tend to be totally out of the blue and unexpected and up until now I have never followed up on any of the requests to go out with them.

I might be guilty of essentially hiding behind my work and using that as an excuse to avoid any kind of social interaction, although I am also genuinely busy most of the time anyways.

Last month I got another request to go out for a drink and it was from a female I have known for some time. The last time I met her in person was a few year's back at a friend's wedding. She was dating a guy back then and I believe their relationship of a few years didn't end well and she has since been stuck on the dating app scene.

I genuinely like her and want to take her up on the offer but at my age I'm not really looking for drinking buddies or casual friendships and I'm afraid this might land into one of those categories.

I'm guessing I should just go for a drink with her first and see where things go from there. At the very least I will have an idea of what she wants and then I can decide if that is something I want too or not.

Any advice on how to manage my expectations or how to approach this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsdedi/going_out_for_a_drink_with_a_longtime_friend_of_a/
15,rsdfho,1640901565,Dating Advice for the Men on here.,"I have been dating for quite a while now and I just wanted to give some advice to the Men since I notice they have had some questions about dating.

1. First and foremost, the height thing, don't let that get you down:  If someone is going to be that shallow, then move on. They are not worth YOUR time, which is valuable. Time is the only thing here that you cannot get back. Always keep your head held up high.
2. If they don't have a car, move on: Unless you live in a city with really good transportation, I would want to know why someone does not have a car, either way, I do not want to be their taxi driver/uber/lyft. And trust me, if you date someone that doesn't have a car, then that is exactly what you will be.
3. Same thing for if they don't have a job: I don't even get onto dating apps if I wasn't working because I should be spending that time, to look for a job. Why should this be any different? How do you know that they can even keep a job, or will even work? You don't need dead weight. If they are not working, then next.
4. Keep your standards reasonable: By reasonable, I mean, don't have them too low(most of the time of what I see) or too high either. Be realistic about your expectations. Once you can zero in on what you can get, don't let anyone tell you that you don't deserve it.
5. Stop the sex talk: Ok, I get it, you want to get laid, but talking about sex right away, just makes you look desperate and pathetic. Stop with the sex talk, and no sending d%\^k pics either! The last time someone I knew did that, I was at a party, and EVERYONE saw it! Keep that for when you have established a relationship.
6. Again, your time is valuable: I can't repeat this enough. I had a date this morning with a woman that went on and on and on about her child custody hearing like I gave a shit. I am not Dr. Phil, and I cut the date 30 mins short, made an excuse and left. I won't waste my time on someone and you shouldn't waste your time either. If the date is not going well, or you see red flags, get the hell out of there. 
7. Paying: Kinda goes with #6, I don't mind paying, but if we got to a public spot and I am getting red flags, then I am splitting the check. If you already know that it will not work, then there is no point in paying. And don't do it thinking you will get sex either, because even if you do, with all the red flags, it still will not be worth it. Five seconds of heaven is not worth the drama or the hassle. Be strong.  No restaurants/drinks on the first date either. That is a bad idea and is either setting you up to either be used for money, or some sort of #metoo action. 

That is all I have so far. I don't know if everyone will agree, but just figured that I would put it out there. This can also be reverse engineered and used mostly for women too, but I don't think women are sending d%$k pics tho haha.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsdfho/dating_advice_for_the_men_on_here/

Im just sitting there on youtube watching whatever comes on my recommended and I see a bunch of videos of doing IRL speed dating like those Jubilee videos, and I'm like,"" Dude that's actually pretty cool."" 

It'd be perfect for guys who absolutely suck at OLD but would shine in IRL dating but unfortuantely, for whatever reason cant easily meet people. Reasons like maybe their hobbies and interests arent well suited for social events (that attract an equal amount of attention from both sexes), or maybe they just living around an area where they might not be as appreciated as other areas, etc.  Me, I don't like the taste of alcohol, Im way to socially awkward to dance in public. But place me among friends, and I suddenly feel like I could dance a jig or too, just sayin lol

Imagine that, people actually going out to meet people, they see someone and get interested in their story, where if they just saw the same person online on their phone, they'd probably just not swipe on them, cause they might just not register as an actual person to them yet, if that makes sense. People don't gotta sit there and wonder as much if theres anything wrong with them, cause people are actually coming to talk to them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rseik9/just_had_a_crazy_idea_why_isnt_this_a_thing/

Earlier this year I got out of a 8 year relationship that started in high-school and so I missed out on the whole dating scene and I'm completely lost. Just need some fresh pointers on getting started.

I've dabbled with tinder and Facebook dating a bit but don't see much coming from that, I'm a moderately attractive guy but I don't seem to get many matches and even the ones I get usually don't respond, I'm hearing that's pretty par for the course though. 

I'm a gamer and a homebody, even though I'm pretty extroverted and outgoing, I find it difficult to think going to a bar or something would find me the type of girl I'm looking for. Especially since I don't drink so I'd just be there awkwardly lol. Any suggestions in that regard?

However, I was only able to see her because I had moved to near her area for work, I knew I would be moving after about 2 months of seeing her, and so we ended up going from an exclusive relationship to a casual one as trying to see her on a regular basis was difficult and we mutually decided it wouldn't last.

She has recently asked that we don't see each other anymore as a result which I can respect, but I'm filled with a horrible feeling as she has told me she has seen other people since I moved away from her. Even though we mutually agreed to have a casual relationship I can't help but feel a bit betrayed, I had myself gone out and met other girls on nights out but I could never bring myself to do anything as I just felt a lot of guilt about it.

I had asked to see her for the last 3 weeks but she has seemed very on and off about me seeing her, probably because she has been seeing someone else.

Also I feel like I don’t feel like NEED a relationship in the way my friends do. Like they’ll talk about how they’re lonely and how they feel like something is missing and I just can’t relate, like a relationship could be nice but I feel fulfilled with just my friends too.

46,rsgilu,1640910054,A word of advice for the young men that I wish I knew when I was a teen.,"I am 34 years old and I’ve had relationships with some wonderful women. I screwed all of them up in my 20’s. My 30’s have been more calculated but dating is much more challenging when your peers all have bad experiences in their past. I want to give you guys a chance to not be one of those bad experiences. 

It’s all about empathy. I see a lot of posts on the sub that complain about being lonely and the pretty people get all of the attention and the complainer gets none. Yeah, that sucks. Its no one’s fault until you get angry about it, then it’s yours. You know what it feels like to get no attention. Now, imagine what it feels like to be 100-120 pounds and gorgeous. You get all of the attention and 90% of those looking at you are either jealous, horny, or both. To make that worse they are all bigger and stronger than you. This is why many women get uncomfortable when complimented. They don’t know where the compliment came from and they don’t know where it’s going. If they are adults, there’s a very high probability that at some point, someone scared them or forced them into having sex with them. We would all frown at unsolicited attention after that. So dont get offended, try to understand. It’s okay to get your feelings hurt, but don’t tell her about it. She owes you nothing. 

Then, if/when the lady of your dreams should return the attention and affection. Be kind if she decides to stop it. You can be as sad as you want but don’t be ugly to her. You’ll never be glad that you told her something mean. If you are happy about being mean to someone that didn’t purposely hurt you, you are not a good person. 

Finally, be kind to yourself. We all get hurt. Learn from mistakes and forgive yourself for them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsgilu/a_word_of_advice_for_the_young_men_that_i_wish_i/

For two years, up until a few days ago, I had a friend-with-benefits. She told me I consistently brought her to orgasm by fingering (and sometimes cunnilingus), but reciprocation, in the form of fellatio, was rare, and PIV was always withheld until we tried it once and she stopped it minutes after it had started; in another thread I was informed I'd probably missed signs that she was faking it, hoping that I'd get better at it (which seems counter-productive to me, to be honest).
She was the only woman to ever be interested in doing anything with me.
I'm somewhere on the spectrum, so family have always counselled me not to try to date, and friends have always treated the idea of me dating as a joke.

I thought the feeling was mutual because he would call me every night and we would talk for hours about anything and everything. We met through mutual friends, but sadly we live in different states. 
We would text all day and call each other every night for a few months before we decided he should come visit me for my birthday a few weeks ago. He stayed for a week and it was really nice to have him around. We slept together almost every night he was here and I thought that I had finally found a person I can trust and pursue a real relationship with. 
After he left, he stopped calling and texting me as much. He started being short with me, so I confronted him and said “is there a reason you aren’t talking to me as much?” He said “I’ve been busy. I do like you though.” 
I hear from him about once a day now… he said he “thought it would be healthy for us to have some space after spending a week together”. But he didn’t communicate that to me before he started becoming distant.
I don’t know what to do at this point. He is now leaving breadcrumbs like texting me “you are my best Christmas gift” then proceeding to only text me once or twice a day max. Seems like he wanted one thing from me and now that he got it he’s drifting away.

68,rsj4uz,1640917867,Adress sex subject early on,"Me (M32) started dating a girl (F32) more or less 2 weeks ago, and we met by online dating.
We had the first date 2 weeks ago, just a drink at a bar. The connection was huge, but things didn't do any further that night. 
We kept texting alot after that that, and we started having deeper conversations, and is obvious that we start having feeling for each other, so not just a casual hookup (which was never a option for either).
After a week of texting, we had 2 other dates this week. 
The first a drink at my place, the next day a walk by the city, followed by dinner and drinks at my place.
Those two moments at my place lead to the beghinning of physical contact, with kissing, cuddling, and alot of touching (not sexually). 
So, those two times, in the heat of the moment, I tryed to go further. The first day, at a moment were my intention were clear, she asked if we can go slower, and I said ofc, and stoped. The next day, in the same situation, she asked me to calm down a bit, and I did. After both those moments we kept kissing, cuddling and caressing each other, with alot of feeling involved. 
We never talked openly about sex, but after those two moments, and using euphemisms, she said that is a matter of time. 
That said, I totally understant the ""taking things slower"", and not beeing ready to have sex, even when we'r at moment were everything points to that.
The ""problem"" is that I'm a very sexual person, with a big libido, and I'm kinda getting scared of she not beeing like that, which could be a problem on the long run, regarding compatibility. 
Also, after those two moments I'm affraid of trying anything again, since I don't want to have more of those ""stops"", or look pushy. 
So I don't really know what to do... Should I openly talk about sex with her, so early in the realtionship, and considering it's a never touched theme until now? Should I just wait to see? That scares me, that we reach the time of having sex, just to find out that we'r not on the same page, or don't have the same needs, I don't want to do that to her. 
This is grinding my mind, and I feel that this is already starting affecting my connection with her 😕",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsj4uz/adress_sex_subject_early_on/

About two hours before our scheduled meet up, I asked him how he was feeling (just wanted to check if he had covid symptoms). He didn’t reply. Twenty minutes before, I asked if I should start getting ready. He finally replied with, “No. I’m not feeling well.” Here's how the conversation went, 

Me: ”was it so hard to text me an hour ago?.”

Him: “I haven’t been feeing well. Sorry.” 

Me: “is it covid? do you need a rapid test?” 

Him: “No, I don’t think so.” 

Me: ""Does it boost your ego to get me to say yes and then bail on me?""

Him: ""Wtf. No.""

This is when I started feeling like it’s just another way to bail out on me. Previously, he’s used a variety of ways. Out of anger, I blocked him right away but I can’t stop feeling bad and wondering what if he's really sick.

76,rsjt2g,1640919914,My ex [21F] broke up with me [23M] but wants to get back together with me. Wondering how to navigate this and make this work,"My ex broke up with me earlier this summer in July due to negative actions and behaviors I exhibited during the course of our relationship leading up to her choosing to break up with me. Prior to us breaking up, we had lived together in a shared apartment and had a very close and strong relationship. We both were deeply in love and behaved akin to a married couple, and she was very much in love with me.

That summer, she accepted an offer to an internship and I had mentally spiraled again, and she could no longer deal with the situation as it had deeply hurt her. It was not an amicable breakup in any sense, but was necessary and I recognize and understand why we broke up as I had done a lot to hurt our relationship. We kept in contact somewhat, especially given our shared space, and she had been consistent from the start about wanting us to be together again in the future.

Since this all happened, I have been serious about fixing my flaws as a person and in our relationship, and making the serious relationship we had before work with all of the experience I have gained since. A week ago, I found out she would be returning from the internship sooner than she was originally supposed to due to being fired. This was her dream job, so she has taken this hard and of course isn’t as enthusiastic or jumping right back into things. Since then, she has come back and is living temporarily with her family even though her things are still here, but does seem to want to live here again. She is firm about us getting back together, but that we need to take things slowly and she needs to figure out how we will proceed together to make things work. I’m autistic, and I am working to understand what she means but I do get what she is saying. I know this is normal when exes attempt to get back together, but it feels weird to imagine us not being serious or who we were before. I don’t know what we can do to make things like they were before when it comes to the love we shared and us living together, and I told her I could only feel comfortable with us not living together short term as we had lived together for nearly two years and I had moved down here so that we could live together and start our lives as a couple. I even was very close with her family, and temporarily lived with them.

What do we do now? What can I do to show her that I want to make this work and that I understand her? She is serious about wanting us make this work, but how can we proceed naturally and what would I be able to do to best maximize our chances of living together and getting closer to what we were before sooner rather than later? How can I best show her I’ve changed and that I am serious when it comes to everything?

80,rskd8x,1640921662,Moving out soon but thinking of doing this before dad goes back abroad? Does it seem ok?,"Me [29M] and my GF [27F] have been dating for nearly 1 year. We live 2.5 hours away from each other and are going to be moving in together and renting in a flat next week.

The new flat will be 2 hours away from her current house, and 1 hour away from my place.

The job my gf is getting, she’s been trying for a very long time to get it, and got it in the city I’m living in, hence where the idea of renting and living in together came from. My situation at home is already complicated, so having the discussion of moving out with her was stressful but as it’s an opportunity she doesn’t want to lose out on, I sort of said I’ll move out with her as we are also a couple.

I’m the only child and me and my mum have lived together since I was born. She’s always been there for me and raised me up. My dad who currently lives with us, only just came back from living abroad 2 months ago. He’s going to return back abroad at the end of January, which will leave my mum alone. He’s not lived with us for around 6-7 years as they’ve separated.

My dad is early 70s and mum is early 60s.
My GFs dad is early 50s and her mum is early 40s. There is a big age difference I know which puts me at a disadvantage.

Now that I’m moving out very soon (in 3 days), today my close friend said to me if it was him, he wouldn’t move until February and he’d spend as much time as he can with dad before he goes back. Now I’m reevaluating all this. My GF won’t be happy as she really loves me and is very excited to move in and start this on another level of living together.

I didn’t really want to move out in the first place, but compromised as I originally jokingly hinted at my GF finding a job in my city, and moving here so we can live together, she took it serious and after months of interviews she got the job which starts next week.
It’s the job she’s been trying hard to get. We were originally planning to buy a house together but I realise it was a BIG NO as we were only together for 10 months! She refused to rent as she says it’s a waste of money, but I managed to convince her and we are going to rent now.

But as my parents are getting old and weaker, and I’m the only child, my mum doesn’t want me to move out as she’ll be lonely and she says I’ll only have one mother. It makes me sad when she talks like this.
This made my decision really hard to move out, I don’t want to but feel because I originally hinted at the idea to my GF, and it’s become a situation where I’ve made her feel hurt for changing my mind all the time, I felt I had to rent.

What should I do?

If I stay 5 nights here and 2 nights at the new flat for the next month, does it seem like it will be a problem for my GF? If she’s moving up here and I’m hardly there.b",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rskd8x/moving_out_soon_but_thinking_of_doing_this_before/

What's gone on with the world?   I don't want to be juggling a load of women having casual relationships. 


I want something stable, long term with a women that is secure in a relationship.     To be honest I know I can have attractive women but it's not a deal breaker for me. 

Personally is key for me.  

Looks don't even matter to me.   I would happily date a women that wasn't considered conventualy attractive as long as the personality connection was there. 

When I connect everything about a women becomes attractive, and they become so beautiful to me. 


Anyways...   

I keep finding attractive women who just want casual with me, the women not so attractive have super crazy high self esteem issues.   

All I'm finding are fearful avoided types (seems to be the default) and I cannot stand fearful avoids disfunctional daring style. 

I'm secure, would like to date secure women or even on the anxious side of things.    

I say I don't mind anxious because my stability and personally usualy makes these types edge towards secure.   Plus anxious are open to communication. 


I don't like avoidants because I find they are terrible partners, that run from everything and are scared to communicate.

1. We already rescheduled once, and then she put it 3 days out. I think anything over 48 hours is a bad sign, but her reasoning is because she wanted it to be on her day off..understandable.
2. Today, I asked her if she was excited to see me and her answer was ""Kinda"". I told her that she did not have to see me if she did not want to, as I want someone who is just as excited to see me as I am excited to them. She then blamed her work and her kids(who are adults) and said that she was overworked. Said she would call me when she got off.
3. She did call me and told me that her daughter might have Covid and if not, then she would come. Two hours later, still not hearing anything, I texted her and she said that her daughter did not have covid.
4. We got the location picked out but she said it was too far for her even though we live in the same city. I had to go and pick another location which she seemed to be fine with even though it was almost the same distance.
5. After we got the location picked, she then said that she would pay for herself as she didn't want to have a ""spending limit"". I have never mentioned a limit or implied anywhere that I am cheap or do not pay for dates. Plus, we are going to Starbucks..how expensive can it be? When I asked why she said that, she said it was a joke. (im not laughing)
6. Now due to all of this, I am heavily suspicious and I think she is only meeting up to be nice it sounds like. I asked her if she gave any thought as to how it will be when we meet, and she ignored the question.

Keep in mind that after she rescheduled the first time, i was not able to answer her for most of the day due to being sick, and she messaged me saying that she hoped i found what i was looking for. I had to call her and leave her a message telling her i was sick and i had to go into work the same day. It seems like she likes talking to me, but is too quick to let someone go.

89,rskn3u,1640922552,At what point should I expect/ask for exclusivity?,"Hi all, first time posting in this community, so sorry if this is inappropriately formatted for this.

I'm a 23 year old guy who's been perpetually single for a while now. I've dated a bit here and there, but I keep having the same experiences, and I'm wondering to what extent it is a flaw in how I'm perceiving dating and to what extent it is just the women I've dated. 

Multiple times now, I'll meet someone, befriend them, know them for a little while, then start dating them. As soon as I start dating them, the tone shifts, and there's a disconnect. The primary thing being that I start to get invested, and they are going on dates with multiple people, which makes me lose interest.

I guess I'm just trying to understand what the general protocol is on dating, if there's a general logic to the madness. I could easily see my view on dating being at a high school level, as, when I start dating a person, they are all I focus on. The idea of dating a different person before breaking it off with this person is aberrant to me. This could also be because I see so few people. There are pockets of time between people I start and stop dating, so scarcity might just be making me hyperfixate.

But no matter how I think about it, intellectually I just think (unless obviously you're poly in some capacity) that exclusivity in dating is a given, and not necessarily a commitment. If you're not interested in the person, or you're interested in someone else more, break it off and go see that person. That's what makes sense to me. Obviously that becomes more complicated as you've invested in a person and built a relationship with them. If you start to develop feelings for someone who isn't your partner, you have to examine what your needs and wants are, and if you're really attracted to someone else or if you're just fundamentally unhappy in the relationship, but that's tangential to this post. I just think that if you're going on dates with three different people a week, how are you going to be engaged and receptive to the experience each date has to offer, good or bad?

The crux of what I'm asking here is, to what extent is exclusivity a commitment? Should I reexamine my values here or is it a normal thing to lose interest when the person you've started dating continues to see other people while seeing you? Is there a general number of dates where you can start to anticipate exclusivity? Or is there no rhyme or reason to anything and I'm just grabbing at the void here?

\- I've got myself into a casual relationship with someone I like who wants a casual.

\- he uses to text me a lot. but now days it's pretty minimal. 

\- i saw from a distance that he's been texting someone on messenger (with the purple bts theme on messenger.. so as if it's not a girl lol - i also need glasses so everything is blurry, can't see properly lol. and it's more lengthy messaging too compared to me). 

\- I know he was out during the day on Wednesday, and I saw him on Wednesday night because he had this parking ticket for Wednesday (didn't look through it, i just glanced at it). (He also had a backpack and his hat out near his desk. Lol I think that he maybe out with this on the day.)

\- He was especially warm and bubbly that day. And super smiley on the phone. 

\- It may seem like i'm overthinking at this point. But with  these data points in my face.. i only gather this because out interactions are almost shallow and these are the only things I have gathered from my recent visit. 

\- i think we've both been super introverted to each other. i honestly don't know how to talk to him. i think it's me and it's him, a two way thing, that we ended so quiet with each other. it's odd because i can be so much more talkative with anyone else. so i know i'll need to open up and try to make him open up too if i want a sustainable friendship at least.

\- verbally we're pretty distant. but in terms of actions, we show consideration for each other. 

\- the fact that i have a crush on him. i don't know what I am suppose to do.

\-  even if a relationship doesn't work out, i think i have too much affection for him to not see him anymore. seems like sex is the only way to see him. to be clear, he's not a bad person, he just make his terms clear too. 

\- i need some advice for my situation",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rskodp/casual_relationship_situation/
91,rskugh,1640923212,Some people slip into and out of relationships easily and others it is few and far between to find a connection. Your thoughts,30F from NY.  I am looking at half of my friends and they are always slipping into relationships like it is no big deal.  And seem to find guys they like easily.  I never had that experience.  I am curious what is the different between people are always seem to be in a relationship vs people who have a hard time finding connection. A connection to me seems so rare and precious.  What gives!  Thanks!,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rskugh/some_people_slip_into_and_out_of_relationships/
92,rskukh,1640923215,Can't understand women's obsession with wanting to be friends and being so entitled when I'm not interested.,"Had a thing going on with this girl during the summer for a bit, I manifested my interest in dating her, she turned me down, I didn't make a scene or anything and that was that. Now mind you this was a girl I had met a few months prior through a social gathering where we talked a bit but not much, nothing happens and we don't talk until months later during summer where we see each other a few times, I suggest and she turns me down.

Basically we haven't known each other for years or since childhood or anything like that. I haven't bothered to reach out to her and kept the discussions pretty short and straight to the point since then.

On Xmas eve I get a text from her being super snarky: ''Even though you don't talk to me anymore, merry Christmas.'' 

Big ew.

I don't get why women are so obsessed with 'being friends' even though we've never gotten to that point. Maybe it's my version of friendship but for this case we were never really friends, just mere acquaintances but somehow that's seen as such a terrible thing. I've had this happen a few times now, I manifest my interest in dating a girl and get turned down, afterwards they give me the ''But we can still be friends!''...I didn't ask? I'm not interested in that?

Personally if I find someone attractive I can't be friends with them, but again that's just me. I think friendship with attraction is never going to be genuine since it's always going to be hanging over our heads. But the sheer entitlement coming from women surrounding friendship makes me think that it's the female equivalent of the guy who buys you a drink and expects sex in return. 

Yes, I had a nice conversation with you. No, we're not going to bffs.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rskukh/cant_understand_womens_obsession_with_wanting_to/

94,rsl2ar,1640923886,Suddenly Gay?,"I(25/m) text this in a sleepless night at the peak of a weeklong confusion. I really don’t know if I’m suddenly gay or bisexual and what happened to me. 

The whole last year my love-life was a total mess, I was in love with my best friend *with benefits* (23/f) and suffered pretty much to the point I had huge depression. Till today I sometimes fell like I’m not over her. 

In addition to this I’m so confused right now with my sexuality and really don’t know what to do. The thing is, I didn’t felt in love with a man or had a crush on a specific man. It was out of the blue that I started thinking when I saw a cute man: „Maybe I’m gay.“ It wasn’t like, I want to date that guy or make out with this guy it was really just: „Maybe I’m gay.“ and it confuses me like hell. I really don’t know what I want, but I can’t get over that thought. Until this year my whole life, it wasn’t something that I thought about at all. I was in love with women and had pretty good relationships with women. I even don’t think that I get aroused by thinking of men or looking at hot men it’s more like that the thought „Maybe I’m gay.“ is coming in my mind. But it comes in my mind so often and even while I look at man who clearly aren’t attractive. Like way too old man or really dirty ones. Persons I would never ever date trigger this thought.

I life in a community/country that is pretty open to queer people and I’ve a group of friends that would totally be fine with me dating man so I could honestly just go for it. But I can’t and I don’t know why, I don’t even know if this is what I want or if my depressiv brain just messes with me. 

I‘m waiting nearly a year for an therapist appointment so I guess I need to figure this out myself.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsl2ar/suddenly_gay/
95,rsl6cj,1640924257,Should there be a speed to swiping?,"Hi, 30F.  When I just moved to a small city, I had nothing to do for the first two weeks and spent a little too much time speedily swiping on dating apps.  And I saw very nice profiles.  But once that first two weeks went through I havent had any luck even seeing a nice profile.  Or getting matches . It is like I swiped through all the eligible men, ran through everyone without much luck 😬. Now what do I do… and any ideas why this happened?  Thanks!

96,rsl8op,1640924477,Crush on someone from work. What do I do?!,"I started a new job a few months ago, and a guy I work with recently rejoined the team located out of this regional office. He has been very nice and gentleman-ly but others have noticed that he recalls small things about me, our boss has suggested we date, and we went to dinner alone at a fancy restaurant in front of the ocean over a weekend. And he paid, the bill was nearly $200. Sometimes when he suggests we do something, he invites other people from our team, so I don’t know if he likes me or not. 

Have any of you ever had a crush on someone you work with? Did you do anything about it? I don’t know whether or not he likes me but I also am thinking, it’s probably a bad idea considering we work together…can anyone lend any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsl8op/crush_on_someone_from_work_what_do_i_do/
97,rslbwh,1640924781,I don’t even know really…,"So I [31m] got divorced over 2 years ago. It was a bad situation that brought the worst out in me. I move back to my hometown, change careers and start trying to “start over.” Until about 3 months ago, I had absolutely no luck. I worked consistent 60+ hours weeks to rebuild myself financially, so my only option was dating sites. No luck whatsoever, until I met a girl and we started hanging out a lot. I ignored some red flags, and we started dating officially when she pressured me into it (being divorced, I was trying to move slow). After moving way too fast, and her expressing that she wanted to be in love I find out (not from her) that she has an OF. 

It crushed me. She was actively posting on it while begging me to be in love with her. How does anyone find a partner nowadays with shit like this? I’m so close to just accepting my loneliness and giving up.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rslbwh/i_dont_even_know_really/

99,rslds7,1640924963,Splitting bill on first date,"As a woman, I always offer to split the check on the first date because it seems rude to not offer. Lately though, every guy immediately accepts without a second thought. Even if they asked me out and the bill isn’t too much (for example tonight it was $40 total.) It makes me feel like they don’t like me. 

I know I’ve seen men complain about the amount they spend on dates on this sub, but I’m just giving my perspective as someone who always offers to split and is always taken up on it. It’s getting really annoying to me and I would like to be actually taken out once in awhile.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rslds7/splitting_bill_on_first_date/
