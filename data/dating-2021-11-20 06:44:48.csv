3,qy5mbg,1637415000,Bumble hook up...NOT (a bit long sry),"So this is a failed bumble date story.
I recently matched with this tattooed up fitness model, she was pretty hot and was looking for a relationship. I was a little worried she might be a fake but her insta  check out and we started messaging on there. We organised a dinner date in a weeks time and continued chatting. She started telling me she usually hooks up pretty quickly but she was over it so I told her that I wasn't expecting anything from the first date. 

Anyway, a few days later she said she had a long day and could use some company. I told her I could come over and she told me to hurry up but she just wanted to hang out. I got to her place and she looked exactly like her pics. We were talking for a while and then she teased me about how shy I was and told me she usually dates guy's that are more up front and possessive etc... so eventually she tells me if I wanted something to happen I had to make a move. So I go in to kiss her and we make out for a bit. After a while she looks at me and says, I don't want to be that girl again so I'm not going to have sex with you tonight. No problem for me, I wasn't expecting it anyway. So we make out some more, she keeps telling me how she wants a guy to just take her, choke her and fuck her and next time we meet up she wants me to do that. 

It's getting late and I'm about to leave, she grabbed my dick as we're saying goodbye and I'm pretty hard. She smiles and tells me she wants to at least have a look before next time. She unzips my pants pulls out my dick and strokes it, she smiles again and just says ""nice"". Then I head home. We message each other and she said she had a good night and was looking forward to dinner later in the week. 

Next morning, she messaged me saying after thinking about it, she wasn't ready to date a dad (I have a kid). 

This was my first non coffee date in probably 8 months and apparently I totally fucked it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qy5mbg/bumble_hook_upnot_a_bit_long_sry/

5,qy5phh,1637415288,Please help me make sense of this awkward situation,"So about two weeks back this cute girl(21F) who goes to my college tried to speak to me(21M) a time or two when we were playing a sport together in a group. Before this, I only saw her a few times on campus and never tried to say hi or anything. Few days later, I follow her on IG and she instantly accepts my request and follows me back. I then replied to a meme she shared as a story to which she sent me a laughing emoji in about 5 minutes. Then a friend of mine who knows I was into her sneaks into my phone jokingly and likes her last picture she posted a few months back which I think might have creeped her out or something because the second time I replied to another story she posted after that, she didn’t react to it or anything for the next 15 hours. She usually replies to everyone pretty quick and she’s quite a friendly person who might’ve felt compelled to reply to me or something so as to not be rude. Now come to yesterday, I walk into my college sports room with a friend of mine who she knows and there she is sitting with an acquaintance of hers in one corner. I head over to the other corner with my friend and grab a seat just when she hops over to us and is entirely interested in only talking to my friend by ignoring me. Like she didn’t outrightly ignore me but I could sense a cold shoulder. I tried to initiate conversation with her a few times but she wasn’t very keen on keeping it on and tried to put me off directing all her attention to my friend as if she’s almost trying to make me jealous or something. What I’m wondering is if she doesn’t like me or something then why did she come over to us in the first place when I was there. Earlier today as I was exiting my class room with that same very friend of mine, she happened to cross ways with us and I said hi to her but she only acknowledged my friend and ignored me but looked me in the eyes for a second or two. The thing is I’ve also heard a couple of rumors about this girl that she may be into a guy from another college and that she’s been in a lot of causal relationships in the past. Is she purposely ignoring me to acquire my attention or she’s just not interested in me?

7,qy5srd,1637415592,My crush wants me to buy her jewelry,"My coworker friend who I've known for years (who I'm also crushing on) recently came up to me and started talking to me about wanting an anklet. She had me pull up a jewelry website and together we were searching for anklets, and while this is going on, she's literally leaning into my arm, invading my personal space. She settled on a couple of anklets she was considering and I put it in the cart cause our time got cut short. She came up to me a short while later and asked me if I bought them, and I told her I just put it in the cart and she was like ""Oh okay"". When I asked her a day or so later if she was still planning on buying the anklets, she told me that she changed her mind. However, I wasn't actually thinking she wanted me to buy her this, I just assumed she wanted me to help her look for something she wanted to buy for herself, but now that I think about it more, perhaps she wanted me to buy her something, like as a Christmas gift or something.

Basically, I'm wondering if she could be crushing on me as well but just doesn't know how to show it or is afraid to tell me in fear that I won't like her back. She gave me her number years back, she has flirty body language around me a lot like brushing against me when walking together, she'll come outside to my car with me during lunch, and she likes to tease me a lot as well. 

Also, when it comes to dating, she believes it's a man's job to ask a woman out, and she told me she'd never do it herself, no matter how much she liked the guy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qy5srd/my_crush_wants_me_to_buy_her_jewelry/

11,qy6gju,1637417776,How can I believe she’s interested when she barely communicates during the day,"

There’s a girl I’m talking with; we’ve been talking for a couple weeks and went on a date. 

Honestly the date was a blast and she told me she’s never had that much fun on a date. She also mentioned that she wants to see where things go between us , she even asked me if we can go on a second date soon and even told me I’m the only guy she’s talking to (which was nice to know even tho I didn’t ask)

The only issue is that she’s an awful texter and most days I’ll barely hear from her. 

Example: you can send a good morning messages and she’ll replied for a couple minutes then you maybe will hear back from her that night. Which then she’ll text dry (short answers, one word replies) But she’ll love to FaceTime and when we do then she’ll be super communicative and we’ll be FaceTiming for house. Which confused me 

I totally get that we all have our own lives, which is totally fine and I don’t need constant contact (we’re all adults) but when you ask her about her day she’ll tell you that she didn’t have anything to do or wasn’t busy at all or just got bored so she hung out with a friend….so if you openly say you’r bored and not busy then maybe saying hi would be nice just to hear that you’re doing well or I’m on your mind  lol

If I’m the one who’s constantly approaching or trying to talk to you then It makes me feel like you’re not interested (so I’m considering just not texting anymore)….but she loves to FaceTime so then if we FaceTime or meet in person then she’s super attentive and wants to talk for hours 

I don’t wanna say anything bc I also don’t wanna look like I’m being needy. I don’t require constant contact bc I run 2 business but I’m also under the general belief that if you’re interested in someone or say that you are then you’d want to talk to them often to connect 

Any constructive or positive advice ?

30,qy8eq9,1637423734,Communication is pretty good - even early on,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/quf2e3/had\_an\_awesome\_date\_and\_i\_just\_want\_to\_share\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/quf2e3/had_an_awesome_date_and_i_just_want_to_share_the/)

So after a pretty awesome date, I was a bit baffled when he was way less responsive to texts afterwards, which a friend of mine agreed with when I showed her some screenshots. We'd agreed before the date that we had good enough chemistry that if the date didn't work out, we would say so honestly and would probably stay friends, but it was clear that the date did go well. Since we had to cancel the original second date (that he suggested) because someone at his workplace got COVID and he had to wait for his PCR test results, I thought that maybe in hindsight he just wasn't interested anymore and didn't want to tell me. I'd worked myself up talking to people about it, and decided to treat the date as a fluke and assume I won't hear from him again for my own sanity, though it was hard to make the mental shift. After all ""if he wanted to, he would"" is like the go-to mantra for modern dating, in a sense (not that I didn't message him or initiate, mind you, he just became more passive and replied way slower). 

So the date was on Sunday, and on Wednesday he texts me that he got his negative test results back. However, despite me jokingly implying before that I'd like for him to ask me out on the second date (considering he's the one who had to cancel the original second date), he didn't actually ask. So I again just took a step back and waited to see what he does, deciding that if I don't hear from him by Friday I would say something and express my confusion at the change in his behavior directly. 

The next day (two days ago), he texted me asking when we're meeting again. So I asked when he was free (since I realized it was possible he'd just been busy the past week), and told him I'd been waiting for him to say something. He apologized and said that he knew his week would be busy and wasn't sure about asking, but he suggested a different date the next week, which worked out. So once that was settled, I asked if I could be honest with him. He said sure, and I told him pretty directly how I felt, but not in a confrontational way - just that I was confused by the lack of communication and wasn't sure if he was still interested, and that I would appreciate more regular check-ins - even a ""good morning"" or something of that nature would work if that's all he has time for. He said he understood why I could feel this way and said that was fine with him. I asked him if he'd also like me to do that on my end, and he said he's okay with sporadic texting. So we agreed we have slightly different communication styles, but nothing we can't work around. I told him I appreciated him taking it well, and he said that's the least he could do. 

We talked more on Thursday and less yesterday, but I still heard from him, and when I texted the night before that I was going to a party and was pretty drunk, he texted today saying he hoped I'd gotten home safe. He's been slow to reply again today, but I think overall, considering I've only known him for two weeks, this isn't too bad in terms of progress. I think I'll be able to tell in person if anything has changed on his end, or if it was honestly just a busy week, but I'm just proud of myself for being direct early on. I don't want to play games or waste either of our times. Hopefully the second date goes well - the current plan is sex, food, board games and maybe some weed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qy8eq9/communication_is_pretty_good_even_early_on/

50,qyarvf,1637430576,"Have I been cut, or is it a matter of being patient?"," I \[M28\] met Julia \[F31\] on Bumble a few days ago, yesterday we went on a walk together. In the days leading up to the walk we did not exchange a lot of messages, because we're both pretty straight forward to get to know people in real life.

Yesterday went well in my opinion, we are quite similar in our views, and have the same sense of humor. There was one situation where we talked about a certain topic, and I told her I had to look up a fact and tell her next time (subconsciously implying there will be second date), which she happily agreed to.

We are from different cities, about a two hour drive apart.

I was in her city by chance because of a familiy meeting, hence the walk yesterday. She is currently finishing her master's thesis, which is due next Wednesday. Additionally, from Monday on there is a 10 day COVID lockdown again, an information that reached us just before the date.

She was planning on going to my city with two friends after her thesis submission, and suggested that we can meet there. This was before we knew about the lockdown. At the end of the walk she told me that, with the lockdown, she is not sure if her friends are actually going now.

Therefore we agreed to stay in contact and see how things play out. Earlier, when we talked about the pandemic in general, she explained that she has taken the previous lockdowns very seriously, only meeting two defined people, and not even her friends.

Now, I am not sure if this is the end already, or if it is just a matter of waiting out the lockdown (and her finishing the thesis). I know from experience that the last days before a submission date are critical and important, so I don't want to take her focus off her thesis.

51,qyawbl,1637430935,Tips for dating for personal experience,"All relationships have a tempo. Essentially, they progress through stages:   
\- Meet-Cute  
\- Evaluating each other/building mutual interest  
\- One-one date    
\- Evaluate the date  
\- Escalation to the type of relationship you will have   
So, from the Mute-Cute stage to the Escalation of relationship, is what I would consider the ""cautionary phase"". During this phase is where most people mess up or disqualify themselves from their potential partner. It is also during this phrase where both parties need to be hyper vigilant of red flags and try and avoid a miserable break up in 6 months. Or, god forbid, a messy divorce in 7 years. Here are some common mistakes people make...I am coming up with this list from personal experience...  
**Common Mistakes During the Cautionary Phase:**   
\- Oversharing information  
\- Inappropriate communication levels  
\- Not paying attention to the other person  
\- Moving too fast/too slow  
**Oversharing Information:**   
I have a theory that I like to call ""The Relationship Equity Theory"" (fancy title, I know). Essentially, the person needs to like you enough to where you're gross, ugly or bad habits are less important than the value you bring to the relationship BEFORE you tell the other person about them.   
\*\*Disclaimer, I do not mean abusive behaviors or generally ""red flags""\*\*  
For example, I have been trying for years to get my feet to stop smelling. I work in an industry where I am always walking around and outside so my feet get wet, and to be frank, sometimes they stink something awful. So, I really want to make sure a woman likes me before she realizes that sometimes my feet smell HORRIBLE. So, before we meet for the first time, I like to take a shower, spray my shoes with odorizer or whatever. Hopefully we get to date 3 or 4 before I have a really stinky foot day...  
Anyway, the general idea here is that you need to have a good presentation and build some relationship equity before you introduce the potential negative things and quirks about you. When you are in the cautionary phase of the relationship the person is still getting to know you. Maybe on the first date you are super nervous and sweaty...and take off your shoe for a second to tie them and the whole room smells it...Why would she want to date you? You're nervous AND your feet smell.   
**Inappropriate Communication:**   
People have a tendency to over communicate in the beginning. People also have a tendency to under communicate in the beginning.   
In my experience the amount and level of communication depends on the person and the situation. I have had relationships where we text/message all day and I have had relationships where we just don't talk during the day. Both situations where fine by me. The important thing here is communicate like you would in a relationship. For example don't go from never using your phone to communicating 10 hours a day on it. Communicate in a way that is natural feeling for you and that keeps the conversation going without it becoming one sided.   
**Not Paying Attention to the Other Person**  
People will tell you what they want and what they are thinking, and you really need to be paying attention to the other person when starting a relationship. They will express what they are comfortable with and what they are not comfortable with. During the cautionary period you should behave like a professor. Study the person, watch their body language and learn about them and evaluate them as a partner. Not only will this help you develop a better bond with them, it'll also allow you to figure out if this is the type of person you want to spend time with.   
Watch for things like personality quirks (like outgoing vs not outgoing), are they clean and tidy, etc. Basically figure out if you could bear spending extending periods of time with them. Someone can be hot and that is fine, but if they are a terrible person to be around avoid that one if you are looking for a relationship.   
**Moving Too Fast or Too Slow**  
Everyone has different comfort levels and figuring out when to move to the next step with the person will depend on how well you pay attention to them. If the person is dropping hints they want to go on a date, you need to initiate immediately. If you wait too long the iron can cool off and you'll lose the opportunity. On the flip side, if you ask for a date too quickly before they are comfortable, you'll get shot down and lose the opportunity.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyawbl/tips_for_dating_for_personal_experience/

56,qybdsm,1637432331,What should I do about my ex?,"A couple months ago, I ended things with my boyfriend, because we were both really busy with our lives (school and being in new places with new schedules).  He’s a couple years younger than me, and we had been friends prior to dating. 
He started a rigorous athletic schedule (2 practices a day, lift once a day, study hall, and his classes). Granted, I also have an insanely busy life in grad school and being a manager of my building.

However, I felt like he was starting to ghost me little by little, and I missed how things used to be in the beginning. He pursued me first, admitting he’s liked me for 5+ years. We used to hang out and go on dates every single day over the summer. He assured me everything would be back to normal once we were together in-person again, and that he was “just busy” and not ghosting me.

I held off breaking up with him, because of these words of assurance, but he kept not answering me, but still viewed my snapchat story and would update his own… which I called him out for, and I received no clear explanation for this. My breaking point was, one day, I texted him “good morning,” and he wouldn’t respond and kept updating his story about fixing his beloved cars. When I questioned this, he disrespected me over text saying, “you knew i was fucking working on my cars today..”

I’m embarrassed to admit this, but then I broke things off over text, and removed him from everything except text/call. I did assure him he could always call/text if he really needed me, to which I haven’t heard from him. Lately, I’ve been missing him a lot and going through a tough time, and I miss our friendship, and I want to know how he’s doing and if he’s okay, because I know he was going through a lot adjusting to his new life at school. Is it toxic of me if I called/texted him, and said I wanted to be friends again? I know I broke things off, but I felt it was the only way at the time. I tried to make things work so many times, and he would change for a week and then go back to his weird behavior.

I gave her my number we texted a bit more and we agreed to smoke together last night. I honestly forgot we agreed to hang out because she didn’t text me till like 10:30pm after I got back from the gym. I told her I ran out of weed, but I’d bring tequila instead. She seemed cool told me to come over immediately. For context I’ve had some experiences with girls who have made me very careful about consent and physical touch so I am kind of shy if I don’t know the girl.

So I get to her house and when she opened the door I was surprised because she was honestly hotter in person than she was in her pictures. I tried to give her a hug to show her I was attracted to her but I don’t think she noticed and walked me towards her room. 

When I got to her room she started talking to me about all the stuff she collects but I was genuinely interested. There was definitely a connection because I was making her laugh a lot. There were a few times where she put her hand on my leg and I’m pretty sure she bent over deliberately while she was turning on her computer under her desk so that her butt touched my foot but I didn’t really know how to react. I was really attracted to her but I didn’t want to ask if she wanted to hook up because I liked talking to her too. 

At one point, she was clearly snap chatting one of her girl friends about how it was going who asked “are you having fun and drinking tequila?” and Im pretty she turned her back in her chair so that I could she’s what she was typing, and I saw “ no fun, “ but I couldn’t tell whether she said “fortunately” or “unfortunately”. I couldn’t tell if she was trying to give me a hint or tell me she wasn’t into me. I was just confused because I wanted to hook up but I also just genuinely wanted to get to know her.

At about 1:30am she asked me if I wanted to hang out the next day (today) because she wanted to go to bed. I said okay and I ended up hugging her in the way out but really wanted to kiss her. Texted her this morning to confirm and all she says “going in to work” I just didn’t respond because I was kind of confused.

61,qybvpg,1637433766,I feel awful about getting angry at someone I care about,"Oh boy, sorry for the long story. Trust me, it's insane.

My ex (20F) and I (21M) had a fun 2 year relationship. We were extremely close and I was always good to her. On my 20th, she threw me a romantic date for us and told me that she couldn't wait for me us to hit the bars next year. Every weekend, we'd hit up every party together counting down the days. But over time, she lost my trust because she'd start comparing me with other guys.

Right before my 21st birthday (late Oct), all of our friends (including her and I) had bought sexy couple Halloween costumes for this huge party. She looks at me and suddenly says that she wants to be on break because she had a thought about another guy. I told her that jumping ship over a guy you don't know was so stupid. I didn't want to, but I dumped her stating that those guys wouldn't treat her as well.

I ended going to the party by myself since my friends were out on dates with their girlfriends. Every person at the party had sang Happy Birthday to me but I felt incomplete because I never got to see her in the outfit. I was in a Hugh Hefner costume that night and everyone kept asking me where my  playboy bunny was. The only thing that was on my mind was the thought that she was probably getting railed by another guy in that outfit. I just lost it and apparently blacked out at the party.

A month later, her and I ran into each other at a mutual friend's party. Once everyone left, she said that a part of her wanted to get back together when we were on a break and that she was sorry for pushing me away.

She starts crying loudly, saying that guys rarely approach her or just use her for sex and that she missed being intimate with someone. I secretly wanted that back too because Tinder sucks. The old me came out and ended up comforting her. I regret doing that. Idk why I did.

Once the party was over, she asked to come sleep over to my dorm. I paused, but then I agreed to it because it had been awhile since I had slept with her. When she got in the bed with me, we cuddled  but didn't she initiate anything sexual. I was going to try to seduce her, but I realised that If she wanted sex, she would've made it obvious. This made all of those repressed feeling come back and she then said that she was sorry for leading me on. I was confused.

She invites me to her apartment and suggests we cook dinner together. But, after dinner, something in me clicked. I realised  that after this encounter, we'd be distant from each other. So, what was the point of all that? My emotions just began to leak out all of the sudden and I confronted her.

My buddy stops by and I just broke down telling them that I felt sad &amp; angry at myself for not doing enough/changing in the relationship and that perhaps she would've stayed longer. He tells me that it was on her but I felt  dumb for pushing her away.

TL;DR: I endure an unfair breakup, ex gf comes to my place after telling me she's being mistreated, doesn't want anything serious, I act erratically towards her and regret it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qybvpg/i_feel_awful_about_getting_angry_at_someone_i/

64,qycb8h,1637435021,Should I stop dating?,"Hi everyone, basically I had never dated or had anything CLOSE to a relationship before a few months ago when I decided to download Bumble and Hinge on a whim. I've been on a lot of ok dates, one BAD date, and a few decent dates. To be completely honest, no guy I've talked to/met up with has struck me as someone I want to develop such a close relationship with/be vulnerable with. Only one of the guys has seemed like a truly possibly match and even then there are definitely quite a few turn offs for me (mainly that it definitely seems he loves to hear himself talk and not necessarily listen to what I have to say). I have a lot of personal mental health issues going on right now and while I love the idea of having a relationship and having someone to confide in and support me in a difficult time, I don't think it's really fair to expect that of a potential partner. Also, I know this sounds so bad, but every woman I've ever talked to who has had a bad mental health period has not had good support from their male partner, unfortunately guys just seem to generally not be good with emotional intelligence/feelings overall. I just don't think I'm in a good place right now to be a great partner and I'm tempted to just tell the two guys I'm talking to that I just don't think either of us will get anything good out of a relationship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qycb8h/should_i_stop_dating/
65,qycbdo,1637435033,This woman whom I really liked and was dating broke it off because she said we weren't heading in a romantic relationship. Any thoughts you have would be amazing,"So I dated this woman off of Hinge for a little over a month. We went out on four dates and text a ton.

First date: I kissed her cheek.

Second date: Flowers with and just a hug

Third date: I walked her to her door, and her neighbors were out. She said ""Do you have to use the bathroom,"" and me being an idiot, the sign went right over my head. I said 'no I don't.' She then just rolled her eyes and pecked quickly.

Forth date: There was a lot of excitement going into this date with a shit ton of texting. We went on this walk, and I kissed her for 5 seconds (we used tongue), but then my body pulled back on it's own). We later had dinner, and I wanted to make out when I dropped her off at her car, but she just pecked and told me ""She's having fun, and will meet up again next week.""

Next week comes around, and then she breaks it off.

We otherwise got along great. You know the type of person who you immediately click and laugh with. I think me not escalting things physically is what made her feel like it wasn't going anywhere. I essentially friendzoned my self since I didn't make moves.

I have erectile dysfunction since I was younger, and I think that screwed up my sexual confidence with making moves.

66,qyceyc,1637435312,I'm tired of attracting broken men?,"I didn't really know what to title this, there's a lot to unpack in this little post, so I'm going to try to be a clear and concise as possible. Hopefully, someone can relate or have some type of insight on the situation and a solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized I am prone to attracting broken men, or broken people in general to be honest. I'm a female and I've dated enough people to realize a pattern, most of them are ""broken"" and need some kind of ""fixing"". Unfortunately, I naturally have a fixer complex, so when these people would come into my life, I would jump at the opportunity to ""heal"" them in any way, shape, or form. As I'm growing, I'm growing to be tired of this. It's not that I don't like helping people, but I just want for once in my life to have some kind of connection with somewhat has their life together. 

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to relationships, they're not really a need for me. I'm quite independent in nature. I'm not a serial dater; I'm not opposed to relationships, but I don't actively go and look for them in most instances. When I'm not in a relationship, I've realized the dudes that I'm naturally attracted to tend to match my ""physical type"", they tend to be intelligent, ambitious, more on the realistic side, **masculine (Usually bordering toxic masculinity, having some type of emotional problems).** Usually, these men have anger issues, are emotionally unavailable, non-commital, just every red flag in the book, and yet I'm still attracted to them. I never pursue them for the sake of my health and sanity, but I'm naturally attracted to them and I don't know why. I try not to go for what I want, but what I might need. The men that I usually attract and end up with (because I really do try to keep an open mind) **usually don't match my ""physical type"" at all, have an inferiority complex, not as realistic when it comes to ambitions and life in general, so they typically tend to be the opposite of what society deems as acceptable for a masculine male.** They're usually more tapped into their feminine side. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my problem comes in when I don't really how to reconcile with my reality. I'm very self-aware most of the time. I know it's unhealthy to have these thoughts, but I'm not really sure how I can fix them or cope with them. It comes from my childhood where I had to be a caregiver to many people at a young age and mainly cared for myself in a lot of ways. I do lean towards my masculine energy naturally as society would deem, and I go after more ""masculine"" males because they tend to be able to take care of themselves. I don't need anyone to take care of me, I just don't want to be in a relationship where I constantly have to take care of them and teach them, which I guess maybe the whole point of a relationship? I just prefer an interdependent relationship rather than a co-dependent one, and the men that I usually attract tend to be co-dependent. 

&amp;#x200B;

This topic serves as important to me because I'm currently in a relationship with a guy who's less masculine than usual and is very dependent upon me emotionally. We've been together for 7 months, and I've stayed with him so long because he gets better and works on his faults as do I. He does have a lot of positive traits. He's very emotionally available, he's very attentive, he listens, he's family-oriented, very loyal. Drawbacks as I've mentioned: he's usually very dependent, not confident at all. lack ambition most of the time. We're on a break right now as I needed time away to come back to myself and heal any of my personal problems that need to be fixed, and it's given me time to really think about myself, and then our relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

As much as I want to be, sometimes I'm just not that attracted to him and I think that's because of his characteristics. I know he's not the problem in most cases. I know that there's something wrong with me and I'm the problem. I'm not super future-oriented, especially when it comes to love, but when I'm really into it, there are times that I could picture him in my future. He's not a bad person, I just see him as rather a bit immature I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I'm wasting his time, I don't know if there's something I can do to fix myself and stop these feelings and thoughts. I'm hoping someone has some type of insight. Regardless, it does feel good to get this off my chest. Thanks for your time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyceyc/im_tired_of_attracting_broken_men/

Is this a disaster waiting to happen?,"So I've been hanging out alone with my male friend this summer and we've become close and there's been flirting involved. My male friend sometimes texts me when drunk, and he asks me for tickets to social events he knows I'm going to. His friend has been acting weird whenever I'm around lately, smirking/looking at me and once have called out my name when I went by him and my friend (but I don't think he realized I heard it). Not sure what that is about.

However I don't think we would be a good couple or anything so I'm just being friendly with him for now and not escalating anything. I'm not even sure he is interested in me.

I'm going on a date with a guy next week and we're going to the bar where my male friend works at. He will certainly have a shift that evening/night and will see us.

It's more like a venting or rant. Since I don't know any other places, which I could post this stuff on. 

The reason why I'm writing this post is literally my dating situation. And before we properly start, I just want you to briefly understand my situation. 24 years old athlete here (yes, I do play sports for living right now), been told that I'm good looking and all that stuff. What is more, I actually do believe that I'm not bad looking at all. It's my attitude that it's killing me.

Whenever I start talking to a girl, I never rush/act desperate and get sexual quickly. I would even say that I tend to be very humble with people around me. Why? Because I want them to be happy and feel comfortable aeound me. However, it just seems to kill my all chances with ladies.

Yes, I do get good ammount of matches on OLD and I do receive attention from opposite sex in daily life. However, because of my comnunication style, I never seem to actually get close to the girl. What is more, what always tends to happen, the girl would always end up with a typical ""alpha"" guy or jus a ""bad boy type"" of dude. And the issue is that the dude would effortlessly attract her, while I would need to work super hard, while talking and courting her. And I just don't seem to understan that. 

It seems super crazy that someone who doesn't care about the girl, can attract her so easily. While I never have any of that ""easy life"" happening to me. Listen, Im not trying to judge girls for preffering someone else. It's their life and their choices. However, it just kills me that I always need to put A LOT OF EFFORT into courting the girl, while some random douche can just get her effortleslly. That's literally the reason why Im sooo frustrated.

- talk the next day and at night, we hang out. night is fine, I end up staying the night (pls no judgement) and leave the next morning.

I always felt there was something wrong with me, something I needed to improve but I had no idea what.  I'm tall, fairly good looking, fit and dress professionally, I'm not a player and I treat women respectfully. I like to do fun &amp; spontaneous things on dates. Still.. I always felt invisible or undesirable. Dates felt like job interviews, like I was being grilled to pass some sort of criteria and I have been ghosted many times for no apparent reason. I tried online dating and it's the horror show everyone says it is. 

So I started traveling and had no intention to date at all. It just easily and organically happened! I had this ""A-Ha moment"" like when something you were struggling with suddenly becomes easy and you feel competent at it. It is what I imagined dating would be like when I was teenager and you are contemplating it for the first time. 

It is not just dating. I made some new friends, both male &amp; female, including a lovely couple that invited me to their home for dinner when we were discussing the local food scene at an outdoor market! 

So, it really only makes things more frustrating because I live in the states and not interested in a long distance relationship. It's hard to get motivated to keep trying here when you experience how natural and easy it can be there.
