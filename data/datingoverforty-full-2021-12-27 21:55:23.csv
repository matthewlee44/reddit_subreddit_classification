I‚Äôve been divorced for nearly 6 years. In those 6 years, I can count on one hand how many relationships I‚Äôve had. There‚Äôs a guy on my Instagram page who has been following me for a few years. I don‚Äôt know him and never met him. Every few months he would jump in my DM‚Äôs and ask me how I was doing, and sometimes would make small and I mean small conversation. I have ADHD I do jump from subject to subject but I do my best to try and keep a conversation going. This guy doesn‚Äôt really know how to have a conversation and the message thread eventually goes dry AF. After these few years he asked me for my number because he wanted to become friends‚Äîthat was about a week ago.

Since I have him my number we had one phone conversation where we talked about üí© like weather, favorite movies, etc. There was nothing of any depth. He did tell me via my DM‚Äôs that his ex recently passed away and he lost his job but will start a new job next month. He sends one or 2 texts everyday and bombs we with the ‚Äúhey beautiful‚Äù  and dry texts which are super annoying. I just figured that he‚Äôs super bored and wants someone to text out of boredom. A few days he hinted that I should come visit him. I brushed off his comment and again the convo went stale. He lives in Washington state. I live in Florida. And I don‚Äôt know him from a can of paint. Today, he sends me a text me that it‚Äôs snowing where he is. I responded back with an in depth response. He then says ‚ÄúSo you willing to visit or do I have to come and see you‚Äù

I feel like he is copying my habits and following my social media way to closely. 

Been with this guy for a couple years. We are both 43, divorcees with college age kids. It was a rocky beginning but it got better for awhile. Lately I have been noticing he likes EVERY comment I make on fb regardless of the random page I made it on. He got his feelings hurt when he read a comment I made to another woman saying to basically go live her life and do what she wants and to stop waiting for the perfect man to live life with. So I asked him how he was able to see all of my comments in the first place as my profile is private and other people I know are not liking my comments etc unless it was on a local news site or shared page we followed. He said he did not know. So I went and checked and he is following a lot of the same pages I am active with, even ones he has no interest in. (Gardening, composting, science, health, nursing, even a few gossipy pages). I have also noticed that whenever I bring something up or ask him to do something he says he was already thinking that or about to do it. I told him he didn‚Äôt have to agree with everything I said or pretend he was about to do something, he of course got offended. Lately though I have noticed him picking up my snack habits (I like to eat certain things all throughout the day, like ice cream, banana bread etc until I am sick of it) I also eat meals but these will be my snacks. If I decide to have a drink so will he. If I go to bed early so will he. He is also becoming clingy. Am I overthinking this? Is this something other normal people do? I have never been with someone that started doing this before. I was new to dating again after I got divorced (marriage of 16 yrs) and didn‚Äôt have much experience prior.

 I suppose that he saw me so sensitive, that he never wanted to say it for not hurting me, within the messages that he sent me today he told me, how beautiful I was, and all those halgos, that obviously I feel that he does it so as not to make me feel bad

Looking for some input here as I really don‚Äôt want to waste our time or energy, especially emotional energy. I could use some ‚Äúcrowd-sourcing‚Äù from my wiser Redditors out there, as I have very little experience (rarely go beyond first dates), but I‚Äôm trying to be more open:

Him (well, my perception of him after a whopping 45-60 min):
43 y/o. Last relationship ended 5 months ago. He was living with her and it ended badly. Never married. No kids. He works in athletics and his hobby is creative (I like that). Not an intellectual by his own admission, but seems intelligent based on his curious nature. I enjoyed talking to him. I find him attractive: he has that combo of authentic masculinity and natural gentlemanliness that I I‚Äôm attracted to. Oh‚Ä¶and he said he finds me very attractive and wants to see me again.

Me:
47 y/o. Married very young and stayed waaaayyyyyy tooooo lonnnggggg.  Ended marriage and moved away from ex-spouse 2 years ago. Kid in college. Intellectual ‚Äî background is science and business. Was a corporate executive and now starting my own company. This is a stressful time in my life but I‚Äôm loving it. 

My concerns: it doesn‚Äôt seem we have very much in common to build from. Our lifestyles are very different. Plus, I have a bit of a hang-up about being &gt;4 years older (I know it‚Äôs dumb, but just being honest that there‚Äôs some anxiety there). I was the younger wife for a long time. 

Normally I‚Äôd just call it done right here. But for some reason I just ‚Äúfelt good‚Äù in this guys company. That‚Äôs literally the only thing drawing me to a second date. But is that enough? Looking for feedback because I need to keep my feet on the ground and not get swept up in attraction if there‚Äôs no chance this can go anywhere.

Afterwards she admitted to me that she is still now living with her ex-boyfriend whom she moved in with at the beginning of the pandemic. Since then she claims they have ‚Äúbroken up‚Äù. Due to pandemic and her school age kids, she is yet to move out. Her kids are in elementary school and the choice to move will be a big step for several reasons. 

I‚Äôm not comfortable continuing to date her in this situation. However, we continue to text and talk often. It‚Äôs a chicken or egg dilemma. She feels trapped by consistency of her children lives and not wanting to live through more disruption during the pandemic. 

We‚Äôre nowhere near the normal relationship status that would naturally feel like it was a fit for moving in together. Although I think she wants that eventually. 

We have a great ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù, and it feels like a great match. There seems like no way out for her for a while. She has committed to me that her current relationship is over, and completely non-physical and not romantic.

What should I do? Remain friends and hope? Move on completely? Move forward with a physical relationship that feels..honestly a bit wrong??

He has been on several dating sites without luck. His previous wife was a lovely woman who was a college professor who unexpectedly died from cancer. So yes, he has some issues and his previous wife set a pretty high bar.  
I think part of the problem is that he does not have a good realization of how others might see him. So, I am putting out this profile that is brutally honest, in the hopes that maybe I can pass on to him someone that still might be interested despite this description. 
He is a bit eccentric  to say the least. He is high maintenance- a bit needy for attention. He can be abrasive without meaning to, though he sometimes purposely says things to shock people ( sometimes outrageously not politically correct). And sometimes, he can be utterly exhausting.  
He is super smart. He has written books about database management and such, but he is so much more than your typical ‚Äúegghead geek‚Äù. He definitely needs someone with which he can engage in mental combat. If you are not also super smart, he will probably get bored with you after a short while.
His original degree was in philosophy with a minor in German film. He has a very broad range of films that interest him, but most of the ones he talks about are definitely the art house variety. 
He has zero interest in typical sports like football, baseball and basketball, so there would be no being a sports widow for any season! 
He loves to travel and has been all over the world. 
He has already done the sugar daddy thing and is just so over and done with it, so if that is your angle, NEVERMIND, move along.
He is in his fifties, and yes, he prefers younger women ( what guy doesn‚Äôt?).

He was working nights (temporarily) so very sporadic but great communication. On Sunday, he called for the first time and we talked for 2.5 hours. It was awesome. Shortly after, he texted to see if I could meet for a drink since he would be working nights starting Monday but also watching his little daughter during the day since her babysitter was on vacation. 

The date was fantastic. Great conversation. We both agreed we were attracted to one another. Had some PG rated making out and he asked me to text when I got home which I did. We texted for another half hour or so. We both said I can‚Äôt wait to see you again, etc. Monday morning I sent text. He responded excitedly and was with his daughter. Around 6 he texted and was preparing to go to work. 

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm confused. I said ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have to text me your last name because I have you as Joe New York Bumble in my phone.‚Äù  He HAD told me his last name on the date but it was long and I couldn‚Äôt remember it. His reply was, ‚Äúyou just want to Google me lol‚Äù. I said, ‚Äúhonestly no‚Äù. No response. So later I knew he was probably at work so I said, ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt seriously think that! Anyway. Have a great night at work !üòä‚Äù. I have not heard from him since (I know it‚Äôs only Wednesday). Was it rude of me to asking his last name? Or am I just overthinking? Please don‚Äôt bash me-this is my first ever post. Also last year, after a two year relationship, I was ghosted by my bf when he moved. So you can see why this could be a sore spot for me.

It didn't help that I decided to be back on the scene during the pandemic but... we don't choose when we are ready, right?

What I found out so far:
Increased my vocabulary with new words I wasn't even aware existed: ghosting, love bombing, catfish, bread crumbing...

Tried FWB but most men (over 40) are either married looking for an escape, emotionally unavailable or will love bomb you in less than a week.  

Nailing an easy going, light and fun relationship is like winning the lottery.  I would think most people our age would run from drama.  

Ghosting is such a coward practice but it seems to have become a very one common specially with OLD.  Respect for people's feelings is just not important as long as one is not bothered.  

Catfishing comes in second... do people assume that we are over 40 and not tech savy enough to use google images and find out the person they are impersonating?

And OLD just opened the door for all types of people and practiced so if you want to put yourself out there be prepared to see and hear things you didn't even know existed.  

I look at my 3 year old daughter and worry what it will be like another 18 years from now... because honestly... this is definitely not for rookies ü§£ü§£",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,64464,public,self,Dating nowadays,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rrm837/dating_nowadays/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,

I called it off with that guy as he had a shitty personality, was abusive, and broke boundaries multiple times on all levels.  
Well, now I am a bit at a loss as I don't know how to date to get another guy with as much compatibility as I had before. It seems I am only compatible with less than 10% of guys. I feel like an outlier as I notice all men expect me to 1) cum, 2) cum fast, 3) cum several times. I am desperate it's usually impossible for me.  
I have a couple of thousand likes in my tinder gold, and that freaks me out even more. How will I sift through them without hurting anybody's feelings? I cannot ask for a d-pick right away, cannot objectify men that much. So, I have to have a first date and see if the guy brings about something sexual after it and there is an opportunity to exchange pics. And then I have to somehow judge it from the picture or maybe even be brave enough to ask about the size. OMG it seems so wrong, I have never done that. On the other hand, I don't want to go from one unnecessary and forgettable ONS to another only to increase my body count for nothing and get more and more frustrated and desperate. And even a perfect photo does not guarantee success, there are so many nuances to sex and sexual compatibility, at least for me. I feel I might spend years ahead, searching and never finding great sex again.

Like a lot of us I guess, I have a few girls in my life who I like and they like me, nothing romantic but we get on very well, perhaps could be if I was more available, or maybe not. Never really know what the other side thinks until you make a move.

But what I don't get is when I see that one has a new partner, I don't feel good about it. They're my friends, I should be happy for them, right? And yet if anything there is a pang of jealousy coupled with a splash of bruised ego. But...

I went on a few dates over the summer, and it wasn‚Äôt a great experience, from the catfish, to the anti-vaxer, to the angry lady, it mostly kid of sucked, or was boring. My last date made up for it, as I had a great date with this lady, who reversed catfished, but she noped for the second. Who knows why, but regardless, it kind of killed my desire, and I just wasn‚Äôt enthused to match with anyone. So I took a break, figured I get a few new photos, tweak my bio, and I did, but my desire to start again just isn‚Äôt there.

&amp;#x200B;

I said I‚Äôd wait till November and then start again, but that day came and went.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I figured I‚Äôd try in the new year, and here it is days away, and I‚Äôm still not feeling it. Locally omicron and the weather (it‚Äôs colder than normal in Canada), have made convenient reasons/excuses, yet if they were not around I‚Äôm doubtful that I‚Äôd still feel like trying. When I think about dating, it seems to me that staying home or going out with friends would be more fun/productive.

&amp;#x200B;

Being late 40s my kids are teens, they do their own things, my routines as a single person are well established, I have 5 different friend groups, join social groups, time-consuming hobbies and interests, as well as far too many books to be read. Some dates are tedious, and some aren‚Äôt, but the payout has never been there, which makes the whole process seem like a poor investment.  I‚Äôm my normal upbeat, happy, entertaining, social self on the dates, FWIW. I don‚Äôt get very many matches, or likes, but I do get some, so there seems no reason to complain on this front.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve been divorced eight years, during which time, I‚Äôve certainly bettered myself significantly from when I was married. And I love my life a lot (Family, friends, hobbies, interests, etc.), but I still think having the right person in it would make it so much better. It did occur to me that success probably means trying more until I‚Äôm lucky, but getting that foot out of the door, is like nah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs too cold out.

We had a very good Christmas. She came over on the 23rd, and again on the 24th. And she surprised me on Christmas morning with coffee.

It was disappointing, but I was okay. We texted through the week, but her engagement fell off as the week went on and I felt like I was pushing a rock uphill trying to maintain a conversation.

I have been happily seeing all different kinds of men for various lengths and types of relationships. About 8 weeks ago I met a man who completely floored me emotionally out of the blue. I have no idea what it is about him but the second he walked in to our first date I felt sparks and they just get more intense every time we're together. 

But naturally there's a catch. We live about an hour apart and both have 50% time with our kids so we see each other relatively infrequently. This means that a lot of our relationship has to be over the phone and he he is the weirdest, erratic communicator. He either texts really intimate things about his kids/life or very sweet love songs. Sometimes sexy, sometimes really affectionate... and then sometimes not at all. He doesn't call unless I ask him to but won't call when he has his kids. There's no rhythm to it at all. I've talked to him about it and he half laughs it off b/c of ADHD and half looks super sad b/c I'm pretty sure that was a key marital issue for him. I know he's a good guy &amp; that he feels the same real intensity when we're together that I do... but I don't see his communication style changing any time soon and in that I'm coming out of a bad communication divorce myself, I dont think it's a good idea to go any further with a guy who leaves me feeling so unstable and vulnerable when we're apart. 

My problem is... I'm so hooked. I'm deliberately dating a handful of really wonderful men right now to learn more about who I am and what I want after my 12 year marriage. I can get 4 texts that are supportive, curious, kind, and funny from other guys and they feel like nothing compared to the one word I get from this crazy-magnet-man I'm messed up on. I know I have Anxious Attachment issues... I know I'm activated... I just don't know how to pull back and stop wanting, needing, waiting... please help me. What do I do?

I too, was in and out of a ""situationship"" I guess you call it, with a DA who I came to really really like. He has a good heart but would ghost me for months at a time and then get in touch by text. He finally took me to a dinner or two and we always had fun together. We've also k own each other for years prior to being together. Well, he got a new house and boat and would promise me that he was going to have me on it all summer, let me go with him on trips to the islands, etc. not once contacted me all summer. Not even to wish me a happy birthday that he repeatedly reminded me in the months before, was coming up. I last saw him in May (he did take me abs a friend on the boat"" and never spoke to me again after. I happened to run into him in July and told him how he hurt me. He had all kinds of excuses on why he had t been in touch as he always does. I told him I should block him only b/c this cycle needs to stop and that it's painful for me. He told me to do what I needed to do. We ended with a few more hugs and parted kind of laughing and kind. He never contacted me in the weeks to come so I blocked him. That was in September. It was just easier to heal b/c I didn't have to see that he just didn't care and wasn't contacting me...ever. Fast forward now to December, I came home from my parents house to see a gift on my front porch. It was from him. It was a picture that he had blown up to an 8x10 of me and my friend on his boat and framed it. I decided to be myself and unblock him to thank him and took a pic of the gift saying ""Thank you. I hope you had a good holiday with your kids and family"". He never responded back to me. I'm so confused. Any help as to why he dropped off the gift but no response to my text? I know it doesn't necessarily need a response but if it's to open the communication lines, I would think a ""You're welcome"" would be next. It's been 4 days. I truly do miss him and was happy when I got the gift he left. Now I'm sad b/c I don't know what to make of it.
