&amp;#x200B;

I've began to catch feels for a girl who I've recently began talking to. If I told her this I think she would likely be fine with it. We do a lot together and I've gotten to know her fairly quickly (2-4hrs a day together for past 2 weeks), most times over FaceTime because of conflicting schedules, but I feel the point still stands. I am not yet sure if I have passed the threshold to outright tell her that I am interested in her and make a more aggressive move - so I was wondering how you think she would respond if I told her that I'm interested in her, but that there is no need for her to respond right now and I'd like to continue getting to know her. How do you think that this will come off to her, would it better to just go for it altogether? Please be nice I am not super experienced with dating - let me know what you think and thank you for any responses :v) Have a good day",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhehm4/is_it_okay_to_tell_a_girl_youve_caught_feelings/

9,nhfxys,1621557659,"Like seriously, wtf do I have to do at this point [M28]","Heads up, this is gonna be a vent. Don't know if I'm looking for advice or not.

This has happened so many times. I match with someone on a dating app, we hit it off and it's great. So many common interests (music, fitness, hockey, soccer) and common values (sense of humor, self-discipline, integrity, etc.). She doesn't want kids I don't want kids (for those who don't know how fucking impossible that is to find and how much it limits your dating pool, this is huge). We're both attracted to each other, and things are fun. Our conversation just flows and it's amazing, sending long texts and bonding over stuff. We make plans to meet. Two days before our plans she just out of nowhere tells me it's not gonna work. Like... what?!

Seriously, this is more than just the first time it has happened. I prefer this over ghosting for sure, but I'm not gonna lie, this pretty much ruined my week. In my text back to her I took it with grace and wished her good luck. Afterwards, I tried staying positive but honestly I'm salty and I can't deny it.

I don't know what to do at this point. I do consider myself a catch compared to a lot of the trash guys I hear women complain about irl and on this sub. I have a lot to offer. I'm fit (rare in the US), I'm stable (on track to home ownership in about a year. In Los Angeles), I have tons of hobbies (that aren't just gaming), and I get along great with people and have a great group of close lifelong friends. I've been in healthy relationships in my early 20's, and I actively keep myself away from any toxic rhetoric which might cloud my headspace (also cause I don't believe in it). I'm well travelled, no anger issues, don't watch porn excessively or whatever (I don't even follow insta models), I play instruments, I groom, etc. I don't know many people who do all that shit. Other than right now and in the realm of dating, I'm actually a very happy person. I consider myself a good man that would make someone very happy and I don't ask for anything I myself don't offer.

I'm not sure what more I can do. Y'all can vent here or give me advice or whatever you want to do here. Just please don't say ""keep working on yourself"" or ""confidence"" or any generic advice cause I've heard it all before. Working on myself is pretty much all I've been doing to get to this point and it's all I do in general.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhfxys/like_seriously_wtf_do_i_have_to_do_at_this_point/

22,nhi6ze,1621565018,Am I standing in my own way?,"Sooo basically I have trouble getting anywhere in the dating world and while I know its pretty much all on me, I have no idea how to go about changing myself for more success.

1) I don't approach. Not out of fear of rejection or talking to someone new, I talk to 10 new people everyday through work, but because I don't want to waste their time/bother them. Maybe I am projecting but whenever someone approaches me to converse (men or women), I make small talk but inside I'm just waiting until I can get back to whatever it was I was doing. Essentially I just don't derive much excitement out of random conversations with strangers and feel that it's the same for other people so why would I subject someone to conversation I imagine we would both be disinterested in? Even if they DID enjoy it, I wouldn't be that thrilled in the first place. In short I am confident in my ability to approach but I have no desire to despite wanting to date and knowing this is how it starts.

2) I guess I would say I keep things very professional all the time and I don't know how to turn it off. Don't flirt with the cute cashier, she is there to do her job. Don't flirt at the gym, people don't want to be bothered while working out, ect. Hell I was at a bar once with friends and at the next table there was a girl and her friends talking about how a date never showed up, perfect opportunity right? Nah, I made zero moves. I don't know why I didn't. I just feel like unless a girl shows interest in me its not ok to proceed. But she wont' show interest until I do, but I won't till she does, and then it goes nowhere. I know the advice is to just do it but it makes me feel sleezy to try, like I'm trying to push myself on someone.

3) I'm typically very happy being by myself like 95% of the time. Every now and then my dating life weighs down on me for a day or two but I will bounce back to normal. I guess the problem here is that since I'm happy on my own I don't feel the need to add anyone into my life. I already have enough friends that I have trouble keeping up with so trying to add more people just sounds exhausting.

I've got some other issues related to a lack of experience and being held on the back burner by my only GF for several years but I don't feel like they are what is holding me back and will resolve themselves if I can get out there and get more experience.

Well Reddit, there ya go. Am I just an omega introvert or does it read like I am standing in my own way? In the past I figured these were all just aspects of my personality but lately I wanted to get an outside perspective. I've asked my social circles and I'm usually told that I'm great and it will happen eventually but a lack of success would seem to disagree. I'm open to answering literally any question if that helps.

Would you give up the chance to meet someone you might really like because someone on Reddit said it‚Äôs probably creepy? If yes, you need to exercise you're own confidence and critical thinking skills.

People meet in all sorts of ways, if you think the person is worth it, take a shot and if you miss, accept that outcome and move on completely.

The key is approaching the right people. And I'll tell you how to identify them but first:

**There is a golden rule:**

**If the person is into you, they'll want you to talk to them regardless of where you are. If they arent into you they wont. Its that simple.** There are exceptions but again, its the rule.

I know this is not some profound discovery but some people seem to ignore the obvious.

Its only creepy if they didn't want you to talk to them, and if they do its not. So we can circumvent all creepiness by correctly identifying those who would want you to talk to them.

Here is how:

If you‚Äôre doing it at the gym than any connection is going to be based on physical attraction alone. And you'll need them to be attracted to you if you're going to actually hit on someone succesfully. If they aren't attracted to you, and this is where the debate of NOT doing this at the gym comes from, your attempts come off as creepy becuase you would have to try and demonstrate your great personality in a focused and time-limited setting and it wont work. But if they think you are hot, then its a romantic start to a very long love story. Its all about perspective.

So here it is:

How do you know if someone is attracted to you??? **They look at you, often.** It is that simple.

The 2 girlfriends and 3 romance buddies I mentioned at the top glanced over at me several times over multiple different workout sessions. If they walked by me they would look at me and smile or I would catch them shooting me glance from across the gym.

Now do people's eyes wonder? Of course, maybe you just look familiar or they're thinking, ""Why is this guy staring at me all the time?"" But if it is consitent enough and they don't mind locking eyes for a second or two, and they walk by and smile, then its a pretty good indicator.

This is also where the creepiness comes in becuase how are you suppose to know they are looking at you without you looking at them? Look over occasionally and if they are completely focused and pay you no mind, I'm sorry, you're going to have to let that fish swim away.

So when determining who to approach, use this criteria:

**If they act like you don't exist, dont persist.** Don't approach, and dont pay them any more attention. There are plenty of gym rats in cesspool .

If there is a girl that looks at you at the gym once and then never pays you attention again then you can rest assured she wants nothing to do with you. Dont bother her.

Now if you are reasonably confident someone is approachable and they won't be bothered with your presence, talk to them. Not in the middle of the set and preferabbly don't follow them out of the building cause thats weird but if they are just chilling and resting, shoot your shot and introduce yourself, say ""Hey I like those custom shoes"" or ""How can you affored Gym Shark apparel as a college student?"" in a playful tone. Or my favorite and very cheesy line is, ""Hey can you not do so much weight, you're making me look bad."" This worked on a collegiate cheerleader (albiet, at a non-target divison 2 school) though of course, I knew she was attracted to me to begin with by her constant glancing over.

Two of the girls I met at the gym approached me. One said ""You have the prettiest eyes"" and the other went with the always faithful ""You Look familiar, did we go to highschool together?"" Both worked becuase again, I THOUGHT THEY WERE HOT and so it was not bothersome at all. I dated one of them and hooked up with the other.

Don't follow them around the gym. Eventually you'll probably end up next to each other at somepoint during the workout and if they shoot you a few glances, start talking, otherwise, don't bother them.

If you start a conversation and you dont feel the enthusiasm reciprocated, leave them alone. If they are engaged in the conversation and keep it going themselves, at the end ask for their number or try to get on a first name basis to ask for it after you see them 1 or 2 mor times. And if they say no, well you're in the same spot from a moment ago but you now have a slightly awkward relationship with a fellow gym patron. Who cares. Just don't bother them again. And don't drag it out over weeks, ask for the damn number and if she says no, forget her and never bother her again.

Most people are nice. Dont be afraid and dont be aggressive, be selective.

If you're one of those people who says ""I'm only there to workout"" no shit everyone is there to workout. Just like at college people are there to study but it doesnt mean they don't also have fun or meet people (even in classes). I also know people at work who have gotten together romantically and everyone there is obviously there just to work, not be hit on. Its just a plus.

Most importantly: **Be respectful**. Girls are great and its a man's responsibilty to make them feel comfortable and safe so dont creep on her forever.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhj70n/you_can_hit_on_people_at_the_gym/

47,nhkeba,1621572824,"Amazing date, and spent the night together , but then the 'Sorry, i'm not looking for anything serious text'. How do you know if its actually you or them?","Met someone a few weeks ago whilst out at a bar who I hit it off with really well. A few days ago, I went out on my first date with her after exchanging numbers and texting for a few days.  The entire date was awesome, we had so much in common and we ended up spending 14 hours together and everything just felt so genuine and authentic. After spending about 4 hours together, she asked if I'd like to go back to hers. So we ended up going home, even after we had hooked up she really wanted me to stay the night with her. So I stayed with her till about early in the afternoon the next day. Before I left the next day, we ended up going for some coffee and going for a walk around the park where she lived - which kind of felt like another date. It felt like this person was invested in me, we were holding hands and cuddling non-stop and she was telling me things like how much she really liked me and even asked me what we should do on our next date. At the end, when I ended up taking a cab home, she was insisting to drive me back even though I ultimately refused.  


 Without going in to too much details, in a way I was a bit turned off because I found her to be a bit full on  and forward through some of the things she had said that I don't think is necessary putting up on reddit,  and I was scared that she would be a bit clingily. But there was also a part of me that wanted to see her again. So the next day I texted her, she took about 2 days to respond to me. She told me that she was going through some issues, and that she wasn't after a relationship and did not want to lead me on.  

  
I appreciate her honesty, and for her not just flat out ghosting me. But my general perception is that usually when someone tells someone this, its because there generally not interested in seeing them again and this is a gentle way to let someone down by saying 'its not you' 'its me'.  Regardless, of whether she actually feels that way she doesn't owe me any explanations. But , I also am worried that I did something wrong, or did something that hurt them, and I've been ruminating on figuring out what I did that was wrong. Because she was the first one to tell me she wanted to see me again and all that(although perhaps she was just lying and saying that to make me feel good).I know that she was living a bit of a hectic lifestlye, she was working full time and she kept apologizing to me on the date for taking ages to respond to my texts the week beforehand.  I kind of feel like things have ended a bit prematurely and I find that it's difficult to figure out whether its 'you(me)' or 'actually them(her) not not wanting anything serious' in cases like this and I'm trying to learn from this experience.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhkeba/amazing_date_and_spent_the_night_together_but/

53,nhl0pg,1621575242,Met this really cool girl at a LGBT rally and got her Instagram after walking next to her during the march and having a nice convo. How do I become friends with her and when do I ask her out? Should I become friends first? I've had limited interaction with girls/have never had any female friends.,"Hi everyone.

I'm 23 years. I just went to an LGBT rally in San Francisco where it's super liberal here. I was just walking around and came across the rally where people were speaking. I found a really cute girl and decided to sit down next to her on the street while she was listening. I mustered up the courage to talk her and ask bullshit small talk like what the rally was about, how she found about it, etc. I then asked her name and she told me. 

When the march started I decided to walk with her next to her and we marched down SF (more like walking). I really found her cute and well dressed So I decided to try striking up a conversation. I asked her where she was from, she told me she was from Kentucky. I asked her where she went to school, she said she went to school in Rhode Island to study industrial design. Now I was really confused how the fuck she was going to school in Rhode Island if she was living in SF and she told me she was taking online classes.

Then I tried asking her more questions to find things to relate too. First she told me was doing apparel design, and I ardently told her that I knew a girl also studying fashion and how she would literally post on her Instgram story at being in the fashion studio at school from 11pm - 3am every single fucking day like a night owl always working on designing and sowing her clothing arments for school. She immediately sighed and laughed and said 'omg yes, that's basically what our lives are like haha.' I then said if her life was like that and she said 'yes' and smiled again. I then asked her how the fuck she was doing apparel design if she was living in SF and she told me had a sewing machine at home. I then asked her more questions like 'what will be your final project' and she told me 'I don't know yet.' That conversation sorta ended there and then I asked her about Kentucky. She told me her hometown and I enthusiastically was like omg do you know jack harlow (famous rapper) and she smiled and was like ""I don't personally know him but I do know of him.' I told her how I know andy beshar (governor of kentucky) and said if he was the mayor etc and she's like no he's the governor lol. 

**That was basically the end of the conversation, I couldn't think of anything else. The problem is it was totally one-sided... she didn't ask me a single question.** *But, she did enthusiatically/warmly respond to everything I was saying. But still, she didn't ask me a single question.*

Anyways I'm really into this girl and I ended up getting her Instagram before I went home (she let me user her phone to search my instgram up). I messaged her *'it was awesome meeting you. first time I went to a rally like that. I'm really lonely and don't have much friends but I really loved the positive energy.*' She then said *'Aw definitely come back then any thursday, everyone‚Äôs pretty welcoming :) the posters say 5pm but it‚Äôs usually more like 6pm.'* and then she sent me a video of the rally and '*we're here every week!'*

Then I said cool. I asked her what classes she was taking and she said  'I‚Äôve got a sketching class, a sewing class, and a business class. but yeah the march ended so now it is my sleep time lol' and then said 'good night!'

Okay guys, what the fuck do I do? First, do you think she's interested in being my friend? Even though she was kind and friendly and enthusiastically responded to my questions, she didn't ask me a single question, even in Instagram. But she did message me that video and said 'def come back :) we're here every week'. **So is she interested in being friends with me? Is there anything there? And most importantly, when should I ask her to hang out? Should I just message her tomorrow? Or do you think she's only just being nice and told me to come to the rally next week and isn't interested in being friends with me me?**

**Seriously this is important: PLEASE TELL ME WHEN SHOULD I ASK HER TO HANG OUT? HOW MANY DAYS SHOULD I WAIT TO MESSAGE HER?**

 **SHOULD I BECOME FRIENDS WITH HER BEFORE ASKING HER OUT OR SHOULD I JUST ASK TO HANG OUT ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE ASKING HER OUT? SHOULD I HANG OUT AND THEN ASK HER OUT TWICE AND THEN ASK HER OUT?** 

Please tell me what the fuck to do...I don't fucking understand how to interact with girls/build my way up to asking a girl out/initiating friendship with them bc I have 0 interactions with women.. so I literally have no idea what to do.

60,nhlpxj,1621578074,Cross-cultural dating. Should I just enjoy the ride or move on?,"I (25f) live overseas and have been spending time with this person (29m) for about 4 months. We started off as language exchange partners, and nearly every weekend, we'll plan to either study together and go out for a meal or drinks, or organize a whole day trip and spend it together. He's also stayed at my apartment on a few occasions, and about two months ago things became a bit fuzzy after a night of drinking where one thing led to another.

Due to cultural differences, his and my definition of ""dating"" are vastly different. In his culture, dating means becoming exclusive from the beginning and learning about each other along the way, while using the labels of boyfriend and girlfriend. It's common for one side to ""confess"" their feelings early on and to couple up from there, but it also means one side may go into that arrangement without having feelings for the other. For me, dating means investing time to learn about each other by going on dates, but waiting to become exclusive after both parties recognize they have strong enough feelings for each other. This also means both individuals are free to see other people until discussed otherwise. 

Obviously, I prefer to date in the context of my own culture, but recognize that I need to adapt to the country that I live in. After becoming intimate, I asked if we could move on from friendship to my idea of dating, but I realized that he didn't understand the concept of ""dating"" but not being a couple. I thought at two months I wasn't ready to have him be my boyfriend, and he had never expressed being interested in me romantically, so it didn't make sense to start an exclusive relationship. We talked it out, gave it a shot and tried to do my version of dating, but by the second date he backtracked and said he wanted to just be friends again. Reluctantly I agreed, but I already knew that I liked him, however I was waiting to see if more time would sway his feelings for me.

Another 2 months pass and we still see each other weekly. Back home, the types of activities, the frequency of meeting, and the fact that it's always just us two would probably classify this whole situation as ""dating"", but I wanted to respect his desire for friendship and never made any physical moves or implied anything flirtatious. He never made any moves on me, but wanted to meet every weekend for a day trip, restaurant hopping, strawberry picking, picnics, and he even suggested an overnight stay in a different city together (separate rooms though). Very ""date-like"" atmosphere, but without the flirting, handholding, light touches, etc. Once again, things became fuzzy during our overnight stay because we slept together after drinking in his hotel room, but the next day he acted just like his normal self, no indication of being into me, and it sucked lol. I initiated another conversation about what we are and what we're doing, and he said he ""likes me more now than two months ago"" and that he ""wants to try to like me"" and be my boyfriend now. 

I'm confused about what his intentions are, because on one hand, it's painfully clear to me that he doesn't like me that much, but on the other hand, we've become closer from spending so much time together, and maybe like he said, he can grow to have feelings for me. Normal dating rules would tell me to move on and invest my time in someone that's into me from the start, but speaking with my local friends, they said making time for me means he's interested, even if his body language doesn't say so, and it's okay to give it more time and to just enjoy his company like he's enjoying mine. It's also not uncommon to date someone that you're not 100% into, and wanting to ""try to like me"" is also common in this culture.

Has anyone been in a situation like this? I'm honestly at a loss of what to do. I enjoy making memories with him and I try my best to recognize that my expectations of dating and attraction should go out the window, but it's really discouraging when I feel like there's no progress being made and that our relationship is stagnant. I hate that sex is what had to lead to us having serious conversations about what we are, but if we didn't cross that certain line, I feel like I'd still be second guessing if he found me attractive, let alone liked me.

So, should I move on from this situation, or is it worth hanging on a for a bit more to see where things go?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhlpxj/crosscultural_dating_should_i_just_enjoy_the_ride/
61,nhlrxc,1621578296,I don't know if I am being ghosted.,"So I met this girl at the beginning of the semester, she messaged me on Discord asking about homework in the class we were in. We end up in a voice call and spoke about homework for 15 minutes and then spoke about each other for the next seven hours. We continued to talk all throughout the semester and it was great, we had all the same classes so we could complain about the professors all we wanted.


We finally met in person and we both had a great time on our first date at a bar. We continued to talk and went out on about 5 dates or so. 2 of those meeting each other's parents, as we lived both lived at home. Fast forward to the end of the semester, we were both set to graduate and stressing about what's going to happen afterwards. She became a little distant, when I asked her about it. She said she needed to focus on school and didn't have time to casually date. I totally understood and agreed to give her space, and we stopped texting everyday. I would just check in every once in a while. Well about two weeks after that, her friend was having a birthday party and she had invited me to it beforehand. She still wanted me to go with her to the party but she was very distant, basically acting like we had come to the party separately and hadn't met before.



 I drove her home and asked her about it and she said that we needed to slow our roll and that we should just be friends for the next two weeks until school ends. I agreed and asked about the two weeks thing, assuming we would talk after graduation. I didn't talk to her after that conversation, until the next week asking if she wanted to go to a wedding out of state. She again said she planned to talk to me after school was over but said she couldn't go on a road trip as she would be looking for a job. I understood the reasoning. Well come graduation day and I didn't even get any message from her. I texted her Congratulations and I got no response. Then we had an in person event after virtual graduation and she didn't make any effort to come see me or communicate with me that day. Granted neither did I, I figured she wanted the space although I am now wishing I at least made some effort to see her that day. I then texted her again, and asked her how she was doing and I still got no response. It's only been a week from graduation and she is starting a full-time job that she was doing through the school, so I don't know if that has something to do with it.



It's not something I would have expected after all we did together. Neither of us are super experienced in dating, she and I have both had only 1 serious relationship beforehand. But it's making me feel awful, I really like her and this just sucks. This is sort of a rant to put my feelings out there but also looking to see what you guys think. I am really bad about initiating phone calls, I rarely ever do it unless someone asks me to. So should I wait a little bit and maybe life will settle down since it hasn't been long since graduation? Should I send her a text asking for an explanation? Should I call her and she if I can I have a conversation? I am just lost on what to do at this point and I don't want to lose her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhlrxc/i_dont_know_if_i_am_being_ghosted/

And I‚Äôll tell ya what, the mental health of most of the dudes I meet online (Hinge)...is like, strange.

Had dinner cocktails with a 10/10 (in my book) who asked me out again but never followed through on the second date. One guy went for the booty call (noped out) and another I just conveniently blew off. Another admitted to being disabled far too along in the process, though I still told him we should juju those disabled Tag privileges. IDK, he‚Äôs an attorney so maybe the joke wasn‚Äôt funny. 

And then earlier tonight, after a couple days of nice conversation and a dinner date arranged for tomorrow, guy just losses his shit going on a rant about how he‚Äôs almost been duped by the transgender/pan-sexual ‚Äúpredators.‚Äù Like dude, how deep is your fucking paranoia that you think I‚Äôm also a dude?

Now, I get that being your friend, it might just be weird, but really hem up the hypothetical. You're not hitting on them. Keep their mind on if you were a stranger approaching them.

He was very reluctant but his mom (who has end-stage cancer) had a temper fit and ended up in the hospital. For history, she blames her cancer on him for the times he didn't listen to her growing up.

He's unemployed and depressed (MDD) and not medicated well right now. China has relatively few resources for depression. He has promised his father he will not marry this girl, but who knows if he can be pushed into it. They are wealthy, perhaps a reason that they are tight-leashing him.

We had chatted most days before meeting and he was very positive, ""super liked"" me etc. When we met up at the bar, he continued to be complimentary, there were no awkward pauses in conversation, and we got on really well.

When the bar closed, we went to mine though I made this clear it wasn't for sex. We continued to chat, eat, kiss, watch Netflix and generally have a nice time then he got an Uber home after we'd spent ~8hrs together. He messaged me when he got home that he'd had a great time. I said I did too. 

He hasn't messaged since. I sent him something midweek just asking if he was ok, then yesterday a non-confrontational message saying it's fine if he doesn't want to keep dating but would be good if he could just say so. Radio silence. He hasn't blocked/unmatched me or anything just zero replies.

I... Have no idea what's going on with this. If he's not interested, I don't understand why he spent such a long time with me (would have been easy to leave after the bar?!) and complimented and kissed me etc. If he just wanted sex, why would he say he wants something serious in his bio, and also have been completely fine with me saying we wouldn't have sex at mine and didn't try to pressure me.

I guess this is a vent/advice post? Tldr at the bottom. I (25F) had a date last night with a girl ‚ÄúHeather‚Äù (26F) that I met on tinder about a week ago. For background, I‚Äôm bi, her profile says she‚Äôs demi sexual, demi romantic so I know what I‚Äôm getting into. We‚Äôre vaccinated. 

We‚Äôve been talking for the last week, it‚Äôs been great, we have a ton of the same interests and some cool coincidences where our lives have intersected and we didn‚Äôt even know it. First date was today, we met for coffee/lunch. We spent an hour talking, the time flew by and I had a good time. I enjoyed talking with her even though she did talk a fair bit about herself so I wasn‚Äôt able to talk as much. She talked about some pretty personal stuff which I was kinda uncomfortable with but I figured she was nervous. She talked about the fact that she smokes weed, no big deal to me, I knew this from her profile. I explained that I don‚Äôt smoke anything, cigarettes, vape, weed, etc. I don‚Äôt want to inhale anything into my lungs. We talked about my experience with other things like edibles etc which is somewhat limited. When we are leaving she asks me if wanna hang out tonight and I said yes cause we wanted more time to talk and get to know each other better. I thought she said her roommates wouldn‚Äôt be home so it could be more one on one.

I arrive at 8, meet her pets. I notice that her two roommates (Sarah &amp; Beth) are there so I meet them, Sarah is pretty out of it, sleeping on the couch. We go back to Heather‚Äôs room, I notice that she is a lot calmer than she was earlier today, not really exuding the same kind of energy as before, I expected they had smoked earlier so the vibe is just different.  Heather sits on the floor with me and is eating something she had picked up for dinner, I didn‚Äôt bring anything so it felt kinda awkward to just sit there and watch her eat. Then Beth just comes in and sits on the floor with us and starts talking to Heather. Beth apologizes for interrupting as they talk about dyed hair care, something I don‚Äôt have any input on. Then Sarah comes back and sits down too. They are talking to me some as well but there‚Äôs not a lot of rapport since we met like 5 minutes ago and I thought I was here to hang out with Heather. They are also talking about various times they have gotten high, people that they hang out with, and inside jokes which I couldn‚Äôt really respond to. 

I felt just really uncomfortable, they weren‚Äôt ignoring me exactly but I mean they are having conversations about weed and other drugs that I don‚Äôt really have input on. And they have clearly been friends for years and have inside jokes and everything which is fine but obviously I don‚Äôt find it as funny. Beth leaves to go to the store and then Heather asks Sarah if she wants to get high. So we go back to Heather‚Äôs room while they do that and I‚Äôm just kinda sitting there, they don‚Äôt offer me anything even though I would‚Äôve likely declined if they had offered. They are smoking a fair bit, not only weed but they are pulling from the vape frequently and there‚Äôs also incense and candles burning, it was stuffy in there so I was kinda dying. Then they want to watch YouTube vine compilations so we do that. Sarah is laying on the floor laughing her head off, I‚Äôm getting bored but I don‚Äôt want to be rude and just look at my phone. Me and Heather don‚Äôt really talk about much of anything the entire time, we talk about some of our interests a bit but the roommates are also there so it‚Äôs like I have to reexplain anything that I say cause they have no background.

After leaving, I just feel really odd about it, like I guess I didn‚Äôt realize how weed is like a major major part of her life since we didn‚Äôt talk about it at all for the last week. I just feel like it‚Äôs kinda rude to be actively smoking while on a ‚Äúdate‚Äù with someone you said you wanted to get to know. It would be like I had showed up and she was drunk off her ass. I don‚Äôt know where to go from here, I guess tell her it‚Äôs not gonna work out? Should I explain that I was kinda insulted by being ignored the entire time or maybe I just completely misread the situation? I had wanted to get to know her better.

Tldr: second date with a girl, thought it was gonna be a time to get to know each other better. She ends up getting high with her friends/roommates and ignoring me to talk about things I have no input on. How do I tell her I was uncomfortable?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhq9u0/i_felt_insulted_am_i_overreacting/

My law degree has been infinitely easier than trying to attract any woman. I've tried every free dating app but never got a match. Joined social clubs at college.

93,nhqk7y,1621597704,How can I let go of my timeline expectations when dating?,"I‚Äôve always chalked up my dating behaviour to me not knowing how to commit, but I have recently realised that I‚Äôm not afraid to commit to a relationship. I just have an idealistic timeline in my head on how a relationship should progress. 

I think I‚Äôm subconsciously influenced by how my parents and my cousins have had typical romantic relationships.  They were first friends then they spent a lot of time together and finally, went out on dates and it became progressively intimate. 

That‚Äôs just how I‚Äôve viewed my ideal relationship even though I‚Äôve seen people around me get into relationships in a much shorter timeline and are still very much happy in their relationships.

This has caused me to push away people I‚Äôve dated (and am dating). For example, I‚Äôve been seeing my old-time friend and he made a move on me after the third date. In my head, I thought, ‚Äúoh this is too fast. This means he‚Äôs not being serious‚Äù even though I feel the chemistry. Things like that that make me believe that the relationship is not meant to be because it‚Äôs ‚Äúhappening too quickly‚Äù. 

Any tips on how to get over thus mental barrier? I‚Äôve seen it happen over and over again and I know it‚Äôs just causing me to push away people I could‚Äôve been good with.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhqk7y/how_can_i_let_go_of_my_timeline_expectations_when/

95,nhqvax,1621598693,Attraction vs Compatibility,"It seems like the girls I have the best conversations with are the ones I'm not very attracted to. I can have a conversation with them for hours and not get bored. I've dated them before and always lose attraction to them after a period of time.

The girls I'm attracted to always have the same dull personality and boring conversations. These relationships never go much farther than a couple hook ups. Theres really nothing for either of us to do after that.

I just want to have my cake and eat it to. I just want an average looking girl who knows how to talk to people.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nhqvax/attraction_vs_compatibility/
