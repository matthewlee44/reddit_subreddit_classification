I understand your first is the hardest to get over and I think I'm pretty over it and honestly just wanting to start a new connection with someone but its proving harder than I originally thought.

My question- is there some place that is really good at getting in touch with people and actually having a conversation with them. I've tried tinder, okcupid, and gametree but I never seem to match with anyone and when I do the conversation lasts about three message &gt;.&gt;
My other question- is there any discord groups 18+ that is used for dating because I'd love to just connect with someone and chat. I honestly just want to talk to someone.

We already established a sexual relationship but never actually had sex due to our living situations, we both live at home and couldn't find a time to actually ever be alone to have sex.

So I (M,24) recently had to go get some new glasses from the eye doctor. And at the front desk was this new woman who was new since I‚Äôve last been there (this was NOT the eye doctor herself).

So fast forward to yesterday and I went to go pick up my glasses. I walked in and she greeted me by name, which I almost never get. When she handed me my glasses she also handed me a fairly nice coffee mug (not that fake plastic shit, like good quality, plus it was free) and said that I‚Äôm welcome back anytime just to hang (it‚Äôs a small place, not a chain store)

X lives miles and miles away from me. We've been texting for almost three months now, no calls. Is that a red flag? Probably. But the introvert in me uncomfy with calls too. We send pictures, occasional voice memos, but that's about it. The chats are great though‚Äîthe banters, the flirting.

All my relationships have been agonizing, toxic and tumultuous. I started crushing on this guy. And somehow the thought of them doing nice things for me in the beginning makes me feel sick and undeserving. I saw a post about how a girl's boyfriend paid for all her hardcovers. And I was imagining being in that situation and wanting to cry/retreat/ reject such treatment. I don't want small talk. I don't want you to be formal with me. I don't want you to buy me things or listen to my favorite songs or introduce me to your family. I don't want you to wear nice cologne, or compliment me or give me heart warming smiles. 

I just want you to realize how f***** I am. From trauma. From my mom making me feel extremely guilty very often when she bought me things. I just want to cut the formal bs and get straight to the part where you cuddle me. I don't want you to do nice things for me. I don't want effort. Just comfort and compassion. And I realize how dysfunctional this is/sounds. I realize any stable person wouldn't want to do this. I realize I'm an adult and no one is going to soothe or coddle my wounded inner child. I realize that as confident as I am, that no one is going to swoop in and save me from the demons that take hold periodically. No one is going to hold me and shield me against the self doubt, paranoia, suicidal ideation, wondering if my friends hate me behind my back. No one is going to be tender towards the hurt part of me. The part that bleeds. I'm expected to be stable and healed before I engage in a relationship. Before anyone will ever want me. 

As much as I both disagree and agree with that idea. Don't formally try to impress me. Don't buy me things or worry about how you come off to me. Don't dress up, don't spend money you don't have on me, don't drive me to the river. Just hold me close to your chest. I won't tell you that I secretly had a bad impulsive episode and that if I owned a gun, I'd probably be dead because the pain caused me to go for it in the spur of the moment.

34,ov1jmj,1627709481,I have no social life or dating options. Need advice.,So I‚Äôm 22 years old. Almost 23. And I‚Äôve got 3 friends. When I was 19. My mother sold our house and Bought a place in the big city about a 1 hour drive from our home town. It‚Äôs still close enough for me to catch up with friends. But the thing is when I made this move most of the friends I had slowly drifted and now we don‚Äôt even keep in contact anymore. I used to have a fairly abundant social life. (Given most of these friends were probably fake) but in saying that it gave me something to do and some excitement in my life either way because I was able to attend more social events and things like that. I chose to move with my mother because I couldnt afford to rent at the time and I wanted to be closer to my family anyway. It‚Äôs now been 3 years since moving. And the 3 friends I still have I hardly ever see. One of them still lives a social life of abundance. And is usually hanging with other crowds that we are not mutually friends with. The other 2 seem to be in the same boat with virtually no friends. The problem is I try to catch up with these guys when I can but most of the time they aren‚Äôt that interested in doing anything or seeing me. They just live in their own little bubble as do I but we talk everyday over social media and things like that. If we lived closer I‚Äôm sure we would catch up regularly. But because of the distance it‚Äôs quite rare. It‚Äôs depressing. I‚Äôm a fairly busy guy. I have a career and work full time. Trying to save for a deposit on a house. I workout frequently and I‚Äôm in great shape. And I know I‚Äôm on the right path to success but I just feel my social life is really lacking. Weekends get so lonely. I rely on tinder and other dating apps to meet girls. Because I feel I have almost no other way of meeting them due to having no social life. Sometimes I feel like finding a girlfriend can solve this issue as it gives me someone to hang out with. I‚Äôve dated a couple girls since living here which made me feel less lonely temporarily. But they didn‚Äôt last. it‚Äôs hard when relying on dating apps as I am able to get one night stands easy enough but to find a girl I would actually like to settle down with is very tough. I also would like to make new friends but I feel at my age it is very hard. Most people have their circle already figured out and don‚Äôt just welcome outsiders like myself.

My standards were so strict ‚Äúphysically‚Äù but now I‚Äôm not like that anymore. I lowered my standards but now I think they‚Äôre too low. 

Now that I‚Äôm a teenage boy, I find myself giving anybody a chance. I was taught that as long as one is a good yet, sensible person, I should try them out because you never know what may happen.  

Is that a good thing? Because now I think I am having trouble distinguishing whether some one is ‚Äúcrush worthy‚Äù or just a friend. 

I always find myself in a quotidian  pattern of being ‚Äúin love‚Äù with a girl or guy who shows some act of kindness-I‚Äôm already thinking about a wedding‚Ä¶ 

Then I get over them and find someone else to have a crush on. This crush could be 4 years or 2 years or even a few months. However, I always find that it takes less than a day to get over anybody.  

Currently, I‚Äôm interested in a girl who shares the same music taste as me and is generally pretty friendly. But I don‚Äôt even know if I should pursue her because I feel it would be the same with how I feel with literally anybody that I would have a crush on.

Tbh I feel like we are both mentally ill people going through a bipolar manic high. (I‚Äôm exaggerating but yeah$ 

I (20F) met this guy (25M) a month ago, we‚Äôve been on 3 dates already and had sex the first date. It was weird, the connection was instantaneous, he brought up that if I was open to to something serious after Sex during the first date because he was looking for that. I just said I‚Äôm open but I would really like to get to know the person first. Sex is amazing, the chemistry is crazy. 

The second date it was so wierd, we were so ourselves, no awkwardness, I even was peeing in the bathroom and he wanted to come in to talk, because I was taking my time lol. He said that even though we don‚Äôt really no each other it feels like we knew each other for years. I felt that too!

Regardless I‚Äôm trying to pull the breaks. I don‚Äôt want to go too fast, I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs love bombing, it feels like actual friendship. Still skeptical, it‚Äôs too soon to see this is stick.

The third date we were having sex and I was just thinking about saying I love you over and over in my head. It was more climaxing thing, but damn I really wanted to say it. I really like him obviously don‚Äôt love him yet. 
‚Äî-
Well he‚Äôs in the navy, and he went out to sea today, he‚Äôs gone for 3 weeks. I don‚Äôt mind, I work in accounting and it‚Äôs going to get busy in August, I got finals, and many birthday parties I have to attend. So this is really good timing. 

Other thing is I am a huge gift giver , just ask my ex all the gifts I gave him, hell ask any of my friends, I‚Äôm the type of person that can not come empty handed to a house. 

Well anyway, he showed me his nerd secret obsession with coins lol and he is turning 25 while he‚Äôs at sea. I got I‚Äôm a cute coin- nothing excessive.

I wondering if this wierd though, like giving him a gift so early. 

I also really want to start blurting out I love you during sex, I don‚Äôt care if we are not official, I just have the tendency to say that. The urge is strong 

Sorry for all the irrelevant details- this is kinda like venting for me.

TLDR: is it wierd to say I love while climaxing on the fourth date. I don‚Äôt want him to think I‚Äôm crazy, nor I want him to see it as sign to take the relationship at a faster pace. I‚Äôm really worried about saying it by accident if it‚Äôs too soon. I‚Äôve never said I love you first- it‚Äôs just sex thing!

And miss me with that ‚Äúwell life isn‚Äôt fair,‚Äù I know that and I don‚Äôt want to hear that because if you were a gay POC instead of a white one you would feel the same way I do. Honestly I think if most white gays, especially the ones who are ‚Äúwhites only‚Äù woke up one day as black they would off themselves. Wouldn‚Äôt last a day. I‚Äôve put a lot of work into my looks, going to the gym, mental health, etc and I‚Äôll never compete with a white guy. I love my culture and being black, but honestly I sometimes wish I was a white gay because things would be so much easier.

65,ov43zi,1627723332,What to make of guy who always initiates texting but you‚Äôre always initiating meeting? And is he beginning to lose interest in meeting to?,"So I‚Äôll  sum up our history thus far and then sum up our current situation.  

This guy (M25) and I (F23) have been talking for about two months now.  And we‚Äôve met like 3 times by now.  Our first meeting was end of June because I‚Äôd been out of our home state on vacation for most of that time.  He has always consistently texted me.  We send good morning and goodnight texts regularly.  He used to double text me his good morning (and still sometimes does) if I procrastinated responding to a previous day‚Äôs message.  Even when I traveled back home from the aforementioned trip he texted me safe flight and to let him know when I made it.  Basically whenever a convo ends he‚Äôd pick it up even with just a simple how‚Äôs your day going or asking or sharing about one of our days.  Another thing that stood out is him always going out of his way to reply to my Snapchat stories saying I‚Äôm cute or pretty (and everyone I showed that too said he‚Äôs pretty into me if he responds to all my stories).  

I was the first to suggest grabbing coffee when I‚Äôm back in town the first time.  We both mutually planned in advance.  At the end, he said he can‚Äôt wait to hang again and apologized for being chatty due to nervousness.  And when I said I didn‚Äôt even realize he was nervous he said he definitely was because of how pretty he found me.  We maintained talking every day but I reinitiated by telling him days I was free.  He promptly planned a lunch meetup with me, and we both talked a lot while eating and walking around afterwards.  He even quick hugged me and told me to let him know when I get home.  We again would text every day.  It was a few days after he revealed something that would be a dealbreaker for a relationship to me that I said I want to be fwb/casual daters.  And there was basically understanding for wanting both physical and emotional intimacy but without strings attached, and that if either of us caught deeper feelings we communicate.  Another thing that stood to me is when I told him we should kiss/make out before considering sexual stuff down the line, he told me he wanted to kiss me during the second time but didn‚Äôt know how I felt.  

Anyways things probably changed a week after that.  Something happened in his family that he couldn‚Äôt go into detail about.  I decided to give him space when he first revealed, and I was surprised when the next day he continued with texting me good morning, and for the next few days he was trying to keep convo going even though it was obvious he had little mental energy.  I remember having to ask him if he‚Äôs ever going to be able to hang and making it clear I understand if not but want to know how to proceed from here.  He said ‚Äúmaybe later this week just to give me more time.‚Äù  And as the week progressed I again initiated by telling him days I was free.  But again he enthusiastically agreed and properly planned hanging at the movies.  

His behavior at the theatres was particularly confusing.  So we were sexting for the first time that week, and talked about making out and feeling each other while we were cuddling during the movie.  At the theater, it was me that initiated the cuddling.  But he didn‚Äôt feel me during it as we teased over text.  He also seemed dull, but he did apologize for being low energy-explaining how he didn‚Äôt sleep or eat well before coming.  And would chat a lot during the movie about what was going on.  And he walked me to the car and initiated a kiss at the very end, but  turned out to be only a quick peck.  And again told me to text him once I got back home.  And again we still text regularly, and in fact just a week ago he again replied to a Snapchat story about my selfie being very pretty (making me assume and hope he still is physically attracted to me).  

Now today after sexting I basically chose to ask about willingness to hookup in person.  The sexting seemed enjoyable and to go well on both our ends.  He said he‚Äôs definitely down for hooking up  in person.  I addressed how he didn‚Äôt feel me or make out last time despite our prior text convos and prefaced that is why I wasn‚Äôt sure how he felt about hooking up in person.  He was just like ‚ÄúHaha idk I just was a little off that day sorry.‚Äù  I decided to hint by telling him I‚Äôm available this coming weekend and following weekdays or week after next.  And that I‚Äôll have to check my schedule when I start working my new job.  He responded ‚ÄúI can't this Sunday sorry. I need to start working too‚Äù (in reference to job hunting-yes mind you he doesn‚Äôt even have a job yet at the moment) and he didn‚Äôt acknowledge the coming free weekdays.  But he said week after next is probably best.  All he said is ‚Äúok no problem‚Äù to a message about protection if we get to doing it.  I concluded with ‚ÄúOk sweet lmk when you want to do it or hang next and we can figure details and all‚Äù to basically leave the ball in his court.  And he said ‚Äúok sounds good‚Äù and then changed the subject.  Despite his initial enthusiasm while we sexted, he came across as dry and not too keen to me and one of my friends who saw this convo, when it came to me discussing actually hanging again and doing it in person.  Thing is, he sometimes texts in detail and sometimes texts short and to the point, but the latter doesn‚Äôt always strike me as dry. 

If you‚Äôve read this far, thank you!  I‚Äôm basically wondering if the fact that he initiates texting but has never initiated the times we hung out a sign he‚Äôs just using me as an ego boost of a backup to someone he‚Äôs more interested in.  But would someone using me as an ego boost really excitedly make proper plans in advance, text consistently, and ask abt my day and keep proper convo going throughout?  Could his shift in energy have to do with things he‚Äôs dealing with in his life?  Or is it just that maybe his tone can‚Äôt be read properly over text and I should just see if he keeps being consistent and follows through on meeting up again?  I‚Äôm really into him, tho in a casual dating/fwb sense (since I don‚Äôt see future compatibility), but I‚Äôm wondering based on all the info about past and current if he really is into me (like attraction wise) the same way or not.  How should I proceed from here really?

You can glean the story from my profile, but I was falsely accused of rape when I was in college. I was cleared by the local DA and my school but the incident left horrible psychological scars on me.

Recently, I started seeing this really nice girl. However, like most of my relationships when they start to get serious, I find myself getting serious anxiety whenever I think about this incident. I told one previous romantic partner about it and while it went decently well and we still sporadically keep in touch, the relationship ended 2 months after I told her and I can't help but think this had somethign to do with it.

Tonight after our date, my girlfriend noticed something was wrong. I told her that there was some stuff in my past that was hard to talk about. She asked if I killed or r^ped anybody. I was a bit taken aback by the latter, but I said no because I have not raped anybody and she said that then anything else could be worked through.

80,ov5wtm,1627732899,Can people explain to me why I see a disturbing amount of early 20's just giving up?,"This is a disturbing trend I've noticed lately that always plays out the same way. Early 20 something man or woman has never been in a relationship before. Hits the gym all the time and puts themselves out there only to strike out. Becomes jaded and just gives up on dating.

Now I'm not sure if this is because these people listen to a bunch of these narcissistic podcasts about ""winning"" the dating game, only to find out that none of this shit actually works in real life or if it's something else entirely.

But come on! Get your head out of the sand and open your eyes! You're in your 20s. The world isn't going to end tomorrow and even if it did there is still going to be men and women living in the world. 

Every one of these people has such a doom and gloom attitude that I seriously think what they need is therapy, not a relationship. 

I'm directly addressing any of these people who read this post now. If you enter a relationship with anyone looking for happiness while thinking absolute dirt about yourself then you will never find the happiness you seek. You'll always be forever chasing the phantom of your own fantasy and never catching it.

Work on yourself first. Your mental health more than your physical health because like it or not, hitting the gym every day and training yourself into the mortal incarnation of Adonis or Aphrodite will not instantly turn you into a relationship magnet.

Now if doing exactly that is what changes your opinions of yourself and makes you happy with yourself than all power to you but for those of you who this doesn't work for I have one thing to say.

Seek your happiness in something else.

Grow your skills, take up something creative where you can see your progression. Learn to cook decent meals for yourself and others. Join a community for your hobby and talk with people about it.

And if all else fails. Talk to a bloody therapist because whatever issues you've got going on won't be magically solved by dating someone.

The world out there is sucks. It's full of shitty, manipulative people who don't give a shit about you. It's full of governments and corporations neck deep in shady shit that we don't even know the half of. It's a world where only the top 1% who are born with silver spoons in their mouths have anything handed to them on a gold plated silver platter. The rest of us have to sweat, and struggle, and claw, and fight our way to anything. Education, careers, relationships. It's all a constant battle that we have to fight every single day.

It's a world where giving up *ISN'T* an option. And if you give up on anything and everything just because you can't get a boyfriend or a girlfriend at f***ing 20 then you need some serious help.

It's disappointing to see people my age (23m) just flat out giving up life and love because they can't get a date. I didn't have a girlfriend until I was 21 and that relationship recently fell apart so now I'm back to being single again. I've waded into the dating pool knowing that I'm probably not going to get anything for quite a while and I've been proven right. Has it made me give up? No. Because I still want to find a girlfriend that I can take on dates and do all the things I did with my last gf and maybe even settle down with them.

Ladies, what were some of your unrealistic expectations?","I am currently in a relationship with my fiance. I have came to the realization that my fiance has incredibly unrealistic expectations of how relationships should work. My fiance wants to go on vacations, purchases new cars, buy boats, and live in a house without having me work more than 40 hours a week and without working herself. My fiance is disabled and she doesn't work at this point. I am blessed enough to have a good paying job in which I am able to pay for one or two vacations a year and save money while paying all of our expenses. However, I am not able to afford purchasing a new house, a boat, and a car without working 60+ hours per week. My fiance says that she gets lonely when I work too much. 

However, she still wants luxury items. I told her that realistically, I will have to work more to achieve this. I have began to resent my fiance because she has high expectations without having the ability to meet them. I have come to the realization that women and men both have unrealistic expectations when it comes to dating. What makes me resentful is that I have a good job, a degree, am 5'10 with a muscular build. Whenever I previously tried to date, I could never find women that were similar. 

If I found a woman that was educated, she worked 60+ hours a week and we never spent time with each other. If I found a woman that was healthy and exercised a lot, she had other bad habits such as drinking and smoking. If I found a normal educated woman that worked 40 hours a week and was educated, she was insecure and bored with her life typically.

There is no shortage of women willing to have sex with me because I have a degree, a good job, and relatively tall and I am muscular (good looking). However, I used to think that there was a woman out there for me that matched my success and personality that was healthy and wanted a long term relationship, and that wanted to feel the intimacy that I desire so deeply. I now realize that many women are looking for support like my fiance and many women that say they want relationships are really saying, ''I want my expectation of what I believe a relationship should be like.'' I now understand why men cheat because I don't see the point in continuing to try to find a healthy relationship at this point. I would rather just sleep around with other women and men.

Please help if anyone has advice for me",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ov842o/ignoring_guys_due_anxiety/

94,ov88lj,1627742123,How I met my dream girl.,"A few months ago I moved into this old apartment. 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, just small enough for a single man and his cat.

This building was made in the 1940's, everything about is old. The floors creak, the walls chime in whenever they like, and you can hear your neighbor's phone conversation down the hall. 

But if there's anything worse than living here, it's got to be that damn rattling A.C window unit. I call it the window unit from hell. A big bulky, boxy A.C unit that hangs out my window, PUTTING, RATTLING, HISSING sometimes even smoking piece of junk I've ever seen.

This thing is a fire hazard if I've ever seen one. I've complained to the landlord many times about this, but he doesn't care. He'll say things like ""Be there in the morning"" but of course he never shows up.

The only good thing here is the view of the city. Living all the way up on the 10th floor can have its perks. If you look down you can see the parking lot below. The view is amazing.

Anyways, one day, on a hot summer, I decided to turn this piece of junk on, you know to cool off and it immediately started rattling. This caught my cat's attention, perking up his little ears. 

Full of awareness, Patterson decided to jump on the A.C unit. As he did, the box started to teeter like a see-saw. I jumped, yelling ""Patterson, no!"" this must've startled the little guy cause he Immediately sprung into action and dove off of the rattling machine.

As he did, the A.C unit fell out the window. It fell out the window... The unit fell out the WINDOW AND DROPPED 10 STORIES DOWN, and smashed into someone's Cadillac.

The owner of the vehicle must've been a crip or a blood, because he instantly made a phone call and his boys arrived in five minutes after the incident. 

I saw the guys look at me and point in my direction and made their way upstairs. I took Patterson and hid in the closet. 

""Bad boy! bad boy!"" I said to the little guy as his ears laid backward. But then I kissed him and apologized because I love him and I couldn't imagine my life without him.

BANG! BANG! The front door was kicked open. 10 men with guns poured inside my living room. One guy even had a GRENADE. I watched this all unfold through a broken slat of the closet door. 

""I know you're in here you piece of shit!"" said the owner of the vehicle with the extended warranty. He had a long scar across his right eye, he had a red bandana over his head and carried an uzi with an extended clip. This man looked like his name could be CONRAD.

I tried hard to maintain quiet. I had my hand over Patterson's mouth to keep him from meowing. He has a hard time keeping quiet in bad situations.

One time the landlord walked into my apartment to collect rent and I faked not being home by hiding in the closet with Patterson, and all he did was meow and gave away my position.

"" YOU GONNA DIE ASSHOLE!!!""  Conrad yelled at the top of his lungs. The men searched the tiny apartment, flipping over the couch, kicking in the microwave door, opening cabinets, and throwing the china across the living room.

One guy even kicked my computer monitor with the heels of his boot, just for shits and gigs.

""He's not here"" whispered one man to Conrad. The men regrouped and started out the door. Relieved, I took a deep breath. For a moment I felt safe, and suddenly, ""Meooww""... came out of Patterson 's tiny mouth.

""THE CLOSET!"" Conrad screamed. He ripped the closet door opened, pulling it off its hinges. Conrad pulled me out of the closet by the neck of my T-shirt. I caught of glimpse of Patterson dashing towards the hallway. 

""Please don't hurt me"" I begged Conrad, as he shoved me to the living room floor. ""You ruin my cah"" he exclaimed with a thick accent.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ov88lj/how_i_met_my_dream_girl/

She hasn‚Äôt responded yet the issue I have is she takes like 24 hours to respond yes to a date. We don‚Äôt chat in between dates as it‚Äôs early I learned a lot from the 3% man and he likes keeping texting to a minimum early on.. why does she take forever to respond? Busy? Low interest?

99,ov8l0i,1627743351,Just broke up and feeling sad about it,"So I met this girl and we have been dating for 9 months. She is very kind , caring and easy going. She gets very jealous when other girls are around and does some drama from time to time. Sex was great, good personality chemistry. I told her from the beginning that I like her and enjoy my time with her but not ready for something serious such as marriage or serious commitment. I got a divorce two years ago and still adapting. She recently said that either there should be serious commitment in the relationship or we walk away. So we broke up. I am feeling sad about it. I know I will miss her but I also know that I am just not ready for what she wants. I was honest with her from the beginning. We haven‚Äôt communicated for a week now. 

I am not looking for a solution just sharing. Anyone went through a similar experience and would like to share? thoughts or comments are welcome.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ov8l0i/just_broke_up_and_feeling_sad_about_it/
