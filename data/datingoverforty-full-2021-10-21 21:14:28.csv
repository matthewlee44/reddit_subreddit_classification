 Two months ago I met a man and it's been going great. We've been doing a lot of stuff together and seems like we fancy each other a lot. Please tell me, what are the common sense rules of introducing the new person in your life to your kids. Like I said, it's been two months, seems like  a bit too early yet, or maybe not?? The thing is, my ex husband introduced his new gf to our son first thing after the divorce and son's not been too excited about it.

Anyway. Met a girl on bumble and we have gone on three dates. We have already made out and today we actually had sex. She knows that I’m not looking into rushing back into a serious relationship. She even said I need to experience more due to my lack of knowing what I like sexually. But ever since our 2nd date, she tells me she misses my lips and misses me, and even said things like “if we ever got to the point we were serious”

Is this too much? Is this normal? I can tell she likes me which makes me feel good. I definitely like her also, but I also know about new relationship energy and I’m sure that’s part of it.

It’s hard in a couple ways…first of all, throughout my younger years, before I got busy getting married, getting divorced, and raising a kid, the lesson I took in from the time I was a teen was that my most valuable currency was my body and my looks. Not gonna go into the dumb mistakes this led me into, but it’s kind of ingrained in me that that’s what I see as my most valuable asset--to men anyway. Now that I’m older, and 20 lbs heavier than I’d like to be, and showing signs of middle age, obviously I don’t have as much “value” in this way. It’s a blow to my self-esteem, and I feel more invisible nowadays. Also, I have to figure out new ways of interacting with men. I was never great at making my needs known, but at least formerly, they were more interested in finding out what they were. 

It’s not that I don’t have other qualities…I think I’m smart, kind, giving, creative…I have things to offer. I would say that some aspects of my personality, qualities that are important in adulthood like responsibility and self-sufficiency, were undeveloped for years, though. 

Anyway…trying to figure out my present situation. I haven’t really been dating and haven’t had sex with anyone for 3-4 years, and that was intentional. Recently, I’ve started to think maybe I’m in a better, more stable place, and have started to think about OLD again, etc. The other day, I met someone while I was out…in person! I thought this was really cool, because it happens so rarely nowadays. 

This guy is mid-50s, attractive—nice face, nice eyes, my height but physically fit (usually I do like taller guys). He approached me, and I thought he was warm and interesting and quirky…intense and a little nervous, very forward. Maybe the kind of person who is quick to get insulted but also really good-hearted and generous…that’s that way I can think to describe him. He has a grown daughter he helped raise and obviously loves a lot, and he’s gainfully employed and just seems like a decent man.

After we met at this live music show, we met to go for a walk at night (during the recent full moon). Before we went for a walk, he felt the need to let me know he was carrying a gun. ?! He said he googled it to find out whether or not he should let me know, and how he should let me know, etc. So this was odd and honestly, for a minute there, it made me nervous to go for a walk with him, but plenty of people had seen us together and I wasn’t getting danger vibes off him, exactly. And I’m not murdered or otherwise assaulted, so…all good?

Anyway, that night, I tried to have this conversation with him, asking him, what are you looking for? Like, just to be friends, or is this a date? I wasn’t 100% sure, because we hadn’t discussed anything like that at the show. He HAD asked me if I have many friends, and I admitted I could use some. 

Well, on the night we met up for a 2nd time, he was making a lot of flirty comments and was generally a little cheezy-romantic…like for example, he had sent me texts calling me “milady,” or saying, “I am at your disposal” or just being kind of flowery; purposefully looking really deeply and intently into my eyes; touching my hands all the time. Which is why I was like, “What’s up?” And he got a little cagey and he said, “We’ll see what happens; I really like you; if something happens, great; if something doesn’t happen, great.” And I was like, “Well, for me, having a friend would be awesome, and it would be nice to have something more too.”

I don’t know if I made a mistake. The fact is, I could use friends, and yeah, I would love to be in a relationship. I’m not looking to get married again, but it would be nice to have someone to go out with and do things with and have sex with. Someone I can trust, someone I feel comfortable with, even if it’s not meant to last forever. But in saying that, I feel like I didn’t set any expectations, and I was letting him take control of the situation, in a way. 

I am not that physically attracted to this guy, but I do think he’s \*attractive\*, and I’ve found attraction can grow with intimacy. But it would have made more sense if I’d said, “I want to be friends right now, and I want to take it slow.” Because I’m NOT there yet physically, and the romantic comments were annoying me a little bit.

(He also asked me what my astrology sign is, and when I said I don’t believe in astrology, he almost seemed a little hurt or miffed, which now, thinking back on it, I think is kind of ridiculous.)

Ok, so…here’s some crazy shit. I was supposed to meet him last night at 6:00 to go to this event-thing, which started at 6:00 and went til 8:30, but I got hung up at an appointment in a town that was far away from where I was supposed to meet him. That afternoon, when we made the plan, I told him I had an appointment. Anyway, I texted him at 5:45 and told him, so sorry, I’m on my way, but I won’t be there til 7:00. Then I drove up there. I didn’t bother to check my texts because I was driving. Well, when I arrived, I checked, and he had texted me, “Don’t rush, be safe. I’m going home. Not gonna wait.” 

Anyway, I called him and said sorry but also said I thought he was being a little touchy. He said he thought that was really inconsiderate of me to show up so late. We went back and forth, and then I asked him if he wanted me to go to him (the event where we agreed to meet was in a halfway spot).

So I ended up going to his place. Meanwhile, he makes this statement to me a couple times, like, “I’m going to be a good friend to you.” We smoke a little pot, I have a couple beers, and he’s kind of trying to be romantic, like touching my face and my hands all the time, which half-bugs me, but then again, I’m like, kind of feels nice to be touched? Maybe I should see where this goes? 

I tried talking to him about how I feel about relationships, which is…I think my sexuality has always been shaped around what’s pleasing to the guy. It’s been my belief and my experience that most guys don’t really want or aren’t capable of monogamy, so I kind of molded my own expectations and desires around that. Before I got married (a green card marriage—another story, and another symptom of my confusion), in my 20s, I was only brave enough to say “I love you,” one time that I can think of, and I was in a few relationships where we just sex and there was no commitment, or where the guy had a girlfriend and he was cheating with me. 

So I was explaining to this guy that even now, I say I don’t know what I want, when I date online for example, but it may be because deep down, I’m scared to hope or ask for commitment. What I wanted to go on to say was…now, at this point, I just want to be friends for a while first before getting physical or romantic (and not for a while for, like, months or years, but at least a couple weeks?!). But then he kind of cut in and he was like, “This is how it is. I don’t date people unless there’s a commitment. But once we have a commitment, if we want to open the relationship up, we can discuss that.”

I mean, this is what I remember, anyway.

So then he keeps trying to dance with me and I was not feeling it, even though I did feel like being held. I suggested, let’s just lie down next to each other. I wanted to see how it felt maybe to kiss or cuddle….and maybe more could happen, I figured we’d see. We laid down together and of course he wants to kiss and stuff, and I wasn’t really feeling it, but I participated. And, to make a long story short, I went down on him. Ha…that’s kind of skipping ahead. 

But this is something that, again, I have done on more occasions than I like to remember. I suck this guy’s dick almost so that he leaves me alone. (This guy doesn’t have a very big dick, btw.) I MIGHT have asked him to return the favor this time, but I was on the tail end of my period AND…guys just need too much guidance in this area, in my experience, which I don’t even feel comfortable giving most of the time. I’ll usually just let them try for 15 minutes, and it feels nice, but I’m not gonna come, so I’m like, “Ok, thanks, that’s enough.” I didn’t want to have sex either because I’m not on the pill, I didn’t have a condom, and I didn’t even ask him, but anyway, I just didn’t feel like taking any kind of pregnancy risk.

It was kind of late at that point, and I had to get home, so I left. But now I’m feeling kind of cold towards him, AND he keeps sending me romantic-ish texts. He wanted to meet up again tonight, but I can’t. I have family coming from out of town tomorrow, and I won’t be able to see him again for a few days, at least. 

I hope this guy isn’t on Reddit, but if he is…uh, hi.

I feel kind of shitty about myself because I put out too easily, plus I’m too dumb to even ask for any pleasure myself.

Should I give this guy a little more time, and more of a chance? Can I even really respect someone intellectually who believes in astrology?! Maybe that’s petty—Idk.

Recently he asked me to go to an amusement park as a first date. Which doesn’t usually happen with men over 40, so I asked his age, and he turns out to be just 30 years old.

I only plan to date to eventually be married. I think if I let him know my age he would be shocked &amp; probably don’t want to continue, but most men that approach me in real life are in their 20s and 30s.

I said I wouldn’t date younger, but we hit it off very well. I’m usually attracted to older men.

It has been a hot minute since my last post, mostly accepting solitude.

I thought I was getting better, but feel my conformation for solitude is just my life now.

I went to a social gathering (A Rocky Horror show)... My anxiety eventually got the better of me forcing me to leave.  Before I left, this beautiful stranger that was sitting next to me picked up on it.  Whether she was trying to be nice, speaking from a beer-enhance brain, or even htting on me, all I could do was be super defensive to everything she said, as if to scare her off from even trying to talk to me.... That makes me sad, because it just tells me I am unable to accept the kindeness of a beautiful stranger, which also tells me I have no hope for a future relationship, and I so want one. :(

Another time he was upset why I am meeting other guys. I told him we met only two time I need time to know him more then I will stop talking with other guys. Anyway, two days ago he told me that he diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. 
Being honest I am really tired of taking care of other people.I used to take care my elderly father and my mom during her cancer treatment.
I was very calm when he told me but I started to be uncomfortable with him.
He said he is financially secure so I don’t have to work if we will get marry.
But I don’t want to make my decision based on finances. Also I want to work I don’t make a lot but love to work.

So I'm a guy, 52.  I had 4 dates over about 6 weeks with a lady i really liked alot.  We both had emotional intelligence or so i thought, liked each others humor, intelligence, faith, support of kids.  We really opened up at date 3 about our pasts and baggage and held hands and a kiss on the cheek.  I gave her every chance then to not continue if she had any issues but she planned a 4th date park picnic for just 5 days later eagerly and was very accepting of me.  For the picnic, I cooked and brought all the food.  She said no man ever cooked for her before and loved it.  I gave her two big eggplants i grew in my garden she asked for.  We went on a walk after, held hands, had a good conversation.  I asked her out for date 5 to a museum the following weekend.  She gladly accepted.  We ended with our first real kiss, and it was very mutual and natural.  We share brief texts the next day.  The next I get a text saying she doesnt want to continue, and she sensed I wanted more and she didn't.  So would never see me again or talk to me.  Now again, all we did was mutually hold hands, mutually kiss once.  No talk of sex or anything and not what i was looking for at all.  Some talk of visiting each others houses in the future for a date but no plans for that.  I told her i just enjoyed being with her.  I really liked her alot at this point but we were just starting to get to know each other.  I feel really played, taken advantage of, manipulated by her in this.  Giving me all the signals she was happy and wanting to continue dating, telling me some plans sounded ""enticing"", etc.  I'm very saddened by it and pretty destroyed right now.  How can women be so cruel and dishonest and not even give a promising relationship a chance?  I think she just played her role of interest and acceptance to have someone go out with her, easy to be accepting falsely because she really had no interest from the beginning of keeping me around more than a few dates regardless.

I’ve dated a lot but never really clicked with anyone. Until recently. I have found myself seeing a MUCH younger man. I’m 42, he’s 28. I don’t even know what to think. He’s very mature for his age and has been through quite a bit in life that makes him an old soul. But it’s still FOURTEEN YEARS. I have never dated younger in my life. But we relate so well to each other. Get along very well, same interests, goals etc. I absolutely love spending time with him and think he’s amazing. Thankfully, I look much younger than my age and he looks slightly older for his so most people don’t even realize there is an age difference until we tell them. So at least I’ve got that going for me lol. 

Part of me says age doesn’t matter. The other part says there’s just no way this can work long term. He says I’m being ridiculous letting something as silly as age get in the way of what could be something amazing.

It was great and flirty and fun. Then we started getting physical but…..

He needed a shower! Don’t get me wrong this gentleman’s hygiene is normally fine, but he’d worked up a sweat and I couldn’t ignore the smell. At the same time we’re just re-breaking the ice and I didn’t feel comfortable enough ask him to go use my shower. I decided to ride the re-breaking the ice excuse and limit how far we went. I just couldn’t continue as the sweaty smell got stronger the closer he got. But I’m disappointed. Was there a way to handle this without embarrassing him but somehow encouraging him to take a shower so we could get it on?

So I have met someone really special and am building an emotional connection with him. Honesty I feel like a 20 year old again.
Scary bit is I am scared as we are meeting in RL soon. We met on OLD.  (Long story but Covid and holiday has meant a RL meet has not been possible for a few weeks.). He is a single dad as well and is emotionally available, respectful, consistent and mature 

Ok fact is he is older than I am, taller/bIgger than I am and just totally physically not someone I would ever have expected to meet. (Tend to be into younger, thinner and shorter guys). 

So I keep getting photos from him and there is no instant physical attraction as I am used to. But when I speak to him or hear from him my heart sings. 

My fear is the attraction won't be there. I will hurt him and I never want to do that. 

I am not such a catch nor my ego so big that I realise he may also not have that spark when we meet. Although he seems enamoured of me physically. 

So what is other people's experience of this? Any advice from people whose love grew and the other things were so much more important than the chemical cocktail that wears off anyway!

I’m female 39, I know I’m not over 40 but I’m nearing it.

Online, guys are pushing to meet me already before we’ve chatted long enough for me to be comfortable to meet (it’s only been 2 days). 
One said he didn’t know why but he gets butterflies whenever he talks to me and he can’t stop smiling and feels happy.

Another keeps messaging me even if I don’t respond, sends me good mornings which is nice but it’s the constant messaging that is off putting.

One keeps asking to meet and wants to know what I want to do, I asked him to think of something. Keeps saying he’s really keen, he likes my smile.

Okay soo long story short I’ve just come out of a short term relationship, and I’m back online checking what’s out there and guys are soo pushy!

Another guy I was seeing, before I met my ex, saw me on there and texted me asking what happened to the boyfriend. Said I should’ve messaged him instead of going on the dating app, he shouldn’t be messaging me because I chose someone else.

I’ve matched with a few guys who’ve said they’ve seen me at the gym, or feel like they’ve seen r before. I don’t remember them.
That feels creepy!

I don’t know why, but I get scared off when guys start sending me, you’re sexy, I like your smile messages all the time.

I’m human, I have flaws, get to know me first please.

I'm a 44 yo  divorced single woman with no children. I find sometimes that potential dates judge me and make assumptions about my education level, life experiences, etc based upon my current jobs.

Although I did attend college (2 year degree program) and have two professional certifications in two different healthcare occupations I chose to work as a laundry attendant and a home health aide. Sometimes men I meet assume that I'm a slacker, uneducated, lazy, unmotivated, and just not a go-getter. Tbh that may be due to my weight ( I am considered morbidly obese due to my height and weight but still under 300 pounds) and my chosen occupations. Or that I'm looking for a man to finance me. None of that's true. I'm obese for a couple reasons. I've battled with my weight all my life. Maybe I will lose more maybe I wont. But I'm certainly not gaining. 

I'm not bothering anyone, live alone in my ow place, and have my own car. I work as a laundry aide In a skilled nursing center so its fairly physical work still. I like interacting with the residents, the lower stress levels, and working hours. It can be hot dirty smelly work at times. And I dont make a ton of money. But I'm self supporting and doing ok. My other job I work as a home health aide/direct support professional with a client that has mental health and intellectual disabilities. Also important work but not exactly glamorous or high end. 

So many men have asked me if I'm going to get a better job or dont I want to do better. Honestly I'm good with where I am. The last few years have been very tough. I've battled depression, lost family to Covid. Had covid myself but recovered, went through a divorce and took care of my father until he passed. I'm rebuilding my life at my own pace. I chose to drive an older but paid for car (no payments) live in a small but comfortably decorated apartment.  I do all I can to keep my stress levels low to avoid triggering my depression. Plus I like the scheduling flexibility the two jobs offer me as I have medical appointments to go to to manage my health. 

If someone is self supporting and not asking for anything why the judgement? I dont get it. I'm not looking to date a dr lawyer or Indian chief. Im a working class woman looking to date a working class man.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,60621,public,self,Judgement by Potential Dates,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qgam31/judgement_by_potential_dates/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think it was this that made me discouraged again, because we both told each other how much we enjoyed talking to one another, and the things we'd enjoy once we started meeting. We even set a tentative day to meet after a week. And then...crickets, although there have been some 1-word minimal responses to any follow up messages I send.
