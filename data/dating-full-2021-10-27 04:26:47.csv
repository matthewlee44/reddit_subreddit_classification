I purposefully distanced myself from him so no emotions would be involved since we are just fuck buddies. I found myself getting attached to him after I haven’t seen or heard from him in awhile, I missed him. 

I started becoming obsessive and was dying to see him again. We finally meet up but we don’t hook up this time, we just talk. 

We talked about his depression and how fucked up he is from his last relationship that ended not that long ago. 

It’s weird because I feel like I should have been sad or hurt that he’s still hung up on his ex while seeing me, but I didn’t. That obsession I had over him went away and I felt at peace. I wasn’t butthurt or upset in any way. I wonder why that is. Is it because now I know there are no feelings between us and that put my mind to ease? Is it because he saw me as more than a “fuck buddy” by opening up to me about his past and depression? 

I’m not sure what it is but I don’t find myself thinking about him as much lately or as eager to meet up with him (don’t get me wrong, I’ll definitely keep seeing him because we have great sexual chemistry). 

I guess now I’m wondering how I should go about our relationship. I have strong lust towards him but do not have feelings for him.

I really appreciate any and all input given here. 
To preface: he HAS given me reasons not to trust him. He will find girls from our area either through other people’s IG, or from hearing friends talk about these girls, or whatever else. I don’t know. In the previous years of our relationship, I have found him flirting sexually with girls in his phone. Telling them how sexy they are and just having full blown conversations with them. I’m more than ok with porn or models, not a psycho insecure girl or anything. When you’re being public about repeatedly following new girls from our area while dating me I feel like that’s seriously tacky and embarrassing.

Again I don’t care about porn, IG models, influencers, any of that. But these are specifically attainable girls that he usually hears about through friends, ie. they have mutuals. To me this is a major trigger for my own insecurity and anxiety because of previous patterns where it does not just end at a simple IG follow- he talks to them. When I brought it up, he would unfollow and recently swore it would not be an issue again because he values me, acknowledges my integral role in his life and would not jeopardize our relationship and trust. Fast forward a couple days and I see that he has followed another girl from our area and that she has followed him back. Then comes the whole “it was an accident why would I ever jeopardize us, don’t you trust me” spiel.

Outside of this relationship I don’t struggle with major confidence issues. I’m a young attractive girl but seeing that my boyfriend’s attention is so divided and feeling like he’s seeking approval/attention from random girls really invalidates my effort as a girlfriend. I’m just looking for input.. After multiple conversations he will continue to deny any ill intent- he will literally say he “accidentally” followed them, amongst other excuses, and just continues to deny any inquiry about whether this is for attention or what.

I try to adopt the mindset of “he chose ME and he’s allowed to look at other girls”. But I think I’m already beyond reasonable with these types of issues, I will admire a girl’s beauty or fitness WITH you in public, I acknowledge and understand that men are going to find women beautiful. That’s completely fine. But while we are in a relationship, to go and try to get these girls attention, establish a mutual following on IG and potentially chat them up just makes me too upset and brings me out of my character.

I'm really confused about the whole situation and want someone to help me break it down.


I'm in a friend group of 5 16/17 year olds. 2 girls and 3 guys. I have a thing for one of these girls, and have for a while. We've all been hanging out together a lot lately, staying over on weekends, drinking and etc,. 
One night at the other girls house we had been having vodka and soda. One bottle of Smirnoff between 4 people, so not much each. After we had all done stuff, we'd settled down and started watching movies when the girl I liked fell asleep on my shoulder. id be lying if I said it wasnt one of the best nights of my life. she woke up later and went to sleep in the host girls bed with her. Anyways, it didn't really progress any further that night past her starting to realise my attraction towards her.
Around a week later we met up for a similar thing. While neither me or my interest have had enough to get drunk, we had both gotten tipsy. I wasn't that affected, only 5 vodka cruisers in around 5 hours and she had only 2 because she'd been drinking before she came, though she wasn't noticeably drunk at all. The host girl went outside because she was feeling upset (family and girl stuff). The girl I liked, and one of the guys who is more feminine, went out to comfort her. they were out there for an hour and a half before they came back. The girl I liked then went to bed before the rest of us. She then sent me a snap saying something along the lines of ""just man up and kiss me already"". I was surprised and said ""would you want that?"" in reply. She then said she was sorry and that she didn't mean to say it. we didn't really talk anymore that night.
The next day I properly confessed to her and her response was (in short), ""I like you too but not as much as you like me. I have given up on dating guys from my friend groups. I said what I did last night because when i was outside with [host girl] and [feminine guy] they were trying to get me to kiss you. I was drunk and I'm sorry"". I told her that I understand her reasoning, and that I won't make any moves. Despite what she said, I am almost certain that she was at most mildly tipsy and that she wasn't being pressured or talked into it but encouraged by our friends. No one in our friend group is manipulative or the peer pressure kind. i doubt they would've been out there that long, trying to get me and her together, if the girl I liked didn't like me either. (feminine guy and host girl both knew I liked her already)
Skip forward another week, we are all hanging out at the same place until late. The girl I like drove us all home and I was the last one to drop off. in the car she asked me if I still liked her, which I replied yes to. she was saying that I didn't really like her, that I only know the fun side of her, that she can be really hard to be around sometimes. after that we were quiet the rest of the drive, she dropped me off, and I went to bed. before I fell asleep I sent her a message saying I liked her despite knowing she had her flaws.
she said thank you for saying those things, and nothing has happened since. though we all will be hanging out this Sunday night for Halloween.

I don't know what to make of this whole situation and I feel that im being wierd when messaging her, saying things like goodnight if I leave a group call while she's afk. I asked her, at 10:30 pm, how her night was when she was out with her family one night. she read it this morning but hasn't replied, almost 14 hours later. do I need to calm down and back off a bit? Am I missing anything she might be saying? am I being a prick who doesn't realise, or want to realise, that she doesn't like me?
I just want someone to help me break this down, help me understand it better and to give me some advice or guidance in what to do and not do. 
im super socially awkward and I've never been in an actual relationship before so this is just super confusing to me. I just want some help.

I work a game night role with a pro sports team and we had a bunch of new staff hired this season. I feel like I may have hit it off with this new girl, but I’m not sure.

I had looked up all of our new staff before the season started and she caught my eye as being absolutely Gorgeous.  She was pretty quite so I started talking to her (1 to make her feel welcomed 2 to get to know her) and that progressed to us talking quite a bit. Talking progressed into a playful banter of sarcasm and other little things like purposely running into each other to tell the other to “get out of my way bro”. It’s been pretty fun and happened the first 2 games we worked together. 

After one of the games at midnight hours after we were all home I requested to follow her on Instagram. She accepted and followed back immediately. Like scary fast. I added her on Snapchat the other day and she added me back a day or so later. She didn’t work today but we snapped back and forth throughout the day. 



My only concern is that she is French-Canadien and I’m American (all of this takes place in the states). I’m just worried I’m misreading it and she’s not interested. This fear comes from my old day job. My boss was a Brazilian lady in her 30’s. We had some communication issues due to the cultural difference. (Like I could never tell if she was joking or serious. Overall communication between us was awful and I believe is a reason why I don’t work their any more). 

I know that may seem irrational as Brazilians and canadiens are not comparable. I just don’t want to misunderstand the situation. 

While I don’t know a whole bunch about her she seems very nice and I like her personality. She sounds a little different when she talks due to French being her first language. I guess I’m indifferent on the matter? She’s also a tiny bit naïve. (This is me looking at things objectively). I still think it would be fun to take her out and think her “quirks” make her special. 

Like I said I just don’t want to misread (either due to my own ignorance or a cultural difference.) this and make a fool of myself and cause drama at work. I’m also just nervous in general about having to ask any girl out.

In fact, I've gotten to the point in my life where I really just sit on my tongue about most things in life. I want to start this out by saying that I know I am not entitled to a relationship, nor am I entitled to girls giving me a chance, but it's been 8 years now, and its starting to make me feel more and more empty.

My last relationship was nearly 8 years ago. Since then I have had ""things"" with other girls, but they never eventuated into anything. Hell i've only ever had sex once, and that was when I was 17 (I'm now 24 for reference). All the girls I have had ""things"" with in the subsequent 8 years all ended up fucking me over. One of them led me along and promised we would be in a relationship, and then went and started dating another guy. One of them told me they liked me, and wanted to be with me, only to turn around and say that she wanted to be with this other guy instead. 

I've been on dates in this time, but even dating has been terrible for me. I went on two dates with a girl, then after agreeing to a third date, messaged me saying I was boring and unattractive, even tho I had put heaps of effort into both those dates. Another girl I went on a date with, it went well, she agreed to another, and then disappeared. 

Online dating doesn't help either. I've tried everything under the sun to get more matches and attract more girls, but nothing works. And then when I do get matches, they never message, reply back, or they talk for a bit, and just when it starts to go well, they disappear. One girl even reappeared months later, said she wanted to be with me, and then blocked me. 

I know I am not the best looking guy, and I know that I have things about me that could be considered bad things. I have ADHD, so I can be a handful. I am honest and blunt, and don't really have a filter. However, I am kind, and I am considerate. I give up time for my friends, and help them whenever they want. But the girls never see this, because they never give me the chance to begin with. 

Coming up to 8 years single, and continued bad experience after bad experience leaves me with a huge empty feeling inside when I think about my love life. I don't know what I did to deserve being treated the way I have, and I know I am no saint, I acknowledge I have many flaws, but at least I can be honest about that to myself, and try to better myself. Am I destined to be alone forever? I honestly don't know... But I try and I try and I hope that one day things will change, and just when I think they will, it comes crashing back down on top of me. 

If you have gotten this far down, thank you for reading my rant. I hope I don't come across as entitled.

I stole a few glances to affirm the impression but, of course, was wary not to stare too gratuitously and be impolite. I noticed she had a really beautiful tattoo and decided to ask her about it between sets as I was looking for a local artist to get some work done myself at the time. She was receptive to my conversation, smiled brightly, and showed positive body language so I was relived that my approach was welcome. We chatted for a brief moment, discussed some exercise forms and what not, and I decided to go ahead and ask for her socials which she was happy to offer (\*whew\*) and we parted ways after that. 

I walked away from that happy because, while it was a brief encounter, it helped me feel more confident in my ability to approach an attractive girl in public which is generally very challenging. I've always been afraid I would offend girls by approaching them in a public place but simply being friendly and expressing some genuine curiosity seemed to help me set a comfortable tone with her. 

While we didn't strike any lasting conversation over social media after that, I felt it was imperative I see her in person if I ever wanted to take my shot. Thankfully, today was that day; I went to the gym and happed to see her from across the room. After taking a minute to compose myself (the nerves were unreal because I knew what I had to do now), I went up to her a struck up conversation again. This time, she was much more warm and engaging and I was pleasantly surprised by it. Despite my nervousness I realized it was now or never so I decided to say that I'd love to hang out and asked if she'd be interested in that. She smiled and told me she'd be down and that I should just hit her up on her instagram to find a time. After that we parted ways and went about our workouts; man was my routine was surely inspired after that!

While I still have to quite a lot of follow through ahead of me now and there's no guarantee the date will even take place, this was a huge plus for me all on its own. For as long as I can remember I have always struggled with cold approach and it took the most out of me to shake my anxieties and put myself out there with her. Being on the slightly more introverted side of the spectrum, making new relationships of any kind without pretext is challenging for me so this felt like a step in the right direction. Even if the date doesn't come to fruition, I'm so glad I managed to push past my internal barriers and take the risk.

We cuddled almost naked and kissed a lot while doing so. It was such a great time.

Now she starts saying “I need some time for myself” and stuff along those lines.

I really want to get to know her because she is such an amazing person. How do I behave the right way? I don’t want to pressure her obviously but on the other hand I really want to see her again.

I F24 at the weekend am going to meet M29. He originally agreed that he would show me around London, but as we got talking we were flirting a bit about having sex but I didn’t think anything of it until last night when he mentioned that he was practicing a specific video game when I watch him play. 

I couldn’t figure out if he meant by streaming or actually in person on Friday. I replied with can’t wait to watch you stream it this morning because I fell asleep last night. But I’m now worried I might have given the wrong impression. 

How do I subtlety check that 1. That we are actually exploring the city. 2. If he says his place I say I’d rather meet in a public space.

Before becoming official we met online and started chatting for a week until our first date. First date went well and then I went out of town the next day for a friends bachelor party. So during the trip my buddies try to hook me up with some girl at the bar. I talk to her for a little bit and tried to make a move, and she wasn’t interested so nothing happened there, no big deal. 

Then I get back the following week and go on another date with her and it went great and few days later I brought up if we wanted to be in a relationship and she did. Once we were official I deleted all of my dating apps on my phone.

So the past couple months have been awesome with her. But randomly this past week I have been thinking about that night on the trip and its been bothering me that I even talked to the girl at the bar. Now I obviously know after a first date you aren’t bf and gf already. I still just kind of feel sleazy about it even though nothing happened and i had only been on one date. 

So my question is was I in the wrong for talking to another girl at the bar after my first date? Or was it fine since I had only been talking for a week and been on one date? I asked my friend if I was in the wrong about it and said I’m overthinking this and I didn’t do anything wrong. Ive done some searching on Reddit and the consensus seems to be its ok to be talking/dating multiple people until exclusivity is brought up.

I have pined for her since the relationship ended 18 months ago, despite seeing other women during that time. We didn’t see each other for over a year, but have seen each other 3 times over the past month. On the second occasion I told her how I felt about her (that she’s all I want and it felt disingenuous dating other women), and she held my hand and told me it was “music to her ears” but that I might have to play the “long game” bc she’s dating others also. 

Well our third time hanging out was meant to be last weekend. She cancelled via text the day of because she didn’t feel well and she offered three days that week as potential alternatives….then accidentally texted me again, BUT this text was meant for another person. The erroneous text revealed she wasn’t sick at all, but actually had other plans that night which obviously were a higher priority for her. She apologized profusely and was embarrassed, but I was crushed, and hurt. I told her to forget about everything and she replied “k”. 

Well two days after that I felt like shit about how it all went down, and even though it should have been her apologizing to me, I reached out to say I was hurt that she wasn’t honest and prioritized other plans, but expressed I didn’t expect to be her top priority and that maybe I overreacted and that it was impossible for me to hold a grudge against her. She said “I understand, we can hang out again sometime.” Not exactly the apology I wanted, but again vaguely instilling hope.

She asked what I was up to that weekend and I shared plans about this small local concert I was going to. She said it sounded fun but was meeting a girlfriend, but if they decided to come she would text me.

Well, low and behold, who do I see in the crowd is my ex, with her friend. We give each other a hug and basically spend the night dancing together. End of the night we said goodbye and get home safe. Next morning I asked if she and her friend wanted to go for breakfast and she gave some excuse as to why she couldn’t (another lie? Who knows?). I said okay another time, and haven’t texted since. 

Seeing her at the concert, and dancing with her, was such a head rush. I’m right back to obsessing over her, but it feels like she’s toying with me. She never even texted me earlier that night to say she was going to the concert. She KNEW she would see me there though. So many mixed signals and it fills me with anxiety. 

Not sure what to do here, probably walk away but I can’t. Just wanted to share my story and hope to get some perspective. I really want to re-attract this woman into my life, but I don’t want to force it either.

Though I can recognize that outside the college context a 2-year gap isn’t a big deal, in school it certainly feels like it. He was also a freshman in the orientation program I led, maybe adding on a different element, though I never met him during the time I was director (there were 300 freshmen participating). Is it wrong of me to pursue a relationship with him? Am I playing into potentially dangerous power dynamics or taking advantage of him? Should I be concerned with the optics of dating a freshman? What would we do should we still be together when I graduate?

Any girls on here that can help out is greatly appreciated.

Basically, the letter will be together with a rose. The letter is a love letter, but rather a letter saying that I have a crush on them, and why I got a crush on them (short but concise)

The letter will also include a bit about me, quick dot points.

At the end, it will say something like ""please do take your time to consider and please let me know. I can handle a rejection""

And include my number at the end?

The reason I am doing this is because it is very hard to find an opportunity to talk to her more than a minute, and at the same time, I'm kinda shy.

I do however intend to approach her, tell her I have a crush on her, wish to take her out on a date so we could get to know each other, hand her the rose and letter, and be like, please take your time to read this letter?

Note: I have never done this in my life before.

We had a really good connection so we ended up texting a lot - we talked about what are we looking for in a partner, work, etc. He seemed very engaged and interested. We kept exchanging texts throughout the whole day. After that we decided to move to instagram and continue there. His insta account looks great and we continue with all day texts from Tuesday to Friday. The weekend comes and he said he will go out with friends and family and will be busy. I say no worries and have a great time. He posted stories from dinner with friends and family. I send like to his story, he replied saying the dinner was great, but nothing more than that. He was pretty chatty before that so I thought he must be busy and I didn’t ask follow up questions over Sunday. At that point, I was used to texting every day with him and that seemed a bit strange but I thought it’s weekend, he is out and busy.

On Monday morning I send him a msg, he replied, we continue texting for a while, but he doesn’t seem as engaged as he was before. We stop there - My msg was the last one so I expected him to reply back. It’s Wednesday evening now and I haven’t heard anything from him, since Monday afternoon… I posted some stories and I saw he looked but no comment from him.

So, now I have a few scenarios going on in my mind:

- He had a lot of questions for me so maybe something I wrote was not in line with what is he looking for, but I don’t know for sure. 

- Not very likely but maybe he is expecting me to text him first as over the previous week he used to wake up before me and send me a good morning text and I reply to it. So maybe it could be that he felt like he is always making the first move. But even with that, I was the one to send reactions to his stories and to send a good morning msg on Monday, and my msg is the last one in our chat, so I feel like I don’t want to reach out again.

- He didn’t like any of my Insta photos or stories. Tbh his insta looks great, and mine not so much as I deleted lots of my pics after a previous breakup and the ones that are left are ok but nothing special. However I did post a cute pic over the weekend and he didn’t even like it.

All in all, I assumed that he doesn’t like me that much. On the other hand I really, really like him and keep thinking what went wrong. I mean even if he felt like he didn’t like me that much after he saw the photos on my insta, he continued texting with me for another 4 days straight, which doesn’t seem right. If I didn’t like his insta, I would send a few more msgs but wouldn’t keep the convo going for 4 days.

Any suggestions what to do? I’m thinking to ask him what went wrong but it’s been just few days without texting so I don’t want to jump the bullet and he might not tell me in the end anyway..

Before we met she told me that she had  some bad dating experiences behind her, and was clear with that she  doesn't have any romatic feelings in her life towards anyone right now.  She said she's scared of intimacy and was afraid that i would try to kiss her. So i promised that i wouldn't do that, and that we just could meet in a friendly manner. I travelled far with some friends to a place  close to hers, thus we finally got an opportunity to see eachother.

Our first real date went amazingly well and we hung out for 8 hours. But it left me so confused. What she said before about meeting as friends  didn't seem to correspond to what she communicated in real life, or else  i'm reading her completely wrong. She initiated a lot of deep and  intense eye contact with me. We could just sit and stare into eachothers eyes for a while without anyone saying anything, and it wasn't even awkward. She initiated quite a bit of physical thouch, she sat down  shoulder to shoulder with me for a while and looked at me. She was  pushing me and joking/schuffing with me while we walked. At one point i  was looking down on her, joking about me being taller than her, and she  spontaneously threw her arms around me and held in for a while. We then  continued walking holding our arms around eachother. When we waited for  her train to arrive we kept looking into eachothers eyes, and she hugged  me again really hard, like squeezing me, we stood there hugging for  probably a minute when her train had arrived.

Before our date when we spoke, she was so anxious and afraid that i would kiss  her, so i calmed her and promised i would not. If it wasn't for my  promise there i think i would have kissed her. Last thing i said, just when she was about to enter the train, was a spontaneous invitation to come visit my city. I didn't really percieve her answer to that, but the last thing she said was ""let's talk again soon"".

Now i am such an anxiety wreck. I have been thinking about her contantly  since friday. I think i have developed a crush on her. I can't sleep or eat. What the heck happened? How does she feel now? What was her intentions? Her talk about meeting as friends and then this? Am i misinterpreting her? I'm extremely confused and feel out of control.

I tried to call her this monday but she was unavailable, she messaged  afterwards and said that she was out on a meeting. I replied that she  just can call me back when she has time. I have heard nothing yet. I'm  scared that she regretted her moves, and that she might have something hard to tell me. Also i don't have a plan how to deal with this. What should i say or do now? Tell her how i feel? I dont think so, she has said before that she wants to take things very slowly. I'm analyzing this back and forth constantly.

I’ve (22m)gone out with this girl on 4 dates and so far when we see each other in person it’s been great in person she also said that the feeling is mutual and we have a great time and she says she does as well but I’m not sure if I’m overthinking or if she’s shy as I’m barely getting into the dating game.

I know she gets busy with work but I figured she would have still made some time to reach out or even ask me out me out as well. We’re been texting slightly but it’s been a lot of one word answers. How can I tell if she’s just shy and doesn’t initiate anything like dates or she’s actually not Interested and that’s why she not initiating. Any tips for me as this is new to me?

The classes are challenging, the professors are great, and the campus is beautiful. 

Little did I know, however, I'd find another reason to like my university in my Management Information Systems (MIS) class. The TA in my MIS class is one of the cutest, sweetest girls that I've met. I usually don't develop crushes this quickly, but she's quite the package. 

At the beginning of the semester, I like to look up my professors and TAs on LinkedIn to develop a strong relationship with them for recommendations and connections. After looking into this TA, I learned that we grew up 20 minutes away from each other; both did marching band; both did debate; both have the same major; and both like similar philosophy. On top of all this, I find her incredibly physically attractive. What are the odds? She's also only one year older than me too so it's manageable. I'm on track to graduate a year early, so we could probably graduate at the same time anyway. 

In order to get her to notice me, I've just been busting my ass on coursework and talking with her after class. About a week ago, I was pretty sick, and when I got back she asked me a ton of questions after class about how I was doing and if the doctors figured out what I had. I've started a few conversations with her outside of class as well, but earlier this week, she initiated a conversation in the hallway--which I think is a good sign. We talked about me taking a make-up exam later in the day from when I was sick. She smiled at me and said, ""I'm sure you'll do great."" It probably means nothing, but it felt damn good. 

I also decided to go all out on a reflection assignment by writing a three-page paper when one paragraph would have sufficed. She sent me an email saying how much she liked my response. 

I mentioned that I like her to one of my classmates and he said that they sat next to each other at a football game, and she was just there with her all-female friends. She's also been with her friends when I've seen her around campus, so I think she's single. 

Even though I feel comfortable talking to her outside the classroom and after class, I keep chickening out of going to her office hours. I get there 15 minutes early with a comprehensive list of insightful course-related questions, but I always leave. Hardly anyone goes to her office hours and likely just the two of us would be there. I'm normally good at speaking in front of others but talking to her terrifies me.

We didn't really have a crazy amount of common interests, but she does somewhat enjoy fitness while I am very heavily invested in fitness, but she does give interesting perspectives on things. After the date, I didn't really feel anything and I gave it a night to just relax and think about how the date went some more and today I still don't feel anything. I don't know if it's dating fatigue or if it's because it was a very normal date, but the feeling I get is that I cannot say I like her, but I wouldn't say no to another date just to see if a connection can actually develop (since I've never felt attachment to someone after one date). 

So my options are to send her a blunt message like ""I didn't really feel a connection but if you want to we can meet up again to really know each other"" but I feel like it's quite rude and gives off a really asshole-y vibe. My second option is just to let her text back and go off of that, and if she doesn't then just mutually ghost I guess.
