He wanted to meet for drinks that night if I was free. We had a brief 10 minute call, he seemed super outgoing over the call and I was like “Oh well, can’t hurt right?”
He wanted to meet in a different area of the city, but I asked to meet at a popular street about a 15min walk away so I wouldn’t have to ride public transport. He agreed and met me at 8:45. This was a 28yr old cardiology resident, so I assumed it’s not some dude off the streets.

When he showed up, he looked different. More so, chubbier than his pics and his hair and beard were grown out. Right off the bat, I was a bit put off. I think he was already a few drinks in, I smelled it off of him. We go to this sort of loud bar and there are no seats available so we’re standing at the bar and having our drinks there. 

During this date, he kept touching me in a way that made me annoyed and uncomfortable. Particularly, a lot of poking at my mid section, putting his arm around my hip, and touching my hair and face. After a few times of flinching, I told him I’m not comfortable being poked. He was like “okay okay, I’ll stop since you told me to.” He would start back up within minutes. 🚩 

He kept asking to kiss my cheek, and I let him when he said “just once” and then he asked like 4 more times and kept doing it. It just was extremely annoying. He took a mile anything I gave him an inch.

He told me he used to do hard drugs- like cocaine. In the same breath asked if I am vegetarian, and I said I am. He replied with “good, that would have been a dealbreaker for me, I probably would have ghosted you after this if you weren’t.” (How is non- vegetarianism a deal breaker but your history of hard drugs isn’t?!)🚩

Then he asked if I have ever cheated on someone, and if I would ever cheat on him. I said no, but he asked like 3-4 times. It was a bit scary. 🚩

“How would you like to be a trophy wife?” I said I wouldn’t fit the role because I have good earning potential and I work. He told me he doesn’t want me to work after marriage. 🚩
(imo this is a joint decision between a couple, not an expectation some a-hole sets on a first date)

He kept saying “you are so hot omg, you look better than your photos, i cant believe you are single, why are you single?” He kept calling me hot to the point I got annoyed and said “yeah I know I am.” Immediately, he switched up and said “wow you’re not humble at all… you think so highly of yourself” 🚩

He told me “if you are saving yourself for marriage, you should keep going because guys would say anything to get into your pants.” He said I am classier than other girls he has met/been with. 🚩He was beginning to piss me off so I point-blank asked his body count. He said “whoa I can’t believe you are asking me that. Idk i dont keep count”. I pushed on asking “Is it more than 10?” When he said “yes definitely more”, I told him “don’t you think its very rich of you to preach to me how I should go about my sex life when you can’t keep yours in your pants?” Then he started sobbing about how I am judging him and I’m so closed off.. i wont give him a chance…

This was a maybe 45min date. I didn’t know how to leave in between so I made an excuse about needing to get back home to my dog. He would not let me go home. “Why do you have to go? I don’t get it. Let’s go to this other bar in an Uber.” He then said he wanted to come meet my dog, and I refused. He didn’t take that well. 🚩He was sobbing about how he is trying but I don’t give him a chance. I told him I don’t let anyone meet my dog on a first date.

I told him I have to go and I’ll speak to him later and we’ll meet again (literally saying anything to make him let me leave). He wanted to kiss but I evaded. He started walking away so I left. My whole walk home, I was looking over my shoulder and absolutely terrified. Then he called me at least 5 times within the next 30 minutes and texted me “Look, I tried okay?” 🚩
I got so angry, I sent an angry message and blocked him. 

That was terrifying. I realized that even though my guard was up and I could read my gut feeling, I didn’t know how to leave such a situation swiftly. Our few texts before this date were fine? Normal?

I met this girl on hinge 6 weeks ago I’m 5’10” and she’s 5’7”. I make 50k a year and she makes over double that but we’re both into health and fitness and have almost everything in common I actually have to try to find things to disagree with her about or else it feels like we’re the same person sometimes. So for the first got to the bar a little early because I was nervous and changed tables like 3 times lol but when she arrived we hit it off really well and I lured her over to the giant connect 4 in the bar and proceeded to go 4-0 against her and she started to get annoyed and embarrassed and that’s when I moved in for a kiss which went really smooth and then I let her beat me in the next game ;) after that I asked if she wanted to “go watch a movie” but as soon as we walked in her apartment I picked her up and we started to aggressively make out and four play it was super hot but she wouldn’t let me go all the way and I was okay with that. After that we continued to text everyday and hangout on weekends I would bring her flowers and little gifts and we also split most of the checks, I don’t ever let her flat out pay for everything but sometimes I pay for everything if it’s just like $20 or something but if it’s like $100 she’ll automatically send me half. She was in a strange relationship in the past where the guy was on some 50 shades of grey shit and basically didn’t care if she experienced pleasure or what kind of things she was into and struggled with her other boyfriends in bed as well so she has performance anxiety she cannot achieve orgasm from penetration alone so I was the first guy to suggest using a vibrator and she’s been experiencing the best orgasms of her life she claims, I have no way to know for certain obviously but I can tell you she’s definitely having mind blowing orgasms, the first time we used the toy after a day of drink tequila, all the muscles in her vagina and groin were contracting and she was going nuts so I definitely recommend fellas, no shame in that. I’ve been doing my best to put a damper on my jealousy and insecurities, every once in a while I expose myself a little in this regard but it’s pretty minimal and well taken care of at this point in my life thanks to extreme exercise and so she’s been very comforting and reassuring and that’s made it subside even more to where I don’t really get those feelings anymore. We’re officially a couple as of two weeks ago and we’re totally in love and always just pouring our hearts out to each other and it feels amazing. Basic relationship boundaries have also been communicated and are easily met and we seem to have a lot of trust for only being together for a short time. 

Wish everyone luck! Don’t let the negative posts negatively effect your dating life, I think one of the most important things is to try and let go of toxicity and I’ve really struggled with this after being in fucked up relationships in the past but I’ve been able to overcome it by finding extreme discipline and building confidence in myself and just having faith that I will find true love and being willing to take the leap of faith even when I’m nervous or unsure because I know there are no guarantees in life.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163031,public,self,Success story,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t9qapj/success_story/,no_ads,0,,,,,

She's pretty, very intelligent and very sociable. It's so fun to talk to her, even when I find myself stumbling my words. I wish I wasn't so anxious around her so I could be more of a person to her.

Anyways we've gotten really close over time. Sometimes we text each other from the time we get home until one of us falls asleep or decides to go to bed. We often playfully argue irl and in text, making each other laugh in the re-occurring insults we throw at each other. When our schedules line up, we enjoy talking about games together, School and life, as well as anime in our free periods. Things that really stuck with me is that she often points out my behavioral patterns (some I don't even notice myself), and me sleeping in class. She even has a picture of my asleep during a lecture and, of course, she teases me with it.  

There wouldn't be any doubt in my mind that she liked me even just a little if she wasn't more or as close to another guy. She always breaks away to talk to him whenever he appears. A few more occurrences like her stealing his jacket or touching him more have happened, as well as her tone changes, it sounds more intimate when they talk, Though it could just be me being insecure.  She's also social and happy to be around everyone, so I can't tell if I'm an exception to her or not.

Even though i don't see her as my future girlfriend or anything i still find her nice to spend time with and she have been active on tinder to meet up, so it feels nice to actually have someone that seems to be interested in you.

We were in my car and I had to drop her off to a friend's house, right there I realized I had little time to kiss here, so I made my move but she didn't respond. Then, something that really crushed me happened, she asked for a Uber and went to her friend's house. I felt really really bad, so I didn't text her after that. After that, she texts me saying that I shouldn't feel bad for that, only that she didn't want to bother me. Then I told her sorry if I fucked up or made you feel uncomfortable. She said that i was gaslighting myself, that that wasn't the case and told me that she just sees me as a friend.

Anyways I’ve (m20) been dating my gf (f20) for the last 6 months or so and it’s mostly been great we love each other yadada all that jazz. But we’ve had a sex problem from the start basically we dont really have sex at all. We’ve hooked up maybe 5-6 times over the last 6 months never PiV sex mostly hands and oral like twice. Neither of us are virgins but she’s only had one other sex partner while I’ve had quite a few. 

Sadly the guy she was with before me was a real dick. Basically played games with her and used her for sex and now it’s affecting our relationship. She wanted to wait and have sex once she was comfortable with me and I was fine with that, but its taking so much longer than I thought. We had a talk about it like two months ago and she said she was comfortable with me now and she knew I wasn’t using her for sex so we could start having it soon and at the very least we could start doing oral and other stuff more often.

Here’s where the issue really start because now I’m thinking cool she said she’s comfortable now so we’ll start hooking up more. Ig I was WRONG cause now instead it’s excuses every single time. “I’m too tired” “I’m on my period” “U asked too late” “We don’t have enough time” “I have a headache” etc etc etc. And when I say she makes excuses every time I literally mean every single time. We haven’t hooked up once since that convo when she said we could do it more. 

So fastforward to Sunday night we come back from a date and I try to initiate. Quickly she goes I’m tired from going out can we just cuddle. I’m ngl for just a second I lost it. I got upset and said she always rejected me and it feels like I’m unwanted. I’m tired of ur excuses and if u don’t want to have sex with me just say it. She got defensive and said it’s not that she doesn’t want sex it’s that she feels guilty about it cause of her ex and me pressuring her isn’t making it better. I said I’m only asking for sex cause u told me it was ok in the first place so why are u always making excuses about it and how is it pressuring if I usually just accept it and move on? She just pouted and avoided it by saying u only want me for sex then some bf u are. That was it for me and I stormed out.

Basically, we both work from home &amp; were working together (different jobs) at his place for the day. We like to work together because then we get to take our lunches at the same time, and see eachother a bit throughout the day. Today I didn’t take lunch with him because i was very busy with work, so he gamed a bit instead.

We had plans for after work with one of his friends, and I got off work around an hour before him. So in the meantime, I cleaned his room (I do very often because he gets stressed about it). I also figured if I cleaned it we would be able to spend a little bit of time together after work, because he wouldn’t have to tidy up dishes and things from lunch that need to go in the fridge again. 

He gets off work and says he should probably shower before we leave (we had to leave in about 30-40 ish minutes). But instead of showering, he got on the computer and started to game again. I looked at him confused and asked him what he was doing, and he said he wanted to get a game in before we left.

This is why i’m upset: I waited at his place to finish work so we could hang out, when I could have gone back to mine. In the meantime, I cleaned his room so he wouldn’t be stressed. I was really hoping he would spend that time with me, because we don’t talk during the work day as were super busy. I know this part sounds a bit dumb; but its also international womens day, and i was talking about how i was excited I was about it that morning. I just get kind of hyped on this day because i’m super happy about womens empowerment, support, etc.

Anyways, I got upset with him, and told him I was hoping he would spend time with me. He said he just wanted to game a bit, and I mentioned how I cleaned his room so we would have a bit more time together, he said “well i never asked you to”, and that hurt my feelings. So, I told him I had to leave to get ready at my house. He felt a bit guilty and asked me to stay, but went back to gaming as soon as I gathered my things.

We'd been just acquaintances and Facebook friends since then... up until a month ago, when I ran into her for the first time in years at an event, we chatted a good long while, and I said to her it would be nice to get lunch some time.   


A few days after that (on a Tuesday), she messaged me on Facebook and said she would like to meet up for lunch. We met up that Saturday at a restaurant I'd picked out. And while I didn't call it a ""date"" out loud, the check came and she made no move to pay it as I took out my debit card and paid the check. Then she suggested we go for a walk around the downtown, which we did. Seemed to me that this get-together had all the trappings of a date.  


In the next week, I invite her out again. We meet up, have a nice time chatting. The check (it was another dinner) came around, and she again made no move to pay as I took out my debit card and paid it. We went walking downtown, went to a bar, and I again ended up picking up the tab for that as well.   


I expect, as a guy, to pay for the first two or so dates, so that's not an issue with me.  


But, I've been thinking I should make sure two things:  


1) Are we actually dating? Does she see it that way? I should probably ask her this and hear her out.  
2) If we are, is she old-fashioned and assumes that I will pay for everything, all the time? I can't afford her if that's the case. If I do date her, I'm going to need for her to accept splitting the costs. I think I best talk to her about this, too.

It's not for me and I've never had that urge, but I'm very sex positive and always want the tea. 

Well. It seems like, lately, I'm finding out just how much fun hooking up isn't. I have a lot of friends who will laugh and share their stories, but when it comes down to whether they actually enjoyed the sex or not, usually it's... Not. I mostly talk about this stuff with other straight women but a few straight men as well.

For example, a couple younger coworkers were having a grand old time discussing body count and past hookups with me. And I mentioned that a previous friend had a lot of stories, too, but hers always made me sad. They asked what I meant and I said, ""like, she'd tell me that as soon as it started, she'd just close her eyes and wish she was somewhere else. Every. Single. Time.""

It got dead quiet. Then one of my coworkers said, kinda awkwardly, ""well, what are you supposed to do? Ask him to stop and leave?"" PARDON??? The fact that they both got uncomfortable the way they did sent me reeling. Rather than also being sad/horrified, they acted as if this was their experience as well. And that's before we even address the issue of consent.

Similarly, but not the same level of sad, I've heard a lot of guys brag about hooking up. But when it comes to the details of how they actually feel about it themselves, it's usually ""empty"" or ""alright"" but not anything they really enjoy besides getting their rocks off.

This is not me passing judgment in any way. I used to love these stories, when I thought people were living their best lives. But now I wonder how much of hooking up is just societal pressure vs how much is actually fulfilling.

I tried to record my train of thought and hopefully it makes sense. I'm 26 years old and feel like I'm horrendous at dating. I haven't been in a long term relationship since the beginning of college. While I like men and non-binary people, I struggle so hard with making a connection with a complete stranger. I always get anxious or nervous and want to shut things down right away, even if someone is seemingly my type on paper.

For example, I matched with a guy who I find fairly attractive who enjoys some of the same hobbies I do. Unfortunately, he lives a few hours away so we can't meet up for a first date. It's my fault that we matched even though he doesn't live near me because I forgot to change my settings after a trip to his city. He said he wanted to keep in touch in case I was in the area again soon, which I was pleased with. I thought he meant we could like, follow each other on Instagram or something. Instead, he's texting me multiple times throughout the day. He's not afraid of a triple text. Which I mean, I'm not either, but I don't know this guy. Our conversation is fine, but it's kind of ruining my solo wine and movie night. He also told me he's planning to move to the other side of the country soon. So what's the point? He wants to talk on the phone later this week and I'm trying to decide if I should push myself past this boundary I always put up or if I should tell him I don't see an easy way for us to continue to get to know what another. I don't really understand what he wants exactly.

My friends say I'm too picky and they get frustrated with me when I get the ick after a few conversations or a lackluster first date.

saturday rolls around and upon seeing him i quickly noticed that his teeth had gaps, were yellow, and had plaque on each tooth. ive also never seen his teeth prior to this so you can imagine my shock. on top of this his breath did not smell good. like at all. despite the fact that he was chewing gum the whole time and i think it mainly had to do with the fact that he's a heavy weed smoker. and he did not look as good as his pictures which i could let slide but of course hygiene is a huge turn off. i feel so mean as i type this but when i got home i washed my hands as hard as i could to forget the smell.Â 

i got home and texted him that i arrived home and he asked if i enjoyed myself, i said yes even though that wasnt the full truth. he then apologized twice for his plans of us going to play pool falling through which i didnt mind that it fell through since we did have fun regardless but it was nice of him to mention it.

the next morning he texted me good morning, which he never did before, and was a clear indiction that he likes me. i didnt flirt with him the whole day and stopped responding at 6 pm. his twitter soon after was full of subliminal messages to stay to yourself and that people can be disappointing etc. which i knew were because he felt some type of way of me leaving him on delivered.

the next day after we didnt speak to each other the whole day because i thought ill just cut contact but i had recently been ghosted and didn't want him to feel how i did especially after he showed how clearly he likes me. so i sent him a message saying i appreciated his time and efforts but i just didnt think i wanted the same thing as him and good luck with everything. needless to say he didnt take it that well, which i understand, considering i told him this 2 days after i saw him which i should've done the night i met him. this was also the first time i outright rejected someone in an adult manner and im proud i did the right thing instead of fully ghosting him.

its a shame because i did like his personality and some part of me keeps expecting him to message me for whatever reason since i enjoyed talking to him. but i especially feel guilt for potentially hurting him and wish i would've had a better conversation with him or maybe been honest about his hygiene which no one really likes to hear. but idk how do i stop feeling pity for him",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163052,public,self,i rejected someone after a first date so why do i feel guilty,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t9y4ez/i_rejected_someone_after_a_first_date_so_why_do_i/,no_ads,0,,,,,

He understands that I have a lot of insecurities, and tries his best to make me feel a lot of assurances. I feel super lucky for being able to have met a guy like him but am scared that this will maybe one day cause issues in our relationship.

we both have kids that are similar age, and get along perfectly I love his son like hes my 
own and he loves my daughter and treats us amazing. 

I finally feel myself being happy again and falling in love after months of depression and being numb.

And my daughter is five and she’s in school and she was to school in New York and I don’t wanna operate her to a different country that isn’t even doing as well or good as United States id And I know her dad would not make it easy for me to make that move. 

I can’t go to Canada because I refuse to get my two vaccines even though I’ve gotten Covid twice it’s documented so right now he comes and visits me quite frequently which I appreciate but I was he saying goodbye. He thinks in order to make us work that we will be able to pull off calling to House as one of the US won Canada and it more or less ones has the one is mine and to me that’s just not traditional and that this is that makes sense. I’ve always dreamed about my husband living under the same roof as me coming home to dinner, doing the kids homework with them, Family movie night, Getting the kids ready for school in the morning and putting them on the bus but also I want everyone sleeping under the same roof.

he was good looking. i honestly couldn’t hear him well at first, i could tell he was nervous. he is an artist, i actually related to him heavy, although it’s weird trying to convince someone you understand them at this age when we are in two very different places. it’s hard to explain.

mentioned his ex plenty of times. i felt rude ignoring it so i finally asked when they broke up like 5 mentions later. he said “a month but that he didn’t wanna talk about it.” i kinda laughed a little and he said “what that it’s only been a month?”i was like “i mean yeah but no, only because you’ve brought it up quite a few times but you say you don’t wanna talk about it, just didn’t want you to think i’m ignoring your comments”

we were playing pool, it was actually a lot of fun, i felt like i was there with a friend. i heard a girl say he was cute, i thought it was nice so i told him. he got very upset that i cared and proceeded to angrily say he was there with me, not her.

i am going to try to be vague, i mentioned he was an artist. i am a different type of artist but he had taken one of my ideas and gave me a real life creation of what he had made. brought it to our date and let me keep it. i thought this was so sweet but also odd.

I tell all these women that I'm not interested in short women, mostly into women that are 5'6+ as its all a difference within my head area not below and find it extremely uncomfortable to be with someone thats below my head,  I just can't do it. They all tell me i'm an asshole for rejecting my height when I tell them they're literally doing the same exact thing rejecting guys that aren't tall. One 5'0 woman gave me the most shit for rejecting her height and I wasn't a prick about it, she was. She hits on me and says, ""Hey, you're tall and i'm petite, I only date guys 6'0+"" I found this a turn off and then go ""I'm sorry I'm not comfortable with short women, I like taller women."" Then she gets all pissed off and says ""You're an asshole.  


 Most guys like short women and tall guys love us. I've never had a tall guy say I was too short. What the fuck?"" Then I go, ""Most of us don't go for short women, I personally find taller women more comfortable and most guys will not go out of there way to find someone so drastically shorter than them on the basis of their height that we disregard everything else nor do most guys even care about height."" She then starts to bad mouth tall women a bit and says, ""Tall women aren't even cuter than short girls, tall guys love us so much more because we are cuter and fun sized."" At this point I literally wanted to punch her in the face, but I just said ""Good luck being you, i'm sorry for any guy that pursues you and feel bad for any guy thats with you, bye.""   


I mean I don't get why tall guys are basically crack to so many women. I can understand that if you're a tall woman that you find it comfortable to be with a tall guy, but if you're short/average why aren't guys that aren't tall not good enough?? I even ask all these women if they're into guys that are like 5'8 - 5'11 and they said that they want guys much bigger than that. Also why is a guy an ""asshole"" if he doesn't like short women? Why do short women have this mindset that every breathing man on this planet only goes for short women? We aren't really a hivemind and I know tons of guys that think a lot of heights like 5'5 and under is too short and want women closer to their height, they are entitled to feel so and are allowed to. A lot of guys love women that are so small to them and the difference between a man and a woman that aren't so far off from each other in height is great.   


I'm not going to drop my preference if other tall guys feel the opposite and want 12 - 20 inch differences and short women are the ""trend"". I personally don't like short women attacking me as if I should force out of my comfort zone and preference in order to like them which I won't do. If that is the case consider me the minority.  I'm not going to try to fake anything and will flat out tell a woman shes too short. This notion of most men like small women is BS. We appreciate women of all sizes and to say that most of us only go for one type of women is extremely narrow minded and absurd. Women can reject guys for not being tall, but its like if we think a girl is too short its somehow a bad thing as if we have to force ourselves  to like every single height and be comfortable with every height. If you are a short woman that hits on tall men, maybe some like it, others don't. Respect their decision if they say you are too short.

So I met this girl on Saturday at a club. She had two friends with her and I had one friend and his friend. I am not really a bar kind of guy as I don’t go often but my friend and his go there to flirt, kiss and try their best to have sex but they always fail. 

As for me, I am a pretty shy guy and get nervous flirting due to fear of rejections though I don’t have fear having a normal conversation. So the two guys I was with spoke with three girls ( one of them is the one I asked out). They took one each to talk ( well more like flirting and kissing). I decided to take to her and we were just having a normal conversation and we bonded, exchanged Instagram and even telephone number and also drank. Her two friends pretty much escaped my friends because they were pretty touchy and forcefully trying to kiss them.

After that, the two girls ditched them but I was still having conversation with the girl I was talking to and asked her out well more like “do you want to meet up just you and me on next Saturday” and she said sure. I was actually scared she would say no because of the two friends I was with and what they were doing.

Long story short, we did exchange texts in between Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Just a small conversation. I am getting a little tense as being not too romantic and being a very nice guy and no idea what to do before our date this Saturday.

So any advice what should I do before our date day arrives like should I keep the conversation going through text or should I call her more and try being more romantic and get to bond. Please advice
