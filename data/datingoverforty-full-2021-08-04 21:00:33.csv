I'd been feeling fairly lonely and down.

Several weeks ago, I started talking to a lady \[38F\] from a dating app who is easy to talk to, and we seem to have similar personalities (liking some of the same things and laughing at the same things).  We text and flirt often.  We've been on 3 dates so far, and they've all been great.  The last 2 dates have involved holding hands, butterflies in the stomach for both of us, and the last date also involved some cuddling and making out, and we said we like each other and aren't interested in finding others now and we want to see where this goes.

We're both fairly chill and like to relax (I think it's important to find someone who enjoys similar things in that way).  One thing is she's religious and I'm not very religious (I'd consider myself agnostic), so hopefully that wouldn't be a problem.  But we've both been excited to see each other, and it feels great.

I just want to put a positive vibe out in the universe for these folks!

When I (52M) was 23, I was standing in the corner of a night club listening to the music and minding my own business while enjoying the energy of the club (sometimes I'd go to dance clubs by myself just to be around people and listen to good music) when this woman with stylish hair and a couple of years older than I was approached me with a friend in tow. 

""You're the best looking guy in this club (sic) and I wanted to say hi to you,"" she said to me, not because it was necessarily true but because it was her opening line. This triggered a laugh and a conversation and some dancing, and we ended up dating for a little while. During this time, she talked a lot about her ex-fiance, mentioning all these great things about him. I love people's stories and am generally confident (?) enough in myself so that I don't mind if people talk about their exes, even if they rave about them, but after she brought him up a few times during our first few dates I asked, ""Your ex sounds like a great guy -- what happened between you two?"" 

""He died,"" she said. 

How shocked and touched I was by this. It turned out that he had an undiagnosed heart condition, and despite being young and fit he died suddenly of a heart attack in his mid-20s. In fact, I was this lovely young woman's first boyfriend since his death, and I can't justify how touched/honored I was by this, even though we eventually agreed that we should just be friends (and actually stayed friends for awhile - I genuinely thought she was a good person).

Fast forward more than 25 years. 

I am on OLD and am looking for potential matches for dates after my STBXW , and there is a pleasant/kind looking woman a little younger than me (45) who I am interested in, so I click on her story and read what she has to say, since I did love reading people's stories. It turns out that we would not be matches -- she loved the outdoors and also home fixit projects, and I hate both those things -- but what really touched me was that she was widowed and this was her first foray into OLD. She mentioned she was looking for someone kind and supportive who understood that she was on the dating market after unexpectedly losing a man she loved with all her heart. 

How touched I was by her story, to the point I sent her a note stating that I was not a match for her (and mentioned why) but that her story had resonated with me and that I hoped she found someone. 

Anyway, I am thinking about these stories today after reading a post by a woman who is back on the dating market after unexpectedly losing -- to death -- her soulmate. 

And I'd like to put out there a wish, that people who are unexpectedly put on the dating market, especially because they were widowed but also because their SO unexpectedly ended their relationship, that they/you find kind and supportive dating partners out there.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,54968,public,self,Sending my most positive thoughts to widows and widowers on the dating market...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oy6dx7/sending_my_most_positive_thoughts_to_widows_and/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,

Td;rl - I ended it. In the end, it was too much for me to deal with and I was having a physical and emotional reaction to the situation and knew that long-term this relationship wouldn’t be healthy for me. 

Things seemed good on Tuesday. She invited me to hang with her friend from out of town and a group of our mutual friends for happy hour. Before heading to my place and her spending the night, I told her it was cool getting to meet him, but that I still wasn’t comfortable with the whole situation. 

Yesterday is where things got weird. 

I found out via our group chat that she was hanging out with him again until his flight left at 8 pm, this was the first time I had heard about these plans. After she left my house, he apparently texted her to meet up for breakfast and drop off his rental car. At 1 pm, she texted me saying they were going to hang out at one of the local breweries and if I wanted to join when I got off work. I happily accepted. 

I think this is important for context.  Because I’m salaried, I don't have a set schedule.  In the past, I’ve taken off early to meet up with her and hang on a weekday afternoon where we both didn’t have our kids. 

At about 2:30, I had wrapped up my last meeting for the day and decided to head out to hang with them. 

When I got to the bar, she was shocked/ surprised to see me.  I sat next to her and they proceeded to tell me what they tasted on the menu was worth getting.  Once she stopped talking, I playfully said, “Hey,  can I get a kiss” as my lips were millimeters from her cheek  This was the way we normally greeted each other in public spots. She just stared off into space and I got upset and said “That's fucked up” before I got up and left.  

Overly dramatic? Maybe a little.... but I had been dealing with this nagging feeling for a few days and I felt everything was inflamed by her actions and disregard for how I felt about the whole situation. Since basically, they spent Sunday afternoon, Tuesday, and Wednesday together. 

A few seconds later she followed me outside and said “you know my rules, no PDA in front of friends, I don’t want to make him feel uncomfortable. “ Honestly, this was the first time I’d heard of this rule being enacted outside of our circle of friends. Because normally she’s the one who initiates contact. 

We had a few words outside and I told her that my feelings were hurt over her actions and that this isn’t normal behavior for her.  I told her the fact that she cared more about making her friend feel uncomfortable with a little kiss from the guy that he knows she's dating and was a little odd. Then I drove home. 

She continued to hang out with her friend and didn’t contact me until she had dropped him off at the airport 5 hours later.  

At first, she wanted to meet at my house and I told her I was more comfortable meeting her in a neutral place, like a bar. 

When she walked in, I told her it was over and that I wouldn't tolerate the disrespectful behavior she’s exhibited, and that we have a fundamental disagreement on what honesty, trust, and transparency looks like in a relationship and that those 3 things are non-negotiable for me. 

She was upset that I wasn’t willing to hear her side of things and that I needed to apologize for embarrassing her in front of her friend. I told her there was no room for discussion and that I was done.  She was dumbfounded and insisted that I was in the wrong and that I need to take ownership of my reaction.  She said that I purposely didn't tell her I was coming to meet them and that I was trying to ""catch"" them. 

What gets me is all she was worried about was how she looked in front of her friend and not how I felt.  Her blatant disregard for my feelings is ultimately why I chose to end things.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,55011,public,self,But we're just friends… Update,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oyl7nd/but_were_just_friends_update/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,

I've posted a few times about it since this is my first time dating since my divorce was final two years ago and basically it's been almost 20 years since I had been in the dating world. Things have progressed amazingly... We have a lot in common, communication is superb, we both have professional careers, are emotionally mature. We really have just clicked. He was the first to say that he loves me and I also love him. It seems too good to be true. And maybe now it is... 

I'm almost 41F with two kids ages 14 and 9 who live with me over 95% of the time (youngest spends maybe 1-2 nights on the weekend with dad even though our custody agreement is 50-50...dad doesn't utilize that). New guy is 43 no kids, divorced over 10 years ago. My ex-husband was very controlling of me and is still very controlling over the kids. The biggest thing with him is that he uses his religion as his reason for wanting to control everything.

New guy wanted to meet the ex-husband since ex is in the kids' lives and new guy was hoping that we could all have one of those great relationships that dreams are made of where everyone gets along and share in birthday parties together etc. Ex-husband was his typical self at the meeting and tried to put down expectations he has about new guy being around the kids (no PDA in front of them unless we were to get married, no drinking alcohol in front of them, no sleepovers if the kids are with me unless we were married... All in the name of his religion). This first meeting lasted almost 3.5 hours. New guy and I both left with headaches and ex-husband left and texted me asking if I was trying to kill him with new guy because he felt antagonized and his blood pressure had skyrocketed. So needless to say we aren't planning any shared family gatherings soon. 

New guy understandably has a lot to digest with this because he doesn't want drama and problems. He says that he doesn't see red flags with me and that I'm great and amazing but my ex-husband is a huge red flag to him. He expected things wouldn't be good with meeting him, but he didn't expect to get what he got. He said I definitely made the right decision by divorcing him. He's talked to friends who tell him to be careful because he doesn't have any ""baggage"" and if he chooses to continue a relationship with me, my ex is still in my life because of the kids. New guy has met the kids and that went well. New guy says he really loves me and sees common ground for a future together (and so do I) and that he's not breaking up with me but he's not sure how things will work with my ex. He's dated younger women without kids and they aren't emotionally/professionally mature enough and that's not what he's looking for at this point in life.

My initial plan was to confront him and then pretty much throw in the towel. Thanks to this forum, I decided with a less dramatic approach &amp; had an adult conversation instead. 

I acknowledged that I had never expressed my needs to him and that I felt we weren't spending enough time together. I told him that I needed more than just a weekend day/night and that I felt disconnected with the current situation. This was incredibly hard for me because I have never felt comfortable expressing my needs. I had tried before in a previous relationship and was basically shut down by my partner. i realise now this is something i need to work on. 

Anyway, his response was: ""I have been waiting on you to give me the go ahead &amp; take the relationship to the next level. You're so independent and you were very clear from the outset that you wanted to take things slowly. I know you've been hurt before, I wanted to show you that I was patient, wasn't going to rush things, and that I genuinely wanted to get to know you. I didn't want to scare you away in being more demanding with your time - i can see that you needed time to learn to really trust me and that I nothing but good intentions. I miss you during the week and I would love to see you more. I wish you'd told me this sooner &amp; I hope that in future, you can be more open with me because I love you and want this to work.""

Wow. 

So i can't say ""thank you"" enough to everyone for calming my farm! I could have completely ruined everything by going off at him, for a problem that he had no idea existed, because I wasn't communicating &amp; expecting him to mindread &amp; always initiate everything. 

I've deleted the old post because I feel so stupid about how i nearly blew this whole thing.

I didn't meet with the woman that I had been dating but sent her this message to close off the conversation:

*Hi. Before you made your decision I wanted to talk to find a way to slow things down so you were more comfortable and could choose the pace, rather than finish the relationship. I had a few things I wanted to discuss with you and some questions about our situation but I’m not sure I would find the answers. You’ve made your decision and I respect it, and thank you for being honest with me. I don’t think we need to talk/meet. I know you understand how I feel about you so if you change your mind or think you’ve made the wrong decision then call me and we can talk.*

She was previously in a 13 year toxic relationship and has been single for 18 months.

I received a long message back from her asking if I'm ok and explaining again that she just feels that she is not ready for a relationship but she thought she was.  She really likes me and acknowledged that she pushed the relationship to go too fast for her. She was also offering again to meet or call to talk about it twice in the message and said she didn't intend on hurting me and was really sorry.

I didn't respond as I accepted her decision but she sent another message last night saying ""Can you just let me know if you're doing ok please. I do care about you"" and then she called me.  I answered the call and we actually had a very nice conversation for about 45mins and discussed the situation and her decision for the first time outside of texting.  She then stated that she doesn't know what's going to happen and may/may not change her mind.  She then said that we could still talk/meet if I wanted but as long as I understood how she felt.  

This just seems to get even more confusing!!! I want a relationship with her and said that this might not be the best for me, she said that its something I should decide.  We ended the call there and she said I'll speak to you soon.

Not flexing here, but the disconnect between my chronological age and my appearance, while confusing for some...seems to be becoming a problem of sorts in my dating life now that I'm forty-something.

For example, last night I was at a party with folks who were so eager to set me up with someone, especially with a gentleman in another state, but when we confirmed his age was 34, my age became a major party-pooper, even though the matchmaker liked me so much to want to set me up with this bachelor in the first place. 

On dating sites, I'm honest about my age and my pics are recent so it's not like there's false advertising going on and there should be less of an issue. However, when I meet people IRL, especially men, it seems like when they find out my real age, I am all of the sudden in the clearance section - that something must be wrong, and whatever biases they have against older women kicks in, even if my appearance and lifestyle indicate otherwise. 

I don't feel the need to apologize for my age, which is ridiculous, but it feels like I'm constantly disappointing people who think I'm a certain (more desirable age), and find out I'm much older. #sorrynotsorry, but it sure doesn't feel great that a number has such an impact now that there's a four in front of my age.

Which meant for me that without exception all the people I’d dated before I married were in their teens and 20s since this was before the MILF/DILF thing was as prevalent as it is now. For the most part, my dates/SOs then were — like I was — still trying to figure out where they were heading in life. Careers were just starting (if even that), families meant “parents,” only one person I dated owned a house, and although we didn’t realize it we were still just babies. 

Fast forward to 51. I am unexpectedly getting divorced, and suddenly back on the dating market again. For the first time in my life I was dating 40 and 50 somethings (when I’d dated in my 20s, my dates’ parents were in their 40s and 50s — now my dates were those parents :) ).

How much I loved it!

Many of us had either figured out our lives, or realized that we were never going to figure out our lives. We talked about careers, kids, sometimes grandkids, houses, places we’d lived, places we’d traveled to, or dreams that had never materialized. Some of us had elderly parents, or had nursed parents, and many of us had lost our parents. There were a lot of discussions (but not too many) about exes, and although I didn’t date anyone (by coincidence, not choice) with late spouses, I had conversations with people with late spouses. 

I expected to be a single a long time, but by chance I met a really special person my age at the end of last year. She had a house, a tween daughter (she had kids late), elderly parents, an ex husband and an ex partner, and was successful in her second career. How wonderful our conversations were, and we bonded so strongly so quickly that I was rarely spending any time in my own place, so when my lease expired a few months later I just moved in with her and am paying her the rent I would have paid otherwise (she didn’t want to, but I didn’t feel right “mooching” off her by not paying rent or splitting the mortgage and thus squeezing into her equity — those things may come later with the benefit of a prenuptial attorney’s expertise). And how much I love her. And how happy I am.

This morning she and her daughter are traveling on a girls weekend. So I am waking up by myself (and with her kitties) in her house. I miss her. But I can feel her presence everywhere. There is the kitchen she remodeled, the special kitty room she has, her yoga area, her clothes hanging in the closet, her work desk, her daughter’s art on the fridge, and of course her lovely kitties. It makes me miss her so very much. But also I am just so attracted to the choices she makes and the life she has built for herself — I respect what she has done, in addition to the wonderful person that she is.

Anyway, all of this makes me appreciate dating and love in our 40s and 50s, because I love(d) dating our age group very much. I would not have known that about myself when I was 25 :) 

Anyway, all my best to you…

Backstory, we met in college, married young (early 20's), and when the marriage fell apart, so did I. I was pregnant at the time with my third child.

In the time since, I've become independent, strong, and mostly very happy being single! I love being a mom, and focus my time and energy on my kids and my future career (I'm in school for a second degree). But I still have people (mother, friends, therapist) suggesting I get out there and date. The thing is, I generally have zero interest in it. I tried online dating briefly a few years ago and found it mostly disappointing. I had one relationship with a man who I realized had an alcohol problem, so I ended it. The only other thing was contact from an old childhood friend... we reconnected, met at a playground with our kids, texted from time to time (he lives on the other side of the country), and he made it sound like he was headed for divorce. Except he wasn't, and he sent me a ring (!!!) saying that if he ever divorced, he wanted to be with me. Well, I threw the ring away, not wanting to be an idiot waiting for something that will never happen.

The truth is, I think dating and relationships are ultimately disappointing. It seems like a waste of time an energy. I like having a peaceful life, with no drama. I get along with my ex very well (we are close friends, and I really like his girlfriend). Sometimes I wonder, am I cynical (and rightly so), or am I missing out on something by basically building a fortress around myself?

I joined Bumble last weekend, and I stayed on the site for less than a day. I just couldn't and didn't want to do it... My sister-in-law said, ""maybe you'll find Mr. Right"". But my cynical self says there is no mr right! I deleted my profile and felt incredibly relieved.

It felt intense and I had to look away. But then I started noticing that he does that a lot when we cross paths. Now whenever I look up from my work, if he is there he will be looking at me and he holds the eye contact for way longer than I would, so I have to look away. He is always smiling.

Plans were canceled via text 2 days prior to my leaving when a landslide occurred at his place of work. He works in a National Park and clearing the landslide would cause him to work 2 additional days, coinciding with days I would have been there. He attached 5 or 6 pictures of the landslide.

I immediately texted, ""It's okay, we can do different dates. I know you'll want to be available to help (at work).""

The next morning he confirmed via text that he would be working Fri &amp; Sat. and that maybe we should do different dates.

Because he is very into his job and this was a big deal, I said, ""Take it easy this week as I know it's going to be a lot of work."" Rather than my getting right into what the back up dates would be.

The next morning, I sent him a case of his favorite, but very hard to find, energy drink. Just as a show of support for all the extra hours &amp; work

But now, the doubts are creeping in since he did not make any attempt to offer up any back up dates. There was neither any regret in plans getting canceled, nor easy and immediate, ""Let's move it to next week?""

Around the house, I slowly unpack because? I have no assurance that he will revive the raincheck, so to speak. (Because it was a roadtrip and I was bringing my puppy for a week, it is a lot to unpack, not just a duffle bag 😂)

I think? Did the landslide get cleared? Did he have to work on his days off? What if there wasn't a landslide?? Yes, stuff like that.

To those who will say, ""Just ask him"", I have been assertive in the relationship in the past, and so, this time, it is important to me that I know that he does want to see me and extends the back up date invitation on his part.

I'm sorry about that, but it's a lot and I don't know what to do. I'm confused and sad and I feel like absolute crap! I've (48F)been dating this terrific guy for about 5 months, long distance. He visited me a month ago and I bought tickets, while he was here with me, to fly out to spend a week with him in September. He's amazing. He's kind and funny and so fucking intelligent. The way his mind works fascinates me. He's a terrific father to his son and although he's divorced, he has a very amicable relationship with his ex wife. He has so many qualities I admire; He's good to people, especially his friends, he's honest, giving and genuine. He is introspective and tends to ramble his thoughts out loud (I think I love that most about him) and is a bit of a know it all! He gets distant at times, but he's a Capricorn so... yeah. He says he's ""A lot"". He is but, up until recently, I had yet to see a level of it that I couldn't live with. We have discussed becoming exclusive on a few occasions, because he kept bringing it up, but never came to a conclusion. When I asked for a definitive yes or no or whatever (because I was confused and I hate to be confused), he said he wasn't sure what he wanted. I can respect that what with it still being kind of early in our dating each other. He did admit I'm the only person he's dating. Anyway, we enjoy each other's company and have fun. 

The problem is this. His best friend very recently died of an overdose. Best friend is too small a concept. This was, essentially,  his soulmate and his first love.  They met as teenagers and had fallen deeply in love to the point he wanted to marry her right out of high school. They were immensely close, but she was addicted to some pretty bad stuff. He told me that, from a young age he'd looked after her and sometimes for her, when her mom couldn't find her, and bring her home and the countless times he'd ""talked her off a ledge"". My God, he was a kid practically raising a kid! There's so, so, so much more. Eventually, he broke things off because he couldn't stay with her in that life she kept returning to. He broke up with her and left for college. He still loved her and was in love with her and anyone who has ever loved an addict knows how complicated it is. They remained very, very close friends up until her death. Whenever she needed him, he was there, until he married and had his son. He had to make different choices understandably. She was however, for lack of a better term, the love of his life. Keep in mind, please, that all of this I've shared with you are things he's told me over the past days since her death. 

He is devastated over her passing in ways I'm still trying to comprehend. I'm trying to be there for him. I'm trying to be supportive and validate his feelings because the love he had for her, at heart, is truly beautiful! He gave a lot to her. Things a teenager should never have to be responsible for, he took on and says he would do it again a million times over. He is heartbroken. We've talked at length about their history. He's posted all over his social media about how much he loved and still loves her. While some of the posts are touching and funny, some of it has made me feel... uncomfortable. He even made a joke that she'd laugh thinking she was cockblocking him in the hereafter. 

Which leaves me wondering where that leaves us. He's told me that none of this changes the way he feels about me and for the first time ever he used the word love, ""It's not easy talking to someone you love about another person you've loved as deeply as I loved her."" He's never said he loved me before. I didn't press him about it because he's grieving and because of that, maybe he didn't really mean it like that?

All I know is he's about to go through his year of firsts without her. First birthdays (hers is in September... I'm supposed to be flying out to see him in September), first holidays, milestones of all sorts knowing he can't just pick up the phone, call her and talk to her. It would be our year of firsts as well. First holidays, birthdays and milestones and I can't help but feel guilty of the fact that I feel our firsts will be overshadowed. 

I'm just afraid that it's wrong to continue our relationship until he's worked through this chapter in his life. Am I wrong? Is it wise to continue our romantic relationship with all of this going on in his life right now? I don't want to break things off, but am I being fair to myself? Fair to him? He's a great guy who is having a very rough time and what kinda creep am I for breaking things off when he's already in so much pain? I'm anxious about September. Am I wrong to feel like he should heal from his broken heart before considering letting me any further into it? I feel like I'm already getting cut by the shards. I feel like I'm being so selfish and thoughtless. Someone help me set my head straight, please. I don't want to mess this up or hurt him further.

I am a 42F and have been dating a 40M for four months. He has 50% custody of his children and coaches their sports so even when he doesn’t have them he stays busy with them. We live very close so when we are able to spend time together it is very easy to do so. From the beginning he has never been a big texter which is very different for me. About six weeks in when we established we weren’t seeing other people I brought up the communication in a way that I thought was positive… and it went no where. He later mentioned that it triggered him as this was apparently an issue with his ex wife. There are times where I can really tell he is trying, but most days it is one, maybe two texts. There have also been several times that we have gone a day or two without any communication. I make sure I am doing my fair share of initiating as well. About three months in we had “the talk” and confirmed that we are in a relationship and I felt it was appropriate to bring this up again and explain more where I am coming from. It also triggers me when I don’t hear from him, I assume his feelings have changed and that he is no longer interested in this relationship. I am very independent and love my alone time, I am ok with going one to three weeks without seeing him. I’m not asking for more time with him, but just more consistent communication. Not all day, everyday… but a “good morning beautiful” text can make a girls entire day! I find myself making excuses for him: he’s busy, he has his kids, he doesn’t feel well.

Am I being unreasonable in my expectations? This is my first serious relationship since getting divorced so I am still learning. I am at the point where I feel like I need to end the relationship, my needs are not getting met. He has so many amazing qualities and I know how awful online dating and dating in general is at this age.

The two I met, I wasn't excited about to begin with, but am trying to keep an open mind and you never know how things might go in person. These two wanted to get together again, but here's some insight as to why I turned those down and why I'm still talking to the third.

All of them, it occurs to me, have not mentioned my looks once. Obviously, they found my photos attractive or wouldn't have matched, so it has been refreshing that the focus hasn't been about my looks and the conversation has been more substantive.

Guy #1: he was boring, but also much more boring in his texting and in person than his photos belied, which looked all sorts of adventurous, exciting, and fun-loving. He talked about money several times, which I hate, and picked his teeth with a skewer from his drink. That teeth-picking was probably a sub-conscious thing, but such a turn-off.

Guy #2: he was engaging in person, but also so damn pushy about everything and insisting on giving me a ride even though I said I didn't need one, and suggesting we get together to watch a movie together and hang out at each other's places. It's good to be assertive sometimes, but you have to read the damn room before crossing into creeper territory. Even if the intentions are innocent, from a woman's perspective, coming on so strong and trying to create situations where you're physically in control like in a car or trying to come over, can be disconcerting.

Although Guy #3 and I haven't met yet, we have been consistently in touch and talking about lots of different topics. I like the consistency a lot. I know the general advice, which I agree with, is to meet as soon as possible if there's a vibe, but it can't be helped at the moment. I hope if we do get to meet, things haven't fizzled out by then. 

So I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you (men) have gone on meet and greets with women that seem to have gone well, but don't lead to other dates, it might be because you've done something sub-consciously that was a turn-off to her, which out of politeness she would never tell you, or maybe it was her and not you at all e.g., she's talking to someone else she's interested in more, or wasn't too jazzed about the date to begin with (which is not on you either), etc. And also, if you feel like you haven't had much success on OLD getting responses, if you've been trying to flatter women with opening lines like, ""gorgeous,"" or ""you're so beautiful,"" ""hi, you're cute af,"" you may want to change up your tactic a bit.

And I didn’t expose myself to my ex for the last decade or so of our marriage, so no one who matters has “seen” me for a very very long time. Meanwhile, my already shy nature actually has something to be shy about as I advance in age. 

This new guy I’m talking to and have seen a couple of times now might have potential. Now I’m getting really nervous. I might start to like him. What if he sees me naked and his eyes start burning because I have stretchmarks from my pregnancy 17 years ago!? Or because my boobs look a lot better in my fancy bras (gravity is evil!). Oh and the butt and thighs that look good in jeans???…. damn cellulite! 

The thought of it makes me panic. I can’t be the only one who looks better in clothes right? What to do if things advance? I would think staying under the covers and keeping the room pitch black only works for so long.

I don’t live under a rock so am very much aware of the body-positive movement. But right now, I feel how I feel, so I need a strategy that will allow me to keep things moving despite my anxiety. I don’t have low self esteem I promise. I’m healthy and active and live a productive life. I’m just very aware of my aesthetic decline and right now way too self conscious to expose myself.

I texted him the next day saying I enjoyed the date and we should plan something soon. He replied that he also enjoyed the date but felt no connection.

Anyways, mostly looking for male opinions on what this typically might mean. I tend to think it was a physical attraction thing, based on what I’ve read on here in similar posts.

My geographical location seems to be an issue but I mean: they knew where I am to begin with and as my profile says, for me distance is not an issue. I have the means, and the willingness to travel and visit if needed. I don’t understand!

This may be a long one……
Got a message from a guy who had recently broke up with his girlfriend (month or so). We messaged for hours the first night, text for hours the next night and talked for hours the next few nights. We finally met for dinner, it went well. We both had a nice time. He called me when he got home and said goodnight as always and said he had a nice time and hated for the night to end. The next day he sent me the normal morning message so I asked what he was thinking about our date and he said once again he had a great time but wasn’t sure he was ready to move on from his ex. I was ok with that bc it hadn’t been as long as I thought since the break up and we decided to give it time and keep in touch. Come to find out he is back with his girlfriend (I finally just asked him straight up).
So, we have been talking close to a month now and he still texts me good morning and goodnight and random texts throughout the day.
Well, I’m still on the dating app and I finally decided to go out with someone and I told him (he tells me when he is with his girl). Anyway, now he makes remarks about “your new man”, even asked about the date and continues to make comments.
Does anyone know what kind of game he is playing? Is it a game? I am widowed (almost 2 years) after a 26 year marriage and I really suck at this dating thing. 
If anyone has any advice, I could use it.
