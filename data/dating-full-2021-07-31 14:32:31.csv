This building was made in the 1940's, everything about is old. The floors creak, the walls chime in whenever they like, and you can hear your neighbor's phone conversation down the hall. 

But if there's anything worse than living here, it's got to be that damn rattling A.C window unit. I call it the window unit from hell. A big bulky, boxy A.C unit that hangs out my window, PUTTING, RATTLING, HISSING sometimes even smoking piece of junk I've ever seen.

This thing is a fire hazard if I've ever seen one. I've complained to the landlord many times about this, but he doesn't care. He'll say things like ""Be there in the morning"" but of course he never shows up.

The only good thing here is the view of the city. Living all the way up on the 10th floor can have its perks. If you look down you can see the parking lot below. The view is amazing.

Anyways, one day, on a hot summer, I decided to turn this piece of junk on, you know to cool off and it immediately started rattling. This caught my cat's attention, perking up his little ears. 

Full of awareness, Patterson decided to jump on the A.C unit. As he did, the box started to teeter like a see-saw. I jumped, yelling ""Patterson, no!"" this must've startled the little guy cause he Immediately sprung into action and dove off of the rattling machine.

As he did, the A.C unit fell out the window. It fell out the window... The unit fell out the WINDOW AND DROPPED 10 STORIES DOWN, and smashed into someone's Cadillac.

The owner of the vehicle must've been a crip or a blood, because he instantly made a phone call and his boys arrived in five minutes after the incident. 

I saw the guys look at me and point in my direction and made their way upstairs. I took Patterson and hid in the closet. 

""Bad boy! bad boy!"" I said to the little guy as his ears laid backward. But then I kissed him and apologized because I love him and I couldn't imagine my life without him.

BANG! BANG! The front door was kicked open. 10 men with guns poured inside my living room. One guy even had a GRENADE. I watched this all unfold through a broken slat of the closet door. 

""I know you're in here you piece of shit!"" said the owner of the vehicle with the extended warranty. He had a long scar across his right eye, he had a red bandana over his head and carried an uzi with an extended clip. This man looked like his name could be CONRAD.

I tried hard to maintain quiet. I had my hand over Patterson's mouth to keep him from meowing. He has a hard time keeping quiet in bad situations.

One time the landlord walked into my apartment to collect rent and I faked not being home by hiding in the closet with Patterson, and all he did was meow and gave away my position.

"" YOU GONNA DIE ASSHOLE!!!""  Conrad yelled at the top of his lungs. The men searched the tiny apartment, flipping over the couch, kicking in the microwave door, opening cabinets, and throwing the china across the living room.

One guy even kicked my computer monitor with the heels of his boot, just for shits and gigs.

""He's not here"" whispered one man to Conrad. The men regrouped and started out the door. Relieved, I took a deep breath. For a moment I felt safe, and suddenly, ""Meooww""... came out of Patterson 's tiny mouth.

""THE CLOSET!"" Conrad screamed. He ripped the closet door opened, pulling it off its hinges. Conrad pulled me out of the closet by the neck of my T-shirt. I caught of glimpse of Patterson dashing towards the hallway. 

""Please don't hurt me"" I begged Conrad, as he shoved me to the living room floor.

What should i do to get her out of my head? I mean she obiviously is cute, not gonna lie. But im sure a boy like me would have no chance with her.

So you’re down on your luck, you hate apps, but you give ONE LAST girl a chance. Well, technically the last girl was the one last girl, but this is the one you remembered you were supposed to get coffee with today and both of you forgot. 

You send her a voice memo and she responds, saying you can come to her friends film premiere and the after party. You attend, expecting the worst, almost bailing last minute, but…you both hit it off. You get along so well that people think you’ve been dating for months—if not years—and you just met three hours ago. You even agree that no matter what happens, you’ll always be friends—and you mean it? This girl is an actress, director, writer and won an international beauty pageant… like actually. She’s prettier than you and smarter than you. She’s also kinda the opposite of you in many good ways (powerful socialite, conscientious and productive, not depressed) and some neutral (she’s sober/non-judgmental about it and very religious, you don’t really care about religion but you’re open-minded). 

When she walks you out of the party, you banter for a long while before she admits she’s waiting to have sex until marriage. She doesn’t even kiss anyone who isn’t her boyfriend. Whoa. This is something you would NEVER have been okay with in the past. Huge dealbreaker. You low key still kinda wanna do kinky shit with strangers and see what you’re capable of, but you also haven’t been enjoying random stuff much at all for years now, so maybe that’s a lie you tell yourself.

20M in college, my parents and I live in a suburb about 20 min north of my college campus. I lived on campus my first year in a dorm, great experience, met lots of people. However, now ive been living with my parents and commuting for a few years now, and it’s mainly for a few reasons:


1. I have very high aspirations for my future after college, I want to work for a company in a big city, get a job in the field I love, while I also get my masters part time while working (company would sponsor). I want to get out of the midwest. I have a job that I have been working for during this summer and my lab scientist told me I can work throughout the school year part time. So I can make money while taking classes. while I could afford an apartment with friends and go to bars and house parties, I really would hate for my paycheck to just be going to rent, when I live 20 min away and could drive down to meet friends and hangout, so I want to save that money


2. Sure, I’m not “in the college scene”, but I have in person classes, have season tickets for football, and I’m planning on joining clubs to be more involved on in campus related activities. My day is just, leaving in the morning, being on campus all day, coming home at 7 for dinner and repeat. And yeah sure, I guess I can’t go down and party on weekends, but I see that as something that would hold me back if I overindulge (I would binge drink and smoke so much weed my freshman year on campus, like every weekend). Even thought being at home sucks, I’m saving money, focused on myself and not succumbing to things I would be distracted from, while also getting the benefits of being on campus and being engaged with on campus activities.



3. Party life is cool, but I know if I take part in it too much I will be offset from my goals. I found myself first year really just having FOMO if I wasn’t at a bar or party on the weekend and doing work, I almost like had to not be sober because it was “cool” to do that stuff to be social. When I live 20M away I don’t even have that thought. If I lived with friends I really think I’d be distracted, the apartments down there are also just a rip off for how much you pay. My campus is near the city, so there’s high crime rates in off campus housing, and the area is a bit rundown. Not the best investment for the college experience, especially when your at the risk of getting pepper sprayed or robbed on any given night coming back from classes.

I talked to my “friends” about this and they were saying how I look “weak” and “unattractive” because I’m a 20M living at home, and that if I did meet a girl she would be turned off at the fact that I commute to campus. I honestly didn’t believe them and thought it was a load of bullshit because no one actually thinks like that.

I have a friend around my age, and she's really really shy, but I'm as chirpy as they come, and can hold conversations well so that wasn't a problem, one day she randomly asked to hig me and we did.. and well one thing led to another and we ended up hooking up. 

This went on for quite some time.. until one day while we were err... Together.. and she said she loved me. I felt it was too early and wasn't sure of my feelings.. so I didn't say it back.

This happened I think 2-3 times, my smooth brain chalked it up as heat of the moment thing. Eventually we stopped hooking up , cause she said It feels too emotional after for her..
Fair enough.

Now it's not like I didn't have feelings for her, but I wanted to confess In a better way (hopeless romantic that way), so I tried to know what she really wanted..
So I asked directly.. do you want me to be with me ? She sorta froze and replied... 'Idk what do you want?'

Well I wanted to tell her about my feelings..but before I could, she started giving me the cold shoulder.. stopped initiating conversations as well.

I tried talking to her and asking what happened, as usual no proper response.. and because it started to feel one sided.. although her replies were always instantaneous, I backed off.
I take is seriously, if I feel a girl has no interest, don't want to overstep my boundaries or chase someone or make em feel uncomfortable.

As a result, didn't even wish her on her birthday, we r still added on social media, haven't blocked or anything just don't talk.

BUT.. she wished me on mine.. and she randomly still comments on my posts.

My friend set me up with her friend a few weeks ago and we have been talking primarily through text since then. The entire time I have been trying to take her out on a date and for the past couple of weeks I have been attempting to arrange plans to do so. Our schedules don't align most of the time which is why finding a window when we are both available is incredibly difficult.

Once the day and plans were established I continued checking in every now and then to confirm it was happening to which she would always reply yes. All was going great until the day before we were supposed to get together and she told me she only wanted for us to be friends.

I suggested we still get together. Instead, we don't think of it as a date - simply a way for us to get to know each other better. She agreed to it until the next day, a few hours before the get together, when she said she needed to do something with her father.

I keep getting the suspicion that she's afraid of starting anything serious. The friend who set us up told me about how she had a bad experience dating in the past and is worried about things moving too fast in a relationship. Is it possible she's trying to end this before it even starts?

I want to believe she's still interested in being at least friends considering how she said she enjoys our talks and still reaches out to me to this day, but I keep getting the suspicion that she doesn't want us to meet in person despite her always agreeing to make plans to do so. How can I get her to be honest with me? What can I do to make her feel safe with me?

A lot of the girls I bring back say they are really into sex, some into fetishes, etc. but I can never bring myself to just say ""please give me a bj."". Maybe I should just be this forthcoming about it?

I think my main reservation is, as much as I just want oral sex, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

Not sure where to post the question since I’m not asking for advice, so forgive me if this is the wrong place. 

I recently asked someone out who I’ve known for a little while and had good chemistry with. She let me down very graciously and said she still wanted to be friends. I said that was totally fine. 

I don’t necessarily plan on hanging out with her in the future, but I’m glad we’re on friendly terms. It’a a bit of a shame since she kept hinting that she wanted to do a bunch of things with me and explore the outdoor areas I’m familiar with. 

That very same night she said no, I went to the bar with my friends. We ended up hopping around and ran into another group of friends. Ironically we ended up at the same club/bar the woman who I asked out goes to a lot.  
 
I had this sense that I was going to see her there and sure enough there she was, with the guy she’s apparently seeing. It’s a crowded space so even though she was there, we could have easily missed each other. I do my best to keep it cool and then she *comes up to us* to “say hi.” She’s all over her guy while they’re talking to us and I’m just thinking about the lack of awareness. I wouldn’t personally go up to someone I just rejected that same day and say “hi” while I was with the person I’m seeing. 

I don’t know, it just felt like it was being rubbed into my face. I was cordial and they left shortly after. Kind of ruined my night but it was ok, I just end up dealing with things like that so much that it genuinely feels like I’m being trolled. Anyone else?

Not sure if I am venting or asking for advice or both. Talked to this guy on a dating app for 2 weeks before we met. We clicked immediately over text and had similar personalities &amp; senses of humor. We texted till 2 AM on multiple occasions about our thoughts on children, marriage, religion, life, etc. It felt very comfortable. He even had expensive flowers delivered to my work the day before for the date with a note saying he was excited to meet me. He said he normally doesn't do a grand gesture like that before meeting, but he just felt like he needed to do something special for me.

The date went great, right from the start. Immediate chemistry. We were joking, laughing and flirting like we had known each other for years. Very touchy-feely as well. I even kissed him first cause I just couldn't wait any longer. I have been on enough bad dates to know when I have a good one. The date lasted over 6 hours and ended with him dropping me back off at my house and kissing in my drive-way for quite some time. We had briefly mentioned during the date about hanging out again but nothing concrete. He texted me when he got home and we talked until we fell asleep. Then the next day, we had some small talk over text but nothing like before- something felt off. I figured we were both exhausted from the date and didn't want to smother each other so I didn't think much of it but I couldn't ignore the weird gut feeling I had that something was wrong.

Now it is has been a whole week since the date and we small talk over text once or twice a day but nothing compared to what we had before we met. He will just send me a snapchat of him or his dogs and captions it ""I miss your face"", or he will send me a text about something irrelevant. No staying up late texting or anything close to romantic. The closest thing to that was him texting me asking ""Do you miss me yet?"" which came across as a fuckboy thing to do, if I do say so myself. I confronted him over text earlier this week asking why communication had slowed and he assured me that nothing was wrong. I thought maybe after that, he would reach out more often but he hasn't. ***Now I could reach out first or ask him out again, but why would I when I feel I am already being slowly rejected?*** I don't want to seem needy either.

I really did like him and it was very apparent we had chemistry. So what gives? He won't ghost me. But he hasn't asked me out again either, or make it known he is interested in continuing to pursue me romantically. A guy who was interested would have already asked me on another date. I am just going to take the hint and walk.

My friend had a thing for me at the time. I eventually made a move, and we went out for a month and realized that there’s something off so we decided to break it off.  Things were a bit rocky at first but now we are very close friends.

 But here’s where the situation lies… 
She introduced me to her sister when she was visiting before our thing happened and had such a good chemistry. But didn’t act on it since at the time she was living in a different country. We’ve been texting each other ever since and now that she lives in the same city,  she always tells me that we should do something someday. But I never ask her out because I know we have that chemistry and something might happen.

You see the thing is chatting online for me is easy but I'm not looking for online right now. I don't know how to meet people in person, how to find people to introduce myself to and talk to in real life.

What annoys me is I don't even really want to be especially social in the sense that I'm not really interested in clubs and bars. I don't care about activities and performances I just want the opportunity to make my presence known so people know that I exist. I just want to introduce myself to people and get to know someone on a date.

I haven't had one in years and it really upsets me because I'm not a bad guy. I just don't know what to do to even have a chance in the first place. You can't win a game if you're never able to play.

Often when I'm outside people are with friends, with family or with their partner. I can't approach people, I'm shy and it doesn't look like anyone wants to be approached because they're all busy or taken.

I'm not your average confident man, I don't talk loudly and can be quite shy. I'm not especially lively or expressive, being social just doesn't come naturally to me like it does for most people. It doesn't help that I'm always on my own because I don't have friends. I'd just like someone to give a chance.

How do I meet people and make friends? How do I talk to women and get dates?

I've (29F) gone on three dates with this guy within a couple weeks. The first date was great, we talked for a few hours over drinks and seemed to have a lot in common. We texted all week and I was looking forward to the second date, but it was just...fine. It felt like the first date all over again, not like we had gotten to know each other much better. I left it thinking I was just getting friend vibes, not really a romantic connection. Decided to give him a third try though, and I don't think that changed how I feel. We've had no physical connection besides the semi-awkward side hug, and to be honest I don't think I've given him much of a chance to make a move for a kiss because I don't feel very physically attracted to him and I think that has made me physically stand-offish.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room.

He's leaving next weekend. So I asked him when he will be back and he said he doesn't know, when he gets bored/tired he'll come back. He works remotely so there's no rush for him to come back for a job. We walked around a bit after and he asked if I'd like to come over to his apartment Wednesday evening (before he leaves) to watch Luca and meet his roommate and his dog. I said okay and we could discuss more later. But now I'm at home and reflecting about the situation.

Should I be suspicious about going over to his place since he's going away with an undetermined return date? Should I tell him I actually can't go? He's a quiet, introverted guy and a little awkward. So far he hasn't been forward and tried to kiss me or anything during the first two days, but he's a covid conscious guy so I attributed it to that.

Before we begin, I think it's necessary to give you the context of my relationship with her. About a year ago I went to write entrance exams and when I was done and was waiting outside for a friend, I began having small talk with a group of girls who were sitting next to me. There was one girl among them who was really cute and funny, so we exchanged social media and started talking. Eventually, we started going on dates and things were going pretty well, with her even directly telling me we're not just friends. However, Greece went into a second lockdown and we lost contact.

2 months later she messages me out of the blue. She responds almost instantly and seems really willing to talk to me. She eventually started being flirty again, sending hearts and saying stuff like ""I can't wait to see you again"". 4 months into lockdown she got tired of waiting and ask me out. I was really excited and was happy to see her, but she mentioned something I wasn't expecting. She casually told me she has a boyfriend.

I tried to take it and move on, but she kept messaging me in a way her boyfriend wouldn't be fond of. She once even sent me a picture without her shirt on to ""have a look at her new tattoo"". I was really confused, but I kept being patient and at some point, she finally told me she broke up with him. I ask her if she wanted to meet up and she said yes, so I thought I finally had a shot, but I got bamboozled,

When we met up, all she did was go on and on about how bad her ex treated her. Don't get me wrong, I care about her, but I felt I was just her shoulder to cry on. A friend. That's what she kept calling me that day and she even mentioned there's another guy she's interested in dating. I decided to stop playing around and mentioned a female friend of mine (without telling her what my relationship with her is) to see her reaction. She seemed really concerned and even asked to see a picture of her. At this point, I didn't know what's her deal and decided to wait until our next meetup.

When we met up again, she told me she and that other guy are now officially dating. She then asked me if there's anyone I'm interested in, but I told her it was complicated. The rest of the night ran smoothly, but I was still trying to make sense out of her behavior, so I decided to mention my friend again. This time she asked me ""Is she your friend?"". I tried to avoid the question but she kept insisting I tell her. I eventually told her she and I have once had crushes on each other but decided to go our separate ways because she was planning to major overseas. She then said, ""Once she's back in town, ask her out. I'm sure she'll say yes."".

We happened to speak today and she told me she's still with that other guy. I honestly don't know what to do. I want to get an answer from her, but I don't know if it's a good idea to be upfront with her or not. Why is she leading me on, but then goes with another guy when she's single? Why did she get jealous when I told her about my friend, but still encouraged me to ask her out? Why does she keep calling me her friend, when she has admitted in the past she didn't see me that way?

I tried indirectly mentioning our ""cute moments"" and she doesn't even try to change the subject.

We got along real well but never knew each other too well. We'd see each other at parties and have quick, cute chats.

Fast forward, a year later, we run into each other at the supermarket and have a longer chat and actually exchange numbers. She says we should get a drink. Turns out her relationship is ending, but slowly.

I try to plan a drink but she cancels and then later flakes out. I give her space because I'm not sure of the situation and don't want to get my hopes up. I like her and don't want just a hook up and feel confused.

I don't reach out for 6 months when I run into her again. She reminds me of the drink, I text her a week later and she seems excited to meet up and we make vague plans for the next day (because of work) but I text her the next day to confirm, but she doesn't respond.

6 months later, she follows me on instagram and I'm hesitant, but follow back and we chat, it's the pandemic and she says she wants to hang out. Bars are closed. She knew where I lived and apparently comes around my way a lot, so I just tell her to let me know when she's around next, and I'll meet her for a walk in my neighborhood.

I never hear from her. I comment on a few of her instagram stories, but never ask her out. We chat a bit, but it's covid, so everything is closed.

Two months later I run into her on the street. She says hi but then walks away.

I think we're done now.

Two months later, she reaches out and asks if I want to go for a walk. I say yes and we do. It's ok, kinda feels platonic but I'm also confused by her. It's perfectly fine and we feel like old friends, but I also don't know her. After the walk, she has things to do so we make plans for another time.

Next time I text her and ask her if she wants to get a coffee, she doesn't respond.

I mute her on instagram and delete her number.

It's been 4 months now and she still looks at all my instagram stories and occasionally gives reactions.

I just ignore it but am confused.

When we game, he gets too aggressive when he rages and I don't appreciate how he rages at me at times. I asked him to tone it down and control his tone, but deems it as special treatment and I'm being too sensitive and that he does it to everybody he plays with. I played with two of his friends and it was more playful banter than just groaning and insults. I have friends I shit talk to but we aren't insulting to each other. If we do, we apologize and fix it so it doesn't happen again. This has happened three times within the last two weeks, not including the multiple times before. We've argued about this before and I expected a change even as a friend, but it's gotten to a point where my patience is growing extremely tired of it. We've split from gaming with each other on this game today, but I feel the beginning of an end.

I am a (26M) that’s been seeing this girl (23F) for the past 4 months. Things were off to a great start and this past weekend, I was going to take her out to a nice dinner and officially ask her to be my girlfriend. But things turned for the worst. 

A week ago, her supposed “ex boyfriend” had DM’d me a video on Instagram of them making out and was holding the special gift I had gotten her the weekend before. After I had seen that video, I was in a weird place and was depressed the last couple of days. It turns out that she was pretty much living a double life. 

We met up at a bar and she explained to me that her and her ex’s relationship was still existent. Long stories short, she met him in a sugar baby/daddy website 3 years ago and was providing for her. She also met another man on the website during the earlier stages of our relationship. In total, she was seeing 3 men including myself according to her words, but possibly more in my opinion. The two men are all in their early 40s and 50s. I didn’t know how to process this information since she had told me from when we had started dating, the relationship with her ex was non-existent.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room.

I am not sure where I am going wrong.

When dating men, fair, I have created this expectation that I want to feel their masculine energy in their ability to plan a first date. In my mind, if someone can plan a date, I feel more secure and think we will likely be more compatible. Ability to plan is important to me - so in a first date it can be a good indication, anywho. So when texting on dating apps, I show signs that I'm interested and open the door for them to ask me. Things go well until they ask me to go on the date and I say yes. Then this phenomenon starts to happen. ''So what you thinking?'', ''Any suggestions?'', '''whats your perfect date?''. I then say something like ''I am open to anything'', ''my suggestion if for you to give me suggestions'' or ''my perfect date is one that I don't plan''. And then the teeth pulling begins. Text: drinks? (Okay fair date idea.) Me: Yeah, sure where? Them: I don't know./hmm. Not sure? WHAT?! Pick a freaking place dude. Anywhere! (we are generally in the same area) Theres soooo many places. It's a freaking first date, who cares! If I don't like your suggestion ill tell you so - but like why wouldn't I be okay with your suggestion? I feel like the best dates are the ones that are straight forward, have a date, place and time. I just want to be able to enter my feminine energy and let the man lead. I feel like this is hard nowadays... Why are men so afraid of taking the lead on a first date?

I am an Irish twin and was always very close to my older sister. It was easier for my parents to lump us together and since we went along with it so happily it just happened that it worked out that I was basically just moved up a grade in most social settings. My sister's friends were my friends, her interests mine and so on and so forth. And, while I enjoyed growing up like this, I've since come to realize that I think this might have had more of a negative effect on my than I thought.

I was a late bloomer. To name a few of the curses that plagued me, I had a horrible sense of fashion, a big forehead, crippling anxiety, that ungodly hormonal acne, a gigantic butt, and about a hundred things more. Meanwhile, my sister has always been gorgeous. From the moment she was old enough to get a boy's attention, she's had it. She had long legs and great muscles, all the things I never had. She was skinny with pretty skin that never got acne. I was always a little jealous, and to be honest I still am. But her luck didn't stop there. Beyond being gorgeous, t she was charismatic and extroverted, and drew people to her effortlessly. Even as children, the guys we played with innocently flocked to her, while I always ran along behind trying to catch up. Boys ALWAYS had a crush on her, and I, jealously wished to be just the same. Obviously, she was a big hit with with the guys throughout our most formative years, meanwhile the most I got was that I was ""a lovely young flower waiting to bloom"", or, even worse ""she's got a great personality"" (which I did and do have, thank you very much--I am funny as hell).

Whelp, I'm struggling to feel like I've bloomed. I'm 24 and after years of anxiety, depression, and endometriosis doing its damage, I've settled into a mediocre human being. (wow, don't I sound sad. Trust me, sometimes I look in the mirror and think I'm hot shit). I'm moderately sized, although I usually end up being the fat friend, which is never the most encouraging female. Hormonal acne has remained my closest companion and probably will remain as long as my body continues to tear itself apart from the inside, and I'm still just a bit too shy and socially anxious to light up the room when I walk in the way my sister does. My forehead is still big, though I've learned to live and work with it, I've sort of figured out how to dress myself, and it turns out the proper term is dummy thicc and not, fat. Over all, I've grown up and for a while I was thinking I hadn't done too bad. I would have maybe called myself a 7, and if you take things like a great sense of humor and a little cute nerd behavior into consideration, maybe even an 8.

But, my friends, we're fading fast.

I've had a few attempts at dating. They've all ended fairly quickly, mostly because the guys who seem to actually be interested usually turn out to be very desperate and pushy, like their starved for water and I'm the water bottle that got left in the car last week and is now tepid and gross. It's like, I'm not what they want, but they're desperate for satisfaction, so I'll do for now. It's not exactly the most wonderful feeling, and I've almost just given up looking entirely because of it. I always did my best not to base my self worth off of male attention, I don't think it's a healthy way for anyone to live their life, and yet, feeling like nobody would want you is a hard thought to shake, and there's something a little humiliating about your friend getting bought a drink by that hot guy at the bar while you sit there and try not to acknowledge the creep in the back whose been making weird faces at you all night.

That being said, I've persevered until recently.

My self confidence took a HUGE digger last summer. Around that time, I'd come to realize that for me, it's important to know the person I'm dating before we agree to date. I really need a friendship before I can move on to something bigger. That being said, that's easier said than done, and so I'd been bemoaning that fact all year. Then, my sister got engaged and planned a wedding and the most amazing thing happened. The best man was a guy who'd I'd grown up with since a tiny tot, and who I was very familiar with. ANd...he'd gotten hot. And because fortune smiled upon me, it got even better: he was single and *looking*.

I couldn't have imagined anything more perfect. Apparently, as his family was friends with mine, our mothers had been chatting and this guy was really wanting to find a girl who could match pace with him--who was into adventures but not clingy, who liked the outdoors and animals, but also liked providing space. I was like ""hello, avid trail rider, hunter, hiker, and introvert??? I am the woman he has been waiting for??"" Honestly, he was too perfect, and that probably should have been the first hint that this wouldn't work. But, I tried anyway. As the wedding approached, I did my best to both be forward enough for him to get the idea I was interested, but not intrusive. I didn't want to be annoying, I only wanted to put the idea in his head.

Either I'm \*very\* subtle, or I'm so average I'm invisible, because I'm here talking about the way my self confidence took a digger. He barely even noticed me. 

Now, if you've made it this far I applaud you, it's a lot. But, thankfully, we've finally reached the summary where I ask for advice.  I'm a young woman who knows that confidence is sexy, but is struggling to overcome being the unsexy ""blooming flower"" all her life and start to believe she's desirable. I'm still staggering from a rejection because, *for once*, it was someone I genuinely was attracted to and **really** wanted to try a relationship with, and it was almost like I was invisible or maybe even worse, actively not wanted. I cannot help but hear the voices that say I'm undesirable. I cannot help but hear the voices that say ""if you just did \_\_\_"" or ""if you just fixed \_\_\_\_ guys would actually be interested"". And, I KNOW those voices aren't fair. I know that self-confidence is attractive, and hell, I even know that I am a great person with so much going for her. But, how do I fight off the sting of rejection, and how to I pick myself back up and get myself in the ring when it's so engrained in me that I'm not that appealing? How do I look at myself and tell myself I'm likable/desirable when there never seem to be any relationships/interested guys around to prove it?
