He drove an hour and a half to meet up with me (which i didn’t know until after we met up) because he went back home after the school year and im still on campus. We basically talked until four in the morning and he just kept telling me how much of a fun time he had and how he hadn’t felt like this in a long time. Now I’m still talking to multiple people so I kind of felt like I was doing him dirty for some reason even though it was just one date. I haven’t done anything physical with other guys or even him but I just feel kind of guilty for some reason like if he feels serious about me and im talking to other guys, is that wrong? We do have another date planned and this time I’m the one driving to him but I don’t know if this is when I should stop talking to other guys? We did meet on tinder so I thought it would be kind of obvious that I would be talking to other dudes but I don’t know...

3,nbvs3b,1620951821,Dating apps crushed my self esteem and I don’t know how to meet women.,"I’ve been using Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge for the past 2 years and it’s just been crushing. I always thought I was average looking and at least one woman’s type but now I see that not a single girl my age in a hundred mile radius thinks I’m attractive enough to match with.

I’m guessing I’ll delete them soon, they’re not serving me any purpose other than a reminder that I’m unattractive. I don’t know how else to meet women I don’t know. 

I constantly hear online and from girls and guys I know that if I approach a woman and she’s not attracted to me she’ll feel uncomfortable and think I’m creepy, so I don’t think that’s an option. Even if it was I don’t even see how striking up a conversation with a random woman I don’t know I could go well in person. I’m too awkward and anxious for that.

I’ve tried just striking up a conversation with a girl I had class with once and it was so awful and embarrassing. The look on her face and body language the second I said hi to her showed me that she didn’t want anything to do with me. I almost wanted to drop that class because I was so embarrassed and I know that I’ll be known as that creepy ugly guy that tried to hit on her in class.

4,nbvtzc,1620952004,Choosing to stay friends,"(Posting here same as r/relationship_advice)

We were really good friends before we started unofficially seeing each other that lasted for six months and counting. It was unofficial since I’m moving soon and we both figured we’ll just enjoy the extra company til then. Ended up getting along really well, more than when we were just friends. Sleeping next to each other every night, eating lunch and dinner together, going on trips, saying i love yous and really opening up with one another.. Finally had the talk last night and, well, long story short it was decided that remaining friends would be the best because that’s the relationship that has the potential to last longer (as opposed to ldr). We want to be part of each other’s lives for a really long time.

I know it’s the right move but it doesn’t hurt any less. Deep down there’s always a small hope that things will work out. If it’s meant to be and all.

I’m not here asking for advice on my situation. Just hoping to hear from people who’s been in the similar situation... feeling just very alone at the moment.

6,nbw7sk,1620953168,"Girl moved, minimal contact, visiting soon","I (29M) was dating a girl (20F) for 6 months. It was very passionate and the most intimate I have ever been with another person. We tell each other we love one another. She's now been home for a month and in another two weeks she's coming back to visit me for a week. Since she's been gone we have talked sporadically. Probably 4 or 5 times on the phone, of which I either called her or told her to call me when she was free. We've had maybe one or two texting conversations that go past quick surface level stuff. I've sent her music, articles, podcasts, etc hoping to have a real conversation, but she's either really slow to respond (1-2 days), doesn't engage them much, or says she'll look at it later when she's free and never gets around to it. She even sent me a quote she liked the other day and i sent back some thoughts on it to which she didn't respond. She does contact me several times a week out of the blue saying that she misses me, sending a song, nudes, or snapchat, but it never goes past surface level communication even when I try. 

I think part of this is likely due to the age difference. Also, she's introverted (not extremely though) so not naturally one to be talking all the time. I wasn't sure what to expect communication wise when she went back home, but it was more than this. I wouldn't care as much if she wasn't coming to visit in a couple weeks. It just feels strange going from spending all of our free time together for months, talking about being in love, crying together and having really passionate moments to minimal &amp; surface level communication. I'm wondering if she thinks about these things the same way I do. Does it seem like I'm over thinking all of this? I'm genuinely not concerned about any other dudes she might be seeing. We are not doing long distance and I'm just not worried about that in general. I feel as though I have extended my hand enough and think I am going to quit contacting her until she calls me.

11,nbwus8,1620955082,I feel like I'm purseing this girl too much and want to back off. Is this a bad move on my part? M28 F26,"**First I'd like to apologize for the length of this post, but can really use some insight**

I've been seeing this girl (not exclusively) for roughly about a month now. We've been on two dates, which were both awesome. The first date resulted in me staying over at her place for the night and getting brunch together the next day (no sex, which is fine with me). The second date we grabbed drinks and went back to her place. Made to to third-base this time. She's wanting to take things slow and I want to respect that (so still no sex). I initiated the invitation for both occasions, which is expected since I am the guy... no problem. 

When we're around eachother it just flows. It feels natural and there are no awkward moments. The problem is the time between dates. We both have demanding and busy jobs throughout the day so we don't text eachother much if ever. That's fine and dandy. In the evening, there's more downtime and I often find that we only exchange 1-3 text messages that really go nowhere. I'm in full understanding that some people simply may not like to text and by no means to I want a deep and philosophical conversation. A simple ""how was you day?"" would suffice tbh.

Being out of town for about 2 weeks due to work, I gave her a call on Monday to chat. The conversation went quite well. As for the days following, there wasn't really much going on between us other than a random text here and there. Actually slower back and forths than usual, and even that was already spare. I had a phone call with her today and it was ""Okay."" I was asking her how her week has been and asked what she had planned for the weekend. I mentioned to her that I'd actually be back in town next Friday and she said that was ""exciting"". I was hoping she would've said something like ""hey we should do something"". Nothing.

I went ahead and dropped in that we should get together and do something and she said didn't know what she had planned but is overall down. I just felt this weird vibe so I simply just told her to let me know since I didn't want to pressure her. That was the end of that. 

The call was drying up, so I simply said I'd let her go and wished her a good night.

With all of that said I DO like this girl. She's very smart and very down to earth. The pain point is I'm not feeling the ""drive"" from her. I don't know if it's all just a mental thing and I'm just in my own head, but it's coming off as disinterst. But when we're on a date, its a different story. So it's somewhat draining me mentally and emotionally and I thinking of backing off a little. By that I mean not text as much, possibly text her every other day. Not call. Then regarding the invite for the date, I left the ball in her court to let me know. I think that if she's truly intersted she will get back to me mid/next week. If I hear nothing I'm basically done. Thoughts? I'm not going to drop her, but I really do need to see ""effot"" lack for a better term. I hope I don't sound selfish saying that. 

I'd love to hear everyone's feedback and advise on this.

If you would like to know my story, feel free to look through my previous posts on r/crushes. Long story short, I got rejected last April. We stopped texting/talking, but we’d always talk if we saw each other at church. I didn’t start going to her church until last fall so that’s when we actually started to see each other again.

I saw her on this past Easter Sunday and she asked if I would be interested in joining their youth team as a “leader”. I told her I may be and she said she’d text me the info to join. She kept saying that if I didn’t want to it’s fine and she understands. She sent me the info and I submitted an application. A couple weeks after that I was sitting down waiting for the service to start and she walked up to me. That was weird cause she usually doesn’t seek me out; we usually only talk if we mutually see each other. We don’t walk up to the other. She was really excited that I was interested in joining the team and she said that she may join too. Once again she kept saying that there’s no pressure to join, but she thinks I’d be a good fit. 

Her social media habits have been weird too. She views my story within an hour of me posting them, even though she used to not view them at all. And on Tuesday she liked a post that I posted at the end of March. She rarely liked my posts before. It’s not like she didn’t see it back then, she’s on Instagram a lot. Yesterday after my first time at the youth service I posted something about it on my story and she replied asking if I went. She asked me a few questions about and she was happy that I went. When I told her that the kids were really friendly and cool, she said “I’m so glad to hear that 🥺”. This was the first time in probably like 6 months that she replied to one of my stories.

Why is she being so nice and reaching out so much all of a sudden? I was thinking that maybe she’s only being nice so I’d join the youth team, but she’s definitely not the type to be fake to someone just to help out her church. She’s the type to just ignore people if she doesn’t like them or want to be around them. I don’t think that she’s doing this because she likes me, but I just don’t know why she’s now so different. If she did like me, I’d gladly go out with her. But after being rejected already, I would only ask her out again if I was certain she liked me back.

She kept rejecting him and in the texts I saw he basically called me convenient and a placeholder and that he imagines marrying her and starting a family.  He told her he would drop me for her. 

In the past two years we spent every day together and every other night together and I had 0 clues he felt this way because he would always tell me I’m his favorite person and I felt like I finally found a best friend and lover in one for the first time in my life.

I’d say my personal red flag was that he never introduced me as a girlfriend until 6 months in. But he also was extremely antisocial as well so the situation didn’t even present itself u until holidays came up anyway.

Also he would nitpick incredibly random things about me such as my nail color or my eyeliner being uneven and such small details that would sound ridiculous and no one else would ever notice. I would catch him staring at me out of the corner of my eye and he would never admit why. Was he looking for faults? Comparing me to her?

There is little to no empathy for men that are struggling to meet women, find connections, find relationships etc They are immediately only given blunt 'advice' and 'solutions' that they didn't even ask for, why do men need just get over issues of depression, trauma, abuse, poor self-esteem etc and somehow we're all just wallowing in self-pity and need to just get over anything bad that ever happens to us?  


It's extremely depressing and frustrating. It's like we're not allowed to just feel like we're in serious emotional/mental pain because we live in a society and culture that practically forbids men from ever expressing anything other than anger. It doesn't matter how many years of rejection, humiliation, mental or physical abuse we go through, it doesn't matter how often we feel hurt and in pain, as men we just need to get over these feelings and deal with them in private(hence why therapy is the golden ticket reply to anything regarding men; seek help out of sight and mind because no one wants to deal with it)  


I've read countless threads and posts from men here that share their struggles when trying to connect and find romantic relationships and then they're nitpicked to hell and back on how they're actually just a terrible person and deserve to live and die alone because they sound bitter and defeated and unless they conform to societal standards of physical beauty and format their personality into a highly commodified, socially acceptable personality(always positive and smiling, never showing anything remotely negative, ultra confident) then they deserve to suffer forever.  


There's a time and place for constructive feedback and advice but generally men are dogpiled on whenever they just want to vent and express their hurt/negative feelings when it comes to dating.  


Most people here are extremely insensitive and not very understanding, and it's not just here, it's a general thing in life. We're forever taught that we're never good enough as we are, and if we can't conform to societal expectations of physical beauty then we need to simply stay in our lane

31,nbzl6d,1620964009,Dating shouldn't be this hard...right?,"I'm 30F who is newish to being single. My last relationship lasted several years and I'm new to OLD world. I never thought the apps were great places to meet people even when I wasn't single (mostly hearing about sketchy men from friends) and when I finally broke down to try it myself I realized dating and dating online is AWFUL. Maybe it's just me and I'm not used to how being single should be now. But it seems no one has good intentions and everyone is out for fun... I enjoy being in  relationships and by going on these apps my morale has dropped tremendously. I've tried a lot of apps and have opened my mind up to dating people I may not go after. It's just frustrating and demoralizing really when someone like myself has true intentions and wants to find that person.

I guess my question is how do you keep your sanity and when you do meet someone how does it end?\*I still want to believe there are good people out there and that there is hope....",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nbzl6d/dating_shouldnt_be_this_hardright/
32,nbzmc8,1620964125,"Does my girlfriend have a superiority complex? If she does, how do I deal with it? (18M + 18F)","So I’ve known my girlfriend for over a year now and we’ve been dating for 9 months. I think she has a superiority complex and I confronted her about it and she got super mad at me and she’s saying she just says and does these things because she’s “comfortable” with me. I need to know what to do because it really annoys me and there’s so much I can’t talk about with her because of how she’ll react. Here are some things that make me think she does have a superiority complex:

- Always has to one-up me or people I know

Example: Whenever I mention any of the AP classes I’m taking like if I’m talking about homework or my grades or something that happened in class she immediately mentions how the classes Im taking are “the easiest APs” and that my school is “stupid” and her school is “so much harder like it’s known to be super hard and my school is so much better than urs urs is so weird”

Example 2: When I mention the sports I like or the sport my sister does she always tells me that the sport she does is so much harder and my sports aren’t even sports and they suck.

Example 3: Whenever I mention anything that paints my school in a good light she shuts me down and tells me my school is stupid and weird and hers is so much better.

- Constantly puts me and people I know down

Example: My sister recently got offered an almost-full ride package at an Ivy league school to row crew for them and whenever I talk about it with my girlfriend b/c it excites me and makes me happy and proud for my sister my girlfriend ALWAYS shuts me down and says that rowing is the easiest sport and that it isn’t even a sport and my sister got in just b/c she rows and the school she’s going to sucks and that college is a scam and tells me not to talk about it. 

- She puts down any girl I’ve ever been friends with or known or even interacted with. And she tells me that basically every girl that ever interacts with me is hitting on me. Early in our relationship she would CONSTANTLY question me about my female friends and would hyperfocus on one for a couple days and cry and make me show her my texts with them and tell me that they were hitting on me when they literally were not until I blocked them and then move on to the next one and so on and eventually I had blocked every single female friend I ever had. She also makes me tell her every single interaction I have with girls at school and when I tell her stuff even just that a girl was in my group she hyperfocuses on them and looks them up on instagram and compares herself to them and sometimes she says that they’re so much prettier than she is but other times she just straight up calls them ugly and pressures me into saying how they are so ugly like it’ll be like: “She’s so ugly look at the wrinkles on her skin she looks like a grandma” and i won’t say anything because even tho i’m not attracted to the girl i think its mean to call people ugly and she’ll be like “so do u not agree?” in a super combative voice and then ill literally be forced to agree with her and explain why the girl is ugly or else she gets super mad and sad.


- She ALWAYS has to be right and I can never be right. And she gets super defensive in arguments about stuff that literally doesn’t matter. 

Example: We sometimes used to talk about politics which is something I am really interested in and she would tell me her opinion and everything would be fine and then I’d start talking and explaining how I have a different opinion like really calmly explaining my different opinion and then she’ll get super defensive super quickly and she usually ends up shutting me up and literally tells me to stop talking.

- She rarely shows interest in stuff I’m interested in and passionate about

Example: Sometimes I send her songs I really like and ask her to listen to them and she rarely actually listens to them like I can only recall ONE time when she listened to a song I sent her. Like she doesn’t even consider listening she just straight up says “No” and moves on. Same goes with really anything else I want to show her like YouTube videos or instagram posts or movies I want to watch together. She shuts me down so quick she doesn’t even look up the movie that i ask her to watch with me she’s just like “No”

I’m confused tho because I’m the only one she acts like this around and when she talks to other people about me she likes to brag about my successes (even exaggerates sometimes which im uncomfortable with) so my question is does she have a superiority complex? Is it possible to have a superiority complex over one person, that person being me? And what can I do about this?

Tl;dr: My girlfriend does things that make me believe she has a superiority complex but I’m not sure if she really does or not and I’m wondering about what I can do about what she does because it really irritates and hurts me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nbzmc8/does_my_girlfriend_have_a_superiority_complex_if/

I think the conversation was getting dry because we talked very intensely about anything and everything but English is his second language and he's not exactly fluent yet. He talked a lot, and didn't ask me many questions but I put that down to nerves because I'm an English teacher and also because we've been in lockdown for such a long time. He was stupidly hot, as in I couldn't stop thinking about kissing him, and I don't think that has ever happened to me on a date before. It felt really nice spending time with him and I wanted to see him again. 

However, when I decided to leave I said ""I really enjoyed this"" and he said ""me too"". I didn't ask for a second date because the times I've done this the guys have ghosted me or have said ""you seem like you want something different"" aka you seem desperate for a relationship. I told him instead ""I'll give you a text later, is that ok?"".


So later I texted him saying how much I enjoyed the date and checking he didn't get blown away in the crazy wind. He text back something funny and asked me too.

He confided in me and let me know that he was getting a divorce and I felt horrible for his situation. I gave him my number and we talked about our High School Days and laughed over our high school memories. Fast forward, and I then gave him some advice about moving forward, after a divorce, and of course said that time will eventually heal his broken heart...to which he responded that a heart can't break if he was unhappy for years. He then went on to say that talking to me made him feel like his ""old self"" and so that tells me he may be a whole lot emotionally devastated than he is leading me to believe.

He also said he can't sleep most nights, but he slept really well after talking to me. :/

Anyway, we ended the conversation and the very next day he sent me a Facebook message that said he doesn't know where ""this"" is going, but talking to me made him feel so good. He further went on to say that he doesn't want anyone else and that we have a lot in common, etc 

I never flirted with him!!!!

I was just being nice!!!

So, I responded back that I am not ready or willing to get in a relationship and I am enjoying the independent and single life.

But, he keeps sending me messages! He tells me goodnight, sweet dreams and he also tells me good morning every day. It does NOTHING for me!!! I am not interested in the slightest.

Then he sends me photos of what he does for his job.

And then he sent me a series of selfies...

I am VERY short with my replies and don't respond right away...sometimes leave him on read for hours.

I seriously don't want him to think I am interested in any way and am just confused how he can be so into me over 1 conversation!!

How does that equate to ME being interested?!??!?

I was just being nice!!!!!!

How is he even smitten by me to the point where he is saying, ""I don't want anyone else?!""

He sounds obsessive already and we aren't even dating. Like, if we were, and we were to break up...he would be the type to be like, ""If I can't have you, no one will!""

I am so turned off!!!

There was nothing leading up to him feeling this way at all ....nothing!!!!

Guys! Seriously!!!! Don't be like this. Especially, after one phone conversation.

P.S. We live in different states. 

Any advice on how to let this guy down gently? He's still married!!! Which is also gross. I am not trying to flirt with a married man on too of everything else..

For the past almost 2 weeks now, there's been a new girl in town, about my age, doing volunteer work at the school. AFAIK, she just goes around looking for people who need help and doing things with them, which is basically what I did the first few weeks I worked there.

One day she came in and asked if I needed any help while I didn't have a class visiting, and I just let her hang out and talk story for like half an hour. We hit it off pretty good, and now she comes and hangs out with me almost every day.

Let me tell you, she's been nice to have around. She's always got a pretty smile on her face and seems to like hanging around me. Plus, we have a lot of common interests,  so there's plenty for us to talk about. And to top it all off, she's really pretty, and she has the cutest smile when I'm around her.

There's also been a couple days where I've come in and found a bowl of chocolate chip cookies with a card from her with hearts on it on my desk. I just think that's sweet.

Anyway, yesterday I asked her if she wanted to go out on a date this Saturday, and she said yes! I'm gonna pick her up around lunchtime and take her down to the beach to hang out and spend the day over there.

I've never felt this way about any other girl in my life. I think I might be falling in love. I know it might be a little too early to say that, but that's honestly how I feel.

I guess you would say it’s friends with benefits because he says he “hates labels and doesn’t want a relationship “ but we talk everyday, we cuddle, it’s kinda serious. We’ve even said I love you. From the start, I’ve always expressed my interest in a relationship and he would say he’s not ready for a relationship yet but he would want to be with me. It’s been almost a year, how long do I have to wait for him to decide to step up?  If I ever bring it up, he says I’m pressuring him and we’ll get into little arguments but we always make up. We had a fight two days ago and I told him I just want him to commit and he said he doesn’t want to be miserable. So is he just using me? I feel awful and it hurts.

66,nc3bv1,1620979528,Dating for a long time but not official,"So we have dated for almost 2 years. We spoke almost everyday on chat (replying to everything the other person would say) for 1.5 of those 2 years, called almost daily since the whole second lockdown thing (last six months or so). She took initiative during that time to meet up and call. Which i liked and got used to. But we both decided on no labels after telling each other that we weren't seeing other people (about 6 months into this situation). Now for me no labels means I get the freedom to date her without the burden of relationship expectations that I must meet. Without feeling like am not a good boyfriend for not doing certain things that am not comfortable with. For example, introducing her to my friends. I don't want to be forced into it. She did once drop a hint about how her flatmate asked whether I was her boyfriend and then reacted kinda surprised when she thought I said 'noo' which I didn't btw. I said 'ooh' as in 'wow thats a personal question'. Anyway, I still prefer it the way it is, however I found some other dudes login details on one of her streaming accounts. But the thing is she acts very 'hurt' when I mention other women in a secual context (even if they're from my past) and jokingly tells me 'you're not allowed to date other women'. Thats fine too, am not particularly interested in dating around. But her comments do end up stifling my flirty interactions with other women cause I think am doing her wrong somehow. She has login details of her other friends on her laptop as well but this guy seems similar to me from what i can tell by my stalking of him. But way more put together. Am basically a bum by comparison lol. Even a talk about stds we had recently, she said ""where could I even catch one from, you don't have one do you?"" Implying that am the only dick she been getting recently. Moreover, in the recent past she has explicitly said am the only guy she is talking to when I joked about her 'other men'. So, my questions are:

1. Is she in the wrong for making me feel a certain way about flirting with other women, while she is possibly getting dicked by this other dude?

2. Can I then flirt with other women without explicitly telling her am back in the game?

3. Am I being paranoid and he is either just a friend who let her borrow his email/password or a friend who just met her and they kept it platonic?

Then we were texting for a month, but she didn't have time to go to a second date, apparently because of uni work. When we went out finally, it was still nice but we went to a walk with really no private place so there was no opportunity for kissing, just hugs. It was also pretty difficult to me to initiate since I need some time to get to know people to be comfortable, and it was a whole month since I had last seen her. (I'm also pretty shy when initiating so this one is totally on me) 

Anyway, she never was a quick texter, but now it feels like she really isn't interested anymore, she texts like once a day. I told her to let me know when she has time, so far no call for another date. Should I just move on? I tested the waters tho, and texted really shitty with yes and no, and then she kept on texting and asking new questions to get the convo going. What should I do?
 She is also pretty often apologizing for not having the time... I feel like moving on, but she's just somehow too nice to skip if she's really interested, and just doesn't have the time.

One day while talking (I hadn't slept more than 2 hours a day in 5 days) one thing led to another and we had sex. It was really fun.

Before doing it, we were sensible enough to talk about not running the friendship. But it's still a line that's hard to cross.

And I really came out of my shell to explore things. He was supportive.

At first it was really good, like in that moment. My brain was happy and I thought it was a one time thingy. But he wanted to continue since we both liked it.  

The thing is, I'm not a no strings attached person. While the feelings for him is not there, I really like being friends with him. 

I don't know how to politely ask him to go back to being just friends. We used to talk almost everyday anyway. 

It's is also getting very distracting not because he is but because I need to work my ear to my career. He is understanding but still.

I also never even kissed someone, mainly because I was never attracted to anyone. Only a few days ago I decided to start dating because I feel like now is the time to look for someone who I can spend the rest of my life with (very traditional thinking I know). I began dating, but women are either too judgmental, racist, or sexist. 

1. Because of my Indian ethnicity they think I’m horny 24/7 and view me as a pervert or as desperate. I’m from a college town with a wide variety of ethnicities, so I thought people would be more culturally aware. I just want to hold someone’s hands and talk about how our days went dammit

2. Because of my size (6’3 220lbs+) people are usually scared of how I look and either avoid me or cross the street to move away from me. I tried better perfumes, hop onto the latest fashion trends, tried to smile more, walk with better posture, hit the gym to get more muscles and less fat, but the result is the same

3. Most women I meet expect too much from my side, and when I expect any effort from their side they either ghost me or lash out, then ghost me. And when they find out about my lack of experience they view me as naive and innocent and avoid me at all costs. 

I’ve even tried online dating, but I either get almost no matches or dry conversations with women who I’m sure are just looking for hookups. I want to believe that I’m doing something wrong, and that people can suggest me tips and tricks on how to be more approachable in person and online for looking for a soulmate/best friend, but a part of me believes that this is the current state of the dating world and I gotta live with it.

A girl I've been dating for four months dumped me a month ago, well after she dumped me we fought, and then I waited two weeks and went to her and talked about everything and we made up but we didn't continue dating, after two weeks she sent me a message and asked me if she can talk to me in school about something, I said to her, yes and then the day afterward she didn't come to talk to me, so I wanted to send her a message on WhatsApp but then I saw that she blocked me so after a few days I went to her and fought with her again, she then sent me a message asking what is wrong with me and I fought with her again and she said that I don't respect her and maybe it was right to end the relationship, I replied with “if you said that you want to talk to me all of the sudden and then blocked for no reason it tells me enough how you feel about me and what type of person you are so yeah maybe it was a right thing you finished it”.
I didn't talk to her at all about it, I live in Israel and there have been a lot of bombings over here lately from Hamas and they started bombing in my city so I asked her a few days ago if she is okay over messeges, she said that she is fine and that is really cute that I asked her if she is fine.
I love her and everything went so good when we were dating and she suddenly just finished it, in school, we don't interact anymore and it's been ego fights since she finished it, she stopped watching my Instagram stories and she is acting like she doesn't care about me anymore, I feel like she expects me to come to her and talk about it with her but I am the one who always goes to her and talks about things so I don't feel like I need to go apologize about it because I was ready to move on before she said to me that she wants to talk to me, I have no idea what to do and how I should approach this situation because I can't stop thinking about her and it seems like it doesn't really bother her.

82,nc6edv,1620991828,Struggling With My First Break-up,"So bit of context here. I am a 28 year old male, never been in a serious relationship. Until age 24, I had a lot going on where I wasn't active in the dating scene. I was morbidly obese, was still living with my parents, was battling depression, was jumping from one dead-end job to the next and just didn't feel like it was fair to unload that baggage onto a potential partner.

Since 2017, I've moved into my own place, worked hard to shed a ton of weight, established a career, and am overall much better off now than I was 5 years ago. That being said, I finally decided to emerge into the dating scene about two years ago.

I meet a girl through Reddit, we talked for a bit, we ended up going on a date, and stayed in touch for a while. I lost touch with her for a few months when I went into the military, but once I got home from basic training, we continued talking on and off until late last year. She didn't want to meet in person because of Covid. I finally reconnected with her through Facebook in March of this year, just as my unit was getting activated for a multi-month mission. I felt like during this time we were closer than ever. We talked almost every day, having increasingly wholesome discussions, and were making plans to get together when I got off orders. I understand this doesn't really sound like a formal relationship, but I didn't want to rush anything since she has been through immense emotional trauma and abuse. Then a couple weeks ago she started ghosting me and I couldn't understand why.

Last night I saw on Facebook that she began a relationship with someone else several days BEFORE she stopped talking to me. I was heartbroken. Here was a woman I spent the better part of 2 years trying to win over and she just abandons me completely.

So I turn to you for advice. I've got my life on track, but now I feel like I've put myself at a disadvantage by not prioritizing dating when I was younger. Part of me doesn't have regrets because I've seen too many people I know get pregnant fresh out of high school, bury themselves in debt, and then try to start a career and it almost never works in their favor. Plus, statistically speaking relationships started that young don't last. But at the same time, it's kind of pathetic to get serious about dating this late in life.

I've tried some of the dating sites (Hinge, Bumble, Tinder, Facebook Dating). I've matched with some people, but aside from some casual hook-ups, its never amounted to anything as far as long-term relationships go. I setup a Match profile today, as they cater more to serious relationships rather than hookups, so I'll see where that goes. I'm a strong 7 at best, but I feel like it shouldn't be as difficult as it seems to find love online.

TLDR 28 y/o. Never been in a serious relationship. Prioritized setting career trajectory ahead of dating. Feeling discouraged about find love this late in life. Feeling depressed about breakup. Trying to understand why she changed her mind. Looking for input

Any insight or feedback would be immensely appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nc6edv/struggling_with_my_first_breakup/
83,nc6ep0,1620991861,My boyfriend lied about spending the night at his friends house,"
This is my first post on Reddit so please bear with me lol I’ll try to be as detailed as possible. I (24F) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) now for about 9 months. He’s overall a great boyfriend compared to my past. Early on in the relationship we started talking about things that bother us and I brought up how I think it’s weird how frequently he spends the night at his girl best friends house (for some background on this: he had sex with her a few years ago when they were roommates but it was a mistake and they stayed friends. She ended up getting a place on her own and he frequently goes there to see the dogs they got together and he’ll spend the night because it’s more convenient than driving 30 minutes home after work..his words) anyways he decided to compromise and wasn’t spending the night as often anymore. More time passes and we continue to have a great relationship, he told me how much he loves me and sees a future together, he met my daughter and my family, we started going on trips together, consistent dates, and all that good stuff. He started being sketchy a couple months ago so I went through his phone. There were half naked pictures of some girl and pictures that he took to send to her, and a screenshot of a flirty text message from another girl in his deleted folder but no text messages in his inbox. He admitted to deleting messages and entertaining other girls. He apologized and said he made a mistake. He also said that with temptation comes the truth and he realized he wanted to be with me instead of them. He claimed he never met up with them and basically turned them down. I forgave him and we continued the relationship. He was aware he’d have to prove his trust to me again and definitely tried but because I was a nervous wreck still it was hard for me to believe anything. He was patient with me being jealous, insecure, and obsessive. He was still spending the night at the best friends house but it really started to get to me after awhile. I expressed my concern again and told him it made me feel uncomfortable but he told me how convenient it was for him and said “ if it’s such a big deal than just break up with me then” so I dropped it. He spent the night again and at this point I’m angry and basically tell him we shouldn’t be together if he’s going to continue to disrespect me and how he could just come to my house or go home. We ended up talking through it and I told him at the end of the day it’s his life and his decision I just hope he’d choose to respect my boundaries. He said he wouldn’t intentionally plan to spend the night anymore or intend to but if it’s an emergency then chances are he will most likely spend the night again. The other night he called after work and said he was almost home. Something just didn’t feel right so I asked him if he was really home and he flipped out. He got really defensive and said I have to stop accusing him of things. I drove to the girls house in the morning and his car was there. He admitted to lying, obviously he was caught red handed. He said he lied because he knew I’d be upset and I’m in therapy so he didn’t want to make anything worse for me. He stands strong on how their relationship is completely platonic and it is simply for convenience and how he doesn’t want to spend the night at my house often because I live with my parents. Oh and it wasn’t an emergency he just didn’t feel like driving home. At this time I told him I need some space. I can’t even process or gather my thoughts and need some advice. 

Here are a couple other red flags that I’ve noticed:
1. He used to comment on my body because I needed to be “humbled” (I’m a confident Leo) he’d say stuff like “I’m not going to lie and say you have the best body” or “if I had thicker thighs and bigger ass I’d be a real baddie”. I’m literally 5 foot and weigh 115 pounds I never thought there was anything wrong with my body until now. I told him to stop and he did. (Trying to control me by making me feel insecure)
2. He went through my phone when we first met and weren’t even official yet (he has trust issues)
3. Manipulative (excuses and reasoning for wrongdoing, making me question myself, apologies without change, making deals with me like he’ll only stop spending the night as long as I quit vaping, gaslighting me when confronted with the truth, won’t change because he feels he does nothing wrong even though I’m hurt, power move comments like I’m willing to be patient with you after he fucked up..shouldn’t I be the patient one?)

Advice on whether or not this is a healthy relationship? Advice on moving forward should we choose to stay together? 

I feel like I’m wrong for asking him not to spend the night at her house to the point where he had to lie about it.

I would say I’m average looking, not really good looking but not ugly. I have a few friends but there are no girls to get in contact with. I’m also working in a “male domain” with not a single female in my company. That’s why it’s pretty hard to meet new people, especially women.
I have no problems with approaching girls/women and I’m pretty confident. I approached a girl 2 months ago, she gave me her number, we texted over a few weeks and then I got rejected because she came in contact with her crush. This was a big disappointment and I’m not sure if approaching random girls is a good idea.

After about a year of this on and off, I went round hers for a ""date"" i guess? We kissed but nothing else. A week later we did the same again. Then my mutual friend said something to her on a night out about us two , I think he made a joke saying you ""are obsessed with josh (me)."" She then messaged me the next day asking what I had been saying about her to my friends and she said we shouldnt see each other anymore... 

Basically now she basically denies that nothing happened between us, almost like she doesnt want to admit it? She never talks to me now...

87,nc70tu,1620993954,How not to be so emotionally attached,"I'll keep this short. I have issues with too strong emotional attachment that i'm not able to cope with.

I always feel like i have to ""serve"" the other person (in relationships) in order to make them happy, like they're so much better than me. With that being said, when they're not in the mood for talking, they're angry or just tired, i start to panic.

My partner has had worst time in the last two days due to their personal issues so we don't talk that much, and i try to keep my cool but in reality I miss them like crazy and can't stop thinking about them. I cried for almost 2 hours today bc i thought they don't like me anymore (they were active on groupchats but were ignoring my private messages). 

I am aware that this is whole new level of overreacting and that i should get some mental help, and i plan to do so, but i kind of can't at the moment and I need advice. What should I do in order to focus more on myself, to not think of them all the time and to stop being so goddamn emotional?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nc70tu/how_not_to_be_so_emotionally_attached/

I had recently deactivated Instagram but got it back yesterday. I followed his account to see he still followed an ex and her other business account. He has told me stories and acted like they ended on bad terms. Ok it's none of my business but I've been through an awful break up and I DONT want drama. I mentioned it to him ( calmly) and he said oh I'll unfollow her I don't know why I follow her anyway. Next morning he follows her again... I feel like there is something going on there and although I have no control or any right to have a say in what he does. Do I just leave it ? I don't want drama and I feel maybe it is drama and there's unfinished business.

He truly is a very good looking guy and has a great personality.

92,nc7rmf,1620996350,Tired of being people's back up pawn dude.,"If a girl dates me, she most likely is into someone else and just using me as a pawn in a game of chess to make another guy jealous and win them back, and then they leave me. Happened to me too many times,  I date someone for a while, we get into a relationship, they post it all over Facebook to make their ex or actual love interest jealous, then they make up some lame excuse like ""it's just not working between us"" when everything seemed just fine, in reality they're saying ""I don't want you, I want him"". I'm simply a tool that women use to get back with their ex or get with someone they've liked the whole time dating me, using me again as a pawn to get the other person's interest, make them act, then the girl does the same thing ""just isn't working between us"". I want someone to actually like ME for my personality, not because I'm a decent looking yet socially challenged guy they can easily get with, I am lonely af, so I'm easy to use for that sort of thing, and get used constantly, never once have I had a genuine connection with someone that actually liked me as a person, they all use me for something. If anyone knows how I can stop getting used like this and find a real connection, lmk, but this is mainly to blow off steam.

We are friends on Facebook still to this day! I messaged her on Facebook but never heard back or anything. It was her birthday recently and I said Happy Birthday! And she liked my post and said thank you! I was looking at all the people that posted to see if I knew anyone. I noticed something... I was the only guy she actually liked and commented on. She said thank you to other girls but out of all the guys she only said it to me and liked my post. I spoke to a friend of mine (girl) and she said that’s a small hint to you.

98,nc8kvm,1620998801,Did I screw myself over for this?,"TLDR   
She got - 2.5 years of love and affection  
I got - Heartbreak and complete loss of attraction to other women + a beating (literally and from the universe)

Hi all, I'm (22M), just want to ask for genuine advice to whoever is a relationship expert or has good instinct in this field.  
I wouldn't call myself terrible at dating, nor great either, but I had to know if I fucked my life over this girl (21F). I'm stuck with her and I've might have potentially had my time and effort go to waste pursuing her. 

I met her at a college club meet-up. At first, I didn't notice her much, but as we kept coming to the meet-ups periodically, I started to become attracted by her behavior and humor. I've always been a long shot type of guy - because even though I like having fun, I ultimately think commitment is the way to go.

Over the past couple of years, I am a bit afraid to show attraction yet, and I intended to get her to like me first. Otherwise, I'd look like a fool. I had to make sure if she was even remotely interested and could reciprocate my feelings.

A little twist - I found out she had a boyfriend, which she soon split up with not long after. After I confirmed she was single again, I built the confidence to make moves. At first, it went nicely, as we started getting chummy and start to do couple-y things like making incredibly nonsensical inside jokes which we would tell in front of our friends. At this period, I was pretty confident that we both have mutual feelings. When the semester ended, I just left it as is and had a vacation, where I kept very little contact with her. 

When the year started again, one of my friends hinted that someone is trying to get her, and it made me even more pressured to finally confess. As time goes, I gathered every inch of courage in my body and went to confess to her, but alas, my friend abruptly broke my bubble by telling me she had went official with this guy. At this point, I had very little hope and just tried to move on. What's even worse is, that same night, I got jumped by 2 thugs. I took it as a sign from God that this is either a match in hell or a sign that she is my soul mate. Obviously, logic prevailed and I chose the first.

2020 arrived, I finally graduated and thought that the glimpse of her face in my head could never sway me again. What a great fool I was. I tried seeing other people but they fell off quicker than I liked.  
February arrived, COVID hits, and I completely lost contact with everyone, including our friend group. As months go by and Halloween approached, she reached out to me, and I texted her a birthday wish. She wanted to meet up. Long story short, the meet-up was a roller coaster of emotions involving her dropping almost a year's worth of tea. For me, it was very hard to take in, as it involved a very personal issue she had which really skewed my judgment of her.

At that point, I am still interested, but I'm not a fool. I brought up the confession I never got the chance to give to her. She dejected the sentiment and reminded me of that personal issue she just told me, and why it's gonna be bad for me. I know she's hurting, for whatever reason. Not a lot of people are gifted at hiding their true feelings, but she isn't one of them. The problem is, she has been and is still teasing me and made me feel as if I deserve to be with her, which led to the climax of this weird friendship/awkward relationship.

Eventually, I met her one last time, and she gave me extremely mixed signals. I finally just pulled her aside and told her how I felt. I have pretty much idolized and put her on this very high pedestal. Of course, she rejected me officially and insisted I should move on.

Now, I wake up almost every day with a wet face and complete loss of attraction to any other girl I met. I can't seem to be attracted to anyone new. Every girl I went on dates, met on dating apps, is just still incomparable to her. I told myself I have to move on but I'm really afraid that she might still be sitting on that high pedestal that I wanted to put her off from.

Any thoughts on how I can stop thinking about her?   
Or maybe the unconventional way of trying even harder?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nc8kvm/did_i_screw_myself_over_for_this/

We stayed up until like 7am in the morning which I never do but we were having such a good time. The next day I had to ask him to leave because it was already 4 in the afternoon and I had plans to go with my friends
 Anyways he didn't text me until 2 days later then just slowly ghosted me so I deleted him. I dont keep people as friends if we aren't going to talk anymore and you ghosted me. Anyways I got over him, but I still think about him every now and then. I am just so annoyed that 4 months later he is friend requesting me. I mean fuck that. I really liked him. I put him on a pedestal. I know I shouldn't have but I couldn't help it. I was crushing on him hard. Now mtfr is friend requesting me bringing up these emotions again. I know I just need to delete it. Just makes me mad how how guys think you are just going to be there at your becking call and just want to talk to you when their booty gets low. Well fuck you.
