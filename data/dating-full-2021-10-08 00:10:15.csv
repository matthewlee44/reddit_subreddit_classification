I live in California and want to find a long-term partner who can accompany me throughout my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I like quiet music. I like to stare out of the window on a rainy day. I like to drink a glass of whiskey when I am alone in the middle of the night. I have lived in the United States alone for three years. To be honest, I am lonely inside and I hope to find a soul mate.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that after the epidemic is over, we can go to Cappadocia, Turkey, take a hot air balloon, take a reindeer sleigh in the Santa Claus Village in Finland, and make a wish at the Trevi Fountain in Rome. I want to go to Iceland to see the aurora, go parachuting in Queenstown, New Zealand, go skiing in the Swiss Alps, go diving in the Maldives, go to Santorini to see the blue and white world, and go to Japan to see the cherry blossoms. I want to experience the world that I don’t know. I want to experience a romance that I have never felt before.

I would love some insight on this situation. 

Met a guy online about three months ago. Everything was nice at the beginning, both very comfortable with each other, good connection, lots of laughs, both made loads of effort etc 

Fast forward to two weeks ago - we have a really lovely date. He made me a tea in the morn and asked me to message him when I got home. I did. But he just went weird from then - his messages dwindled and he was avoidant to commit to the next date. It felt like he didn’t want to see me again, so I asked. He replied with a ‘I just don’t want things to get too deep too quick’. He was out out and said he would call me the next day. He didn’t so I sent a message establishing things were over. He replied straight away wanting to apologise and then nothing….

A few days later we spoke on the phone. I assumed things would end but he apologized and made it clear that he didn’t want to cut things off and wanted to ‘pretend the blip never happened’ because he ‘panicked’. 

I accepted his apology. We met the following week but it was basically a booty call which I was not okay about! A few days later I called him to tell him that the last meet was too casual for me and not what I wanted. He enthusiastically declared that we should make more time for each other next time and we proceeded to set a date and plan. 

We continue chatting like normal for the next two days about random shiz. I wake up this morning on the day of our date…and he’s blocked me on everything!! No explanation and my last message was me telling him what music I was listening to.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She also told me that she hadn’t really dated anyone in years and never even kissed anyone.

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

&amp;#x200B;

We had the date tonight and it went alright. We went for dinner at an Italian restaurant. I brought her a single pink rose and because she was joking about how I will have to be extra cute the night before, I used that as the reason why I brought the rose. That seemed to be the wrong move as I don't think she liked the flower.

The date itself was a little weird. We shared all the dishes and towards the end of the date, she even suggested sharing dessert which might've been a good sign. We had some breaks in our conversation though with awkward pauses but one of us always managed to pick it back up and it wasn't too bad. However, I definitely was nervous and in hindsight, picking dinner was probably not a good move because I get some anxiety and very self concious around eating and food. She could definitely tell I was nervous and I tried casually joking it off.

Towards the end of the date when the bill came, I pulled out my credit card but she offered to split it. I said don't worry I got it and she told me she doesn't mind me paying for coffees and stuff but dinner is a lot. We had a little back and forth where she told me I don't have to and I told her I know I don't but I would like to if she lets me. So she said fine but next time it's on her which I quickly agreed to.

Then she got a text from work asking her to be in even earlier for tomorrow and so we left. When we got to the car, she told me she had a lot of fun and enjoyed it. Then she dropped a ""so as you know I have a really busy thanksgiving weekend and the weekend after that is my grandmothers bday and I have plans with some friends but definitely keep in touch and let me know if there's anymore crazy stories at work so we can rant about them"". My heart kind of sunk here because I like her and I think she's just nicely say ""there won't be another date""

What do you guys think? Am I overthinking or did I mess things up? I definitely wasn't on my A-Game. The first date I made a good impression and I was my usually self but dinner date was really a bad call from me. I texted her to make sure she made it home alright but I think I'm gonna wait until after thanksgiving to send her a text suggesting a third date and see how she responds.

There's a couple reasons why I've never been in a relationship:

1. I was morbidly obese all my life until junior year of college. For obvious reasons I had no confidence, I was(am) shy, and most importantly no one was attracted to me like that.
2. Throughout college I was really focused on my grades and working. I tried dating a couple times and was always rejected so it just never really worked out.
3. From 22-23 when I moved out after college I tried dating again. I got two dates in that time period that both went terribly. First one was my fault, second one she left with a different guy at the end of the night (most likely my fault too).
4. 24-25 my depression and anxiety got very, very, bad and I was eventually diagnosed with binge eating disorder. I gained all of the 140lbs I lost back. When the depression and anxiety came back I quit trying to date. Rejection, lack of success, and the hits to my already low self esteem wasn't helping. So I took a break to go to therapy, try to tackle the depression, anxiety, binge eating, and also lose weight.

So now I'm about to be 26, almost back to my goal weight, and would like to try dating again. Even though it's probably what every one will tell me to do, I'm personally not interested in casually dating or hook ups I just want something serious. But will anyone looking for the same take someone with no experience seriously? Or is this too big of a red flag and will be dropped when it comes out?

OLD is a cesspool of horndogs and liars (men and women alike). Unfortunately, in the current dating climate, it’s possibly the best way to meet people. I’m my experience, the best way to “enjoy” OLD is to approach every interaction/date as you would with your friend, with as minimal to no emotional investment as possible (until things get official of course).There is no pressure, expectation, shyness, judgement, no forcing things, etc. when you hang out/text your friends, it’s just you and your authentic self. Your match is either going to like you for you or they’re not and it’s better for you to know right at the go than to pretend to be someone else or follow some arbitrary rule. When you go on a date, think of it as a night out with a friend - you’re either going to see this person again or you’re not, you can’t control how the other person is going to feel about you but you can walk away knowing you put your most authentic self forward. Feelings complicate things, be present in the moment and enjoy yourself.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1052539,public,self,Best tip for OLD: Be authentic to yourself while holding off emotional investment.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3ocrx/best_tip_for_old_be_authentic_to_yourself_while/,all_ads,6,dating,,,,,

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She also told me that she hadn’t really dated anyone in years and never even kissed anyone.

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird. 

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn’t... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest.

Been living in a uni dorm for over a month now. I am socially awkward, but I've started to get used to my flatmates and starting to put myself out there more

So basically, I think the girl beside me is flirting, but I'm not sure. She is from India, I'm from Ireland. Her English is perfect and she is easy to talk to

So when we were in the kitchen there were there of us and we decided to go to the 'social space/lounge' for the first time. So me and her were playing a Xbox game and she started getting touchy (leg and resting her head there) and slapping me there because I kept killing her, was fun lol. I just laughed and went with it.

We went to the kitchen afterwards, me her and our friend, it was like 2 or 3am. We were just talking about random stuff and she kept hinting at the other guy to go to sleep/his room, he looked tired though. When he left for a bit she asked me if I'm seeing anybody and how long it's been, I said a year (it's been longer than that lol) and she said 4 years. That was it really, didn't expect that. That was it really. The other guy came back though

Tonight at like 9pm I just went to the kitchen to get a drink. She was there cooking and stuff. Ending up sitting there and talking till 1am. I was telling her how I get sports channels for free (she was talking about her love for F1 and stuff) and she said to me I can go to her room with her and put the channels on there, but at the same time another flatmate turned up and we were just chilling in the kitchen talking till late. 

I was wearing a beanie at the time because I'm growing my hair out and it was cold, so I just kept it on, she kept saying why are you wearing it, your hair is nice etc, she complimented my eyes 🤷

She asks questions such as, bucket list, what I do all day, fav foods/restaurants, she figured I don't cook so she offered me to cook with her, asked me if she wanted to she food cupboards in the kitchen

I don't know, it could be nothing. I just don't want any awkwardness lmao, she's my neighbour for the year after all",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1052543,public,self,Flatmate flirting?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q3of5o/flatmate_flirting/,all_ads,6,dating,,,,,

We’ve spent whole days alone together and have done date-like activities like going to arcades, walks in parks, and exploring the city, though they weren’t officially ‘dates’. We’ve become fairly touchy with hugs and the like, and she likes to hold/play with my hands, though not interlocking fingers or anything like that.

Now I know some of you might be reading this and facepalming about how clear the signs are, and I would agree, but I’ve just got this gut feeling that tells me she’s not interested in being more than friends. I’ve generally easily noticed signs from other women when they’re interested, but this one feels different for some reason I can’t really explain.

Another thing I noticed is that she lets me know whenever a guy hits on her, so idk if she’s trying to make me jealous as part of her being interested, or if she’s just craving the attention and being like “oh look at all these guys chasing me. I’m so beautiful and amazing”. Knowing her, I don’t think it’s the second one but also don’t can’t say it’s the first cos of the gut feeling I mentioned.

Now I'm 30, recently out of relationship with a sweet kind affectionate girl who i broke up with because I felt overwhelmed and like I was pretending to be someone I wasn't and couldn't talk to her about it.

I feel crazy. I'm not a serial dater who's sleeping with girls and then never calling them back. I'm dating them for long enough for them to see me as their potential life partner and then dumping them. It's some psychopath shit. I feel ashamed and shitty like im ruining these girls lives.

Other aspects of my life are good. I've gotten over my social anxieties of my teens. I have friends. I have a good job and active health hobbies. And whenever I start a relationship it's always so good and then after a year or so in I start to feel like I'm not myself anymore.

So now im sitting here feeling aimless. I know I'm not ready to date again but also am craving that validation I get from women. But I just don't see how any future relationship doesn't end up like my past ones.

(21m)To add some background context. I just turned 21 less then a month ago. I’ve been having this sort of on and off again toxic relationship with (18f). 

This past year and half She is a coworker of mine who I meet last year during the height of the pandemic. In the beginning of training. At first our only interactions where random conversation. School or id make her laugh by smart ass comments I’d make .  

I even found her quite annoying she was type to he say and be super nice to everyone. Just over all very bubbly. Fast forward a couple months we end up working 12 hour shifts. An during this time we had Designated partners who we could have lunch with . Not sure why we did exactly. Just was during this time I found her, true self. 

We opened up to each other about personal issues family, friends mental health issues  Past partners etc. An of course goals and aspirations. At first to me she seemed the classic Version of Damsel in distress. she had multiple home life problems. An I will say I was dick, at first she would confine in me about her issues ask for help I’d give one off remarks basically hitting at idc not my problem type of things. 

Fast forward, couple weeks we end up getting lunch and stuff outta work mostly bc she would ask if we could hang out I’d say yes for the  food . This when I truly started to care about her. I realized that her issues where actually taking a toll on her. She seemed very off distant. 

Then person I had met months ago. I’d finally stop being asshole. I was giving her Advice and hang out with her  when she didn’t want to be home. Helping wen I could etc. At this point started to gradually gain feelings for her romantically . She was hard worker put a face of warrior at work and with peers but when we where alone she. Was simply a girl who was depressed looking for a friendship. Also I’d say we basically had flirtish relationship mixed with if would she would send me her nudes type of stuff . I’d say 5 months after we got close . 

We had large argument on what significant others do for each another. I thought we where gonna date An at one point in that argument it slipped out I had feelings. At that point she became distant. Wouldn’t reply or gave me small texts back an work tried to avoid me as much as possible. I found she was back with her ex. 

An I felt I had been used as a shoulder to cry on.  Rather the someone she truly did care about too. I did Dm her going off. An she replied with classic apologizing she wasn’t in good head space and stuff which she wasn’t. An told me would still be close friends. An this point I’d say we where. Recently she. 

Broke up with her ex again. 3rd time. An we back to square one. Flirtish realm and we have will we or won’t we. I’m very much in love with her . For while now I’d say. I have talk to girls during her time with her partner but she steal remains an I still find myself going outta my way to spend time with her and help with anything. P.S during the time she was with her ex we shared locations still texted none stop day in and day out.

That makes perfect sense logically, and after years of working on my appearance/social life/moving to a big city, that's exactly what I'm (23M) doing now. I go on lots of first dates, I'm always having at least three or four conversations with girls on apps, I can't remember the last time that there has only been one girl in my life. 

If that sounds like bragging, it's not and I'm pretty miserable. It feels like no matter how many ""options"" I have, the quality of people in the dating world is so low these days that whenever I find someone smart and interesting with actual depth, I get just as obsessed with them as I did over my middle school crushes. If anything, dating more people just makes these crushes more intense because I see how much better they are then the competition. And then when the girl I like inevitably doesn't want to be in a relationship with me (a self-fulfilling prophecy), it just sends me into a depressive spiral when I go back to the apps and bars and see how bad (most) of the dating pool is. 

The worst part of all this casual dating is that it's made me realize that there's just one type of girl that I really fall for. It's too specific to get into but there's just this one archetype--from the way they dress to the way they do their hair to the places they hang out and the books they read--that I can't resist. And while other girls can be hot or kind or funny or anything else, I'm never going to obsess over them like I do ""my type."" I thought dating around would expand my horizons but it really just reinforces that I want the same thing that I've always wanted but have never been able to get. 

I don't know what point I'm trying to prove with all this, other than the whole ""date a lot of people and you'll get less anxiously attached"" advice has been incredibly ineffective for me.

But at the same time, it does seem like we both agreed to ""some"" specialness to our arrangement. For example, she started taking birth control because of me and we stopped using condoms, but agreed that if we are with other people we will use protection always. Which I think is a bare minimum requirement for me.

**Question 1: How do those of you who participate in these kinds of arrangements handle the mental aspect of it?**

Such as hearing about her out on a date with someone else? Or even knowing that she's most likely having sex with someone else right after having sex with you?

I think I personally am dealing with childhood insecurities of inadequacy and so I tend to interpret these things personally and negatively. Such as, ""am I not satisfying her enough sexually?"". Or ask myself questions like ""why does she feel the need to be with someone else literally the day after she was with me?"". 

I also think that having feelings for each other is part of the reason why I would prefer a longer-term casual relationship versus flings/one-night stands. It's a huge part of the enjoyment to me, so I feel like not caring at all (which I can do, if needed) kind of takes away from the experience... but caring/having feelings makes me feel insecure and hurt when I know she's also seeing other people.

It's frustrating because I finally after a long time have the casual relationship that I've been wanting (because I'm dealing with some, hopefully soon to resolve, health issues that make me not quite ready to date seriously), but at the same time I feel like I'm not cut out for non-exclusive relationships.

**Question 2: Where do you draw the line on the relationship? When do you say this arrangement won't work for me? What boundaries do you communicate other than what I've mentioned in the opening paragraph?**

I think there's probably also a jealousy component to it, which is that she may be having sex with someone else while I am not currently (and I feel that girls typically have a bit more control over this). 

**Question 3: How do you handle the jealousy of feeling like the person you primarily go to for sexual expression has other people to go to besides you? Is the solution just to have multiple casual relationships? Isn't that a lot of work?**",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1052839,public,self,"Men, how do you deal with non-exclusive dating mentally?

Later that day she showed me some photos of her home village (it's in the alps) and told me how much fun it was to hay as a kid. Then she invited me to help her family hay in the summer and that it would be very nice if I would come to help.

A bit later I just had put my glasses on, she told me how sweet I look with the glasses :-)

We’ve spent whole days alone together and have done date-like activities like going to arcades, walks in parks, and exploring the city, though they weren’t officially ‘dates’. We’ve become fairly touchy with hugs and the like, and she likes to hold/play with my hands, though not interlocking fingers and that stuff. I make her laugh and she’s always up for hanging out together even at short notice and we’re going hiking next week. 

Now I know some of you might be reading this and facepalming about how clear the signs are, and I would agree, but I’ve just got this gut feeling that tells me she’s not interested in being more than friends. I’ve generally easily noticed signs from other women when they’re interested, but this one feels different for some reason I can’t really explain. We study engineering and so most of her friends are guys (since most of the course are guys), and I don’t see how she acts around other guys cos we’re in different years so I only see her when we hang out, which is alone, so I can’t judge if this is how she is normally or is this special from her. 

Another thing I noticed is that she lets me know whenever a guy hits on her, so idk if she’s trying to make me jealous as part of her being interested, or if she’s just craving the attention and being like “oh look at all these guys chasing me. I’m so beautiful and amazing”. Knowing her, I don’t think it’s the second one but also can’t say it’s the first cos of the gut feeling I mentioned (could just be small talk, idk).

I have not really ever thought about settling or lowering my standards, I have always wanted to find the perfect guy for me. But I haven’t found that guy. I don’t think I have ridiculously high standards but maybe I am unrealistic and just don’t know it. I am in my 30s now, I am in great shape and slim, I have a very pretty face and used to model, I can cook really well, have a great sense of humor and I have been told I’m very down to earth and nice. I have conservative views for the most part and people describe me as very easy going and I avoid drama. I would say that my biggest flaw, I don’t know what to call it, is that I have some health issues going on right now . I have had to stop working and just focus on my health right now. It doesn’t seem like many men care about that especially since some women are housewives, it is not the same as a guy having health issues and/or being disabled. Which I’m not saying is fair at all but just something I have noticed. Many men have exclaimed they are surprised when I say I’m single and have been for a couple years now.

A lot of dates I have gone on men have tried to sleep with me right away. I have met most of these men on dating sites but some in person. One guy I met on a Christian mingle site and he tried to put his hands down my pants on a public bench in a shopping mall. I have recently been less picky about looks and still experienced the same type of asshole behavior from men. At least from my experiences, the fact that I am in my 30s and I am attractive and a good person and haven’t found a guy yet makes me think that my standards are too high and that I should just settle on a guy who is at least a good provider in my situation and someone who is someone I can at least get along with even if I’m not crazy about them. Thinking that I will spend the rest of my life with out someone seems lonely but I also don’t want to spend my life with someone who treats me like shit. Maybe it will be hard to find a guy who checks all of my boxes. 

I would say that my desires in a partner are this: funny, secure in himself and his beliefs, has integrity, not controlling or abusive, doesn’t treat me like a sex doll, respects me, no drug or alcohol issues ,attractive to me, sexual chemistry, financially stable (doesn’t have to be wealthy just stable), smart, doesn’t want kids or already has them and doesn’t want more, isn’t a guy who is going to bars every weekend to get laid and that sort of thing. 

So like I said most of these dates I have gone on the men have behaved like pigs. If I do meet a guy that meets some of my standards he doesn’t meet others. For example I dated a guy a few months ago who was financially wealthy, funny, handsome , but I found out he was a liar who lied to his ex wife about getting hand jobs at Asian massage parlors and I caught him in a few lies with me. I have always found guys who have met some of my standards and not others. Are my standards really high?

Yesterday I got in a huge fight with my boyfriend because he called me ungrateful. He went to buy us breakfast without mentioning it (I was on a call at home and didn’t realize he left.) Right when he got back with the food, I was about to walk out the door to run a quick errand on my break. I thanked him for the food and said I’d eat it as soon as I got back. This, for some reason, set him off and he became REALLY upset. He called me ungrateful and said he should put less effort into the relationship. He said I “have no idea how lucky I am” to have him and I’m “using him for a house and a loan.” (Context to follow.)

It’s the last part that bothers me. Because I DO know I’m lucky and I tell/show him all the time! 

We’re the same age but he makes about 3x as much as me. When he bought his first house, he asked me to move in with him. I declined because I couldn’t afford 50% of his mortgage, but he insisted I only pay the amount of my current rent. (We split utilities and groceries equally) 

We’re in a LTR and both agree we want to get married but not for another year. So In the meantime he often says he wants to help me improve my credit faster so we can buy our 2nd home together. He offered to pay off one of my larger loans (HIS IDEA ENTIRELY) so I could just pay him directly and get it off my credit report. When I finally accepted, I insisted we have a contract outlining my repayment plan to him in case something happens to the relationship. 

And it’s not just money stuff. On top of all that, he’s just a great boyfriend. He takes such good care of me I could cry thinking about it. 

I have always felt like I go above and beyond to show him how much I value him. I can’t match his generosity financially, so I show my appreciation with quality time and thoughtful gestures (which he has always enjoyed in the past) and doing small things like treating him to dinner, doing most of the housework, cooking for him, planning surprises, etc. 

But to hear him say that I “got a house and a loan out of him” really hurt me deeply. Especially because both those situations were initiated by HIM. I have never in my life considered myself ungrateful and I can’t stop hearing him say he “needs to put less effort into me.” 

He’s never spoken to me like that before. He has since apologized profusely but our entire dynamic has changed.

I'm 28(m) and in good shape (gym 4x per week). 5'9"". I run my own business that I launched about a year and a half ago and so far its going quite well. I read/listen to podcasts constantly but also have a very active social life. I've never touched a drug in my life or smoke cigarettes and overall have pretty high standards for myself. I like to to think I'm a pretty good looking guy (though dating app results would beg to differ). 

Yet despite everything I think I have to offer, my dating life is a huge disappointment - especially the last six months. Most women it seems don't think worth an hour or two of their time to get to know me. They are cold, flaky, ignore my texts, cancel last minute with no offer to reschedule, and in general make zero effort with me. Sometimes they forget my name after multiple meetings (like what?). Often I feel like a commodity in the dating market - as if even mildly attractive women have such an abundance of good options that I'm just another dude they could get at their nearest supermarket/gas station. Honestly, I probably asked out 10 women in the last week or so and got rejected in one form or another (ignored messages, canceled date, etc). Its incredibly discouraging and it contradicts everything I think I know about myself. Can't seem to figure out what I'm doing wrong, everything else in my life seems to be going quite well - in fact I think most men would envy every other aspect of my life but women seem to reject me consistently or not think I'm worth the time of day. There are women that are into me, but for one reason or another I don't view them as good dating prospects (sometimes looks, sometimes personality).

She said she has fallen out of love with me and the relationship has run it’s course.

Physical intimacy has been next to none for the past 6 months. I am frustrated because she won’t even try to improve things, she says she has been trying recently but she hasn’t felt any better and doesn’t want to drag things out . 

We did fight however  but the main issue was the fact that she refused to introduce me to her mum and sister and constantly said she would do it on “her time” and not to rush her. It was hard for me as I’ve been ashamed of being gay for so long in my life and it makes me feel like her dirty secret. I really value family.... she never once invited me to a birthday, Christmas or lunch with her family. My whole family constantly put in effort to make her feel included and thought of her as part of the family. She went to my dads wedding as my date and would come over for dinner at my mums house all the time. 

She said I pushed her too much on this and that it was too intense for her.

I feel let down as we normally go to the gym together after work and she would constantly bail on those plans to hang out wirh her friends, she would say that they are “loose plans “ and doesn’t get to see her friends very often.

I am really struggling right now to come to terms of the relationship ending and thought that this would be the person to spend the rest of my life with. I am 28, have a good job, brought a house earlier this year, quite fit and outgoing yet  my self confidence is at an all time low as I have been rejected so many times by her for physical intimacy in the past year.

My friends keep telling me I will move on and meet someone but I genuinely can’t see it right now. I cared so much for this person and it’s now over. It makes me so sad to think we won’t ever gym together, we won’t ever have a coffee in bed together and we won’t ever travel together.
