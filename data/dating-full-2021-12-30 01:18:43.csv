I really want to try dating. Somehow through 30 years of living I've only gone on two dates with actual strangers. I have been in a few relationships that each laster around three years but it was always this weird like, knowing them before, never dating just jumping into a relationship.

Each past relationship Ive been cheated on, and stayed, until the emotional abuse got too much for me.

I've spent a very long time being small, weak, and hating myself. 
But the last few years I've been going through therapy, and really working on myself and making some pretty great strides. 
I just don't know, the idea of meeting someone new scares the ever living shit out of me. 
Maybe I shouldn't be trying to date again yet? Im scared I'm going to get too attatched to people as soon as I get any affection.
Also
As I child I went through alot of sexual and emotional abuse, and it's really fucked me up. 

Sometimes I can get a handle on it but other times, I just can't help it, my body takes over. I start shaking, sometimes I catch myself trying not to cry. Some of the people I was with before have said some awful shit to me about that. It's about as immasculating as it gets.
I'm always a bit awkward and shut down alot.
I feel like the odds are really stacked against me. 
I'm decently fit and have some hobbies I can really dig, and my friends all seem to think I'm attractive and very nice. It's just being intimate with people on any level, even just hugs is alot for me.

How do I bring these things up? I know there's a nugget of gold hiding under all this shit I carry around but it's so hard to get that out and present it. 

I don't know I think I just needed to vent?

Me (23m) and my ex (24f) broke up due to me catching her cheat on me. We recently got an apartment together before breaking up and decided to be roommates after we broke up until the lease is over as we got no where else to go. 

During our relationship and after she (the ex) would talk about her friend and say very positive things, such as being mature for her age, working a lot, has her own apartment, and has her life straight then most people our age (friend is I believe 21-22f)

Me and her friend never really talked. I am over my ex and I am ready to start dating. When I realized I was ready to date the first person that came to mind was her friend. From what I’ve been told about her, it seems like we have a lot in common and I want to give it a shot with her. 

But knowing my ex who has always only talked negative about me and during our relationship, her (the friend) idea of me might be the complete opposite of who I really am. 

Also the ex has been dating/sleeping since day 1 of break up of a 4year relationship. It’s been 1 month &amp; a few days. I have been over her, no feelings for her anymore a bit halfway of a month. Like I said I am ready to date. Did not choose her friend for revenge or anything, I truly believe her friend is someone I can really enjoy spending time with and be possibly be happy with

I didn’t have any romantic feelings left for him so I was actually able to have casual sex with him quite easy. 
He has now admitted 3 seperate times he has feelings for me, he can’t stop thinking about me and he wants to commit to our relationship. 2/3 of those times I felt I wasn’t ready and told him.

The 3rd time he admitted he liked me was more recent and I told him I needed time to develop my romantic feelings for him again. We hung out a couple days ago and I’ve found I felt a spark of that come back so now I want to give this a chance.

He’s gone away for a week so I can’t see him for that time. But ever since our last hang out we haven’t been communicating as much as I would like… I think because I didn’t mention anything I may have ruined it?

I (31M) haven’t been on an in person date since February of 2020 and I recently took a 6 month hiatus from dating altogether. I did a bunch of virtual dates up until this past summer. None of those developed into any sort of meaningful relationship. I wouldn’t have met up with anyone in person unless both of us were vaccinated and it looked like we could have a serious relationship. I was very careful to avoid contact with too many people during the first year of the pandemic. I got a new job in July and moved away in August. I deleted all my dating apps when I got the new job since it was pointless to try to find a partner 400 miles away from where I was moving to. I decided to take a few month break from August onward, just to avoid any unnecessary stress and really focus on my job. 

I was excited to start dating again after the holidays, but thanks to Omicron, I’m going to have to put that on hold. I realize that Omicron is likely a weaker variant and I’m triple vaccinated so my risk of serious illness is minimal. But, I don’t want to have to miss work or infect anyone I live with or go out with even if I’m asymptomatic. I’d prefer to wait until things are a bit safer. 

I guess my question is, how has in-person dating changed during the pandemic? What are new considerations I should be taking into account when I start going out with people in person again? I’m tempted to begrudgingly do some virtual dates again. I just really crave the ability to make eye and physical contact with someone.

I'm definitely not good looking, I'm far from intelligent, I'm not rich, I'm completely androgynous looking which creeps people out (it's like they can't decide if I'm a 60 year old woman or a 12 year old boy. Here's a hint. It's neither.), I'm on disability, I'm not funny, and there's nothing I'm really good at despite having a whole bunch of different interests.

Most of my relationships I ended up with someone who was just desperate and probably would have gone after anybody. I was never special. And my partner is never really paid any attention to me. My birthday, Valentine's day, christmas, none of that was ever remembered or paid attention to. Even though I got them something. And even though I was considered a dick and a tool when I didn't forget but the gift I got her wasn't expensive enough. I never really received any physical affection at all from my partner. No hugs, no kisses, unless they wanted me to hug and kiss them. But I never got anything in return. Sex was like that as well. I have been entirely sexually selfless. Everything was pretty much just me servicing the other person but I never got to get off too. It was never mutual which is what I really wanted. 

Same with making all the moves. The other person would State their interest and yet expect me to do everything. I paid for everyday, I arranged every date, so on and so forth. And yes this happened even with boys. They would treat me like I meant nothing to them. They never wanted to go out or do anything, no matter who it was it was always just us hanging out watching TV which is fine but it was like they never wanted to do anything with me. They would also completely ignore me in public. Pretend not to know who I was around there friends and said that we need to keep everything ""on the down low"" and there was no way that their family could ever know about me. Makes me feel completely unloved.

I was expected to always cater to them and their needs but if I ever so much as wanted to hug or something I was a dick. I was also expected to give up everything such as all of my friends and a lot of my possessions but if I so much as expressed my discomfort with my girlfriend at the time sexting some guy online I was a ""fucking tool"". So I just held my tongue and let her sext the guy.

Most of my ex's are men. But the one thing all of these guys and the two girls had in common were that they were all completely emotionally unavailable. And yet they expected me to always be emotionally available to them. If I got tired of being constantly ignored and snubbed in favor of somebody else and decided that I wanted to break it off and find someone who actually appreciated me, I was an asshole.

Also none of these people have ever been attracted to me. They would all tell me how to disgusting they found me for various reasons. First boyfriend thought I was disgusting when my hair wasn't straightened and lost all attraction to me when he saw that I had inverted nipples. I didn't think it was a big deal but he made a *huge* deal over it. Second boyfriend thought I was fat when I was only 70 lb. First girlfriend said I looked old.Third boyfriend thought I was ugly unless I wore heavy under eye concealer *and*called me disgusting on multiple occasions. And my last girlfriend thought I was the most revolting thing she'd ever laid eyes on but stayed with me for the money.
 
Honestly? The most affection I've ever experienced from any person was when a fuckbuddy of mine took me out for lunch and hugged me. Was Steak and Shake. But I was still completely swept away because holy shit someone is actually acting like they like having me around for once.

****feel free to skip this part of my life story that helps you understand my emotional roadmap that leads me to my crisis****


  This year is starting to get quite interesting. A few months ago I started out with almost $1000 in my bank account, but after this month, I’m down to my last $20. Thank goodness I get paid again tomorrow. 

  I would have more than that if I didn’t have to spend most of my paycheck on prorated rent on a new apartment because my boyfriend hasn’t been been making his part of the rent. 

  Now don’t get me wrong, there were only a few times he wasn’t able to pay the $600 I quoted him. But after crunching some numbers on bills and food, I needed at least $650 and there’s been some times he only gave me $400. I covered the difference for him the months he couldn’t give me the full amount. 

  He goes to school full time and he was able to get a side job making extra money and also refinanced his car, but he wasn’t going to be able to cover it still. 

  I did everything I could short of cancelling internet service and cellphone bills. I knew a change needed to happen before I was in a deep financial crisis. 

  I had recently bought a new car and the car insurance is just astronomical for full coverage. It is unfortunately due to the state I live in even though I have no had a traffic violation in over 5 years. They want me to pay $268 a month. 

  Luckily, with my good credit, my car payment is $168 a month. You really can’t beat that. Before that my past car was 10 years old and I had to put a lot of money into it with all the issues. 

  I would bring it to the shop and it would cost over $800 a visit for major mechanical issues. I won’t bore you with what those issues were. Luckily, They had a finance program and I would make monthly payments and when it was paid off, another issue would occur and it would cost about $1000 the next time! I brought it to the dealership with 5 star reviews. 

  I figured with all the monthly payments I was sinking into fixing my old car, it was time to invest in a more reliable car. 

  Ever since then, I have drastically changed my habits. I stopped eating out and buying groceries, I stayed home ALL the time so I wasn’t spending money on gas. I cancelled all my tv memberships and gym membership. I still wasn’t able to afford my living situation anymore with what my boyfriend was giving me. 

  I had worked two jobs before I got a promotion and I make a little less than what I was making before. Truth be told, I worked two jobs for 2 years with a physical disability in my feet. And there’s no chance I am ever going to do that to myself. I would work myself to death from 10:30am to 11:00 pm with an hour break in between.  

  I had told my boyfriend my concerns covering for him and it went on for several more months without any real solution being made. I finally jumped to a cheaper apartment in town and will be saving $150 a month with the change. 

  I’ve been very fortunate to have made it this far considering all the obstacles, but it should help with my finances. My manager is talking about giving me a raise and it seems like everything is on an upward trajectory to get my life back. 

  Honest to god, I’ve been stress eating so much and don’t ever have energy to go exercise since my promotion with the new hours working overnight. 

  I just sit at home all day depressed and eating so I’ve been gaining weight. And I don’t have any motivation to make any kind of changes. 

  I’ve been stuck in this rut for almost 4 years since my breakup with my last ex boyfriend. I have actually gotten two job offers before in 2020: one in Houston making nothing and one in Denver, Co probably not making enough to survive on my own out there. It paid $17/hr. 

  I walked away from both opportunities because I thought I wanted to move to a big city, but that was before Covid and all the riots. Now I’m content with living a smaller city that still has things to do post Covid. And I don’t have to worry about the chaotic times we are in. 

  The only unfortunate thing is we got hit with two major hurricanes and even after a year, we haven’t recovered. There’s jobs in the city but none of them meet my needs. I want a regular day job working in an office away from the public, but still able to afford my bills, traveling, with enough for savings. 

  I was so unhappy working for the public during the pandemic and after the hurricanes. I feel like since the change, it made my mental health so much better to be away from that and focus what matters to me. 

  But it’s not so easy making a big jump and going somewhere else with the pay. You have to figure no matter where you go and what you do there will be obstacles. I want to stay close to my family, live comfortably, and not have to be in a huge city. Plus, it’s just not that easy finding a job where I am currently. 


*****skip ahead to here******


  Another predicament I have is the current state of my relationship with my boyfriend. 

  We’ve been together for over a year and I feel like I don’t want to keep the relationship going. I honest to god feel like he has an intellectual disability and I have been keeping this going because there’s no way I could do this by myself financially even making $14 an hour now. 

  Plus I would be all alone and depressed and I feel like he’s the only friend I have in my life and can depend on. Please hear me out on this…

  I will miss him for the whole day when he’s gone but when he comes home and I have to listen to him talk, I just want to be away from him. I don’t ever touch him and he’s a very touchy feely person. 

  I don’t like to change in the same room as him and I masterbate in the bathroom when he’s in the bedroom. Everything points to this is not healthy for either of us. 

  If he moves out I’d be fucked. I’d have to move back home with my parents because even at $14/hr I can’t afford all my bills by myself. I’ve posted ads online for a roommate before and realized I could not rely on that. Hell, I even listed furniture for sell and they all sat there for months at a quarter of the original value. And it was brand new. 

  I’m in some deep shit and have no choice but to pay off debt before I can even think about doing anything by myself. I’ve gone to therapy for my depression and anxiety. 

  I’ve done EVERYTHING. So any comments below just reiterating everything I have said or telling me how much of a bad person I am, do not comment if you’re not going to be helpful. 

  I have gotten comments saying I should kill myself. You don’t have to read this article. You don’t have to comment if you’re going to be nasty. 

  I have gotten therapy about all of this and honestly all they did was help me with some grounding techniques and establish my values and goals. Everything I’ve been doing is in direct alignment with all my values. 

  I think as far as my relationship, yeah I really think we are better as friends. If I’m able to pay off some debt and save again, I’d love to go out of town and spend some time with him. He has become a good friend of mine. 

  I just can’t handle his mannerisms or his disability. You wouldn’t even know he has one because he is normal when you first meet him. 

He’s going to school to become a tv reporter, he has been a weatherman for his local tv channel, he has a full job working for the state of Texas. He just doesn’t make any money and can’t sometimes help me with the financial responsibilities. 

  Yes, he deserves better than me. Chances are there isn’t going to be anything you comment I don’t already know. 

  I’ve done everything I can to address my mental health issues. I hope by coming on here, I will receive some support and maybe a similar story with what some of you have done to get out of a rut and find the motivation to make your life all it was meant to be. 

  I don’t want to look back on right now and regret how I wasted away being young. I’ve always dreamed of traveling to other countries, living abroad, and doing interesting things like trying to ski in the alps. 

  I’m happy with my life for the most part because I got everything I wanted so far, but now I am about to be going into my 30s with so many regrets. 

  A lot comes down to money issues. I know money can’t buy happiness but damn I feel like it would if you come from being poor trying to have nice things having to work 3 times as hard.

A little context: I am M(25), parents divorced when I was three. Dad was single and worked very long hours to support us, but I was often isolated at home. Mom dipped out and had little to nothing to do with me. She often made excuses or flat out lied about why, would seldom even contact me on my birthday or Christmas. Neglected to pay child support until I was already an adult and she was legally forced to back pay what she owed. As an adult I’ve had some toxic relationships where I end up sacrificing more than I should / my own mental health just to keep the relationship alive when it’s not healthy to do so, I’ve since learned not to overextend and value myself a lot more, and set boundaries for what I’ll accept from a partner.

Present day: I have made a year of substantial improvements to my mental and physical health but I feel like there’s a piece missing before I consider myself “complete”. I work out, training strength and cardio 2-3 times per week, am making consistent gains and have lost quite a bit of body fat (used to be 280, currently at 257.7). I am gaining confidence in myself and my looks, I honestly think I have a really fun and wholesome personality, but sometimes when I meet new people I get excited at all of the possibilities, but when things don’t work out or they’re not as interested as I am, it totally shits on my confidence and I’m at a loss for how to stop internalizing it like it’s a failure.

Don’t get me wrong, I totally understand that not everyone is going to want to date me. I have realistic expectations of women, I don’t text obsessively or hold people hostage in conversation, and I definitely don’t think I’m “owed” a relationship. I do think that I’m worthy of love however, and when I meet someone and it feels like we click, and then they ghost me / lose interest, it makes me feel like I’ve done something wrong even though I know that’s not necessarily the case. 

I’m fine with the not-dating aspect of it, if people aren’t meant to be then they won’t, it’s really simple. I just don’t know how to stop internalizing it like it’s something that I personally fucked up when someone’s not interested. I’ll do really well for a while and focus on myself, I’ll feel confident and comfortable and “good enough”, but then I meet someone interesting and when they’re not interested I feel “not good enough”.

So I (32M) and my GF (30F) have only been together for a few months, but unfortunately due to schedules (different weekends, I have sat/sun off and she works them) and distance (hour+ drive) we rarely get to spend much time together in person. (We do a ton of movie/phone dates to make up for some aspects)

I'm not sure if its the honeymoon phase of a new relationship is ending, and she's feeling the somewhat LDR pains, or if I'm just missing something?

So for the past month I had some vacation time that I had to use before the new year, so I'd take fridays off to make them 2 day weekly dates (I'd head up after work on Thursday,  and come back on Saturday after dropping her off at work). 

For Christmas she had told me about her plans with her friends, and last minute invited me when my plans fell through(one of my friends got sick), and I told her I'd have to see if my group was doing a online Christmas instead and that I'd let her know if I was able to go. We did, so I didn't end up going.

We made plans for NYE, and what to do for dinner etc. Then a couple of days ago, she said that she had the weekend off if I wanted to stay a couple more days. I responded by mentioning that my friends had talked if my friend was better we might be doing our Christmas plans either Saturday or Sunday so I may not be able to stay another night, and almost immediately I noticed a shift in her text tone. 

She said that if I had plans for Saturday, that she'd just spend it with her girl friend instead, that 16 hours together wouldn't be worth the drive since half of it would be sleeping.

And today after ending a movie date early to help her son (which is fine), she texted me saying that she wasn't feeling a movie, that she wasn't in a good mood. Followed by a text a bit later saying that she feels like she has expectations for my time and attention and that it feels too soon for that, so she needs to set boundaries  for herself so she doesn't get needy and upset and ruin what we have. And that she's not sure if she'll be out of the funk by Friday.

I guess I just don't understand that logic? ""I want to spend time with you so much that I feel like I'll get upset if we can't hangout as much, so I'm going to cancel the plans we had for a holiday."" All because I *may* have plans for one of the days that she normally works. I mean I'd 100% understand if I was canceling plans to meet with friends, but that's not the case..

I 27M have been casually dating a 26F for 6+ months.

She had been six months removed from a 7-year relationship; and was always honest about not looking for anything serious. I wanna give her credit for that. 

However, we had been going on amazing dates over this past half year; and although she was open about talking to other guys, I was the only one she had been going on dates with. We had sex while drunk once after the first date; but only had sex again during our date last week while sober. During that date, we were so intimate. Her calling me cute, laughing with me, sex… all of it. 

Today she sent me a long winded message saying she didn’t see me that way; and thinks we need to take a step back. I asked for a phone call, because I believe I deserved one. 

We talked for an hour, and I told her that although I accept her lack of feelings, I stated that I felt strung along. While she DID always say she wasn’t looking for a serious relationship with ANYONE, this was the first time she said she never had feelings for me. 

This completely hurt. I asked how she was able to kiss me, have sec with me etc… and she said she always enjoyed my company; but she cannot force feelings. She simply said she never felt that way. 

So, I’m hurt…. But also a little mad. I explained that I would simply walk away if I didn’t have feelings; rather than continue to see someone. 

I don’t wanna feel resentment… but I also know that simply being friends with her would be really hard. 

Part of me wants to leave the door open, but I also don’t wanna give myself false hope. I don’t think women change their minds about things like this

Im turning 22 tmr.

I started losing hair when I was 18, and by 21 anyone could tell I just have a sparse cover of hair over my crown. From 18 to 21, I'd tried any and all things I could (aside from a hair transplant) to save my hair; including but not limited to cupping therapy, different kinds of oils, different vitamins, varying my diet, even frickken applying onion juice on my head every other day (cuz someone said it works), but it didn't make any difference. I felt like my mental health was taking a toll as well during that period since hair was something I was always always fretting about.

By December 2020, I was just tired of all of it, and finally decided that I'll embrace the baldness and shave my head; and I did. I felt like it was one of the best decisions of my life.

It's been a year since I've been routinely shaving my head, and going with the bald+bearded look.

I've never felt as confident and assertive in my life as I have for the entire 2021, and a big part of it is because I've actually started to love my new look and feel more confident in my own skin, and don't have to worry about hair anymore.

However, when I see old pictures of mine with dense hair, there's this longing inside to be like I used to look.. Yk that nostalgia..

For the entire 2021, I haven't actually had many social encounters with women. I've tried to meet women on dating apps (using my older pictures - with hair), but it hasn't worked out (maybe bc of demographic reasons - a brown guy in a white country or bc I don't have great photos? ) part of me thinks that women won't find me attractive anymore (unless I have a head full of hair).

I recently found out that bc of Christmas sales, they're selling Rogaine (minoxidil) pretty cheap. So I told myself, whats the harm in trying it for a few months? Ppl say it works, and I still have a fair bit of 'thin' hair covering my entire head (just not dense) - Rogaine could help me strengthen it and grow it back?

However, when I thought deeply I realised that I only want hair bc: I 'think' women will find me more attractive with hair, than without.

But on the flip side, I'd have to spray that shit liquid/foam x2/day on my head indefinitely, and wig out and take 'progress' photos every week, and just constantly focus on my hair (and it makes me feel like going back to the 18-21 age zone again).

I have my house-mate, whose like 27, has gotten a hair-transplant and now just sprays minoxidil every day on his head. I told him all this, and he told me he's not the right person to talk about it since he's taken drastic steps to deal with his hair loss (I think he took offence) - so anyhow that's why I want y'alls opinion.

Wdy guys think I should do? rock the bald and bearded look, and focus on other areas of life?

I've been hitting the gym regularly, I've been focusing on my classes, I've been getting my money up, and I've been focusing on my future. I put dating on hold for a while, but recent developments have opened my eyes.

In my 20 years of life, I've only been in one relationship, and it turned out horrible. I've talked to a few girls after, but I've had the worst luck with them. Either they have someone they already have on their mind, they don't return my energy, or they simply put play me.

To add salt onto my wounds, COVID stole nearly two years of my college experience, and deteriorated my once renowned and amazing social skills and confidence. That's two years worth of people I could have met and gotten to know down the drain.

Since I'll be graduating Winter 2022, I feel like if I don't find someone in the next two semesters, then I'll be stuck waiting for someone who doesn't exist to walk into my life. Not to mention, trying to date after college with a break as big as mine sounds like a recipe for disaster.

Online dating doesn't work for me. I've tried multiple apps, and the results are the same. Either they don't know how to hold a conversation, they aren't my type, or they don't text back. I don't have any female friends who I could imagine being with, so looking into my own circle isn't an option either.

The only viable option I have is to find someone on campus. That itself poses a lot of issues. I don't know how to make a move on someone who is a complete stranger, someone who I may not even have class with. An additional issue is that they may already have a boyfriend, or they might be in a group setting which would make it really awkward for me if not for the both of us.

I'm have a full beard that I keep light and groomed, I have wavy black hair, I have a 140lbs skinny-athletic physique, and my only physical short coming would be that I'm 5'8 which I hear may matter by some.

I suddenly felt sad. Because he was the only one I was talking to and I had no interest talking to anybody else.

One I really hate and would like to change. Therapy is not an option because of money.
I used to think I was ace, but turns out it was just my self-hate. No shade towards aces, you're great, I'm just not one. 

For some reason I only get interested in people who are 1) way out of my league 2) abusive 3) unstable

Basically, I only ""love"" when someone makes me worried constantly, is a POS and I'm not at risk of ever getting into a relationship with them. I guess they make me feel useful.

Once they show interest, they suddenly start to annoy or scare me. And once they want to do anything intimate, my brain goes ""wtf, this is gross, their taste is so weird"". And then I lose interest, snap out of my fascination with them and realise that they were in fact abusive. Which is great when someone is a threat. Better to realise late than become... late.

The problem is, it's the same for actually nice people. I either cut the relationship short when they say they like me OR I stay ""friends"" with them. But in reality, I barely tolerate them and scream at my phone every time I see a notification. I have a history of SH. At someone being NICE to me.

I realise this is messed up, and I would very much like to have a partner one day, own two cows and a breadbox and ykno, live a normal human life.

I (M/23) have been pondering re: my identity.

It's hard to be not straight.

But it's harder to be not a straight ""gay"".

I am attracted sexually to both bananas and peaches. Yet, emotionally and romantically into girls only.

People around me thought that I'm gay for how loud and funny I am as a person. And thought I have/ had /will have a boyfie in the near future.

Growing up, even in elementary and up unti now, I have crush on girls and not on guys.

I tried to build romantic relationship with some girls, but it will end up as a friend zone or busted. Tried to do dating with guys but ends up I'm not really interested.

Now, it's being solidified again for I started to like a girl in college whose also a close friend of mine. I don't know how should I pour out my feelings carefully. I plan to pursue her. But I overthink.

Need your thoughts. Both on my current identity crisis and on how to face this feeling of mine.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1143298,public,self,"I'm Bi, not too femme but loud.
