I’m someone who easily gets cold…i always wear sweaters in the day time. Meanwhile he easily gets hot. Considering where we come from, he’s from lower temperatures and I’m from all year round hot and humid temps, and the heatwave in California feels just right to me.

The movie ended and we made our way outside (it was night). I felt cold. I had on a long sleeved blouse however my chest was exposed. (Leaving the house, i didn’t think i would need an extra layer that night). H&amp;M was literally a few feet away and I told him “c’mon I wanna go buy a sweater right quick”. He told me “nah cmon we good”. So i tried to stick it out…but after a minute I told him i really need to buy a sweater. Btw, he is walking ahead of me. He says the same thing and now i start getting fustrated. I told him “im cold and stores are literally right here”. He responds by saying i have on more layers than him and he’s not complaining that he’s cold (getting mad at me at this point). I found that to be so insensitive. Like, am I supposed to persuade you to believe that I feel cold enough to qualify for a sweater? Well for the rest of the night he walked way ahead of me going wherever he was going and i didnt chase behind him since he obviously didnt want to be around me as though i did something wrong. So to top it off he didnt care that I was walking by myself at night cause he was too pissed at me.

I keep giving him the benefit of the doubt because of what he does for me…he really is considerate, but apparently only with the practical matters. But the way he treats me translates to inconsiderate and insensitive and I can’t deny it anymore. I’m always busy trying to understand his POV and accepting it even though it might contrast to mine, even though many times I still have valid reasons to be upset, but he never does the same for me. He’s showing me how rigid and uncompromising his way of thinking is.

(I liked his profile first). After the date, I followed up via text message and suggested we should do it again sometime. We texted for several days and he never mentioned a 2nd date nor did he address my suggestion to meet up again in his response. I’m on OLD for a serious relationship, not a pen pal so a few days later, I suggested that we should schedule a 2nd date. He responded back saying he thinks I’m a great person and he had a good time but he met someone recently, wanted to see how it goes with her so we shouldn’t see each other romantically again. Fair enough. I thanked him for his honesty and wished him luck. The conversation ended there and I thought that was the last I would hear from him.

After a short break from Hinge, I decided to make a Coffee Meets Bagel profile. I’m only two days in and I see that this same guy has liked me on CMB. I mean, he could have mindlessly swiped… Possibly? But really? We met in person on our first date… My first picture is different but 4/6 of my Hinge pics are on CMB. Also if it matters, I’m in a major US city and my profession is not common at all. Everyone here is in tech or finance and I can’t be any further from both. The reason why I’m confused is we are still matched on Hinge and he has my phone number (assuming he didn’t delete it but if he did it’s the last message we exchanged on Hinge). If he wanted to talk again, he could have reached out on Hinge or text and not have to like my profile on CMB? I read it’s common for people to match again on different OLD apps. However unlike in those situations where some ghosting and/or an unmatch occurred that would make it difficult to contact the person without a rematch, this guy has 2 easier ways to contact me than a rematch on another OLD app.

What do you think this means and how should I go about this? I wouldn’t mind seeing how things go with him again but obviously only if he was serious about it. He seemed like a genuine person on the first date and we had lots in common, but honestly his actions are very confusing. My friends said I should leave the CMB like as is right now and text him directly to ask about the CMB like and see how he goes about explaining it/see where it leads. I’m not opposed to this but I would like to hear other people’s perspectives and could use some help phrasing my text if I choose that route.

At the volunteer house I am staying at there is a really cute guy who visits for a few days most weeks in between travelling around doing jobs/research. He works sometimes for the organisation which is why he sometimes uses the house. 

I just don’t know how to subtly show I find him attractive or how to know if he finds me. His first language is obviously Italian and I know he has a slight disdain for speaking English with volunteers (don’t blame him). My Italian is mostly a few words/phrases but I try speak them and understand Italian where I can. So it is difficult for me to initiate conversation because I know he doesn’t like speaking English but I can’t speak Italian well yet. 

Most of the time I think he doesn’t find me attractive at all — he often goes off on his own, doesn’t look at me much at all, and doesn’t often initiate conversation, but maybe this is also his personality/the language problem.

Sometimes we have really nice conversations about niche things or he will ask me questions about myself but he is probably just being friendly. Although, the first evening he visited he said I had a beautiful name and another day we went to the bar to watch football and he was showing me what offside was by moving bottles, he kept placing his hands where mine were on the bottles/glasses.

Still I feel like I’m reading into a lot of this and I don’t know how to subtly know if he finds me in any way attractive or how to get to know him more. Also he often just speaks Italian with the other volunteer who is here a lot so I struggle to keep up with conversation. He has left now again and I don’t know when he will be back; he is very much a ‘free spirit’. My housemate gave me his number but I know he doesn’t use his phone much and feel awkward texting for no reason when we haven’t spoken so much. Should I message asking when he will be back and if he would like to do something like go for a walk next time he comes? Or is this weird?
I also recently found out he is older than I thought (like 28-30) though he looks and acts more like 25. Perhaps this makes it weirder, I understand why a 30 year old would not be at all interested in a 20 year old.

Now, I'm basically starting over, and I need some advice. I've never had a relationship before, and I've decided that this year was the year that I changed that. So, time to play the Bumble, Hinge, and Coffee Meets Bagel game again. 

1. Flirting: I have no idea how to flirt over text. People always say ""make sure to flirt"" but like, what does that mean? How do you create that sexual tension that takes the conversation from ""Hi, how are you?"" to ""Wanna go out sometime?"" I'm not looking for a hookup, but I know small talk is basically Kryptonite in OLD. 

2. When to ask them out? How long is too long? I don't want to waste either of our time, but at the same time, idk how people convince a total stranger to meet up within 3 messages. I've seen posts where women complain that the guy they've been texting for 2 weeks now wants to meet up because ""that's moving too fast."" OTOH, I've seen posts where the guy basically opens with ""You're hot, wanna get drinks?"" and gets the date. So, how does this work? Yes, I know there's no one size fits all. And yes, I've heard ""Steps 1 and 2"" more times than I can count. I'm asking for real, practical advice on how and when to pop the question.

Heart break, them being judgemental, etc. I won’t go into it much. About a year and a half ago, I thought “why the hell not” and began shooting my shot on 30’s+ ladies. Sometimes they would be confused about it, other times knew exactly what I was doing, and some times flattered. 

Why is it such a big deal though, age difference? If both people are consenting adults and upfront about their intentions, then what’s so bad?

I cannot for the life of me now make moves toward women my age. I’ve tried to. The awkwardness, beating around the bush, and all the indirect annoyances with women my age remind me why I stepped away from it.

For those who aren’t digging into my profile, I am 20 and nearing 21. The age group I lean most towards are late 30’s early 40’s. Not that this is a rule for me, kinda just the exception and I’ve found my most success in that area of age. I’ve never had any in person interactions yet, all of it has been online since the pandemic. 

I’m also Polyamorous &amp; pansexual AND non-binary and have found genuinely the most acceptance and validation in my life within the older age dating groups. I have never seen any one of these ladies ever try to break my heart or hurt me at all. I’ve never had to jump through hoops, loops, and beat around a bush.

(F 23) Im in desperate need of advice 😕. There is this guy (M 26) I once met on a dating app, we matched each other and starting talking instantly and we seemed to click and dig on each other’s vibe. He would tell me he digged me and how he thought how cool I was. Then we started following each other on Instagram and commenting on each other posts blah blah ya know the whole Shabang! Well this is where things got weird. I would ask if he was down to hang out (which already felt weird to me as the girl asking) and he would come up with an excuse as to why he couldn’t. Mostly cause the guy goes to festivals and sees live bands a lot! Which is understandable single dude living it up. So one day I said let me join him on one since I knew this would be the only way to really see this guy and plus I haven’t been to a live band in quite some time. We met and it was alright, he was nervous and it made me nervous lol but he still tried to make me feel comfortable especially infront of his friends who were extremely nice. We got to know each other a bit more. It seem alright and cool. I decided to leave early and just go home. He walked me to my car and gave me a long hug, I felt a little tension (that kinda tension) and that’s it. I went home and decided to party with some of my friends. Anyways later on that night he starts texting me saying how nervous I got Him and how beautiful I looked blah blah and I reciprocated the same type of energy/words. So throughout the next couple weeks he would text or message me on Instagram, but never initiates to hang out. Which throws me off. So I did again and once again he is always busy. So I finally told him maybe it’s best we don’t continue things because I get mixed signals from the dude. He told me he was very interested just has been a long time since he had put himself out there. He told me he does want to see me again. So another week or two pasts by and he invited me out to see a band with him. I went and was accompanied by him and his friends that I met the first time and I ended up having a really fun night. Me and his friends click really really well. But when it came to conversation with him he got awkward and quiet and it made me awkward and quiet.  I’m the type of person who will reflect the energy you are giving. So whatever, I’m just confused by this dude. I keep thinking there is something wrong with me like I’m boring or not interesting enough. But when I’m with his friends it’s the total opposite. He starts to drink a bit and so do I, then i noticed he opens up and we sit down and finally have a one on one conversation. We start laughing and even flirting. To the point where the physical touches start to come in, I noticed at one point he was resting his legs on mine (we were sitting on bar stools) and slowly but smoothly he put his arm around me. Gently pulling my body towards his. AND DANG, when I say the sexual tension I felt between us was like 😳🔥⚡️✨🔥🌟✨🔥💥💥💥. we both still kept it PG-13 we were very close to kissing and he even said a comment about how close we were to kissing. Anyways we were def doing some slight cuddling for the rest of the night. I told him I was gonna leave cause the bar was closing and the band ended. He said Ok and walked me to my car. Not gonna lie this is the moment where I thought he was for sure going to kiss me. But he didn’t. Literally just gave me a hug and thanked me for coming out. And I left. I didn’t really care that he didn’t kiss me though because I was on such a high from having a good night. So here is where I feel I messed up, I went home and texted him if he was still down to hang out which I felt like it sounded desperate in some way, but he told me he was already on his way home with his friends that he got a ride with. So I told him oh ok never mind have a good rest of your night. And he texted me a couple more times that night about some bands to listen to and I told him I loved seeing the live bands and to invite me if there was anymore this weekend (since we met on a Friday night) he says of course I’ll keep you in the loop. The next morning/day (Saturday) he doesn’t text me which was like eh what? Then this morning (Sunday) I saw he didn’t have a story on Instagram which is not like him, so I had my roommate look up his Instagram just to see, and sure enough he had a full story of him going out to see a live band with his friends (Saturday night) and well just to put it in shorter terms he blocked me from seeing his story. I’m not gonna lie even though it does hurt my feelings I think to myself hey maybe this guy just wants to enjoy himself with his friends but I’m not sure, am I overthinking it? sorry if this was long but I really needed to give some context so you guys understand the mixed signals I am receiving from this guy.

I (30M) am beginning to severe ties with my family. I could use some internal healing that I'm working on, but I'm legitimately okay not going to another family gathering because every instance of most of my immediate family is just filled with bad feelings.

I could go on about that....but it has affected several dates, because family is important considering you potentially could start a family with someone you're dating one day. Is it a part of my core values? Do I want kids? Etc. So when someone says ""How are your parents?"" I am either changing the subject or I'm going over why I go to therapy once a week. Both give the image of red flags whereas I have a completely logical reason to feel the way I do. 

So, all of you fine redditors out there, what would you recommend? How do I not get judged on circumstances outside of my control?

I've been with my bf for 2 years now. We used to text every day in the first few months. We also lived together for some time so I'm aware of his texting behaviour. He's on his phone daily (several hours per day on social media) and has long conversations with his friends over texts (not daily but it happens). He also often gets on calls with his friends for several hours many times a week. Sometimes we'll be hanging out and he'll start texting his friends while I'm talking to him.

Whenever we're not together, we barely text each other. I mean, I text him but I don't want to text him so much that I seem clingy. You know, when I send 10 texts one after the other and he only sends like a ""ok"" message xD and especially I don't want to always be the one every day to message him first. I'm the kind of person who likes messaging someone if something interesting happens in my day to day life and I love having long conversations by texts. I just find it hard to have that with my bf, and it used to not be hard early on in the relationship. I've talked to him about it and he said he'll work on it but I don't feel like he did. A few days ago he was busy doing something really fun and he said he'll keep me updated about what happens afterwards, and he ended up not texting me the whole day. Maybe he forgot. And knowing he's on his phone a lot, it's not like he hates texting so it's not even about what kind of person he is, it just really feels like he doesn't wanna talk to me specifically (because I know for a fact he checks in with his friends basically daily and he checks his messages in the morning and at night).

For the fourth of july, i invited her over to party as we’ve been hanging out consistently for 2 months, and we both know we want to be together. we’re practically a couple, we go on dates, have sex, cuddle, make out, help each other through tough situations, and of course really enjoying each others company.


anyway she said she couldnt come and that she was planning on going away to ____ to get work done on her car since she knows a mechanic that could cut her a deal there. 

i was fine with that, asked if i could go with her; she said no.

she then went on to reveal that the mechanic is her ex’s father ( from high school ) years ago and that shes good friends with his sister as well. 

i understood why i couldnt go, lets say her ex still has feelings and im there; obviously that would be a bad mix. might not be able to get what she needs if im there. 

she came over before she was leaving to go over to meet with her ex’s dad ( the mechanic ). and then she revealed she’d be staying with them from today to monday, because the car will be done tonight and since its 4th of july; they are obviously throwing a party and she was invited. since its the dads party, she felt obligated to say yes since he’d be working on her car that whole time anyway. 


she kept those two last parts out until the last possible second. i was walking her to her car when she told me and i was shocked. felt disrespected from that honestly. she told me i had nothing to worry about and that nothing would happen; but i know its alot easier said than done with alcohol in your system with your ex.

I met my bf on happn about 8 months ago. We are both in our thirties. 

A few days ago we had an argument and on my mind we broke up and I reactively joined the app again for distraction. To my surprise it showed him as active. I told him that I saw him on the app and I was honest for my reasons of being there, but he insists that there is an issue with the app and denies using it. I don’t understand why he would lie about it when I was upfront that I was on the app too. He could have just said that he joined for the same reason too or something else. The next day it did not only show him as active but online too. Again, I confronted him and again the same story, that he knows nothing about it. Again, if I could see him online on the chat he could see me too, so why lie and not just admit it? He said he contacted happn directly and his account is unavailable now. 

This is not the first time I catch him being on the app. Another time I was just curious and reactivated just to check if he’s there and he was. When I confronted him he said the same thing, he does not know how this happens when he has deactivated it and then his account was unavailable again.

Has anyone else deactivated happn (not just deleted the app, but deactivated) and being told that they show online or active? Am I being too suspicious or am I being gaslighted? 

Btw he is the one that insisted on deleting our accounts and on being exclusive.

I will not send her this somewhere more personal like whatsapp. Thinking of insta or fb.

You might remember, a while back, I texted you a lot which resulted in you getting irritated and pissed. It was between our higher secondary and first year (2 years ago). The time was weird and, so was I. I will not blame the things I did wrong on that time. Whatever I did in the past, if it ever made you feel bad, hurt, or something at all, I apologize to you.

Facebook dating and POF try to match me with people 100 miles away and most apps are swipe based.
I understand the intention behind a swipe based app but c’mon! I’m sure I missed out on a handful of matches because I’m buried behind a ton of bad swipes or the person I’d be compatible with is buried under “suggestions” that don’t match my preferences when I swipe. Then apps like zoosk or okcupid advertise that they’re free but theres paywalls that cost more than all of my utility bills combined.

There has to be a better way. Seriously, if I had money I could develop an app overnight with a better system. They make it seem so complicated but it’s not.

I've been talking to this girl for about 2.5 months now, we've gone on 3 dates and have chemistry and have definitely hit it off. 

Friday night we had our third date. Mini golf, then we went back to my place and slow danced in my living room and got smoothies. It was fun! I've been single for about 4 years and this girl seems pretty cool, I like her company. 

She comments on my photos I post and also texts me in the morning when she knows I had a bad day. We aren't exclusively dating yet but she had definitely gone the Extra mile to show that she cares about me. 

On our date she was talking about how she doesn't like it when guys come up behind her at bars and try to get her to grind on them. Last night she posted a video of her grinding on some guy and it rubbed me the wrong way. I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother me. 

I was also out last night and was kinda drunk. I swiped up and said ""wtf"" and she said ""whaatt"" and then asked where I was. 

Yeah we aren't dating exclusively, I know that. But this really does bother me especially when the tried making it sound like she didn't like that stuff. The crowd she hangs with it definitely not my crowd, but when I'm with her she's a lot more chill and down to earth. (She goes out a lot with her girlfriends and some weird looking guys). 

It's odd to me that she would post that the day after telling me how she didn't like that stuff. It's also weird seeing that the day after I went on a date with her.  

I don't know what to do. I feel like i should communicate my thoughts but I don't know how to do it or what to say. I don't want to screw this up but also feel like I shouldn't do nothing about it.

- she had a period when she stayed alot of hours at the job(claiming she had alot of work to do)
- one of my friends(female) that went to a bar with her once told me she talked to a guy(nothing sexual) but she heard her complaining about me, not going out as much as she wants and being nerdy. 
- she used to send me screenshots of guys that would text her(most of the time she would reply saying that she has a boyfriend) this brings the question maybe there are texts she didn't show me.

About work stuff and things we would like to do at some point. He mentioned at some point something that indicated that he would like to see me again. He texted after we parted and said he had a nice time and then the next day he said he did not feel a spark. We joked a bit about surviving our first OLD experience and that’s about it. 
The thing now is that I really liked him. In terms of looks he is a normal looking guy sort of nerdy but definitely cute and his personality was great (i know i only saw him once but no red or yellow flags- nada). He is funny, he is kind and he seemed like a normal genuine guy.

I met his mom, step dad,  siblings, grandparents, etc.. This guy started trying to pick fights with everyone. He was cussing everyone out and calling them abusers in his childhood. He threw a beer all over his mom &amp; then he attacked his grandpa and punched him and he got punched back...and then his mother was threatening to hit me if I didn't get him off the campsite, because they were gonna get kicked out. Everyone was screaming and cussing saying they disown him and want nothing to do with him and how they knew this was gonna happen. It was such a nice day until then. They  were all  drinking so heavily. His mom yelled at him saying he hits all of his ex girlfriends. His mom and grandpa apparently assaulted and abused him alot in his childhood, which is horrible, but it felt so uncomfortable,  scary, and inappropriate, for me meeting his family the first time. I told the police I would drive him home and it was storming like crazy. He forgot his phone, but they wouldn't let him go back in to get it. He kept trying to take my phone and was dumping stuff all over my car and hitting it on the inside, angry at me for not taking the fast enough route, when I was in a unfamiliar city &amp; he also wanted to drive. I just wanted to take the wheel and get him and his dog and I home safely and cuddle and have a good night still. He starts calling me just like his ex &amp; that I'm obsessed with my phone. I didn't feel comfortable even giving it to him while he was covered in blood and filled with rage. It was my only form of communication with my family to help me. He threatened to eject himself from my car if I didn't do what he demanded. I hit the brakes after he opened the car door while I was driving and he jumped out and then I stopped and he got his dog and he walked down the street. I was crying hysterically because I was just trying to comfort him and support him and keep him safe. He left his wallet and house keys and his tent we were gonna sleep in, all in my car. I drove home cause I was so hurt. I felt really bad this morning that I didn't go chase him down, but he would've been home &amp; he voluntarily did this, while disrespecting me.

I consider myself fairly confident but I lose it when I start thinking about my bad dating record.

I've been pretty unsuccessful, have only been in one relationship that lasted only 2 weeks. I think my biggest problem was dealing with mental health problems (depression, social anxiety) in my young adult and teen years. I've improved a lot, but I still feel stuck in inceldom.

Part of it is living in a conservative shithole (Lebanon). I also have a very Western and liberal mentality compared to most Lebanese. But i think the main reason is (1) not being able to find anyone I'm interested in (I find a lot of girls attractive and cute, but not interesting enough to make the effort to know them) and (2) not putting myself out there. I don't make that much of an effort anymore because I met my ex at a party at a time when I was trying to get over a fresh rejection. In my experience, girls find me attractive when I come across as aloof or indifferent (when I'm genuinely not looking for sex or a relationship). So I figured to stop actively looking for someone to date but I feel a strong longing for intimacy and companionship. 

In the meantime, I want to learn how to be more confident around women because I think that's always been my problem. I think my history with mental health has made it hard for me to be assertive and confident in some social situations, but I can see some minor progress along the way.

Any help and advice is appreciated. I also want to make it clear that I'm fairly comfortable and happy being single.

After that, what is the most important thing: Height? Whiteness? Face?

I know one study from Badoo found putting 6' in your bio was the #1 predictor of getting matches based on bio content so that obviously makes a huge difference.

Also experiments have found even normal white guys get 3x more messages on Tinder than top Asian male models.

But I've also heard short ethnic guys who are handsome claim they have no problem dating. And I've heard white guys who aren't handsome claim they get no matches.

So what do you think is most important? I am leaning towards thinking that having a handsome face matters most, because you don't have to put your height, and lots of white guys who aren't handsome are still struggling.

So this suggests to me having an at least average or beautiful face matters most.

After my long term relationship broke down over a year ago and we finally split up after January this year, I threw myself into online dating for the first time. I met a girl online, we were in the same city, we went on a date, it was awful, she was very unpleasant and quite rude, we never spoke again after an uncomfortable date.

In April I matched with the most beautiful girl I'd seen on tinder, you literally couldn't make it up, we had completely the same interests, she was my type in every sense and we would text each other paragraphs all day, EVERY day. We developed a deep connection and I really fell for her, we had a couple of video call dates where we watched films and all seemed to go so well, I was totally enamoured by her, and she told me that she thought I was ""neat"". A couple of small flags appeared, she continued to change all her tinder photos eventhough she had told me she deleted the app, I knew she was well within her right to date, we weren't exclusive...but why say that? She had never been in a relationship or been on a date with a girl, which wasn't much of an issue, but I was aware it could be awkward for her (I've had many girlfriends and been out for years). A month of chatting and video calls passed, I had mentioned meeting up as she had made no mention of it, and I was afraid the conversation would dry up and she would lose interest, and we agreed a date for June 30th. 

The big day came, I was so excited but really nervous, and also not feeling well (I have an autoimmune disease which she knew about), but I made the 2 and a half hour journey to see her (it wasn't a big deal as I've been in a LDR before). We went out for pizza, chatted for ages, I laughed so much my face ached, we then went to play indoor golf, there was a lot of flirting going on, but ultimately I wasn't that touchy because COVID...she wanted to leave after golf, so we went to the train station and it turned out my next train was in an hour's time, I got the impression she wanted to leave, she felt bad but left promptly anyway. 

I got home after 3/4 hours and told her how much of a great time I had and how happy it made me, she sent me a message saying how she had a great time and we got on really well but she felt things were in more of a friendship direction, but understood if I ""didn't need anymore friends and just wanted to split"", I was honestly shocked, because things had seemed so great. She assured me that I didn't do anything wrong, and my sister kept telling me that sometimes things can be great but there could ""just be something missing"", it honestly put me in such a spin, and I have been utterly depressed for days. I'm in therapy so luckily can discuss this with my therapist, guess I've just taken a knock in my confidence, because the first thing I thought was that maybe she didn't like how I looked / dressed. 
She assured me also that she would always be happy to chat and such, and that she wanted to be friends, but it feels almost embarrassing to do that now, knowing that were both on completely different playing fields. I felt such a strong connection had been built over the last 2/3 months that to just throw it away seems a shame, and to not even have a second date, but shes the type of girl to not mess around when she doesn't want something.

I matched with someone from one of them and she and I have a really nice conversation with chemistry and I think she’s cute and attractive and interesting and talented and funny. I like her it’s chill. The problem, and why I’m turning to Reddit for advice, is that I find myself seemingly unable to feel attraction even to someone that I find attractive. We just finished our second date, and I have a feeling that the thing that will let me know if I’m able to feel attraction to someone other than my ex again is if I kiss her and see how it makes me feel. The problem is I feel like that’s a disgusting thing to do to somebody. Especially because I can tell she wants me to make a move. And I told her I’m getting over a break up and I need to move slowly right now, so she’s cool with moving slowly, but still…

Is it wrong to kiss someone who you know wants you to kiss them but you’re not sure if you’re attracted to them? And just again to be clear, I do think she’s attractive and interesting and funny and I’m feeling all of the emotions that for my entire life accompany the feeling of attraction to somebody but because I’m just out of a break up from the most deep and real relationship I’ve ever had in my life I cannot tell if I am on attracted to her or if I simply have not given myself enough time to get over my ex.

I’d also like to clarify that for about a week and a half or two weeks now I have been completely at peace with the break up. I feel like I’ve moved on. But emotionally when I am in front of this person and I am looking at her and I think she’s cute and interesting and attractive I still don’t feel attracted enough to this person to make a move.And I know that hooking up with someone who I have a nice connection with will help me get over all of this finally, but I feel like kissing her as an experiment is wrong.

Just so that you guys know this beforehand. I[25] have never dated ever before. So, I might be unaware of some unwritten rules. 

There is this thing I keep hearing people say, that be friends with a girl first and then try to pursue a relationship. However, I have had one issue. Whenever, I try to be friends with a girl first, it becomes just that- friendship. There were two of my girl friends I asked out. According to them I am 'too precious of a person to lose over a relationship'. I interpret it as a rejection, in a way that won't hurt my sentiments. Am I doing something wrong or I should approach this in different way. I would be glad to get your advice.

I’ve been seeing this guy for a week, we’ve been 2 dates and hung out all night for 2 nights, we haven’t had sex or anything but we have kissed and cuddled and told each other we like each other. 

He has now gradually stopped texting me with the same energy he did before, and the responses go hours in between. However in person, he is superrrr affectionate, always kissing and wanting to be babied. He gets jealous when I talk about other guys and always jokes around/teases me. 

There was a point where he didn’t text me for more than 24 hours so I took that as a sign of ghosting, and removed him off my contacts and socials. He ends up texting me, I ask him if he’s okay, he says there’s been shit in his head he’s dealing with, then stops texting again. Hours later at 3AM he facetimes me twice, the first time I didn’t answer and the second time I did, I told him about the ghosting and removing him on social media and he told me that I could have always texted him too, etc. he wanted me to sleep over at his but usually when I’m there we don’t have sex we just kiss and cuddle then go to sleep. I don’t know if I should speak up one final time about how things should go between us, or just cut him off completely at this point, 

TLDR; guy I’ve been seeing for a week has slowly stopped showing effort on dating, and more effort on sleepovers (haven’t had sex yet but I do sleep over) and takes longer to reply to texts.

On the phone call, I was with a few of my friends of mine as I wanted to introduce her to them and she seemed to be more interested in my friends asking questions to specific people. She then told us that the last time she had sex a few days ago, which I found strange as her parents are “strict” that we can’t hangout but she can find ways sleep with other guys. We asked many questions and eventually she asked me personally what I see her as and what my intentions with her are. I replied with well do you see me as? And she said she sees me as a friend but then laughed and told me to leave so she can ask my other friend if I mad or upset at her response. Eventually my other friends fell asleep and it was just me and her and she said she wanted to ask my other friends questions since she has been talking to me and knows a lot about me and also she wanted to see who had the hottest voice and she said I had the hottest voice.

Gonna be honest, this is a pure rant post. Had an objectively great day at the beach with friends that I've known for 10+ years. Swam, played frisbee games, lots of great craft beers and BBQ, the works. The catch, is that out of 19 friends in this group... I am the only one single/unmarried. All of us between 23-30. To be honest, most of us in the group at the 8/10+ crowd of hyper attractive folks. I'm not too bad myself, probably a 6/10 or modest 7/10. 7.5 if I dress up, so I'm not too worried about looks.  
  
Otherwise, pretty normal. Geeky white dude, but tall at 6'3. Clean face, short mussed hair, etc. Athletic due to gym visits, but not ripped. I do some pretty hardcore engineering for my job and similar hobbies. I don't have any trouble getting likes or matched on OLD, but even the ones that turn into dates end up with one or both sides not feeling it. That said, I'm not under any delusion that it's everyone else's fault. I'm the common denominator, but I have a very hard time being excited by or about other people. I'm not even sure if I'd rather spend my life with a homebody or a workaholic or something else entirely. Between my own indecision and seeing myself as the ""last man standing"" today, it's been hard to feel good about things I've done and valued. It's really hard to not fall into the, ""well, there's something wrong with me"" pit trap.
