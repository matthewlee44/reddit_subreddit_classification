I really don't know what to do with myself honestly. I've been told I'm attractive but I have a very hard time believing that when hardly anyone on several dating apps will match with me, let alone TALK to me after I message. My confidence is shot so I have a hard time knowing when and where is a good time and place to talk to women in a dating sense so I just dont ever do it now in fear of being considered a creep.

Everyone I know always says the same thing in that I shouldn't care and I should be happy with platonic relationships and I'm so sick and tired of hearing this. Is it wrong of me to just want someone to come home to after a long day at work? I don't know what to do at this point. I'm turning 26 in less than a month and have very few irl friends that I can hang out with that could possibly help me and the only time I have to try and maybe look for a fate outside of terrible dating apps is on the weekend.

Time flew by, she was laughing a lot, leaning in, making eye contact, etcetera. A second date was basically implied, we talked a bit on whatsapp afterwards, I had no doubt in my mind that a another date would occur. So two days later I suggested a second date with complete confidence, but since then she's ignored me for several days.  I've had a similar experience before where a girl outright said ""I had a great time, let's do this again"" only to later come back on this statement. It's leaving me confused as to what I'm doing wrong. If you've had a great time with someone you find physically attractive, this should be enough to warrant a second date at least right? Has anyone ever been on the other side of this scenario?  Why did you have doubts afterwards?

4,qdfuam,1634905652,F25 I'm about to give up ....,"I've dated 2 men and had a ""interest only phase"" with 4 men....

The first man I romantically had interest in sexually assaulted me because he was ""waiting too long"". It took me a long while to get over that. Still am, actually.

I tried to go back in the dating scene again after 2 years of healing and met and dated a man who seemed perfect but was a 100 ton weight of mental issues with a strong stench of failure and lies. I found out he was on again, off again unemployed, had a child, lived in his parents' basement, and was cheating. Even after breaking up his footprint depressed me for many months but I didn't yet have the will to give up and tried again.

I met a man who was only interested in me sexually, which was boring and I had absolutely no interest in. Came across another right after him with the same mindset.

I dated a smart man with a good heart but he couldn't be affectionate or emotionally responsive. He had a bad habit of having a really sarcastic tone and gestures that often angered me. His only conversation consisted of memes (which I'm not that into), the same military stories he told me in the beginning (he speaks on these a lot and they don't ever change. I literally worded the stories to myself in my mind), or spoke of plans that sounded like they'll eventually blow up in his face which they usually did. Loved to squeeze up on me though and was a terrible kisser.

I tried a LDR for a bit over a month and it ended today. We're in seperate countries but they aren't far from each other. He was very private, didn't talk much about himself, never sent a non-filtered photo that didn't distort his face. Took him 3 weeks to ""have"" Internet despite having a working phone in his hand. I asked him many times to call, have a watch party, game with me ... he didn't. I asked him if he was a catfish and he claimed I wanted to fight and blocked me.

At this point I'm feeling really done with dating because the characters I meet are really taking it out of me. I'm giving this love thing one last chance though. What should I do? I'm nice. Maybe too nice. I am good spirited and a bit whimsical. And, emotional and sexual predators can smell me from a mile away and I'm like the airheaded antelope walking to the edge where the crocodile waits. As theatrical as this sounds but my heart isn't beating anymore because I have a pattern of people with agendas or aren't mature enough for a relationship.

12,qdgivg,1634907921,I sometimes feel like there's a gap between my boyfriend and I,"I (F21) have been dating him (M24) for a little over a month now. He's really great in person and gives me genuine affection and attention when we see each other, but isn't really the texter type of person between our dates. I'm still a student whereas he's working during the day and sometimes until late evening. And most evenings, I'm the one who's going to my part-time job. That, in itself, has never really bothered me until now because I respect him enough to understand he can reply whenever he has the chance to during his shift. I don't have any problem with that. To be honest, what's bugging me is that he can go hours without replying to me and still be online; not that my messages require immediate replies, but still, we just started dating and I sometimes really feel needy and wonder what he's really up to? I'm obviously talking about the evening when he's home.

Because he just got into the professional life and I haven't yet, I sometimes fear he would think that I can't understand how busy he can get. Not only this but the main difference between us is that his social circle is quite big compared to mine; I only have a few really close friends (4?) whom I would hang out with, while he's out there making plans with his different groups of friends, whether they're from high school, college or work. Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming him for socializing, if anything I'm just afraid he would think I'm boring for not going out in my free time. And because my first semester is very light in terms of classes, I'm really not doing much. I recently picked up badminton again as an activity and met nice people, but not to the point of being overly friendly with them yet and he's still on my mind most of the time.

I came to realize my insecurities come from my previous relationship which ended earlier this year, by someone who didn't love me and strung me along because he was uncertain. I definitely learnt from it and still am in the process of not repeating the same mistakes on my part (by this I mean that I'm still trying to understand my happiness should not depend on someone other than me and I'm making efforts to not come across as too needy/clingy), but because we can only meet once-twice a week, I wonder if he ever thinks of these differences as much as I do. I hate myself for always doubting my place in the relationship, although he's super sweet and caring in person and even introduced me to his family as his girlfriend.

Am I overthinking this? How can I gain confidence and understand that my boyfriend likes me for who I am?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qdgivg/i_sometimes_feel_like_theres_a_gap_between_my/

I met a guy from Tinder last week, we met pretty soon after he contacted me for the first time. 

I actually am no big fan of texting and so to say being each others penpals before meeting for a first date, so that's the perfect way of Online Dating in my opinion. 

The ""downside"" obviously is that you will only really get to know each other in person, so the probability of rejecting / getting rejected and not meeting for a second date is comparatively high. 

From the very beginning it got pretty clear that he was stressed out from working all day and week and that he had caught a cold. He said that he thought it had gotten better before coming for our date but now he is realizing it didn't. 

We had a nice conversation, a nice flow, good vibes. No red flags. After not much longer than one hour he came forward that he was really sorry, but he felt so bad, he would like to take the next train home when we reach the station. Obviously, no problem for me. I had friends in the city with whom I would spend the rest of the night. 

BUT: To this moment we had no meaningful conversation, no deeper connection, no flirting, no spark. For me pacing in dating is a big thing, and to this moment there had not been the right time to bring things to another level. 

When we reached the station and said goodbye (and Get well soon!) I therefore was totally unsure of his ""feelings"" towards me and meeting for a second time, so I just asked him ""Should we meet again? Or not?"", he answered that he would have to think about that. Well, i guessed that was a no. 

I quickly but politely said ""Okay!"" and ""Bye"". Actually I just turned around and got on with my saturday night. Feeling, well, rejected. 

Tbh I would like to meet him again, I thought he was attractive and interesting. For me, only the time was too short and our encounter too shallow to make any sweeping decisions yet. I would like to get to know him better. If I would have been sick, I also wouldn't had been in the mood and mindset for flirting and really getting to know a stranger. But is it too impertinent to guess that his decision was altered by his state of mind - and not only his lack of interest in me?

Now I am wondering: Should I make the move and text him that i would like to meet him a second time? Or is his kinda-rejection something I should just accept?

We got paired up for a group discussion in class. She could barely look at me and couldn't talk when I asked her a question, just stared at her down at her lap. It was her, a friend of hers, and I. But she wouldn't participate. I thought it was odd but whatever she's just shy. Later we switch groups and we are split up. I look over and she is giving full comprehensive and articulate answers to another group. It was with another girl who isn't even really her friend and another guy. She was occupying the other side of the table I was seated at and I finished with my group and went to sit down and she immediately motioned away. 

I've kind of guessed she's liked me for a while. Years ago I said Hi and she looked straight down did the biggest smile I've ever seen and bit her lip. But that's was nearly 4 years ago. So who cares?

Two years ago I merely address the phone she had in a conversation with 3 other people and she just lite up and fully smiled.

Last year we were all socially distanced one to a table and I was sitting across from her very close friend. The friend called her to sit in the table infront of me so they could be closer together. This girl paused for a moment and decided to sit at the very front of the class.

That same year I actually texted her about a TV show I had watched per her recommendation to the class. She was fairly pleasant but took hours, nearly a day to reply and when she did the responses were wooden and stiff. I considered that she wouldn't want to come of as too eager or something but I figured case closed decided shes just odd. But now I really don't know.

That's pretty much been it. Few other small interactions here and there but I figured she surely couldn't have liked me for this long and not even try to talk to me?

24,qdhwuu,1634912279,[LONG POST] Anxious before second date. Want to vent. Advise welcome," 

TL;DR: mixed signals from the girl that asked me out, REALLY into her and terrified to lose her.

The date:  
I  \[M28\] (was single my whole life, very limited dating experience) was  planning to ask this girl \[F26\] I liked from my extended circle of  friends out, but, to my total surprise, she actually beat me to it and  invited me for coffee. So two days later I picked her up and we went to a  coffee shop. Talked for hours, we both laughed a lot, but also covered  some more serious topics. Our views seemed to match on almost every  topic. We sat at the coffee shop until it closed and then went for a  walk outside where we spent a couple more hours walking and conversing.  Afterwards I drove her home.

During  the date I though it was going really well, we both were in stitches  laughing and not a single awkward silence in sight. However, her body  language was throwing me way off. She barely even looked at me the whole  time. When she would look at me she would always smile and turn her eye  away immediately. She also kept crossing her arms when I would put mine  closer in an attempt to go for a touch so I would always just back off.  Idk maybe she felt trapped because she chose the spot next to a wall  and I was blocking the only exit or maybe she's just very shy? Anyway,  although I really wanted to, never ended up touching her in any  meaningful way (other than brushing her arm and shoulder a few times)  and when I dropped her off I couldn't even try for a hug 'cause I  couldn't get out of my car and walk her to the door due to traffic and  hugging in the car seemed just too awkward to pull off.

After the date:  
So  at this point I'm super happy and super confused at the same time,  regretting not being braver on the hug front, although unsure if I  should've been. End up driving around the city for a while just thinking  (yes, I'm an overthinker if you haven't gathered yet).

Next  day I wake up, immediately start thinking about her. Can't even bear to  wait a couple of hours so I text her right away saying that I had fun  and inviting her on a second date which should take place after I come  back from a business trip next week. She then replies (after the longest  hour of my life) that she had a great time too and would be glad to  meet again.

I was relieved for a  couple of hours, we texted some, joked around it seemed like an  extension of the date... We've been exchanging texts here and there, but  I always initiate (she will keep the conversation going, though, no one  word answers or such). Now I started getting very anxious because I  realized I really REALLY like this girl. I mean, I've had crushes and  I've had girls showing interest in me too, but I've never felt THIS and  now I'm absolutely terrified I'm going to mess this one up like many a  time before.

Current situation:  
So  basically it has been three days after the date, I'm totally losing my  mind here, can't focus on anything else and have no idea how I'm going  to manage the business trip at this point. I didn't expect to feel so  strongly about a person after basically one meeting (although I've known  her for a while through friends, but we wouldn't meet often) Should I  tell her I feel this way? She seems to like me, but definitely seems to  not be on the same level as me and I don't want to scare her away.

He thinks I am really cheap and want him to pay for everything which is not the case. There was one time I told him out of frustration that I just want him to pay for dinner without the passive aggressive jokes that make me feel guilty for enjoying a meal. I‚Äôd rather just split everything down the middle if it‚Äôs going to be like that. Like I just want him to WANT to pay and treat me to dinner and I guess he takes that as I want him to pay for everything. He makes almost the same as I do so he is not struggling financially although recently told me he has zero savings despite making almost 90K which is really concerning when I even made a budget for him (his total amount of bills per month is $400 less than mine FYI). So he can obviously spend plenty of money without batting an eye but when it comes to me it seems to be such an inconvenience.

So I‚Äôve been single for awhile now and decided to jump back into dating to feel things out and see where I‚Äôm at.

To my excitement, I got some really great matches whom I was thrilled about, met in person, and had a phenomenal time with. I‚Äôm talking about those spend-3-hours-together, lightly physical, lots of eye contact types of dares. The ones where you can tell you‚Äôre both very interested and impressed with one another.

However, in both these cases - I can‚Äôt seem to get much of a follow-up. Usually we both text agreeing we had a phenomenal time, and mention something about hanging out again soon. Normally I figure meeting the next week makes sense - so I offer something - but is that too soon? Am I rushing it? So far I‚Äôve just proposed something like ‚Äúhey I‚Äôd love to see you at X time for Y if you‚Äôre down!‚Äù And otherwise left it pretty chill / casual. Do I just need to be patient? (Most of these dates happened within the past couple of weeks)

Any advice / perspective would be useful - I think I‚Äôm either making judgments too soon and too quickly or just unable to empathize with the fact that you can fully connect with and like someone but not want to make time to get to know them further soon - it‚Äôs a strange concept to me as someone who gets very excited about new people.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qdjjsi/struggling_with_second_dates_gay_male/

I hate FWBs cause I cant just fuck and leave, its not who I am. Even more so she has told me she still wants to talk to her other guys yet she really cares about me and wasn't expecting to develop the feelings she did for me (that part is mutual), but I began to get really jealous and upset one night when she told me about how she was hooking up with an older guy. I got insecure and got annoyed and she got upset cause she thought I thought less of her.

I told her I don't but she seems a bit off since that day. So this made me think I should cut her off and if she wants to talk to me she will come back and we can restructure what we have going on, ill let her know my stance and if it doesn't work for her we just don't speak anymore. Does that sound fair?

The poor girl is still probably dealing with the recovery of her last relationship the last thing she needs is to be constricted to a single guy, and since I cant look past that I should just remove myself from the situation.

I did a couple months ago and it has changed my dating life in a way. We are both older (in 40‚Äôs) he‚Äôs the lead singer of an apparently famous band and good looking. I remember seeing him play at bonaroo when I was much younger, over 10 years ago and if anyone would have said this guy would have his face between your legs in about 10 years I would have never believed it. 

Anyways, I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble dating in the past 10 years (my child is 10 years old if that says anything). Mostly bc there is no time but also bc I‚Äôve come to terms that being alone is not so bad. Ive given up on appearances and decided I may not ever find the right guy, and ok with this.

The famous rockstar of course is NOT the right guy for me but just the mere fact that I had a wonderful time with this dreamboat seriously prompted me to get into gear.

61,qdlyme,1634923995,Am I (23m) overreacting on girlfriend (21f) prioritizing her coach over me?,"Hi guys,

So, this is the situation:  
Have been together with this girls since 6 months or so, having some good time together and we really seem to hit it off.

Here's the catch: my girl is a (semi)pro soccer player. As I am in and from Europe, this means that soccer players like her actually get paid and are taking their sports pretty seriously.

She recently quit her old pro club to play for a lower league club, meaning she probably has more time on her hands. This also meant that lots of lower league clubs really really really wanted to have her in their team.

She choose this nice club pretty closeby where we live, like a month ago. In the process of choosing the club, she already had pretty extensive contact with the new coach of that team about her position there etc. Nothing weird or whatever.

Now, since the month she choose the club, that coach (I guess 50m) is texting her every single day, like a lot. Texting about how she is and a lot about the sports. He calls her phone a sh\*tload of time during the week as well. Next to his (clear) passion for sport, they also talk a lot about her mental and physical wellbeing and how he wants to help her become her best self in all these ways.

So what happens recently is that she does not take my calls, cause she is expecting a call of the coach. Or she is not texting back for a long while, cause she first wants to text the coach and maybe call him. It seems like she is prioritizing him over me, and it happens more often than before.

As a sidenote: I do not give a shite about soccer, which is something that does not help really, cause soccer is like her life.

I am feeling like I should stop her from prioritizing him over me really. I am not planning to just be her ""whenever I have time and my coach is not able to call"" boy. But maybe that pushes her away as well.

What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: my pro soccer player girlfriend prioritizes her coach over me. I am not planning to be her entertainment when she has time for me. Should I say something or will that drive her away?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qdlyme/am_i_23m_overreacting_on_girlfriend_21f/

65,qdm7e9,1634924709,Dilemma of getting to know two guys who are opposites of each other,"I feel like I‚Äôm (29F) stuck in a dilemma. Recently I have gotten to know two different guys. They are extremely opposite of each other. And I feel unsure of how to proceed forward‚Ä¶

Guy 1: let‚Äôs called him B. Well B and I met at a wedding last weekend. It was his brothers wedding and I was the hired photographer. As I was finishing up for the groom and B drunkenly tip me to stay a little longer at the reception. After a little bit B asked me to dance (two stepping, since it was a country wedding). He‚Äôs much shorter and stockier than I go for. I could tell he was fairly drunk, he kept asking me to dance and I thought ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù. He kept asking Jen to stay longer and I stayed long enough and said I had to go. He walked me to my car at the end of the night and gave me his phone number. We went on a date a few days later, he took me out to dinner and a movie. The date was okay, he was sweet and paid for it all even when I offered to pay for the popcorn. But to be honest the date was semi boring. During the dinner all we talked about was travel and food. Then at the 3 hour new James Bond movie he barely helped my hand. I‚Äôm not sure if he was nervous but he was much more quiet obviously being drunk at the wedding. He texted me some sweet things after the date (a bit too much) and has texted and been sweet kind stuff since. He seems wholesome and kind but some stuff there‚Äôs some issues like he snores (I‚Äôm the worlds lightest sleep and cannot sleep with someone who snores). He is overweight and seems lazy (he hates hiking/exercise). B is 32 and works at a restaurant while getting his computer coding associates degree. But he is local to my city which is small and it‚Äôs very hard to date. I just don‚Äôt know if I feel it. I‚Äôll see him again but I honestly felt kinda bored. 

Guy 2: Let‚Äôs call him D. Well we met back in July, I did a photoshoot for him with his motorcycle and his fianc√© came along. We barely chatted since then, just here and there. My ex came back in Sept and there was a whole situation with that (He ended up ghosting/abandoning me). Soon after D posted on his FB early Oct that his fianc√© ended things. I reached out being friendly to say I was in a similar situation. We connected on our breakups and have been talking nonstop since. He‚Äôs not the typical guy I go for as far as ‚Äústatus‚Äù as he‚Äôs poor and never went to school, he works hard but his job is not the greatest. Not saying I‚Äôm above him but I have my own business and have two bachelors degrees. He‚Äôs also 4 years younger than me. He smokes cigarettes but is slowly quitting (I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt date another smoker). We are ~2 hours long distance, but he‚Äôs not tied down to the big city. We connect really well it‚Äôs like I feel we‚Äôve known each other for years. He opened up to me on FaceTime about his really tough childhood and past being adopted, being homeless for a year in high school, abused by his adoptive parents but finding his real family and things turning around. We laugh and get each other, the chemistry, sexual tension and vibes are definitely there. We talk through out the day and usually FaceTime at night for hours. For some reason I tend to date/ connect with ‚Äúlower class guys‚Äù. And again I don‚Äôt mean to sound like I‚Äôm above them. I see the conversion and personality of people, I see the potential of how things could be with someone rather than date based on all the qualities they already have. 

Both of these guys are so freaking opposite I feel stumped. My friend says B would be loyal and has money but I don‚Äôt feel the connection that I do with D, our personalities line up. Ugh.

For the first time in years I've been seeing someone. Been on about 10 dates. Because I'm pathetic and scared of rejection i haven't tried to escalate our relationship as much as I'd have liked. Until a month ago we were texting every day and meeting every week. 

Thing is she then became very busy at work. It makes sense because she's very career driven but to be fair she has still been showing interest in texting me. But since then it's taken her a lot longer to respond. As i say she does still show active interest in meeting. She just can't commit because she's so busy.

So I want to get a straight yes or no answer, but i don't  want to come across as too dithery. Equally I haven't worded it strongly either because I don't want to scare her away. The text is below - I need advice on wording, please.

At the bottom was a pic of him and his ex‚Ä¶ (this doesn‚Äôt bother me at all that he still had this pic, as I have loads of pictures from my past) I replied to it making a light joke about him forgetting to crop it ;) before sending (more or less so I didn‚Äôt see the other photos including that one) and he said no he didn‚Äôt at all, it‚Äôs from his memories and that i was funny but slightly worrying‚Ä¶ he then sent me the big version of the photo of him and his ex. 

I responded and said I knew it was an old picture and I was being sarcastic but he didn‚Äôt respond or spoken to me in over a day. This has really thrown me‚Ä¶. Again, it‚Äôs not the picture it‚Äôs self but more or less have a little consideration or maybe that just how I am. he didn‚Äôt reply and didn‚Äôt speak to me the whole next day‚Ä¶ thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qdovhp/guy_im_dating_sent_me_a_picture_of_him_and_his_ex/

91,qdp6e1,1634933417,"I went on holiday last weekend; on my first night there there was a massive rainstorm, so I hooked up with a male American tourist in my hotel room. But afterwards his messages got a bit full on.","We literally spent one evening together before he had to leave to catch his flight. The physical side was pretty great tbh. We did the pillow talk (that I kind of excel at lmao), where you talk about each other's lives, and it feels deep. 

We spent literally less than 12 hours together, and now he's talking about him being very keen to see me again. Now is this a man who feels something intense because he was in holiday mode and my British accent means I'm different to what he's used to, or could this be a sign of some unstable dude. Adding some messages that he sent to me over the last five days. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And I know it was just sex. But I did develop some more for you... there is something about you I desire

And 

&gt;This is probably really foolish but I have been thinking about you most of the day. Both because I want to talk to you more and cuddle. And also because I really want to f\*\*\* you again \[EXPLICIT CONTENT\] You are truly so gorgoeus. **But am I the only one who feels something** 

Also 

&gt;I am not saying we should get married or even date. I am just saying that I felt something with you. And I enjoyed the sex. I was wondering if you had felt the same.  

Also he's asking me to visit him in his part of the US, he's even floated that he can come to the part of the States I might visit, suggesting he could stay in my hotel room. Like what?? Anyhoo, what is this? 

TL;DR why is my holiday hook up coming on super strong?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qdp6e1/i_went_on_holiday_last_weekend_on_my_first_night/
92,qdpb68,1634933821,Bad date. What should I do now?,"I (25m) went on a date with a girl (27f). I thought it went well but there were a lot of awkward moments where I felt like an idiot. She was laughing a lot, holding hands briefly and connecting on a few common interests. We were kind of forced to talk to each other for 4 hours straight due to our date choice  so it was tough keeping conversation, I ended up asking a lot of questions because I did not want their to be awkward silence. She did not mention any second date but I proposed one and she said yes. Not sure if I should text her or just let her go or what. I really did like her and if it went bad for her I would like to salvage it and do better. Tips?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qdpb68/bad_date_what_should_i_do_now/
93,qdpdtt,1634934044,Dating Widower man with toddler,"I (37F) dating a widower (36M) who is a dad for 2.5girl. I have 12 years old boy and divorced. His wife died a year ago. I asked him if he is ready to see someone again and he said he is not going to stay alone. I already mentioned to him I'm looking for a relationship and don't want to play arround.

I chat with him sometime everyday, and sometime he texts back saying he is tired from work and everything.

I never dated widower before and I don't know how to deal with him.
We see each other every 2 weeks and I feel that's a long time that we won't get close or know each other easily.

I dont wanna presure on him because I feel he is still sad. His wife died in break cancer after 1.5 year battle. They were together for 10 years.
Sometimes he mentions her and when we go to eat something, he would say I used to come to this place with her.

Any advice how to deal with this man? How often we should talk, how I can speed up things to know eachother better?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qdpdtt/dating_widower_man_with_toddler/

96,qdplri,1634934712,What are your rules/limits of interaction between your bf and female friends?,"Hey all, 

if you're seeing a guy but you're not in an official relationship, what are the appropriate rules of interaction between that guy and your female friends? Your female friend knows what's going on between you two, the feelings, the bedsheets, and everything. Do you have any rules for yourself? Things to watch out for? What are the limits for you?

Context: I generally have a lot of trust issues against both men and women. And I am trying to find out  how people in general approach this subtle issue to determine where on the paranoia spectrum I stand. 

\- Is it okay for them to hang out with your knowledge, but without you in private? 

\- Is it okay for your female friend text them with a question from a conversation they had before?
