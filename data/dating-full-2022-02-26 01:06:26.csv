I hope everyone is doing well. This year, at school, I was lucky enough to make a new friend (gay M19) who has been such a breath of fresh air for me. We are both into films, so every week we take turns showing each other a film of our choice (and usually a genre of our choice, like he really enjoys horror and I'm trying to get more into it as a film student). Anyway, that's really beside the point. I'd say we are fairly close; we talk pretty much every day, whether brief of not, and we usually hang every week or so. I don't feel like we have to talk every day, though, which is news for me.

My dilemma is I often find myself falling for anyone who gives me extended attention. He is super nice, and I certainly don't want to date him, but I can't help but feel like I need to bring it there eventually. He has mentioned before he hates when friends only seem to be into their friendship to get into his pants, which I totally understand and relate to. I'm kind of in a catch-22; I don't like him enough to ruin a relationship, but it's not like I feel nothing.

i feel like it'd be way too weird to message someone from reddit of all places, they never asked for someone to randomly dm them and the last thing i'd wanna do is unintentionally make them uncomfortable. but idk, these days i rarely feel drawn to a person almost immediately. i recently got out of an emotionally abusive relationship and since then it's felt like feelings towards others don't come as naturally as they used to anymore. so it feels kind of nice to have a crush again, even if it's just a random person i don't know at all.

originally i was just gonna get it off my chest and not do anything, but some people on reddit and some of my friends irl have told me i should message them and see where it goes. so now i'm kinda mulling it over. i don't really have any expectations, but would it be inherently creepy to message someone and ask to be friends? i'm pretty outgoing and i think i'm sociable enough to start a conversation but i'm just worried the act of messaging a person on reddit at all would be super weird right off the bat.

While this isn’t truly what I’m looking for, I also love making true connections and, of course, enjoy having more lovers nearby.

I did, however, find myself wasting a disproportionate amount of time on partnered guys who were only “testing the waters” which is extra frustrating given they weren’t even what I was really looking for.

So, what to do. After reading about and  becoming extremely intrigued by financial kinks such as fin-dom, I decided to try something called Phin-dom, basically I tell the guy what nonprofit he has to donate to. I ask a few of his interests and look at his pictures and pick something out. So far I’ve raised over $250 for various causes. And I only started a couple of weeks ago! 

So but here’s the thing. It kind of, really really is turning me on. I thought it was sort of a joke thing but I find myself getting…excited.

We were supposed to meet for our first date at 6 last Saturday, but he postponed it last minute by a couple of hours because he had tickets to a show he had forgotten about. (This was true, he showed me pics.) We ended up meeting that night and had a great 2 hour date where he kissed me after and texted me as soon as he got home. Telling me “he didn’t want to be too forward but he’d love to see me again”. 

He has texted me a bunch everyday since, checking in on me after work, sending me funny videos and telling me goodnight every night. He asked me out again right away with a specific time and place and we were supposed to meet up again yesterday. 

He then texted me a several hours before we were supposed to meet saying he had to fly back home (instead of this weekend- it’s his brother’s birthday) to avoid the winter weather/storm in the Midwest. He said in his text he’s very serious about meeting with me again and he felt terrible. He told me he’d love to make it up to me with flowers and dinner. I know he’s telling the truth about being home with his family because he’s been posting pictures.

I told him no worries and asked him when he’d be back so we can reschedule. He texted me back hours later last night, really late and said that he would love to FaceTime and call in the meantime because he felt a connection with me and definitely wants to maintain it, but that he won’t be back until next weekend unfortunately.. I replied to him saying that would be great if we could FaceTime in between. He replied back and said he was “relieved I was on the same page” then asked how my day was this morning and I replied a bit after that asking him about his family, now it’s 8 PM and still no response. Is this a red flag? I know he’s with his family and he probably still had to work today, but still, no reply for eight hours? Especially after saying he wants to stay in contact in the meantime… :(

Should I text him a second time, or wait? Or maybe see later this weekend if he wants to FaceTime? I’m just confused because he seemed really concerned about wanting to stay in contact and now I haven’t heard from him all day. He told me on our first date that he prefers calling over texting but didn’t say specifically that he doesn’t like texting or that he isn’t a big Texter. It’s definitely unlike him to take this long to reply and it kind of makes me feel like I should say something but maybe I should just leave it? Is this a sign that he’s not interested in me, or could he really just be busy? I never know when I’m overthinking or when I should really be concerned.

When I (19F) got in the elevator of my building, there were already had two people in there, a boy (20M) and a girl but they weren't talking to each other, so it was awkwardly quiet. The elevator is also really small so I had to stand quite close to the boy, probably closer than I would ever stand next to a stranger normally.

Anyway, the moment I got in the elevator, the boy was looking at me. I could feel his eyes on me to the point where I had to pretend, I didn't notice him staring at all. I was also wearing heels which does make me quite tall so maybe he was just looking at me because of that? With the heels we're around the same height.

Anyway, so this girl got off at her floor and then this boy turned to look at me fully facing me and then after looking at me for a second or two he asked me what my name was and then introduced himself and shook my hand. He then said, ""Your hands are freezing cold. Are you okay?"" really concerned. I'd just been outside which is why they were cold.

He also asked me what floor I live on and what I was going to do right now (the laundry). When he was getting off at his floor, he also stood outside the elevator and talked to me and said that he'd like to run into me again soon until the door shut.

I don't think he was hitting on me really, but he kept looking at me the whole time even before we were talking. I'm not really sure what that was about but he was really nice and his interest in the things I was saying seemed really sincere? I mean it was an elevator ride, so we didn't talk about anything deep, but he was firing questions at me the whole time. So, was he just making conversation, or did he actually want to know me?

So 2 years ago I left a really toxic relationship. She was abusive in a few ways, the worst definitely being mentally. She constantly made remarks about my appearance and my physique, which sucked because I train 5-6 days a week and considered myself to have a really good physique. I pride myself on having great hygiene but she’d make little remarks about my hair or my clothes. It made me feel like shit. Trying my hardest to be good for her in whatever way and it wasnt enough. Fast forward to a few months after I caught my head and left her, I meet my soulmate. She’s everything that my ex wasnt. Supportive, comforting, kind. We’ve been dating for almost two years and recently she decided to join my gym and workout with me. I noticed she has wondering eyes, which tbf there are some hot guys at our gym. And I cant get upset at her for looking, because I do the same. But since then I’ve caught her checking guys out more and more. The other day we were walking past the men's underwear section while shopping and I noticed her literally turning her head to look at the models on the packages. Im not mad at her for it. But it does hurt my confidence and I feel like even though she’s 1,000 times better than my ex, it’s putting me in the same head space of not being good enough. I know it’s only human nature to look, so I’d never ask her to stop doing that. But how do I work on myself? How do I stop myself from getting in my head when I notice her checking guys out? I realize that the problem lies in myself and not in her actions, but I dont know what to do to change it. It’s not causing me to have animosity towards her at all…but I also don’t even know what to say to explain how I’m feeling to her. I know she’ll feel bad like it's her fault or something but it's not her fault.

It seems I couldn't buy a girls interest, much less a date at the moment. I know I can do it but I obviously need some help if you'd be so kind. To give you a bit of context on my current situation, I haven't really dated in about a decade. Some of that was my choice. I dated the same girl throughout highschool and when it ended it hurt, as it does everyone, and I just kinda wanted to do my own thing for a bit. Because of this though, I've really screwed myself out of experience. Recently I've wanted to get back into the dating world but my approach has landed me on one hell of a losing streak. Its confusing me because I can't pinpoint whats wrong with it. I try to be respectful, conversational, and as interesting as I can be while remaining truthful. It just seems nobody is interested, or anyone worth pursuing in this small town is taken at this point. One thing I thought would work to my advantage is my wide range of interests. Sometimes conflicting, but I thought it might help me connect more easily. It could be totally unrelated but I actually feel it may be a disadvantage. Maybe I seem weird that I can't exactly be put in a specific box? For a long time I was terrified to even send a random girl a message to guage her interest, but I've since overcome that. If I am lucky enough to get a snapchat though, the responses quickly become sporadic. One girl was in the process of moving to another state so that went nowhere. I don't think looks matter as much as everyone thinks, but for whatever its worth, I'm decent looking. I have a job, a truck, etc. And I think most importantly, my intentions are good. I've never slept around. I'm honestly just looking for someone to get to know because I'm getting older and its pretty lonely at times being single this long. I'm hoping someone has some advice that will make it click for me. I tried again today and it looks iffy at the moment. If this one is a strike out then I'm pretty sure I've explored every option.

It's sort of unrealistic with how social media made dating extremely toxic. It's possible finding something on there, but there's a slim chance you'd get a perfect match:

You have to be interested in the other person, they have to be interested in you. You have to meet each others checkboxes, you're competing against numerous people, and in this era of dating, if you put the other person off or come across an issue, instead of working together and fixing it, it's just ""swipe next"".

Meeting irl is extremely difficult as well. That ""perfect"" situation where you just so happen to be in a coffee shop and you see that perfect person and some magical moment that brings you together just never happens. You have to find that person at the right place/right time, they have to be single, they have to be interested, you have to make a move/wait for that opportunity all while not being creepy, etc.

I've came to the realization that meeting thru mutuals is the best route to go and it makes perfect sense. That mutual person can vouch for you and the other person are more likely to give you a chance because of their trust in that mutual person (being that they have good judgement and they'd be willing to give you a chance).

Recently I finally went that route and it looks like it's going nowhere again. I messaged a friend about the person on her Instagram story and long story short I was interested and a day later that girl requested me and I was super surprised and excited. I finally thought by switching up to this route, this would finally be a genuine connection.

We started talking but I understand she's probably busy, but I've sort of came as a ""one a day"" vitamin. She'd take 8+ hours to respond. I understand that people have lives and people aren't always on their phones and stuff and I'm certainly not a priority yet, but how do you manage to keep things flowing and establish a great relationship if there isn't some sort of communication in between? We're in an age where texting periodically is typically the norm, and that random phone calls although traditional and more meaningful, aren't generally accepted unless you're at a certain point. 

Anyways, I finally asked her out and she agreed and I asked for her number and we started texting. The responses would be like every 12 hours but they were meaningful and fun but it was sort of hard to keep that fire going. I reiterated about plans to meet up for dinner and now here I am waiting over a day for a response back. 

When we messaged on instagram it would say her online status as ""x amount of hours online ago"" and they matched up with her responses so it wasn't like she was ignoring me on purpose on instagram at least. But when I asked for her number she agreed and said it would be easier than talking on instagram because she probably isn't as active on there. By texting her number I thought this would finally give us better communication but I guess I was wrong and here I am back to square one.

Work became miserable and I didn’t take good care of myself. Never talked about it much with anyone, just dealt with it internally. 

A few months pass and I’m mostly over it and doing a bit better, met a new girl on Discord (don’t judge me). She’s cool and we had a lot in common, we became close and considered ourselves together for about 4 months but it was long distance again and she left me last month due to it. I wasn’t as hurt this time around but it still sucked, didn’t plan on getting in another relationship let alone long distance but I did anyway.

The only two relationships I’ve ever had were long distance and they both left me… Not great on the self esteem. I recently quit my job cuz I hated it and have been keeping myself busy redecorating my room, buying new things for myself, trying new hairstyles, outfits, etc. I basically just took a step back started working on myself and improving my state of mind. Still working and still improving but I’m doing better I think. But there’s one lingering issue… I feel so alone. 

This isn’t the worst this feeling has ever been, I was in a VERY bad spot a couple years ago but that’s behind me. Today, the problem feels more like I just need companionship, someone to spend time with and talk to and laugh with and have fun with and… yeah. I just wanna find someone and form a connection with them but at the same time, I’m not sure that would exactly solve my problem. I don’t think this is the right reason to get into a relationship, you shouldn’t SEEK it out right? I don’t NEED to be in a relationship but everything in my body wants me to. I don’t even care about being rejected or embarrassing myself in front of girls, I’m not even afraid of getting hurt again, as long as at some point someone says yes to a date. 

Sorry that I wrote so much, just thought some context would help. I hope this doesn’t make me come off as desperate like that, I don’t understand why I feel this way. Any advice anyone can provide would be much appreciated.

31m  met 29f summer 2021. We went out a couple times up until fall 2021. She  had some issues extending from her past relationships that made me  uncomfortable. She was very recently out of a relationship and kept  talking about her EXs. Long story short, I told her lets take a break  until the thing with the EXs calms down, and maybe try later. She asked  for another chance, saying she's not used to ""emotionally available men""  and her EX BFs were ""abusive, alcoholics, and depressed"". We went out  one more time, then she ended things with me. We both turned 32 and 30  respectively within the past few weeks.

She  kept in touch over time, and eventually asked me for another chance  early February (3 weeks ago). I was apprehensive at first, said we could  try talking more often and see what happened. Well, we ended up talking  daily and she came over to my apartment tonight.

While  she was here, she told me she got back with her EX late November. She  was on a date a week or so ago, didn't go well, and was in the bathroom  texting me. Also said her period was late, but has taken multiple  pregnancy tests and is not pregnant (telling me she's having sex with  other guys). We never had sex or even made out. She sat on the opposite  side of the couch all night. But she stayed for 3 hours, we talked the  entire time with literally zero pauses in conversation.

She  goes home, then texts me that I'm ""a nice guy but the  connection/attraction isn't there"". I'm like what the fuck? You knew who  I was before tonight, why did you even bother leading me on for the  past 3 fucking weeks if you felt this way? Next time you feel lonely  about turning 30 leave me the fuck out of it!

Now  I feel like complete and crap. Here are photos of both of us, because  fuck it at this point. I feel like crap and want to hear from people  what happened. Will probably delete later.

We went to a pizza place and a frozen yogurt place later that week. It was some of the most fun I’ve ever had with a girl. She’s fun, she’s dependable, she’s everything I’ve ever wanted tbh. Talking to her made me feel like it was a dream land because I could just chill and not worry about anything. She seemed like she wanted to talk as much as I do.

June 2021: we met, I approached him at a bar and we started having sex and hanging out 

August 2021-October 2021: he disappeared, then returned saying that he was scared to mess things up, he’s a mess, he’s a loser, etc. I decided to meet up with him after a hike and he was hammered. Most of the time I’ve seen him—drunk at a bar. 

November 2021-December 2021: we’re back at it. He’s drunk and I’m trying to remain patient, encourage him, etc. I showed up, put out, listened to him, never insulted him. He’d tell me how he could see himself coming home to me, red flag: he’d bring up kids because I’d told him I wanted to date with intention; he told me about someone else who he dated and how she didn’t want kids (unsure of what the point was).

I texted him what I got him for Christmas and he never replied. It was a sweet gift bc I’d paid attention to the things he likes.

Our sex was insane and I found it to be passionate. He’d once told me that we were dating, and I said we weren’t  because bars and drunk sex isn’t dating. 

Anyway, the last time we saw each other, I let him pee on me (he’d asked me to do it to him but I was tipsy and didn’t feel comfy as I hadn’t had water). We also did other things that night that I’d never done. The next morning he cooked breakfast and asked me to stick around all day—he invited me to go with him to a nearby city he’d been working from recently and I was like nah. 

I met his dad twice (he lives at home), he peed on me, and ghosted me. I haven’t heard from him since the peeing night. 

My dad recently passed last month and I’m back in this city feeling completely heartbroken. I’m not open to dating rn but I just have the very real urge to tell him how badly all of this hurts.

So I (22F), have been dating this guy (23M), for a few months. The first few months were really easy, we texted a lot, often deep at night even, a lot of kissy faces and all day contact, dates were all nice and good. I was really sure he liked me and all. From our texting, I'd get a lot of security as we would often discuss feelings through text and compliment each other etc. 

Since a month or so, the pace of texting has slowed down a bit. He still does effort to see me and in real life it feels all super good and nice. However, texting is more ''boring'' about day to day life, he is slower at replying, we don't seem to get into these ping pong flow conversations that much, and genuinely makes me more insecure cause \`I miss the ''validation' I would get through our texting. He doesn't send a lot of sweet things over text anymore. 

There was some things that changed though, he changed jobs and is definitely more busy now, and he bought a PS4, I feel like he now often games instead of having our like conversations after work, but Im not sure if this is the true reason.

I miss our passionate convo's, I miss the validation and it makes me a bit anxious. We are exclusively dating, but not in an official relationship.

I would say I'm a modest looking dude, I wouldn't say I'm some sort of workout junkie but I'm fit and do take care of myself in that regard. (5'7"" 150ish lbs) 

I have my career figured out, have a home, and am a pretty outgoing person with plenty of hobbies.

I swipe yes to every single profile I see on each app daily. 


However I haven't had someone match with me in months. I've updated pictures because someone said I should but that did nothing.

It's pretty demoralizing when I'm swiping yes to literally everyone, to the point where there's no one left in the queue to look at.

I wad never an outstanding student but he was. We used to be in the same class and there were few times my result came close to his. 

After a summer break that year, he was selected to opportunity class, that was the time I feel the very large gap between us. We never dated but there was definitely something different between us.

Being in different class made me avoid him always, he was so perfect and confident, he nailed everything flawless (in my eyes), he was someone or the only one I really admired. We never confessed or say we never admitted there were something different. 

Upon 3 years of split, he sent me a very well written letter at the last day of school. It is said how much of affection he had on me, how he regretted never telling me such feelings. It was really touching and strong.

Tbh I had moved on ever since to live within my abilities, I spent my time with classmates who have same output like I did. And I had dated with others. But something deep inside myself knows, I admire him as always and he was like never reachable to me. I wouldn't say it was affection or crush or love anymore but just something different. 

Therefore when I received that long message from him, it totally spinned my world over. I couldn't say anything true to him as I remembered I was dating someone else at that time. I appreciated his very genuine confession to me, his words, were the warmest thing I ever received, even my fam, my that time boyfriend, my close friends, never said anything like that. 

After graduation, I moved abroad to attend university. He stayed behind. There were a few times I courage myself to text him, but it was short. I don't what feelings I had toward him. I don't want him to still have feelings for me because he deserves much much more better. I was and am never gonna be his one.

We did say to meet when I back during break, and I knew he truely mean it. But I was too scared to see him, same reason as I said, he shouldn't develop any feelings for me. So I told myself, if he ever asked me out again I'd say yes. But we never talked since then.

He still is someone I admire and think of every now and then. I think of him every year since then, and I had wanted to text him everytime I think of him. Cowardness stopped me from doing so. And thinking of that gap between us. No.

Five years since then, today. Seeing something on the news makes me think of him. This time I had that very strong desire to tell him, to tell him everything. I wrote everything down in a letter(is it weird people still writes letter nowadays? Lol coz I personally love writing on a solid paper) and I took pictures of the sheets. 

My heart started beating fast. It is five years now and it is everything that I kept in mind, never told anyone, I never told anyone how low self-esteem I have to myself. Would it be appropriate sending this to him? What if he's now in a lovely relationship?

I took my phone and texted to his number, see if he still using the same number as before. Without him replying to me, my heart beated super fast for 3hours and I started to get cold, and shaking. And I found out I was too nervous to a point I literally getting a fever. Lmao

But he replied, and we talked. We talked a lot, he's currently in a complicated relationship and I reckon it is appropriate to send him a genuine message which I kept for five years, in response to his letter 6 years ago. 

And so we talked for like 3 hours in text, I never expected a thing would happen and no there wasn't. It was just a relieve, and lesson learned. -Taking something out that you buried deep for a long time need courage and it burns.

Sorry the story will be a little long but i need to explain some particulars otherwise it doesn't make sense.
I've met this girl at university, I wrote to her about some university things and then we clicked instantly, first day we talked for hours until 2 am and that is about one month ago. For this time I've been talking to her everyday nearly all day and she seems interested: we make plans to do many things, for example going to the sea, doing a pic nic, going to cinema and other things and we've been on a lunch togheter and made 2/3 coffe date where we talked of a lot of things), she also some days come to university only to see me because there isn't any of her friends. I recognise that I'm very into her and from what i see she also seems interested in me but I'm not 100% sure. We also found each other because we have our problems that we share and there's been a lot of positivity between us, for example we always tell to each other I'm here for you or if we want to call each other to talk when we are not feeling good and also she said multiple times that she's happy to have met me. She also calls me cute when i'm being gentle with here and talks to me with silly voice as if she's trying to be cute.The problem is that she's been with a guy for 2 years but it's a distant relationship and she told me that she doesn't have the courage to end with her bf but she also told me that she doesn't feel like she's in a relationship as she doesn't talk with her boyfriend so much. 
I'm at loss i don't know what to do, i really like this girl but i don't want to be the guy stealing girlfriends (supposing she's into me but I don't know).
