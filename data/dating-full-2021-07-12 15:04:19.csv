I like spending time with him, and I'm attracted to him, but my problem is that he's really not smart and is unambitious.

I feel terrible. He's such a kind guy and I know he would make someone happy, just not me. He said he hasn't felt the way he feels right now in years, and sees a future with me, etc. He wanted me to meet his family.

I become more of the person I want to be everyday now that I don’t have anyone draining my energy. 

I work 60+ hours a week with a very erratic schedule that doesn’t allow me to plan anything in advance. Im also in school so that takes up some more of my free time. I have friends but they all live far away and are living their own lives too. There is no way I can even think about dating again right now, because anytime that I do have free from work/school are dedicated to me. And I refuse to do online dating again because I want to meet someone “naturally”, which would obviously take longer, should something like that even happen. 

But some days- like today- are tough. 

I can’t help but long for some sort of romantic companionship (but not from my exes). What can I say? I love love. Everyone says that you need to be happy with yourself and by yourself, and I am.

I liked a girl and she and I was coworkers, working in different departments. Before covid she lead me on and tried to ask me out by making comments like, I'm easy do you like me?
I wasn't sure if I could drag her in my lost life but I felt bad for rejecting her, what I did was just ignore her. But then after the covid break I went back to the same job and wanted to make things right. I couldn't talk to her cause everything I told her, she shared in a big party with her friends. 
I stayed at that job working hard just for her, just so I could see her, I couldn't say anything but one day I decided to text her and tell everything because the mental pressure from that job was unbearable. 

She accused me of harrassing her, then she started posting stuff on her vsco profile about me or smooch pics, she knew I was looking over her profile, she even posted a song picture named ""treat you better"" I thought I hurt her really bad that I started pouring my heart and started posting for her, started being better for her. 
I realized that she stalked me on one of my photography alias account. I started telling my side of story there. I did what I could but she was telling everything to her friends, they would come where I work and eat lunch or dinner, I was the hard working dishwasher taking care of dishes from two floors. I had to ignore her everytime I heard them talking like, ""you are gonna go under him!"" Or ""he is so cute why isn't he talking to you?""
I got so angry after hearing those words, I tried to change myself for her and she told everyone for what? Friend points, they laughed at me in street and even at work.
I have a promising future I am getting a degree in psychology and I am a long term trader at 21. 

She just kept making things worse, so last week I posted that you should block me because I don't wanna see your profile but again I couldn't do her like that, stubborn me!
I really went to work on july 10 and tried to apologize to her about everything, about how and why I ignored her, why I stopped talking (mainly cause she would talk to people who were saying racial comments about me), she stopped me and told me that let's leave it and never talk about that. 
I felt really lost at that moment.

I never told her that I came back to dishwashing for her, I never told her that I changed for her, it's probably my fault for even starting to interact with her because as soon as I told her that ""at least give me a chance to explain myself"" she accused me again for harassing her. 

Last night July 10-11, nearly 1.24am a group of drunken boys and girls came down my apartment window and they were screaming that, ""look that guy lives here"" and ""hey dude come on down"".
One of them tried to knock on my apartment door at 1am.

I was really sad about how the things went down, how I didn't started talking at times and she went to talk about that in a big group. This was happening nearly every weekend, drunk people would come down my apartment window and they knew my name, but last night someone tried to knock on the door. 
I am a different guy, I've been to an army academy and learned shooting rifle when I was 15, I never wanted to scare her with this info thats why I kept her away from my life. I'm in financial trouble and life problems are piling up slowly as I'm growing. 

I still love her but it's a mental toll to keep this all in my mind so I decided to post it somewhere.

So here's a simple yet super confusing tale about the initiation of my second decade and my second love (or mistaken love),

I'm really fucked up right now, can't think straight, I had to leave the job cause everyone at work are on her side, they think I really enjoyed harassing her, they don't know anything about my side of the story.

I was really looking forward to this and knew it would be a really fun day.

During the day, I noticed that anytime I would try talking to my gf, she would ignore me, barely respond, or start going on her phone mid-conversation. It felt like most of what I heard from her that day was that I needed to move up in line and that I didn’t understand social cues to stand in line in a way where the four of us could easily talk. 

When the four of us would be talking as a group, I would have a lot of fun talking with the two friends that we brought. During these group conversations, I would ask my gf a question, but she wouldn’t even acknowledge it, yet if anyone else said something or asked her something she would immediately respond to it.

It honestly hurt quite a bit to see my gf being extremely friendly and goofy with everyone except me. This is unfortunately usually the case. It felt like she was purposely ignoring me or excluding me. Again, I had a great time at the park and with the two friends.

During the day, my gf asked if I was good and I just said that I was because I didn’t feel it was a good time to bring up how I was feeling since we were in a group setting. After the park, we went out to eat and she asked me again in the restaurant to which I gave the same response because I didn’t want to get into it right then.

When I got home, I texted me gf that we needed to talk and that I was upset with her. I explained how I was feeling and that I had a really fun day but did not really have fun with her. It took her awhile to respond but she said sorry and explained her side and I said thank you. She explained that the day wasn’t about us but it was about including our friends. I agreed with this and felt it didn’t really address my point of being ignored. She told me I can’t make such strong accusations like that because she didn’t do it intentionally.

After this, the situation completely flipped and she was telling me how awful I was for always picking her apart and how I’m awful for not saying how I was feeling earlier. She also said she’s uncomfortable around me and feels like she can’t be herself because I don’t laugh at her jokes, which is completely untrue as I always tell her how funny I find her. This phone call ended up lasting for 3 plus hours and a majority of it consisted of me ending up apologizing to her. She kept saying that I need to look at myself more when there’s a problem and to not be so hard on her.

We are currently taking a break after that phone call. She was crying the whole time and said that I can’t dump things on her like this.

I’m not sure what to make of things. Did I overreact by feeling that I was ignored all day and for telling her I felt ridiculed?

This is my first time posting on here. It would be nice to get some advice on this.

So i just got out of a abusive relationship that I was in for a year. I broke up with him 2 months ago. 

Fast forward to now. I went on a family vacation and met a guy on my trip. I was at the bar waiting for a drink and he approached me. Afterwards he made every effort to “run into me”, every time I’d go to the pool, the lounge, the restaurants, he would see me and he’d say hello to me. He went so far as to introducing himself to my family and he introduced me to his. We however didn’t have the time to get to know each other, because I wasn’t going to go out of my way to spend time with him. My focus was on my family. I was flattered that he was obviously interested in me, but I have been hesitant due to my past.

Anyway, I got back to the states a few days ago and he got back yesterday. We happen to live in the same city btw. We started texting a little here and there. 

Today he asked me out on a date. And I wanted to know how I should respond because I’m unsure. I said yes, however he told me to pick my favorite restaurant and that we would go there. 

How do I go about responding? My favorite is expensive but I don’t want to come off as high maintenance, should I choose something more casual? Also, I kind of wish he just chose something himself, because I kind of dislike it when I’m asked to choose.

How should I go about this?

Just checking in to see if this is normal-

There’s this guy I’ve been dating who I was fantasizing about probably for a month beforehand. 1st date was incredible, like wow. I’d never felt like that before. I honestly had thoughts in my head that I may have found “the one”.  Incredible conversations, feeling of chemistry and physical attraction. 2nd date, was very good and I still felt that wow feeling. 3rd date, I was feeling some panic and anxiety feelings on the date and I don’t know what changed but when Im alone and I think about him, I no longer have that moony feeling about him. All things look great so far- we even had sex and it was really great for me. I was wondering if it’s normal to have doubts at this stage since I no longer have a weird fantasy about who he is in my head. I really like him but I’m a little concerned that the cloud 9 feeling faded so fast?

I'm not blaming her, she has a lot of friends and they might have told her what to do.

Firstly, she used to give comments like, love you, or I'm easy do you like me?

So once, A coworker and his friend tried to harass me at work and she took his side. They knew each other from a long time. 
Then she lead me on by posting love songs and tried to get me back. 
I sent her a text explaining that I like her but please tell me why you took the side of the person who harassed me and she accused me of harassing her.

She then posted smooch pics, vlogs with songs, she brought her friends at the workplace and they would laugh at me while I worked. 

I was getting messed up everyday, she didn't knew I was there just for her, so last day I tried asking her. She told me she is leaving the town, for two years and she don't wanna talk about it more. 
I was thinking I was late but soon she told the manager that I harassed her again. So I did what was right, I broke my heart and left the job. 

Surprisingly she told her part of the story in a party and last weekend a group of 10 to 12 people came down my apartment window and they were screaming, ""come on down dude"" and ""hey, he lives right here"". One of them even tried to knock my door.
I am felling really sad and weirdly happy that I left and didn't tried anything more, what could've gone wrong if I went ahead and proposed her, she would be controlling me with everything.

We aren't exclusive at the moment. We've been on 3 dates now and I plan on trying to make plans with her soon for next week. She mentioned she likes hiking so I think I'm gonna ask her if she wants to go hiking with me. 

We've been talking for a while (end of April), so I honestly do not remember our communication patterns and how it started. She will text me in the morning sometimes, wishing me a good day if she knows there's a lot on my mind. She will FaceTime me sometimes as well. She initiates these things. I texted her yesterday and she replied but then didn't reply to my second message. We then talked to Snapchat the rest of the day yesterday. Around 1am I sent her a snap replying to her and she opened it this morning and didn't reply.

I don't remember how this all started and who made the first move when we started dating and talking. We have a 64 day snap streak and we also text a couple times a week or every couple weeks. 

When I snap her or text her she is responsive. Usually she's the one to text first and yesterday was one of my first times actually texting her first. On snap I don't remember the patterns. I can tell she doesn't send me mass snaps very often, but always replies to me and usually replies pretty quick. If we talk late in the night and she falls asleep she either snaps me in the morning or opens it in the morning and doesn't say anything. 

Last week and she me she wants to see me again and wants to keep going on dates. I don't want to commit right now, but I'm starting to realize I like her a little bit. She also told me she isn't looking for anything serious right now but wants to keep seeing me and going on dates. We haven't had sex yet because she told me she isn't ready, which I understand. We have had intimate moments just no sex, and it's definitely hot, the physical chemistry is there. 

She has definitely shown that she cares by texting me wishing me a good day and also FaceTiming me, sometimes when she's drunk and other times to talk.

It feels terrible to be the victim of ghosting but what are the ghoster really doing to you? Be it a good friend or a potential dating prospect.  


If someone ghosts you then it often means that they just cant handle their own shit. It may seem selfish or inconsiderate. Immature for sure. But it rarely have anything to do with you at all. They either dont know you well enough and ghost you or they are going trough some shit which you cant help them with.  


In either case, just back off. Dont try to reach out to them. If they want to stay in touch, they will message you sooner or later. And if someone have ghosted you once, you need to set boundaries next time. Decide if this person is worth your time and make it clear what sort of behavior you will tolerate.   


I have many friends who have ghosted me for various reasons. Some of them came around eventually and told me they were going trough some stuff. With friends that can often be the case. I usually give them a second chance but serial ghosters are not really good friends in the first place. Just let them go. You cant help them if they cant even help themselves.   


And if you are crushing on someone and they ghost you: Let them go. Dont panic. If you let them go, then you have a slight chance that they come around. If they dont, count yourself lucky. You never really wanted to be with them anyways.  


And lastly: How long would be considered ghosting? I would say for a crush that if it takes more than a week on multiple occasions you should stop up and stop chasing them. They are either not into you or not ready to date.   


For friends it varies. I dont mind if some of my friends take 2 weeks to reply. I dont expect to always be on top of their minds. Good friends will answer within a day or two. Some friends may take half a year but I dont care. If they answer I will take it from there.

I spent the 4th at his parents house where he lives since they were out of town. It was also the weekend where I told him I loved him. I left him a little note because I was too afraid to say it in person all weekend. He found the note like 2 days later because it fell under his bed and he told me that he loved me too.

Things are great between us when we’re together. However, we are long distance and he has a big social life and a lot of friend groups. He has a lot of female friends too which I’m not insecure or worried about because they’re all married and/or childhood friends. 

My problem is that he has a lot of these close, ”pre-established relationships”, with a ton of friends (both guys and girls) and I’m afraid I’ll never reach that level of “closeness”. I feel like he kinda tends to forget that I want to be here for him too. I don’t want to bring it up because I don’t want to sound needy and clingy. I’m not. 

This weekend, he went to a friends wedding in Louisiana. He texted me up until he got to the hotel Friday night, and then yesterday I figured he would be busy so I didn’t text him. He did text me to ask how my day was going and we just had a short conversation. I was the last to respond. He’s supposed to be coming back home today so I thought he’d atleast shoot me a text or something from the airport but he hasn’t yet. 

I texted him asking if he made his flight and he told me how he felt sick at the reception the previous night and left to go back to the hotel and how his flight is delayed and he’s been sitting at a restaurant for 2 hours. I told him he is more than welcome to call me if he wants company. He said he was still feeling sick. I just said “alright, take care” and let it be. 

I feel like as a gf or whatever, I wish he’d atleast tell me himself he wasn’t feeling good or something. I’m just having a hard time trying to make myself a priority, and by priority, I don’t mean the #1 at the top, but if we’re gonna be together then he needs to let me in more. 

I don’t want to bring this up with him because I feel like this is something he should realize himself. I don’t want to force anything but I do wish I can drop a subtle hint or something

A couple days after the date we talked to see how we felt and where we were at. 

She said wants to see me again and wants to keep going on dates but isn't looking for anything serious right now. 

She then told me that she wants to keep seeing me, and made it very clear that she wants to keep going on dates with me. Last date we played mini golf, got smoothies (she paid for my smoothie unexpectedly), and then we danced in my living room for an hour and cuddled, watched hot Rod, then had a hot make out sesh. We've made out on every date. She told me she isn't ready for sex yet which I understand. 

We've been talking for a while now so I don't remember our communication patterns when it started. We Snapchat, text, and FaceTime. She usually texts me first and we maybe have a few text conversations or play iMessage games a couple times a week or every other week. It's not constant with the texting. We have a 64 day snap streak. 

I can tell she doesn't send me a lot of 'mass snaps' and usually I'm the one to send the first Snapchat message. She's responsive and usually responds pretty quick and we chat it up and have normal conversations. 

She also FaceTimes me at night sometimes drunk and other times just to talk. 

Yesterday I texted her and it was one of the first times I've texted her first. She replied to be first text but not the second. Later in the day we ended up talking on snap until about 1 am. 

We've been on 3 dates. When we talked after our date about where we were at, she told me she wasn't looking for anything serious right now. She wanted to keep going on dates with me and I told her I agreed and wanted to continue this if she did. She said ""yes I would love that too""

Lately I feel like I'm the first one to send a snap. She texts me in the morning sometimes if she knows I have a lot on my mind wishing me a good day. Last month she also commented heart faces on my Instagram post. 

Last night we were talking until about 1 am. She opened my snap this morning and didn't reply. I've never double texted or shown any signs of neediness. 

She's definitely shown that she cares and the only reason I'm thinking about this now is because I'm starting to like her a little bit. I don't want to jump into a relationship right now because I don't 100% know what I want either. Things seem to be going good with this girl and we both agreed we want to continue dating and likely see where it takes us. I don't want to jump the gun and mess up something good. 

Based off these actions does it seem like she wants me to chase her? She opened my snap I sent around 1am last night about an hour ago. We had been talking for a while yesterday on snap before this happened.

But then when we’re not together, he messages me constantly and sends the weirdest messages. I can understand that it comes from a place of insecurity but it’s so frustrating. I do shift work so sometimes I’m sleeping during the day and it’s so annoying to wake up to 20+ messages. It’s usually just funny videos or memes but some of them are about love and relationships, which is not we’re we are at yet.

I told him the last time he sent one that it was a bit much considering we still don’t know each other very well, he just brushed it off and said that he’s not good at communicating with words and uses memes instead. It feels like he’s trying to push us into a place where he is comfortable but it’s moving way too fast and un-organically for me, it feels pressured and rushed. I’ve tried saying the above to him but he just sort of dismisses it and sends another awkward (and then cringey) meme about relationships. He also randomly sends messages talking about ‘when we become official’ despite never having a conversation about exclusivity.

We have only been out on two dates. The first was to get coffee and we spent almost 5 hours together just talking. He reached out soon after this date and planned a second date for the following weekend. He ended up cancelling this date the morning of and apologized saying that something came up at work and he would have to stay late. However, he later sent me a snapchat of him leaving work at his normal time..... I figured this was his way of dodging me but then he ended up asking to reschedule a few days later.

So we ending up going on a walk. This date was VERY short. There was a chance of rain that day and he had told me if it rained we could just go for a drive instead. However, about 15 minutes into our walk it started to rain and instead of going for a drive he just drove me home! When he dropped me off he apologized for a poorly planned day and told me I could plan the next date. I was honestly in shock.

Since that date he has reached out less than before but when he does he is still flirty. I decided that maybe I was overthinking so I reached out a few days ago to plan a third date. I asked him when he was free and he told me that he worked on the weekend but should be free during the week. The conversation kind of ended there without any set plans. BUT THEN he snapchats me during the weekend (at a time he said he would be working) and hes not at work at all but with friends! I don't understand why he lied about having work? Why wouldn't he have just said he had plans?

Another thing that I've been overthinking is that he hadn't kissed me on either of these dates. This is super confusing to me because he has made sexual remarks to me and has complimented my physical appearance several times - all of which I was very accepting of.

Over the past few days there has been minimal conversation between us. We had a short text conversation in which I was left on read and over snapchat he has only been sending me 'streaks' and leaving anything I send on open. I decided that today I wouldn't respond back unless he sent me more than just a 'streak' snapchat - but he didn't even send me that today....

First, I am fine with rejection as it's part of life, and I think people should be with who fits them best even if it may end something with me! Also, the 1st experience has taught me to not have expectations what so ever, and go with the flow with a positive outlook.

I see others mention they start casual and hope the guy their interested in eventually reciprocates more interest/pursuing things further, so should I be approaching/presenting myself more casually to start?

A few months before, when my neighbor found out I was going to attend those classes, she appeared to be enthusiastic about attending the same exact course.

What's wrong with me? Or better saying, what's wrong with her??? What occurred to her extroversion? Why is she acting so disagreeably?  
When I told my parents she was unreasonably taciturn during the ride, they didn't expect this. ""How come? She's so ""sunny"" with other people"". Then, why was she always eclipsed when I was around?  
At some point, I gave up and our ride was usually filled with an awkward silence. It seemed like we weren't even neighbors.

If she'd flipped me off, I would've been more satisfied, because it would've been a fairly solid standpoint.

Let’s be real, a first date only has a 25% chance of going well. Class is in session boys, cuz I’m gonna teach you what to do.

So about a month ago, I matched with this girl on tinder, and we hit it off pretty well. We were having conversations for hours on end, and we eventually agreed to meet in person. She lived quite far from me, so I had to pay an expensive train ticket to meet her. I’m a massive train nerd, so this alone is a fun thing for me. However, I’m 5’6”, so I knew there was a high chance that I’d get stood up. My height wasn’t talked about, so I didn’t lie about it. So before the date, I bought tickets for a movie in her town and I saw that there was a classic car gallery nearby, so I made that my backup plan. Men, have backup plans for days of dates. Onto the day of the date. Once she sees me it’s clear that she’s lost interest due to my height. However, she stays around and still tries to somewhat converse with me. It’s clear that she’s thinking that she’s gonna get a free meal out of this. So after 15 minutes, I say I have to go to the bathroom and I make it straight to the movie theater. I blocked her and carried on with my backup plan.

So what should you take away from this? First of all, don’t expect the first date to go well. But most importantly, have backup plans and think ahead. That way, you don’t waste a good amount of your time. Additionally, try to have a 30 minute conversation before ever stepping foot in a restaurant. That way, you’ll know if she’s actually interested in you or just sees you as a free meal ticket. If she says things like,”I haven’t eaten all day” or “I’m super hungry”, you’re being used boys.

Backstory: We dated for over a year. He abruptly dumped me out of no where (over TEXT) with no real explanation other than him saying he was emotionally closed off and wasn’t happy. He told me his decision was final and that we both needed to move on. He went out drinking with his friends over the weekend, so i did the same. I ended up drunkenly hooking up with someone because i was just so hurt and didn’t know how to cope. 

After his weekend of drinking, he came crawling back saying he wanted to rekindle. I was honest with him about getting with someone else that weekend and he totally flipped. He told me he couldn’t be with me anymore if i got with someone else that fast. He was mad that i moved on so quickly even though he was the one to dump me immaturely. 

Even though he was mad and said he “resented” me, he was still talking to me all this week, making it hard for me to fully move on. Yesterday he was ignoring me and it was driving me crazy so i just decided to block him. I know i needed to make that decision because we both won’t move on if we keep talking to each other. 

I just hope he knows that i didn’t block him because i hate him, but i blocked him to benefit us both. I’m now just feeling so alone because i lost my best friend too. How do i get over all of this?

I do not live in the US. here in israel. around 2 months ago they gave the green light to open the market. I went back to shooting weddings. I was so focused on that. ive been trying slwoly to get back with my ex (8 years together). it exploded. I must start dating. I have massive panic attacks. I never had an issue to find a date. 6' I bodybuild 40+ and I (think) am a handsome guy. at least my mom told me so. 

anyways. I opened 3 profiles in different sites...I see tons of womans profiles saying they were online 2 months ago. probably when people felt confident infected were really down. I dont mind paying for membership but there are few online. sure sure you only need one. but thats throwing a dart to a bullseye a mile away. 

we have a rise again in infections and im guessing 2 things. 1 -people are less online because of this and 2-many have gone online 2 months back and have found partners (being that all year people were nervous to date before taking vaccines) thats why it seems very diluted...

 im deperate and super lonely. as much as it seems that shooting weddings is lovely and fun and should make me feel not lonely. it actually makes you feel more so if you are single. when youre around people it feels fine, &amp; the whole idea of a wedding is together, love and partnership,  but going home alone kind of marks that in your head. you wake by yourself.

I'm an  average looking lightskin person who uses Tinder to get dates with girls, the good thing is, is that they often end up with kissing and touching, but the bad thing is, is that they never lead to sex or at least building some sort of a deep connection with the girl like a relationship, second date, or even just being friends and hanging out.

I do not know if it is due to my character as a person, I'm quite chill and maybe perhaps I'm way too chill sometimes and need to be more energetic when talking.

During a date a common thing I do(which I am not proud of) is I get a drink with them and just start drinking(I never drink unless it's a date or party), this kinda makes me be more careless and be more creative, because sometimes during a date my head is just blank and really don't know how to make a casual conversation much more fun and interesting, so it makes me tap into my playful silly idgaf side.

We make out, but that's it I don't really know what to do then. I mean they start making excuses that they gotta go, when asked to go to my place.

So how do I move to second base after first base? Maybe I'm not taking them to the most fun places(the places which I go on dates are either: cinema, park, a coffee place or just having a walk in the city, sometimes a mall) so maybe this makes the dates way too chill and not as exciting and I need to take them to idk some concert event type place?

I try to offer as much logical advice in this sub as I can, so I do appreciate the same in return.  

Background:

On/off again ""stoner"" for a long time now. Almost a decade. I go through phases where I smoke a lot, and phases where I quit for a while. Well, as a 28M, that largely has his shit together but wants to take the next step in life mentally and emotionally, I recognize that I am using weed as a crutch for deeper self esteem/confidence/""depression""/addictive personality issues. I'm sure this is the case for the majority of people who smoke on a nearly daily basis. I have smoked in the last couple days, but I haven't purchased marijuana for myself since I ran out over a week now (honestly, can't remember).  

Anyways, I met this really cool chick and we've been getting along really well. We've been on four dates and seem to have a shit ton in common. I like her a lot already. I would be willing to pursue her in a serious way. However I have noticed myself feeling very anxious, needy, codependent, etc. I don't excessively text her, she seems interested, she has initiated some of our dates and initiated some of our recent conversations (we don't really text much throughout the day and will sometimes go a day or two without communication, which kind of throws me off). I guess, I am feeling very insecure and starting to make assumptions that she's not interested, overthinking things, and beginning to talk myself out of pursuing her any further or reaching out this week to see if she'd like to do something. We joked over a couple texts yesterday about an ""inside joke"", and we went out the night before which ended in our first kiss in which she texted me as soon as she got home, so I guess I shouldn't be too worried, but I am.  

Should I back off of this woman and focus on my own struggles right now? Is quitting weed while trying to date someone that makes you feel a little anxious/excited a double edged sword in a way? I know from experience that there are withdrawals to quitting weed for about 1-2 weeks. Should I tell her that I need a week or two to myself? Should I not tell her anything and just grind on like a king? Should I be honest with her that I'm quitting weed and don't know where I will be (mentally/emotionally) in one week, let alone two, three, four? I know long term, this is going to be the best thing for me, but I'd like to not ""lose"" this woman in the process.

When I was in middle school, I had no chance of getting a girlfriend. I was pretty nice and extremely smart, but I was overweight/fat. People bullied me all the time and no girls gave me a chance.

It took 5 years of ice hockey and exercise to improve my physical appearance. I also joined several school clubs to improve my abysmal social status (even though I lost weight, people still made fun of me). Now after long last, I finally have a girlfriend. But it cost me so much effort. I almost thought it wasn't worth it. I had to completely change myself.

P.S.A.: Don't always give that sort of generic response to comfort someone. I know it's a tough thing to tell them they need to work on themselves, but sometimes it's what they need to hear.

————————————————————
The first thing i want to say is that this is just MY point of view, my personal opinion. I just want to offer a different point of view, maybe it can help someone. 
I’m NOT a dating coach ( does it even exist? ). 

I’m just a 18 yo guy. I define myself as plain looking.
————————————————————

So, I’ll start by saying that

“being plain looking ( not ugly, but not even handsome for sure ) is an advantage”.

Sure, looking like Brad Pitt or Margot Robbie might help A LOT, but it’s not everything.
I’m a plain looking guy myself. I’m even balding… it wouldn’t bother me if i was 30, but i’m 18. 

What i want you to understand is that a plain looking person is not a person that people think is “hot” but not even “ugly”. Being plain is a particular situation: you can become very attractive, especially for people that get to know you. Ofc you won’t be attractive for girls on the streets, if you’re average looking.

And consider that ugly people are very very few. The person that’s reading this is probably not ugly. If he/she is, there’s always a way to improve both physically and mentally.

You can still be attractive for some girls that don’t know you, just by going to the gym, improving your style and taking care of yourself. You won’t be a model, but you’ll surely become less plain and more handsome than you used to be. 

The point is that plain people can’t mainly count on their looks initially, but they can still develop a great personality ( also regarding interests, way of talking, moving, literally anything you can do or think about ). An handsome man is “handsome” also because he stands still, maybe has a great physique, maybe is very confident. You see? Most of the things that make a man attractive are things that can be achieved. 

But why did i say that “being plain looking is an ADVANTAGE?”. I mean… people don’t think you’re hot when they first see you, they don’t think anything… just “another random guy”. 

The reason why i used the word “ADVANTAGE” is this: 

your personality will be taken more in consideration. 

This doesn’t mean that an handsome man/beautiful woman’s personality won’t be important, but it means that you can actually attract people also thanks to your personality. While an handsome man will have more chances regarding physical attraction ( even though tastes are subjective ), a plain looking dude’s strength will be his personality.

It has happened so many times, and i still see attractive people with plain looking partners. Personally, i’ve been attracted to many plain looking girls ( they were considered average by other guys ) because of the way they acted. After a while, everyone at school considered them attractive. 

At the beginning, when average looking people still don’t have confidence in themselves yet, they’ll just need time to be considered attractive. 

You want a clear example? Look at Ryan Gosling. Tons of people wouldn’t find him attractive, if he wasn’t an actor. All his acting roles imply confidence, courage, and literally any positive feature a man can have. He looks better than average because of his physique, but he’s full of defects. If he was a normal person with a normal job, maybe even shy and insecure, he wouldn’t be seen as a very attractive man. 

I’ve dated two girls up to now: the first was very beautiful and the second was less beautiful. Imagine what? I was dating the pretty girl mostly for her looks, and the average looking girl mostly for her attitude, her intelligence and the way she talked/moved/looked at me. 

Imagine who among the two got a second, third, fourth date and became my girlfriend ( that i currently love both physically and mentally ).

So, if you really want a piece of advice:

Be honest to yourself when it comes to your actual appearance. Improve it to the point that you feel confident in your own skin. It’s true: if you’re considered plain looking it’s mostly because of your face, but that doesn’t mean that changing your physique will be useless, even if you’re ugly.

After you’ll feel good physically, just work on your self internally: surely you’ll feel more confident with a better physique, but you still have yo find out more about yourself, put yourself out if you’re shy and improve your way of talking ( it’s very important ), your way of looking to someone ( might be creepy, but it really makes the difference, along with the way you move ). 
Plus, SMILE MORE ( if you don’t do that already )… some guys/girls can be extremely attractive if they have a good smile and use it often.

There are two types of single people - the happy ones and the unhappy ones. And there are two types of the happy ones - those who are naturally enjoying being single and it's just their core personality trait / genetics /or whatever that makes them to not want any relationships at all, they just naturally don't care regardless of their life situation - those people are Naturals and they are the minority. I'm not going to talk about them, since there is nothing to talk about this type - they are just the way they are and are damn lucky to be like that.

Now let's focus on the other type of happy single that most of us strive to be. When unhappy single people try to ask for advice on how to stay happy single, the advice is always like:

* stay busy
* get hobbies
* enjoy your company
* love yourself
* I don't know, travel, go to Japan and try sushi or whatever
* make your life exciting
* build your career focus on yourself
* ....you know all that stuff

It's not necessarily a bad advice since it can help with the main goal I'm going to get to. What I've noticed on people who took this advice to heart and practiced it, that in the end, after reaching all their career goals, travelling around the world and trying new hobbies... at the end, they ended up being unhappy single again. And why? Because all the advice on how to stay being single lacks the core aspect that makes difference between whether you'll end up being happy single or being unhappy single. And that is - **making yourself desirable and therefore voluntarily single.** That's all. If singledom comes **out of choice**, then you'll be happy single. If you can get relationship easily, you'll be happy single since you know you can get it any time you want. Being single out of choice is what makes you feel good about being single. Knowing that you're desirable and that you can certainly find someone that would desire you is reassuring. Being single like this is much easier.

That's the main difference between unhappy single and happy single. The people who I mentioned ""did everything right"" yeah, but in the end, they still felt like their single-ness was **forced, in-voluntary** and that they are not desirable - and that is where all the unhappiness comes from. Feeling unwanted and being unable to find a relationship is soul crushing. That's why some people who are single are so unhappy and angry. It's because they feel **powerless**. They feel like they can't change the situation, so even if you try to be happy in that situation, you'll never actually be happy since you'll always feel forced in it. That's it. That's all it is about. Simple.

The key to become a happy single person is ironically obtaining the ability to get a relationship. All that advice people give you will help you but don't focus too much on that because you'll end up like the people I mentioned. Resolve the **underlying issue** which is your un-desirability. If you're single and desirable you'll be happy, if you're single and undesirable (or feel undesirable), than you'll end up unhappy and bitter despite trying all the hobbies in the world.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,894176,public,self,"What I learned and observed from the advice people give on ""how to stay happy single""",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oj2kg9/what_i_learned_and_observed_from_the_advice/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I went on a date recently with this great guy! We had margaritas and met off bumble. I’ve been on a lot of dates lately that I just didn’t mesh well with the person and never felt great about but last night I had so much fun and this guy and I just clicked. He walked me to my car, he did not kiss me but we hugged, and he asked if I was free next weekend to go to a restaurant  we were talking about. We decided on Friday night. I gave him my number then and he texted me 30 min after the date saying he had a good time and saying we should figure something out for Friday. I agreed and said Friday would work but didn’t say anything else. He hasn’t replied. Just not sure if a guy would go to all that trouble if he wasn’t interested in a girl. What do you think?

After the trip she and I went out for drinks on Saturday and talked. We both admitted that we like each other. We’ve known each other for years and have always flirted. The reason I never pursued her was because my sister and I had made an agreement to not date each other’s friends.

Now I had to tell my sister that her friend and I had decided we liked each other and I wanted to ask her out on a date. Now most people might not care what their sister thought but my sister and I have always been super close. She’s really one of my best friends. For some reason I had convinced myself that my sister would lose her shit when she found out. But at my parent’s place on Sunday for dinner I told her I needed to talk to her.

I told her that Shayna and I had talked and both admitted that we wanted to date each other. I left out the making out part. I told her I know what the deal we made was and I didn’t want her to get pissed at Shayna. Well my sister laughed at me and said that deal was something we made when we were high school kids because we didn’t want drama. She made me promise not to hurt Shayna and said if we wanted to go out she was fine with it.

So I called Shay up and told her what my sister said and that I’d like to take her out on Saturday. She just laughed and said she’d love to go out with me. So we talked for a while and decided on a restaurant we both like. We’re not sure what else we’ll do but I’m going to figure out something fun for us. 
This will be my first real date in a while. I haven’t had the best luck with women this year so far but hopefully that has changed.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,894197,public,self,I have a honest to god date on Saturday night!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oj2v5j/i_have_a_honest_to_god_date_on_saturday_night/,all_ads,6,,,,,,
