1,mkgfof,1617613879,Help... how the heck do I keep it above board,"Ok gentlemen of Reddit... And ladies who manage to do this are welcome too. 

I am now officially on OLD sites again. I have chosen to maximise my reach and date across many of them. 
I have recent pics, full length, active, b&amp;w, face ones etc. 
Smiling in all of them (of course). No fliters, exes, kids, pouts. 
I am pretty specific about what I want and there is no indication in my profile that somehow... I am some craven s3x fiend. (I just play one on Reddit. *pmsl*)

So to my questions 
1. Why after chatting for 1 day does every man I talk to eventually test the waters with a comment like? ""Blah blah blah in the bedroom. 

2. How the heck do you answer/shut down  the above without seeming like a total prude? I enjoy passionate expression in a relationship. I just prefer getting to know someone for a period of time before I am propositioned. üôÑ

I am tired of reading bumf on high value women blah blah. There is no secret we need to learn to be decent to each other. I don't desire to manipulate, cajole or convince a man to like me. That is patronising.

Simply put I hold old fashioned values of honour, respect, mutual appreciation and treat my friends, mates and lovers with admiration and decency. 

Answers on a postcard please...

She said she has been enjoying my friendship and isn't quite ready to take things to the next level quite yet.

I feel like this may be a sign she isn't attracted to me and might end up not wanting to continue pursuing a relationship with me.  I've been feeling quite down thinking about that, to the point where it takes up a lot of my thoughts during the day.  I would be heartbroken if that were the case.

I *almost* swiped left on him because I had listed ‚ÄúLooking for a relationship‚Äù and he wasn‚Äôt sure yet but was just kind of looking to meet people at that point. 

A guy friend of mine advised me to not bypass the ‚ÄúNot sure yet‚Äù guys but instead ask more questions. 

I did. 

It turned out we had quite a bit in common. 

Long story short, we took our time moving from dating to exclusivity to using the terms ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù and ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù but those things all eventually happened. At his lead. 

A couple of months ago we had too much wine together and he admitted he‚Äôd been looking for a partner all along. 

We seem pretty well-matched. We respect each other, meet each other halfway, have met the kids (there‚Äôs a few teenagers between the two of us). Our cats even like the other person.

I do ok on my own with apps, but my picker is off so maybe outsourcing would yield better results.  

My schedule and lifestyle aren't really conducive to meeting someone new - I work in a super male-dominated office, my kid plays travel sports so most weekends in the spring and fall are dedicated to that, and my hobbies like camping, backpacking,  and Spartan/ Tough Mudder style races aren't really venues to meet people organically. 

Does anyone have any experience with matchmakers?  My experience is limited to being in their candidate pool. 

Long story short - my friend from high school worked for the one advertised on TV and was building her client books, so she included me for free as a matchable person... so I'm sort of familiar with the vetting process and had one really short, but intense relationship that formed from being matched - that quickly flamed out because we wanted different things in life - she wanted kids and I'm done changing diapers and didn't want to be the old dad.

I was on drugs but decided that life wasn‚Äôt for my children or me and have been sober over 11 years from hard drugs like meth. There is much more but that‚Äôs for therapy. I am 41 now. 

I‚Äôm sharing all this because I‚Äôm seriously self-conscience of my past when it comes to dating and my fears were just confirmed.

I recently was dating a man from work and thought it was going cool. Until last Friday when he opened up and I thought that was the green light to open up too. I shared some of the above (not everything) and let him in my apartment for the first time ever. We didn‚Äôt do anything sexual and it felt good to finally have someone to trust. 

I thought all was good and was considering asking him if he wanted to be in a relationship with me, but all of a sudden he went cold like ice. He called once after that and wasn‚Äôt as talkative as usual. He stopped replying to my texts and hasn‚Äôt answered when I call, he always has picked up right away before or would call back within an hour. 

I feel like I scared him off by sharing too much. I had previously stopped dating before this and have been single for 6 years now. I don‚Äôt know if a man will be willing to fall in love with someone like me. I have never been in love or in a healthy relationship where the man I am with loves me back, they have all been abusive.

I do sports 3 to 4 times a week. I stay fit mentally as well. Bald on the top and grey on the sides. I find myself attractive for my age and so I hear from all the compliments I receive. 

I‚Äôm fun to be around and like joking about myself and everything. I do have my 5 minutes of serious exchanges with others, I don‚Äôt criticize nor offer my opinion unless asked for. I‚Äôm also an empathetic fool that sometimes carries the weight of the world. From the 16 personalities, I‚Äôm an INF-J. Do not mistake my kindness with stupidity or being a pushover.

My problem is simple, but sometimes difficult for my daughter and myself. She is a beautiful 22 year old with an envious social life. Many of her girlfriends tend to stay over for many days. They are sweet, beautiful and pay too much attention to me and flirt with me in a way that I find uncomfortable. I brush them gently away, thanking them for the sweet compliments when my daughter is not in direct hearing distance. She loves being at home and I don‚Äôt want to jeopardize our father daughter relationship. Since her mother has departed, we emotionally help each other out. I just don‚Äôt want her friends to flirt with me anymore. I‚Äôm not looking for any relationship, had one that was 35 years younger than me and was very money hungry and loved teen boys. Learned my lesson. So, started dating women my age again, they were searching for financial stability and displayed no emotion whatsoever.

Now alone and very happy. Just don‚Äôt know how long I can handle that. Young girls don‚Äôt turn me on and don‚Äôt feel like teaching them the fine art of love.

60,mme8wz,1617836385,My Time is MY TIME,"I have a couple of observations I've noticed with app dating that I'd like to share and get feedback from everyone on. A disclaimer: I am in no way confused and not looking for advice, but rather needing to point on the behavior and challenging us to do a little better.  


When we get to the point we exchange personal phone numbers, I'm going to still need you to respect my personal time. Por ejemplo:  


* When I give you my personal number (or a Burner number, because I ain't no type of fool), this means that you will text me at an appropriate time of day. I'm steadily noticing a tend of new matches (and messages from those new matches) coming in between 5 am and 7 am in the morning. Now, I'm grown enough of a woman to understand why this occurs. I know what thoughts and desires run through a man's head when he first wakes. And, I realize what his testosterone is likely boiling as yawns, awakens, and picks up his phone to swipe on pretty faces. And, that's well and good.   
However, if we've chatted and I've given you my phone number to continue our chat off of the app, and you feel 6:00 am is a good time to text me good morning on my personal number and share exciting musings and conversation about our continued communication, that's gonna be a no from me dawg. I'm getting my last moments of sleep. Or, I'm roaming around the house in a zombie-like state and am in no mood to connect with you and your desirous ruminations

And, while some of us are able and comfortable to turn our phones completely off to avoid notifications, some of us have children or aging parents for which we must have access to communications coming in at all times. So, let's keep that texts for respectable texting times.  


* If I happen to be awake at 2am or 4am or 6am and on the app, that's MY TIME. My little green light means I am utilizing the app. If you see me online, say to yourself ""Hey! I have her personal phone number! Lemme hit her up!"" and text me ""I saw you were online. Hi!!!!"" you're infringing on MY PERSONAL TIME.   
If I am on the app, this means I want to be ON THE APP. This does not mean that I want to take my attention, time, or conversation away from the app that I am currently on to split my time between different software or devices to talk to you. I did not give you my number to have you look for and stalk my online time and attempt to dominate it. Realize I may very well be talking to other people and don't take my green app light as a green text light. You're welcome to text me, but respect that I may not respond until I am free or want to.
* &amp;#x200B;
* Finally, if you text me at 5 am or 6 am habitually before we are scheduled to meet, don't get angry, upset, or insulting when you don't understand why I cancel that meet. Your lack of personal boundaries in text alone shows me you will have issues with personal boundaries in a dating relationship.  


tl;dr - don't stalk me on the app and text me when I'm online. And, don't ever text me during early dawn hours before I'm even awake.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mme8wz/my_time_is_my_time/

Wikipedia defines a cornerman as a trainer or coach, assisting a fighter during a bout.

I read a nice quote from a woman today that gave me pause; it was so simple, but also very powerful.

‚ÄúA man in your corner is way different than just a man in your bed.‚Äù

As a man, I thought about it from the perspective of switching man with woman, and the same applies.

Compatibility, in and out of the bedroom, is great, but when you add that in your corner/got your back element to it, the couple almost  certainly becomes unstoppable when it comes to achieving the life that they want to create, as their actions and energy are completely aligned.

Regardless of whether or not we ‚Äúneed‚Äù someone, it‚Äôs nice knowing that someone‚Äôs in our corner if ever the time came in which we did.

77,mn30q7,1617920266,Slow going. Asked if I could kiss her and now she seems distant/quiet,"I've been seeing a woman for about 3 months.  We met on a dating app, and early on she said she wanted a friend who might lead to a long-term relationship, and that she's had bad luck in relationships in the past due to depression &amp; anxiety, as well as trouble sleeping at night which leads to sleeping a lot during the day.  So, I've been patient and have been giving things time.

Things have seemed fairly friendly, but I've gotten to really like her.  We've always seemed to enjoy each other's company.  We have good conversations, and we've told each other we like each other.  But I feel like she's given mixed signals.  For instance, she recently told me she was falling for me (after I told her I've been falling for her) but she needs time to work through issues with affection. Then, recently we were out shopping and she was holding my hand and later cuddled a bit while watching TV.  When she wanted to go home, I asked if I could kiss her.  She said she isn't ready for that yet.  I texted to say sorry if I was too forward, and she said it's okay, and she has been enjoying my friendship and isn't quite ready to take things to the next level.  After 3 months, it feels like things are going fairly slow.

Since then (several days), it seems she has been more distant/quiet, not texting as much and not replying to texts as soon as she used to.  I really hope I haven't pushed her away.  I value her friendship.  I really like her; would it be worth waiting to see if anything more happens?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mn30q7/slow_going_asked_if_i_could_kiss_her_and_now_she/

The check arrived and it sat on the table for a minute. I didn't realize until later that he was expecting me to offer to split. He said, ""Would you like to split the check?"" I replied of course. 

I forgot my wallet and was so embarrassed. There was a thunderstorm and I was trying to get things situated at home. I never forget my wallet. 

He looked suspicious when I said I forgot my wallet. I offered cash app, he countered with venmo. We settled on PayPal. I overpaid half of the total + tip because I was humiliated even though I had a salad and he had an entree. If someone forgot their wallet, I'd assume it was an accidental and cover the whole tab.

Then she wants me to bring someone for her friend to hang out with. I don't really know any single guys our age.  Single guys I know are younger redneck guys I know from sports and would not be caught dead with this lady and her friend. 

So I tell her I can't really provide someone for her friend to hangout with.  She hasn't responded since so I deleted her with morning.

91,mnj8l6,1617980873,I found the men! Real life men!,"Hi DOF!
I‚Äôm a happily married 42 year old woman, so I‚Äôm not looking for any dates, but I accidentally stumbled on a way to meet single men in the real world, and it doesn‚Äôt do me any good so I‚Äôm hoping it will help someone else!
Ok, so prior to COVID, every Friday I met up with my friends at the brewery and we would knit. 
We would get to the brewery, settle in, and throughout night, I, or one of the other women in the group, would make a lap around the place and invite people to come knit with us, something like ‚ÄúHey we‚Äôre knitting over there if you want to learn. Stay for as long or as little as you‚Äôd like‚Äù 
I had extra needles and yarn from garage sales so people could keep their projects if they wanted to.
And... people came by our table to knit! Some nights we had as many as 20 additional people knit with us. Old, young, couples, singles, all sorts of people would stop by. This wasn‚Äôt *designed* to be a dating thing, it was meant to be (and was genuinely!) about us knitting and teaching people how to knit, but we noticed that the one type of group that almost always came by: men, age range of mid 20s-mid 50s. The younger guys, mid 20s, were the most into it, they were so excited! But older guys came by too. 
It was a brewery so we got lots of men knitting because, well, that‚Äôs who primarily came to the brewery. 
And they would come by and chat and knit, sometimes they were just curious and wanted to chat. But basically I think what we accidentally did was make it okay and easy and not weird for strangers to talk to eachother. I mean, we were the only weird ones because we were knitting at a brewery, and that‚Äôs not all that weird.
We eventually made it more formal - you got a name tag if you came to knit, but you HAD to use a fake name and we would say your fake name really loud like ‚ÄúNorm!‚Äù on Cheers. Over the months that we did this, only two men chose the name ‚Äúboobs‚Äù, if you were wondering. 
My single girlfriends met more ‚Äúgood‚Äù men during our Stitch N Bitch sessions than they had during months of online dating AND everyone kept their penis in their pants, so, that‚Äôs a win there. Plus even if you don‚Äôt meet someone you eventually get a scarf out of the deal so that‚Äôs not a bad thing.
Should you all start knitting? I don‚Äôt know, but I do know people over 40 don‚Äôt often get a chance to mingle and somehow we stumbled upon a recipe for getting strangers to talk to eachother.
During the pandemic, I took up paint by number and watercolor and, like knitting, my ambitions were greater than my time so I have way more stuff than time to use it, so now I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll bring those to the brewery post covid and see if people go for that.
Anyway, happy knitting and good luck!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mnj8l6/i_found_the_men_real_life_men/

I live in a remote area, so it seems like any relationship I get into will be long distance, at least for a good while. I‚Äôm on an app where I‚Äôve met some promising matches, but I feel like even though I‚Äôm attractive enough, it‚Äôs going to be very difficult to find someone who will want to jump through all my hoops (including only being available for calls when my kids are with their dad a few days a week (but I love texting!), having to drive hours just to meet for the first time, not wanting to have sex immediately). 

So many things about getting into a relationship again make me nervous! All of a sudden my house is too chaotic to ever invite someone over, I look too old, I get nervous on FaceTime and lose my train of thought...I used to be very chipper and happy but after my mom died of cancer a few years ago I am still smiley but have an edge of negativity I fear will also be a turnoff. I see a lot of profiles saying they want a woman who is ‚Äúconfident and happy where she is in life‚Äù. Are any of us on a dating app really this?

My other concern that I hope can be addressed is probably due to my time on reddit GW, but I worry that a lot of guys are just looking to be ‚Äútalked off‚Äù. Somehow about half the conversations I‚Äôve had with prospective matches has veered into sexual preferences and I end up feeling like a prude if I say I‚Äôm not comfortable talking too extensively about it.

I‚Äôm sorry for the long message but I needed to explain well.
Last October I met a man on a virtual karaoke. We used to sang very often together and it was beautiful: he‚Äôs so sweet. In December we started to talk in private and in January he told to his kids (teenagers) that I am his ‚Äúfuture wife‚Äù. He said to me all the sweetest things you could imagine, that I am the love of his life, that I surely have made a spell on him for him being so amazed by me, that he can‚Äôt wait to come to see me (we are in lockdown and he‚Äôs at 3 hours by train). He even made projects for us lo live together in another area within 18 months. He actually started to search a job in that area! 

I know that he‚Äôs quite ‚Äúfamous‚Äù in the karaoke app, as he sings very well and he‚Äôs also handsome and funny, and kind. I have told to him that I was a bit concerned by all the female fans (especially the same 5-6 that ALWAYS sing with him and to whom he say things like ‚Äúlove you‚Äù) and for a bit he stopped being so warm with them. But one day while we were chatting on WhatsApp I felt that the wanted more to go to sing with the ‚Äúothers‚Äù than to talk with me. Also, he started to show more public appreciations for the duets he had done with the others than the ones he had did with me. I also felt, reading some e public exchanges, that he was talking with some of them by private messages.

 I told him that I feel bad for this and he reacted saying only that I‚Äôm wrong, thaf he only talks with me, that he doesn‚Äôt want to argue because he has already lots of problems at the moment (which is true) and so things became a little ‚Äúcold‚Äù between us and we are still in contact even if I officially left the karaoke app because I ‚Äúno more wanted to see those exchanges he has with others‚Äù (in fact I‚Äôm checking every day and it‚Äôs going worse and worse).ü§¨ü§¨

We are supposed to meet as soon as possible as discussed yesterday and this night while checking the comments under his songs in the karaoke app I saw that‚Äôs he‚Äôs cursing a ‚Äúfan‚Äù (one of the 5-6 that most concerne me) and that they are planning to meet and to go together for a walk at a lake. üò±ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

I feel very sad and MAD! What I am supposed to do?? Talking of this with him would be him blocking me and definitely break up with me. And not give me any explanation, as this is the line he‚Äôs adopting.ü§¨

I am considering to write a pm to her, informing her that the man she is planning to meet has promised to go to the lake with ME, to LIVE with me, to LOVE me for the rest of his life and has also told to his kids that I AM his future wife.ü•∫ And that I can prove all of this with screenshots of the conversations.
What do you think about that? Is it a better idea than suffering in silence? Do you think that she would tell him? Even if I do not write the name of the man?
