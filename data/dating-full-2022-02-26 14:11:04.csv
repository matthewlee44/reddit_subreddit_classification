Boyfriend (24M) and I (23F) met 3 months ago on tinder. We both kept our profiles but disabled discovery/removed ourselves from the swipe deck and deleted the app. I would occasionally redownload the app to read through our first conversations. His profile would always show as 34 km away, which is the exact distance of the apartment he lived in at the time he disabled and deleted his account. He recently moved closer but his profile still showed as 34 km away. Recently, I was on his profile and noticed his distance changed to 20 km away. His new apartment is exactly 17 km away from me. I have not allowed tinder to use my location, and I was at the same location I always was. 

I know your location doesn’t update unless you enable location and start swiping. I confronted the boyfriend about this and he denies ever swiping or even redownloading the app. He has never given me reason to believe he would cheat, quite the opposite actually. He says he could make up some white lie (to show his friends my profile or to read through our old conversations for example) to make me stop worrying about it but isn’t because he wants to be honest. He has let me go through his account and nothing would suggest he has been active recently, but of course, things can be deleted. I am tempted to believe him, would that make me a complete idiot?

So i have so far gone on two dates with this guy and we have been talking for pretty much three months now and we talk like almost everyday. However, we live somewhat far apart, which is why we have only met two times really, and also because of covid obviously. Anyway I asked him if he wanted to meet up and do something this week and at first he was like “yeah, tomorrow?” and then like “shoot, tomorrow is Friday, not Saturday.” So I went but on Saturday would you like to meet up and he said yes. And at this point were texting each other more frequently then usual, but Friday comes around and I notice that I am left on delivered longer then usual but its no big deal but just to make sure since I am the one who travels to his city I ask if we are still on tomorrow, (this is roughly translated cause we weren’t speaking in English) and he answered back “should we?” and so I said something along the lines of that’s what I’m asking so he wrote back “me too.” Then I was kind of like, I don’t remember word for word but I wrote “lmaooo if you don’t feel like or want to meet up anymore then just say that instead” because to me it really isn’t that big of a deal if someone cancels or just doesn’t feel like they want to hang out anymore. He responded with “hahah its not that I don’t want to meet up, I do. I’m just messed up and I feel mean.” 

I didn’t really understand what he meant by that so I wrote back, hahahhah what? Makes no sense. Why would you feel mean? 

He hasn’t responded and its been a week, he hasn’t blocked me or anything either (I think that if he had it would make me feel better actually, because then I know 100% where I stand). I am totally new to boys and everything like that and I don’t have any boy friends that I can ask. If you ghost someone you usually block them, no? maybe I’m being dramatic and hes just thinking or something, but it bugs me that he stopped responding when I asked him a question. Maybe I’m being dramatic or something idk. 

Anyway, right now I cant decide whether I should text him and see whats up or if I should just let it be.

It felt really obvious. Soon after, we began scheduling occasional events with a mixture of friends/coworkers and eventually biweekly bar trivia. Every time, it's a blast. I always sensed something between us, but not enough to make a move, even though I'm sorta crazy about her. I'm about 7 years older, which made me hesitant. I understand the plight of the woman coworker who wants platonic male friends. I have plenty of platonic female friends at work and otherwise. I also feel like the group is great and I didn't want to risk making that awkward. 

Recently, she came to another work event (which is rare) and kept going over to one of my friends to talk to him. Her body language was pretty telling. He's currently seeing someone, but it rubbed me the wrong way and I felt jealous. I didn't show it and I wasn't resentful, I just dealt with that on my own. 

Still, the next day, I texted her and asked if she wanted to hang solo and if I could treat her to a movie or drinks. She said she'd be down to see if there's anything we could do with the group. I was disappointed, but I felt like I had my answer and went along with it, offering to float some ideas. 

Later that night, she texted me again and said she would be up to hang soon, alone or with the group. 

I feel like I should be happy about that, but it felt mixed and unenthused. I gave her an out, she came back and accepted, but still. I'll probably see her again this week and I'm hoping to get some clarity. I'm open to finding out I've been wrong this whole time and it hasn't been mutual at all, it's just gonna be hard to adjust because I really like her a lot and have for a while. Maybe I'm just overthinking, maybe I'm being too intense. Maybe you're ready to bash my head in. 

Obviously there's more to this, but what do you all think? I'm just really trying to get across that I want to take my shot, I really like them a lot, and I absolutely respect them as a friend. I wanted clarity and I feel like I have even less. 

For the record, I've worked here for 5 years and never pursued a coworker, nor have I really given into anyone pursuing me. It's a start-up, so at times there was a sense of unlawlessness.

Yesterday I (F21) decided to take a break from my relationship (I say I because unfortunately it was not something my boyfriend (M22) wanted initially). He was sad about it, but it was a relief to be able to tell him what I needed, and he understood. We've only been together for 2 months (dating or sleeping together since october). It is my first relationship and he is all I ever wished for in a man. In the beginning I wasn't very interested and never thought this would end in a relationship, but we got a long so well, the sex and intimacy was great and then we decided to be together in december. I've never felt more safe, calm and loved by a man before.

I don't know what happened two weeks in but as i remember it, intrusive thoughts just came out of nowhere: ""Do I really like him?"", ""Are we a good match?"", ""Will this work out?"" and ever since i've been really sad and gotten a lot of anxiety because of this back and forth (some days it has been all good but this week it has been horrible). He has been very sure of his feelings the whole time we've seen each other, whilst things have gone slower for me. I've never experienced anxiety before so it has been a bit traumatizing. The worst part is that he is the most amazing person ever, and he has showed me so much love and appreciation. I've never gotten that appreciation from someone else before, he has truly been the most amazing boyfriend ever, so I have no idea why I gotten these doubts from. He has been the most helpful person and one of my rocks during this, but it all has gotten a bit conflicting, when most of the anxiety regards thoughts about the relationship (I think?), and I've felt a bit bad for what he has had to gone through with me. It feels like half of the relationship have been him comforting me, which feels wrong.

The anxiety got so bad that I now decided that I need a break. He is very positive that everything will work out and all he wants is to be with me, which is what I hope for too. We had a good talk and spent some time together yesterday before parting ways. Today has been hell. I woke up and all I wanted to do was call him, the rest of the day has been switching from trying to calm down and crying so much because it hurts so much. All I want is to be able to have a healthy relationship with him, and i'm afraid that i feel we've gone too fast and therefore this break was inevitable, and that it feels a bit hopeless. So i go between feeling hopeless and thinking we have to break up but then thinking everything will be fine. I try to focus on myself but, I can't stop thinking of him and how much it will hurt if this ends (for me too, but he's madly in love with me and I care and love him too and don't want to see him hurt). The worst part is that he said ""I love you"" this week when I was feeling down, and even though I love him too it felt a bit too soon, but I know he only meant well (and i said I love him too but wishes to tell him ""for real"" when i feel better). I'm so scared to make the wrong decision that it hurts.

I will see a therapist on wednesday and wishes that I can see things clearer, but I try to not put too much pressure on that one meeting.

I know I should not force anything from myself and take this time to heal and try to figure my feelings out, but it is so hard.

Apologies for the long post in advance, this is a bit of a vent session too. This was my first true step in the dating world after being single for 4 years after a ending a long-term relationship. I don’t date often because I don’t choose to spend time with guys who I am not interested with, and in the past, guys I was interested with turned into long-term boyfriends so I don’t have a lot of experience in rejection from a dating stand-point. 

I started talking to a guy (33M) on OLD who was from my hometown. We had several mutual friends in HS, but were never friends. I was flattered that he liked one of my pictures and we talked online for about two weeks before I gave him my phone number and we moved to text for another two weeks, before he asked me out for dinner and drinks one Friday night. He lives far away and only comes into town on the weekends. 

First date went well, but he was definitely way more shy and awkward than any guy I’ve ever dated or even socialized with. When he did open up, he was funny and witty. I was also a little nervous because I am about 50+ lbs heavier than I was in HS, and I was worried he would be disappointed when we finally met in person. At the end of the date, he walked me to my car and hugged. I thought it went okay, but no major sparks and didn’t expect much out of it. 

After first date, he continues to text me everyday. Not long conversations daily, but he’d always check in once a day to see how my day was going. If I didn’t respond to his text the night before, he’d still text the next day. The next weekend, he asked me what I was doing Friday night but never made concrete plans. I mentioned that it would be nice to see him again and he asked me out to dinner that night. Afterwards, he invited me to go out for drinks with his friends afterwards. I felt like that was a great time. At the end of the night, same thing. Walked me to my car and a hug good night. We texted a little afterward and said thanks for going out, I know I twisted your arm a little. He said not at all, the whole point of coming into town Friday night was so we could hang out. 

Now - the rational mind in me is telling myself that this is not a love connection. I ignored a few red flags that I normally would find undesirable. He basically is a college student living in a 30-year old’s body. But, for some reason, I still found myself drawn to this guy. We text every day. He even sent a couple of flirty text messages which took my by surprise. I told him so and he admitted he was very shy but he was glad that I haven’t given up on him yet. We went on another dinner and drinks date and I felt like he opened up a lot about past relationships and his dating life in general. Still just a hug good bye and no kiss. 

Fast forward to this weekend, he invited me to an event yesterday that would have me meeting all his friends in the same place. I asked if it would be weird and he said no and even offered to hang out before to chill and have dinner at my house. We do that and right before the party (I literally changed and everything), he tells me that before I commit to going, that he didn’t see us dating and didn’t want to continue leading me on. I decided that it probably wasn’t a good idea that I go, opted to stay home and let him know no hard feelings. 

TLDR: I know this is a situation that probably happens often and it’s not an anomaly, but the rejection really stings. In hindsight, I should have checked in earlier to see where his head was at, but was worried that it might scare him off. Obviously, will not be making that same mistake again. I know in my heart that it probably wasn’t going to work out long-term and I should be grateful it ended sooner rather than later, but I just keep wondering where I went wrong.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1161963,public,self,First Rejection in a Long Time.

Me (30 M) went to a wedding two weeks ago and roomed with a mutual friend (28 F) that I’ve know over a long period of time but I’ve only briefly interacted with when get together were planned. It was all very fast in the sense we woke up after hooking up and had to go wake up the other friends in other rooms to go to the airport and had no time to interact after waking up in the king bed. 


She is pretty busy so it’s been tough to get her to come to the reunions our friends have planned in the last two weeks. I feel like I could casually just tell her that I got some feeling and would like to spend some time together to get to know her better. Here’s the kicker, another good friend of mine is interested in her after the wedding. We both talked about it since he disclosed it to me and I told him I had intentions of asking her out and told me to go ahead but I know he is still interested. He previously told the former bride and I don’t know how much she is helping him but I feel I need to make a move soon. I asked her when she is not working (she is a nurse) but hasn’t answered. She had to be at the hospital at 6am. I feel like I want to be more direct and tell her I want to have some coffee with her (and maybe tell her I want to talk to her about something?)

Update: I'll try and make this brief. So it turns out we both really like John Candy the actor. I made a post about what movie would you pick to test someone. To see if you're a great match. I said either Uncle Buck or what about Bob. She said we should watch a movie together since we have similar taste. So far we haven't do to me having crappy internet. But that's led to us talking more. 

She messaged me out of the blue the other day. Just to say hey and talk about the Bible study she's going to. We had a bit of an airplane Leslie Nielsen moment. I asked her what the Bible study was about? She said they talked about books of the Bible. I said yeah it's a pretty good book. she thought that was pretty funny. Later I shared a selfie of my hair all messed up. Said I forgot to put a hat on and went to the store like that. She thought it was cute. She then shared a selfie she took. She looked great as always. But basically said she's been feeling gross lately do too gaing weight. I told her she was far from gross. I also said you can't weigh awesome and that's the only scale that counts. She appreciated it and laughed. She even messaged me the next morning just to say hey. 

But now I've got a new problem. The group were a part of has made today saddie Hawkins day. Basically guys put their name and selfie in the comments. Then girls can DM them to ask them out. She hearted the post and said aww yeah. I liked the post. I'm just not sure if I should put my name down in the comments. I know that their is a few other girls that probably like me in the group.

For context, I'm a guy in his late 30s, I myself look younger than my actual age, I'm very fit, handsome, and all-around well put together in my career, personality, and lifestyle.

The reason why I think dates with older women happen and the ones with women around my own age do not are because older women actually show up to conversations, make the effort two-way, are very transparent about what they're looking for, and don't flake on plans. Meanwhile, women around my own age have a funny way of disappearing after a conversation that barely got off the ground after two or three days, or in the instances where you make plans to meet up, they either back out at the last minute or will even stand you up flat out.

Now, you are probably wondering: Why don't the dates with the older women work out? The reason usually comes down to being in very different places in our lives. I'm single, never married, have minimal relationship baggage, and don't have children. I still want to do enjoyable things in my free time like go see live music, see new places, and am generally seeking someone who is available on weekends to start off, where as older women have family obligations because of their children, are in different places with their careers, they're also more experienced in relationships, and they basically just want a guy to go to dinner with or watch a movie with on the odd days when the kids are at their other parent's. They are often surprised I'm still single, though, and don't get it why women around my own age keep missing me since they think I'm a big catch.

I'm 34, living in the suburbs, in and out of jobs at the moment, but this has been going on since my teens. I feel like my desires are both unwanted and invisible and I'm not really sure what to do.

Most of my meeting people now is through the internet, twitter/reddit generally. I get along with lots of people but I can never seem to get the kind of interest back that I show. I'm not really looking to be on social media just to get laid, but I see other people having fun flirty conversations and I can never really get on that level. People seem to find me okay company but I just don't grab that further look.

I've tried tinder and hinge but really had no dice there either. It's not that the conversation goes badly, it doesn't even get to that point. I don't like pickup lines because I feel it's a bit gross and obvious, so I just try to start out with a conversation, a question, anything. 19 out of 20 times it's an instant unmatch. The other 1 time it doesn't tend to go anywhere. I've had one decent date through tinder in like a decade, we got to making out at one point then she ""suddenly got serious"" with someone else.

I just don't really understand what it is about me that doesn't get over. If I ask my friends they say I'm alright, clean, fairly funny, interesting thoughts. I don't think that I'm an ugly person. I just can never get a sexual/romantic interest out of people that I'm interested in, and no one that I'm not interested in (yet) has ever brought anything to my attention. I've had girlfriends but they were short things and were kind of out of the blue, I can't say that I was doing anything different.

My goal is to be able to flirt online, either over apps or on social media. I just want to be taken seriously as a sexual person. I never have been and I think it's really deeply damaged my confidence. I just don't know what to do about it. Any help or advice appreciated.

Note: as far as meeting people in person goes, I just don't have good luck with friends.

Why don’t they want to date me? And in what ways am I the problem? 

 I am 27(F) and my life’s dream has been to be a wife and a mother to a large family, but despite my desires, I have not even been in a relationship before. Not that I actively tried to be in a relationship nor did I actively avoid it but it just never lined up for me. I grew up very academically focussed so I never considered dating in my high school years. In college I went on a couple dates here and there but they never really went anywhere. There was a time that I felt almost overwhelmed with multiple options for a partner but then the pandemic hit and my potentials all quickly fizzled out and since then I have never even spoken to a man. That’s going on two years now. I tried the dating apps but aside from those seeking hook ups, I haven’t found anything of substance yet. 
Some of my girlfriends who vowed never getting married in order to pursue their careers are all getting engaged left and right around me now and it seems to me like everyone else is finding incredible relationships effortlessly which leads me to wonder more everyday; what is wrong with me?
As far as looks, I am 5’5/120lbs and average body I guess. With a masters, no debts, and trained at all the wifely duties in the book, I worked this hard so far in my life all in hopes that it leads me to becoming someone’s wife. I look forward to putting in the work to build a healthy relationship, and I happily await the highs and lows, but yet I can’t find anyone available to start this chapter of my life with. 
I have some male friendships and plenty of male colleagues but they either see me platonically and/or they are married even those in their early 20s, which I find so odd in a big city. 
Has the ship sailed for me in this department ?
Hopeless and dismayed - please help!

So, I want to post here and ask for some help. I grow up in China and I came to US to study when I was 19. Now I worked in US. I have dated some Chinese women in the past, but only a few American girls. I didn't meet any American girls that I'm truly interested until this week. 

I went to a website called Fetlife, and I met a girl there. She was pretty 'brave', as she agreed to invite me to her house and have sex with her without even seeing me. She even told me I don't have to use a condom....  I insisted to meet first so we met on the next day. I was supposed to just talk to her for like 20-30 minutes as this was a hook-up background check for me... But I ended up finding myself very much attracted to her personality and her look. So, our first meeting turned to be more like a date. We talked a lot, obviously her life is a mess now. She told me she was addicted to alcohol and sex since pandemic. She got herself into jail because of drunk driving. She had to go to a rehabilitation group to get rid of addiction to alcohol. So, this girl is by no means someone that I would even consider to date in real life. But I got so attracted to her personality. She told me she really wanted to explore her BDSM fantasy, which is what many people have been doing on Fetlife. I told her that my life value was totally against lifestyles described in this website, and the only reason I went there was because I need sex. So, our life values are very different. Nevertheless, she seems to be interested and enjoyed our conversation. Before she left, she told me to text her to let her know if I want to be a friend, or like to date or to have sex with her. 

I knew that I should not meet her again because I think allowing myself to develop a deep feeling for someone like her is just very unhealthy. She told me she was on that website mainly because she wanted to explore BDSM fantasy, but I even naively thought I could somehow change her mind and start a vanilla relationship with her.   I am very attracted to her, so I ended up texting her 3 days later after we met.  Although she never texted me after she went to her home. 

I didn't text much, I just let her know that I wanted to move forward with dating. Surprisingly that she texted me she did not want to move forward. So, can anyone let me know what do you think of this lady, why she ended up saying she was not interested? Even though she expressed a lot of interest when we met.

I have lived with my boyfriend for almost 4 years. I haven’t always been the most clean individual but at some point I had to grow up. We got a new apartment in September after living with my mom for a year. 
I do all of the cleaning. All of it. He does take the trash out but sometimes will leave it for days. 
If i ever ask him to clean he might do one task but if i ask for another one, even quite simple, he will get pissed and act like he is godly for doing the first act and how dare i ask him to do something else. When he does clean something (never a lot) he is super rude about it. He doesn’t do it to be nice. He isn’t nice about it. He acts like I’m the worst girlfriend ever for making him do it 
I’m a college student full time getting all A’s and struggle immensely to keep the house clean even though i clean every day.  We split the rent and i use my savings. He does work but not full time and he just lost his job 3 days ago. 
He doesn’t clean up after himself, either. He leaves his food on the dresser next to bed every morning when he leaves for work and puts his clothes on the bathroom floor. I do literally every piece of laundry and he will not even put it away when it’s done and will sit it on the floor until it gets unfolded again and I have to refold it. His grandma lived with him all of his life and he has never had to do laundry. He cannot understand the concept of putting dishes in the dishwasher. If he cooks, (he acts like an ass while he does it most of the time) then he leaves shit EVERYWHERE. like i mean wrappers. anything he goes into the kitchen to get he leaves shit behind. he makes easy mac? he leaves the wrapper on the counter. 
I cleaned the entire house before my wisdom teeth surgery yesterday and thought he would take care of me (this includes taking care of our house)
He went to the grocery store and left groceries on the counter. The sink was full of dirty dishes and food when I woke up today. I waited to see if he would clean it and he got on his game again. 
He lost his job 3 days ago and has done nothing but play video games for 12+ hours a day, not looking for a job or anything.  ( don’t get me wrong i play video games too but i also get my shit done )
So i cleaned today. While recovering from surgery. I cannot rest while my house is disgusting. 
I am so tired of being his maid it literally sickens me at this point. If i stop cleaning it will get so bad and he won’t do anything about it and then i have punished myself because I have to clean more then.

She would always bring up dating/being in a relationship with me but I always tried to play it cool. Until I caught legit feelings and mentioned maybe we should take this to the next level.

She came back to me apologizing profusely... She said she realized she can't be in a relationship right now and she's extremely depressed and hung up on her ex from October. But she ""really likes me and still wants to hang out.""

Hi! I’m 24F dating a 26M. We are dating for about 3-4 months. Everything seems to go really well! We would make plans to see each other 2 times a week. I met his friends multiple times. He’s so sweet and affectionate with me. Always telling me i’m beautiful and that i’m an incredible cook. Giving me cute nicknames. Opening up to me about his past. Doing my dishes and making my bed before leaving. Buying me chocolate. The sex is great (he told me) the sexual tension is still there. And i reciprocate these things, i show him that i care too. We speak on the phone almost everyday. Yesterday he texted me that we neeeded to talk. I knew it was either for the what are we talk or break up talk (which was less likely because of how he acted). Less than 2 days, ago he told me he could’nt wait to see me. He wanted to talk in person. I was going away for the week-end at my parents so i told him to call me today. He told me on the phone that he wanted to take some time alone. That he always does this when it gets serious. That something is missing. Why would he act like this if he doesn’t care about me? I really feel like we would be great togheter. I developped strong feelings for him. We agreed on still meeting up in person. (I feel like it’s his fear of rejection speaking because he lost his parents when he was young) what should i say/ask when we meet up?

I am a very emotional 21 yeasr old guy, who has already been through some very deep shit in his life. And I hate that I am a man.

That I am supposed to ‘pick up’ girls (not the best choice of words, but I don’t know how to explain it in English). Maybe sometimes I want to be asked out on a date. But that literally never happens or will ever happen. You can say otherwise, and I know that there are some cases when it happened, but realisticly it’s very, very unlikely.

The worst part is that I am supposed to be ALWAYS strong. Otherwise I am considered weak. I am literally hiding my past from anyone I date. Because I am too scared they would just leave. Slowly, over all the dates and all the different girls I have been with I built up an emotional wall. I feel like I don’t act like the person I really am. And just because I am waaaay more succesfull in dating like that. Seeming always confident and strong. But what’s the point in even doing so? I never get true connections, or love from it.

it usually goes something like this,

1)I meet the girl on a dating app 

2)we make plans to go on a date 

3)we exchange numbers and chat for the next few days 

4)then I usually text them a day ahead of our scheduled date to confirm if they're still up for the date, and they just flat out ignore me.

I'm just so confused because why is it so hard for them to simply say ""Hey, i cant make it tomorrow"" or even ""hey sorry I'm not interested in going anymore""  or even a simple ""no"" would've been fine. I just don't like to be left hanging and stuck with no plans. 

And this is not coming from a place of desperation either, I've reached a point where I have a few girls that are willing to see me when ever I ask, but when these women  leave me hanging and don't even have the common courtesy let me know that they cant make it, it really angers me because I could've scheduled a date with one of my other female friends but instead I'm stuck with no plans all because they can't reply with a simple ""no"".

my question is why do women do this a lot? its not like I'm some thirsty guy hitting them up after getting rejected. these are women that i already had a conversation and build some sort of connection and arranged dates with.

We were talking and we found out that we actually live in the same apartment building and go to the same college, and then when we walked home together that night she gave me her number. Since then, whenever our shifts coincide, we try to walk to and work with each other, and I find myself always looking forward to walking with her. We always end up chit chatting, talking about the shift at work, our classes, our interests, and the like.

On days our shifts haven’t coincided, she texted me that she missed me at work. She wants to know when I am and not in at work, and each time we walk home together she reaches out to give me a hug. There was one week or so where I wasn’t in at all when she was and the next time she saw me at work she ran over to give me a hug in front of everyone. I’ve never seen anyone light up upon seeing me the way she has, it’s the first time I’ve seen anyone look at me like that. Now she’s been embracing me each time we greet each other and whenever we say goodbye to one another. When we walk together, we always laugh at each other’s jokes, and she has this really sweet and inviting presence that I just find myself smiling often around. I also find myself looking forward to running into her and embracing her.

Here’s where I’m conflicted. Apparently she has a boyfriend though. Her Instagram is filled with multiple pictures of them as a couple, most recently being a post on Valentine’s Day of this year. Due to this, I’m inclined to believe she’s just being overly friendly and wants to be friends, but at the same time, she’s never mentioned her boyfriend in conversation with me, and the way she gets all excited when she sees me gives me mixed signals. 

She mentioned having nobody to go to a concert with and then we started making plans to go to one, and she seemed really excited, hearting and laughing at my messages while we were texting about getting the tickets to go. Unfortunately the artist tested positive for Covid and the shows got canceled, I was really looking forward to a night out with her. I really wanna get to know her some more and still do something with her, but I’m unsure on how to proceed. Does she like me? If so, do I or do I not proceed? Or is she just being overly friendly? Do I save myself the trouble and heartache, or go for her? For someone as sweet as her, she may be worth it. What do I do?
