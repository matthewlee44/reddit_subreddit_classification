When the pandemic hit, I tried to do virtual dates and make the most of it, but it just wasn't the same and I myself wasn't too eager to meet anyone while trying to stay safe for myself and others, so I took a break for several months from dating. In the meantime, I got back in touch with some hobbies I'd been neglecting and thought more about what I wanted in a partner. Something I realized is that when I began dating again, I wanted to meet someone who wasn't just going to act like the past year didn't happen at all. I wanted to meet someone who did some growing on their end, too.

I rejoined Hinge and Bumble in late April after I became fully vaccinated. I'm glad I took the time to reflect on what I want right now (which is something of substance and monogamous, but also with no hard goals in mind like rushing to get married or any of that moving too fast stuff...) Along the way, I ended up going on a few dates with a couple of guys, but one in particular stood out. He, too, was just reentering the dating picture and was also moving at a comfortable pace of not rushing back into normal life. We went for a coffee walk on our first date, and then we did a workout at his gym together on our second date. By the third date, it was the weekend, and making tacos and watching a movie with wine and cuddling, and that was right up my alley. 

What's different between dating now and dating before is that I think I appreciate it again, am more aware of my expectations, and have thankfully met someone who is similar in lifestyle and I'm physically attracted to (he's taller, very fit, but also well read and likes low key hobbies.) By date four, TMI, but I don't think I was ever so enthusiastic about sucking a guy's dick in my entire life.

It along with natural self-reflection led me down a path of self-correction when it came to my understandings about sex, and I feel like I learned a lot from it. 

Now a decade into the 4th wave, I feel like we are still in this weird place, because we readily established a solid list of ""don't do""'s but our list and understanding of positive sex norms is very weak beyond Enthusiastic Consent. 

All the relationships I have been in have had very weak sex lives. Either too little or too much, too emotional or not enough. A lot of the women I date come from conservative homes where virginity until marriage was held as a virtuous ideal, or they experienced a sexual assault at some point, or both. 

These things led these women to have unhealthy relationships with sex, in which inner contradictions were present they never knew how to deal with. They may develop sexual attraction and anxiety from sex simultaneaously and not know what to do about it. 

Or they may have used sex to ""not be alone"", or had someone use them for sex as well, leading them to develop unhealthy understandings of how sex ought to work in a relationship, assuming it ought not ""be that important"", and that it is something secondary or even tertiary to a healthy relationship. 

I agree sex isn't needed for a healthy relationship, as I have many of those, but it is needed for a healthy ***romantic*** relationship, and thus the problem arises. 

I'm not quite sure what level my libido is, but it almost never matches up with my partners'. I like to have sex 1-2 times a week, maybe 3, but honestly, I'm more likely to turn down a 3rd time than accept. Which I have had to do with the few women I've dated who used sex (and me) as a coping mechanism for something else, like equating sex as THE love affirming/self-affirming activity. 

My most recent ex used sex early on in the relationship to get me to like her, this she stated explicitly, but then later in our relationship revealed she didn't think it was that important and it ought not be for a healthy relationship. She also revealed she got anxiety from it, and this resulted in us having a dead bedroom at the end of our relationship. 

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""Communicate, Communicate, Communicate."" 

This is why I am writing about this though, because communication is not enough. Simply telling someone what kind of life you want, or what kind of sex life you want, is not enough to heal all wounds because fundamentally theirs and our understandings, notions, and beliefs about sex are flawed. 

Sex is viewed as a vice. Some dirty, raunchy event that men love and sometimes women do to. Its a tool for power. For Pleasure. For Pain. For reliving trauma. For affirming yourself to yourself, and on and on. 

As a result, these inherent contradictions grow in the mind that results in bad understandings about what sex ought to be. Sex ought to be a romantic endeavor, one used to procreate but also bond with a partner and help establish trust and affection through an utterly unique mating ritual. 

Sex ought to be conducted frequently, a rate of your choosing, but a consistent reaffirmation of one's romantic interest ought to be sought after. 

Sex should be understood as a positive thing, conducted in moderation, and done with the utmost respect and honor. It might just be our oldest ritual, and to undergo it is to engage in something truly human. 

This escapes almost all my partners. It's almost never a tool for this, even the one's who fantasize about it being this romantic candle-lit rose petal event never actively engage in the event the way they say it ought to be engaged in because their fantasy is ill-conceived and naive. 

What is needed to remedy all of this is healthier sex norms, and self-reflection on your own preconceived notions of sex done ***not just to interpret what you view sex as but to fundamentally change what you believe about sex*** 

Too often, communication is merely an expression of an idea rather than a thorough study and evaluation of whether that idea is actually correct. Which is why I don't think it is actually enough to bring to create a healthy relationship. 

Better reasoning ability, comfort with being wrong, proper philosophical reflection, and so forth are the only things that can fix our understandings of sex and relationships in general.",False,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,824959,public,self,Sexual Frustration as a result of bad sex norms and emotional connections within ourselves,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nv9l1y/sexual_frustration_as_a_result_of_bad_sex_norms/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

And believe me guys a Glow Up is absolutely necessary, you can't restrict yourself in terms of looks, sometimes it's really stupid to see how an Obese Man/ Woman be expecting a Hot Woman/ Guy. But do y'all guys really believe that, those people would be getting dates from those Hot Guys/ Women?

&amp;#x200B;

Are men expendable? Yes

Can you make it so you are not expendable? Also yes

Men with average or below average looks (which is all subjective btw) think they have no chance in this age of dating and just accept it. This ofcourse is not a good mindset, first we need to realise that dating for men and women is largely different, this sounds obvious but is actually very important to understand. These dynamics go as followed:

Men have it more difficult in the way to initially get a women invested in them. But if they do get into her head the men have all the power. In other words, women screen you/test you in a way that makes sure you are a good man for them (looking at charisma, confidence, status and other factors.)

On the flip side, women have the power initially and it is their game to lose. They will pick what is in their opinion the best possible mate, you just gotta make it so you are that option. You do this by working on the things you can (go to the gym, have good hygiene, eat well, focus on your job/studies, work on posture, have hobbies that interest you and work on confidence etc.)

This ensures that you atleast tried everything to become the best option + all the things i mentioned above are things that will make your life better either way so it's a double win.

Understanding this makes the game more fun because the amount of effort you put in will all go to yourself which makes it amazing because you are improving and attracting a broader scale of women.

I have no interest in sleeping with a guy who is actively pursuing other women.

At the same time, I understand that exclusivity is a type of commitment and from what I’ve seen on this sub and others regarding the typical timeline for exclusivity is that most people don’t want to have that commitment until they’ve been dating for several months (the most common timeline I’ve seen is not establishing exclusivity for 8-12 dates, so assuming you’re both working adults and see each other on the weekend, that’s 2-3 months)

I feel like all the choices are kind of bad choices. My choices seem to be:   
A) Have sex with someone without being exclusive, opening myself up to STDs and emotional attachment when he’s fucking other women;   
B) Don’t have sex with him until we’ve been dating for 2-3 months and we’re finally ready for commitment (which based on the comments I’ve read on this sub, is a dealbreaker and many men will move on if you don’t sleep with them within dates 3-5); or    
C) Bring up exclusivity SUPER early in the relationship and risk scaring him away or him thinking you’re love bombing/being needy


Is my sexual exclusivity boundary really that uncommon? I mean, it can’t be that uncommon, right?! The average # of lifetime sexual partners in the US is like 7, so if I slept with every guy I met on OLD who I got to a 3rd date with, I’d hit the lifetime average in a year 😅

I matched with a guy on bumble three weeks ago and we were consistently speaking for a few days and then randomly he stopped responding.

After a man stops responding I usually let it go but for this guy I felt inclined to continue speaking with him so I waited a week and then I messaged him. 

Afterwards he was more responsive and I asked him if he wanted to facetime. We spoke for hours and if it were up to me we would have continued speaking. During our conversation we settled on a date to go on a date.

However, when the date for our date arrives that afternoon he cancels on me. 

It was frustrating because I had said no to some plans with my friends to see this guy. And after he canceled he stopped replying so that evening I was walking around my neighborhood and I just called him and messaged him asking him if he wanted to join me on a walk if he was done with whatever he was doing.

He called me back and said he would pick me up. He comes and picks me up and takes me back to his apartment. Strangely, I wasn't afraid to go to this stranger's place. I have never gone back to a strangers apartment. We spoke for hours in his apartment and he confessed that the reason he stopped responding was because he didn't feel that I was looking into seriously dating. Which is silly but I brushed it off. 

We then got food and came back to my apartment where we continued to talk and make out. He left my home at 7am. He told he he was so tired that he requested half the day off. 

The following Tuesday and Wendesdays the same thing happened. We stayed together the whole night and we did not have sex. We did do other things but overall it was pretty tame. 

We had scheduled an official date for Friday and on Thursday  he said “I can't do tomorrow. I'm severely behind with my work now, and I still have to see family and my one friend. I did not expect to spend this much time with you these past 3 days. All nighters throw off my routine. And I told him it's okay, I understand. No response. It's been 5 days.

I (21m) met this girl(20f) at my retail job. I went out of my way to introduce myself which is something i never do. We talked for a minute and went our separate ways for about a month. 

She started to sit across from me on my breaks. The break room is a pretty good size and usually not crowded so there is plenty of empty places to sit. The first two times she did this she would just sit there not on her phone or doing anything else really.  

I had seen her in the break room a couple of times before and she was always buried in her phone she was kinda in her own world. 

The 5 or so time she started doing this i started convo with her. I got to know her pretty well over the course of a few months but i am so shy and nervous that i didn’t make any moves. She seemed even more so than I was so that put me at ease. 

We would always talk about family, school, and generally about each other. She would always follow up on little details. We both started getting comfterbal with this snd did this just about every day. Usually going over our scheduled break time. 

One day she started talking about guys who liked her in the past but she didn’t like them for what ever reason. Struck me as odd and from here on out she started asking weekend plans and stuff like that. 

I finally asked for her number and she happily gave it to me. I texted her the next day. But every time she would text i would wait 10-20 minutes to respond to make it seem like i had things going on. I stoped the convo at various points for an hour sometimes two as i was very nervous and afraid she wouldn’t respond if i said something super boring. At around 7 or 8 I would just end the convo by not replying as i go to bed around this time. 

I would always text her the following afternoon, until the third day to which she didn’t respond. I assumed that she want interested but i convinced myself to ask her out anyways. 

She told me she didn’t think she could because she had a brother vulnerable to covid and hasn’t gone out/hung out with anyone and avoids going anywhere but work and home 

I took this as a rejection and told her if she didn’t want me to i wouldn’t talk to her anymore. The last think i would want is for her to be uncomfterbal. She told me not to do that as she really liked our relationship. I agreed and we didn’t text until i saw her at work next. 

Avoided her the whole day until she came and sat down on my break. She was more dressed up then normal and shot me a cute wave before she sat down. We talked for like an hour and a half. 

That night i texted her and told her i needed to get over my feelings for her and i needed space to do that. I told her she was my friend and i dint want to cut her off if she didn’t want me to. She said she understood and would respect it but then said something that sounded like her feelings were hurt. 

The next time i saw her she looked upset and i tried to apologize but she dint really want anything to do with me. How did i read this wrong

I've met a guy on the 25 of April. We went on a first date. We spent 6 hours together and he wanted me to meet his best friend, which I did. He also wanted me to hang out with them but I had to leave as it was already a long date. 

3 days later he reacted with a funny emoji to my story on gram. I thought he’s not interested. 
After some opinions here, I messaged and suggested we meet if he's free. He responded within a minute and kept the conversation going even when I left him on read, he double texted. It was long weekend so he went away as he planned before. No problem. 

He came back and would occasionally message me. Specifically 5 days in a row before the second date. 3 weeks after the first date, we finally met. It was a good time spending. He said the gap was because he's very occupied (he's a lawyer but also has a second job). I messaged him when I got home. In the morning he said ""thanks dear 💞"". 

Again, it's been 18 days and no date is planned. He replied on my gram story and we had some long discussion on some political topic. He ended with ""so glad I've met you tho. You are a kind soul"". It was out of nowhere. 

I am so confused. I know it's too early to think of anything and definitely don't want to pressure him. I do think it's not just for sex as he doesn't reply to any selfies etc. Doesn’t say anything sexual. During the dates, he tries to impress me by showing the videos from his trips etc, he asks me many questions. He remembers every small detail I've said. He always replies within a minute or so. He also showed me a picture of his ex and he had 5 year long relationship but that was long time ago.
Also maybe it doesn't matter but he always calls me ""dear"". Im not sure what it is and kinda confused as I've never seen anyone like that. I don’t like texting everyday either but I mean 3 weeks is just a lot between the dates.

They want something but are afraid to say so they say the things that make them seem as “good”. I stayed true to myself and I wish women do the same so it’s possible not to get any misunderstanding. I even had a marriage proposal so I though the girl had agreed only then I would agree to move forward to the next level, so one day she just dropped that she cannot conceive, I took a liking to her so I told her that it’s gonna be fine, there’s adoption. What’s important is we go through everything together happiness and difficulties. 2 weeks later I emailed her asking how is she and all? She replies “ You make me miserable, I am getting married to what’shisname.” 
No answer from her nor her parents, it took a couple of hours to shake off the confusion. I would have understood if she said she had someone and the proposal was like forced by her parents. I would have taken the high road and called it off amicably.

Yes, in the grand scheme of things, a specific romantic partner is more important than any specific friend but these things are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they actually help each other quite a bit, especially friendships -&gt; dating.

Think about the ways you meet new people to date. 

* Online dating, great for solo people but can be ineffective.
* Going out and meeting new guys/girls. It's really difficult or socially stressful to go out solo. 
* Meeting friends of friends, or other social introductions. You would need a wide social network to do so. 

Plus, do romantic relationships in and of themselves really fulfill us? 

When you have a wide network of friends and other relationships, going out and meeting new people, meeting people through their networks, having support and getting advice, and life after you finally find your partner become much more of a pleasant experience. At least in my opinion.

We met on a dating app, texted/snapped, and he asked me out the next week pretty soon. Early on, I had a series of horrible arguments with my abusive parents that led to a meltdown - he was there, listened, and supported me as I vented

Our first date was the best first date ever. It was 5 hours and only ended because the bar closed that Friday. We met up 1-2x the following weeks and time flew by. I saw a lot of green flags in him and felt a strong connection. I had broken up with someone last summer and this was the first time I felt like I truly clicked with them. At the beginning, he’d tell me how you need to believe in your own worth and how hardworking, amazing, smart and beautiful I am and how it’s really attractive that I apply myself both personally and professionally. And how I’ve got a great job starting soon and he believes in me.

He also would look me in the eyes and say “I really like you” multiple times by the second or third time we met up, seemed super eager to talk to me, said he was hoping he’d be lucky enough to get to see me again, and we’d talk all day until 1-2AM. I also admired his ambitions, work ethic, and just being around him felt amazing, even when he opened up about super personal topics. He did little things that also made it seem like he cared, was respectful, and a gentleman. He was also the first person I had felt comfortable and enjoyed giving and receiving physical affection/touch (having grown up with none). I eventually told him I felt the same way back. 

A month and a half in, he got sick and was busy for a week. He talked a lot less and didn’t seem like he had been. I understood and when we met up at the end of the week, I brought a small thing of flowers and wine to cheer him up. He said he had never had that given to him before and how it was sweet. I noticed that he was a lot less physically affectionate this time but chalked it to him being out of it. 

Over the next couple weeks, he continued to take a lot longer to reply and things seemed off. I eventually asked him and he clarified that he was not looking for any commitment and couldn’t have us getting into a schedule. He needed time to work on himself and protect himself from hurt as he had just ended a toxic long term relationship last year, and that it’s more him than me. In the beginning, we did talk about our expectations and he didn’t mention this, just that he wasn’t looking for anything serious. I agreed and said I was also just looking for casual dating because I felt like I’m in a place where I am ok being single. I was disappointed to find this out but respected it. He still said he’d love to talk and see each other and so did I. I stepped back and kept myself busy with other things. It temporarily felt better. 

Over the next couple weeks, that slowly wore off. When I brought up my birthday, I said I honestly just want to spend quality time with someone I want to be with. I asked him and he said for sure, but couldn’t confirm if he was available or not. I said it doesn’t have to be that specific day, it can be during the next week or two. He never replied. 

I did some more thinking and realized that he was putting almost no effort anymore. It was such a stark contrast and it felt like if I never ever brought up hanging out or messaged him first, he wouldn’t care. So I texted him saying that while this felt like a really special connection in the beginning, I feel like I’m just an afterthought now and I deserve better. And I’d rather rip the bandaid off than drag it out if this is how it was going to be from now on - unless he thought otherwise. But as much as I hoped things went back to how they were, it’s his life and his decisions. And I said good luck and that I wish good things for him. He never responded. 

It’s been 5 days and I am still hurting. I keep getting random crying spells. One minute I’ll be ok, the next l’m reminded of him or see his name on Snapchat and cry.

I have a date tmrw..or hanging out, not sure what the term would be since that is what I asked him if he wanted to do. I’ve only been on one date in my life, didn’t go well in the end. We ended up having sex on the first date, ruined it all.

New guy comes along, we plan to get tacos tomorrow. Been talking for a month now. There’s obvious interest between us. We went to school together when we were younger but never socialized so this will be the first time we actually see each other.

Today he has been MIA. Not texting at all. Only an hour ago have we started communicating and even now we haven’t talked, he’s busy. We haven’t talked officially since Sunday. Obviously my anxiety was at an all time high. 

“Is he going to ghost me?” 
“Is he going to stand me up?”
“Maybe he isn’t interested anymore?”
“What if he just wants sex in the end and is just lying and saying all these great things to get his way into my pants?” ( he has not once made a sexual comment to me. Some flirting but nothing explicit) 

I need to cut this. I need to also stop going into situations with high expectations. I get a good feeling about him and I know he is interested. When I asked him if we were still on to hang out he replied with “we can” 
Again.. high anxiety. Overthinking over a small sentence. I’ve never had good relationships with the opposite sex, every encounter has ended in disappointment and bitterness. I’ve only dated once in high school, so not much experience there either. I’ve done my fair share of hookups but I’m ready for a serious relationship. 

Any advice on how to overcome this would be greatly appreciated. I have never done this before, not even with my first date.

I'm 19F btw and I want a relationship but I've never had one

Anyway my bf has to...

\- be asexual bc I'm a sex-repulsed asexual and I cannot/will not have sex

\- like hot weather and want to live in the south (i like florida and arizona but i'm not picky) bc I cannot handle temperatures under 80 degrees and I've lived in the north my whole life and it's awful

\- be ok with having guinea pigs, cats, and lizards as pets and not be allergic to any of those animals bc those are the kinds of pets I want. I've always wanted a cat but a lot of family is allergic :(

\- not want a dog bc I've always had an irrational phobia of them which I've been working on my whole life, by now I like them from a distance and can hang out with them sometimes for short periods, but I would not want to live with one and have it always in my house

\- want to travel the world with me bc i want to travel the world and share that experience w my partner

\- be ok with not sharing a room bc I like having my own space. But we can still sleepover in each other's rooms and cuddle and stuff sometimes or even a lot if he wants

\- be a quiet person bc I'm a quiet person and I don't like loudness or talking too much, I want someone I can chill with

\- have similar enough political opinions, doesn't have to be exactly the same and I try to be open minded and learn from the other side but just enough that we're not fighting all the time

\- not want kids bc I don't want kids

\- not do drugs bc drugs are bad for your health (and are expensive) especially the ones you smoke (tobacco/weed) bc 2nd hand smoke (occasional alcohol is fine tho)

\- be sweet and understanding bc I want a man w a nice personality

\- be catholic bc I'm catholic and it's important to me that my partner shares my faith

If you want to go off the dictionary definition, I’m desperate. I want to be in a relationship, and experience that, and love and sex, and emotional intimacy with a woman so very badly but I can’t. No woman has wanted to be with me.

I mainly use apps as I know most women don’t want random guys to talk to them if they’re not attractive. No girl would want an ugly guy to just comes up to her to try to start a conversation. I have been introduced to friends by my girl friends, that always goes badly so it’s just too awkward and embarrassing to keep doing. I use 3 dating apps and I haven’t had any success. The last time I got a match was January. I’m essentially an ncel without the misogyny.

I don’t know how to not be desperate like this. Like, I can’t not be desperate unless someone else wants me. And no one else wants me so I’m stuck being desperate. And I know women don’t like desperate guys, which I can’t fix because women do want me because I’m desperate. It’s a catch-22.

Honestly the weight of being like this feels like it’s too much. I’m a 20 year older kiss less virgin. I’m such a fucking freak. My 15 year older brother has more experience with women than me. It’s so embarrassing and shameful. It honestly makes me want to Kim myself because I know that if I don’t figure this out soon, I’ll have missed learning how to date and no woman advice 23 would want to be with a guy like me.

My friend (34F) is dating a royal jerk and let me tell you, he has no redeeming qualities: he is unhygienic, and has to be negged to shower and wear clean clothes; he has never taken her on a real date, he claims he simply doesn’t want to leave his house; he misrepresented his intentions, says he “isn’t sure if he’s ready” for a relationship despite claiming they were on the same page. He’s made himself unavailable Monday thru Friday, because he’d rather play video games by himself rather than spend time with her. Most recently he got his friend to “dump” her at a party, apparently conversing with the opposite gender means you’re easy. Prior to attending the party, he so graciously reminded her that he hadn’t *actually* asked her out yet. Basically implying, “there will be other women there so I don’t want to be romantically associated with you.” The same friend that performed this betas dirty work has also made my friend uncomfortable on multiple occasions; Mr. Douche Chills won’t confront his creepy ass friend cause “tHaTs hIs OnLy FrIENd” so she’s SOL as far as he’s concerned!

Well I wanted to ask for some dating advice, like how can I start talking to girls. I never really had any experience in flirting in a person, I tried online dating but even then I am having a hard time starting a conversation.

I never go out except for some walking or to meet friends but we never go to partys or bars. So how can I meet new people, I work in a concert house so there is a possibility but even then I would never have time to look for someone special.

I've had relationships with men from all over the planet and mainly care about how our personalities click. All of my LTRs have been with men of different ethnicities (latino, arab, native american etc.). Not because of preference, I just grew up in a very multicultural place.

But over the past couple years I've noticed that I'm mainly attracted to men from a particular race - actually a friend pointed it out to me and now I'm aware of it. This is mostly accidental. My most recent ex is mixed, white passing and changed his name to a white name to avoid racism - I didn't actually know his background until he told me on like our second date. But most of the men I've dated over the past few years have been from this ethnic group.

There are definitely certain physical traits that I prefer which occur frequently in this ethnic group - I love floofy hair, darker skin and thick eyebrows. But these traits occur in basically every race and I am still attracted to people from other ethnicities. 

I just worry that I'm fetishizing when I'm consistently dating men from the same part of the world. I don't think I am though. I like who they are as human beings, and don't view anyone I date as a walking stereotype. Though honestly the accents + sound of that language really does it for me.

I feel like I'm moving on and I'm feeling very well with myself. 

So I met this woman \[26F\] in my work and we started to chat just after I broke up by accident, due work reasons. I started to like her due her way to see things (she is very intelligent, supportive, positive and gorgeous) and, in the last week, I said I like her and that I want to do everything right to get her friendship and to get closer to her. She said I moved too quickly and that this is too quick for her. Some days before, however, I said I got a ""crush"" on her and she said very cool things (like she thinks I'm pretty and cool to talk with and that we should spend more time talking and meeting to know each other). Now I'm feeling guilty and stupid because I moved too quick. 

Basically she asked for space and time. She said she needs time to know me at her own pace (that is very slow, according to her). We talked later that day and things seemed ok. But in that weekend she asked for space (we didn't talk for 3 days) and, during the work, we talk for 10 minutes without text messages during the night (the conversations are fluid and pleasant). Today we talked again (I asked her to talk for some minutes and grab a coffee with me), she said something like ""I'm distancing to give time to things with calm and we should see this next week"". I said I'm reflecting and trying to move slow as well (during this time I'm always trying to respect her space, just asking questions about her day and how she is feeling). She said ""that's it, perfect"". 

My question is: did I screw up everything? Is she trying to get me out of her life or I still got a chance with her, just need to respect her time? What should I do now?

He and I had more of an ebb and flow connection. It was never official or “serious,” but there was definitely potential. I felt like we were both at weird stages in our lives when we first met.

In 2019 he un-added me from Instagram, buuut in all fairness I unfriended him first on Facebook, then later Instagram because I was moving on with a serious relationship at the time, and my partner at the time were both cleaning our following lists (not the best move.)

After I thought I un-added everyone I had to un-add, turns out he and I are still Snapchat friends.

I can’t remember how we left off on the conversation, but apparently he sent the last message to me.

My therapist keeps telling me it’s all in my head but it’s hard to see that when reality is telling me differently. I’m 19M gay and hardly anyone is interested in me. I message guys at my school in my age range I get ignored, I hit up guys around my area in my age range, I also get ignored. Most guys that hit me up usually are 2-3x my age, overweight, and not really attractive to me. I don’t think I have high standards. I lost a lot of weight over quarantine and I’m continuing to bulk and tone this summer so I prefer a guy with similar toned/slim/muscular build as me. I don’t care about hair color or eyes, or height really as long as he’s not shorter than me. And I came from a pretty wealthy family so it would be nice to be with someone similar or have goals. I just like a guy that’s attractive and fit like me that’s kind, ambitious, and funny. 

Yet I keep attracting the opposite of what I like. I talked about this before on a different sub and they all said I had high standards and should lower them if I want to be with someone. But as someone that’s young, fit, and attractive, is wrong not to want the same thing in someone else? Nonetheless, I feel like there is something wrong with me if so many guys in my area are ignoring me on Grindr or aren’t matching with me on tinder. I’ve definitely compared my experience to my white gay friends and they don’t have the same issues. While they complain about guys or being single, the guys they go on dates with or hookup with ignored me, like pretty much everyone of them they’ve been with. And they all follow each other on Instagram too, I feel like there’s this exclusive gay network and you have to be white to be apart of it, frustrating. 

Anyways, I just want to know what’s wrong with me. Either I get ignored, told “sorry not my type,” or blocked (which is rare). And I feel like I can’t do anything else besides getting work done to my face yet (but even doctors I consulted with told me I was already pretty good looking and the work I want done would give minimal results :/ ). I’m focused on continuing to improve my body but I take really good care of my skin, teeth, and hair. I expect perfection in myself. But all of this is just for me to get ignored? I feel like I wasted time improving myself if guys still don’t like me. I hate to blame it on race because not everything is about race and I’m pretty lightskinned, but I can’t help notice how different my white peers have it vs me. Guys will have “looking for fit/slim/twink/twunk,” but will still tell me “sorry not my type.” I guess only white gays can be twinks idk. When I changed my tinder location to Europe and different cities  I matched with a couple models and very attractive guys I like, but back in the Midwest it’s just crickets.

If I want to text with him, I have to initiate every time and he is the one who ends the convo (eg “going to bed now, have a good night”).

I’m trying to rein in the insecurity, but it’s making me feel like shit that he never initiates texting and tbh after not speaking to him for a full week, my interest starts to wane, only to be rekindled again when I see him in person. 

At this stage would it be too clingy for me to address the lack of texting? Say something like “Hey, I don’t feel like it’s enough to only interact with each other on the weekends. I would love to see each other more frequently or even just hear more from you via text during the week”?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,825603,public,self,Fighting the urge to be clingy and desperate.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvinw7/fighting_the_urge_to_be_clingy_and_desperate/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

She's a party from the start. I'm not so much that, I can but not every weekend. 

So she calls me almost everyday. She even called me while she was drunk at 2am She updated her profile on hinge, I expected that. So did I. There's one thing though that I am really confused and need advice on.

But recently I had a discussion with my girlfriend about our relationship and I expressed that I feel like she doesn’t call/text me first or I’m the one putting in all the effort or she never asks me to hang out, I always make the plans it seems.

She pretty much said she doesn’t call or ask me to hang because “she’s afraid of bothering me” or she thinks I’m busy and doesn’t want to annoy me.

I got kind of frustrated because I’ve told her before how I love her and want to hear from here anytime of the day, and how she never can bother me. So that just seems like either an excuse or a weird coping mechanism to me.

And then from there I just asked her how she feels about me, her thoughts on our relationship, etc. but she literally shuts down. She can’t even try to express any thoughts or feelings about me/us into words.

I was able to explain what she means to me but for some reason she can’t seem to do that for me. I just want to be intimate/close with her and I thought we were intimate/close at this stage of our relationship.

So this hurt me because all I really want to hear is that she cares about me and all I really want assurance of is that she loves me like I love her.

I want to share things between us, because isn’t that the point of a relationship anyways?

Since we had that conversation it just feels like she became less engaged in talking to me and less interested in maintaining our relationship... so maybe this conversation made things worse or maybe she’s just having a bad week or something?

As of right now, I’m pretty emotionally hurt by all this and have thought this may be a sign to break up with her but I’m trying to find reasons to stay even though she hurt me bad.

New redditor here and first time poster. 

I (21F) met my ex partner when I was 15 years old and we were together until I was 18. Because of complicated family circumstances, we moved in together very young. As such, our relationship was very serious and “adult,” despite our age. We mutually decided to end things after I graduated high school because we were on different paths. I was about to start college on a full ride. He had dropped out of high school and got his GED and experienced a fluctuation in motivation. We agreed it wasn’t fair for either of us— but especially me— to have to support each other through a new, uncharted chapter. 

Despite ending the relationship, we still stayed in contact with one another because we considered each other family. This really came to a head in early 2020 when we really got honest about our relationship and mutually apologized for all of our shortcomings. We agreed we would also love and root for each other and that neither of us regretted the relationship. After this, we’d check in every few months to make sure the other was doing well. 

A few months ago, I got a call from his mom that he had passed away in his sleep. Because he had had COVID, he was not granted an autopsy. We do not know how he died. 

This entire thing has stirred up a whole mess of feelings in me. I am devastated for his family and the loss of potential. Selfishly, I am also devastated that I no longer have someone out there who, to this day, loved me endlessly. Besides my mom’s, his phone number is the only one I’d remember in an emergency. He was one of only a few people who would support me no matter what. Additionally, despite the fact that we broke up almost 3 years ago, I feel immense guilt when I think about dating someone else. I’ve played the tinder game while in college, but now whenever I go on it, I feel as if I’m being disloyal to my ex. Hoping this will pass with time, as all things do.

Was at dinner with a group of friends. There was 6 of us -a couple, a brother and sister and then me and this other girl. At the end of dinner we had the waiter split the check and he split it 3 ways so that all checks were even (not organized by order).

This girl (who was sitting across from me then joked that the waiter must think me and her are together).  Then she said “cheers boyfriend”.  A few minutes later when talking about my life plans with the group and a decision I had made(dropping out of grad school). She said “damn I wanted to marry rich”.

I’m not sure if she is teasing me and friendzoning me or if she has interest. We don’t know each other that well and just met a couple weeks ago. Although we have hung out a few times now as part of the same social group.
