I have a main account with a decent amount of Karma for someone who generally lurks.

###However, I am somewhat “new” to posting on various dating subreddits.

A few years ago, I posted a couple of times and received a middling amount of upvotes, but a fair number of messages.

With this new account, I’ve posted 6 or 7 times and my posts are generally downvoted to zero votes within 10-20minutes. No hyperbole.

Either there is an uncanny coincidence of people objectively not liking my post within a short timeframe, or someone(s) are actively taking it upon themselves to downvote me.

If it were just me, I might consider not bothering to post here and move on or try again. But I have more than once, been scrolling through some odd hundred different personals ads, and seen several, sometimes a dozen consecutive M4F posts downvoted to zero votes.

####A coincidence? I think not. 

I am not a female so have no knowledge of their behavior, but based on my observations of men, if I had to guess, I would come to the conclusion that for WHATEVER REASON, at the expense of the health of dating subreddits, men do the following:

* Upvote women’s posts to fandom levels

* Downvote men’s posts to oblivion

* Spam women’s inboxes with low effort messages and **** pics  

^(Obviously this is a generalization and doesn’t apply to all men)

###As others have pointed out in various [meta] posts, this compromises the health and success of such subreddits in a few ways:

1. giving women a headache of “popularity” and unwanted attention and discouraging them from searching for themselves or looking at men who make decent posts

2. making it extremely difficult for men who post to have any visibility or traffic

3. making it very difficult for men to send decent messages to women and NOT get drowned out in the sea that is their inbox 

4. women becoming jaded toward the general male population on the internet/dating community, altering standards, expectations, and likely creating insecurities and other problems  



##People of Reddit and /r/dating, I wonder if I am alone or not in these findings. What do you think?

Secondarily, I am very open to the possibility that I’m missing something, I’ve been wrong on more than one occasion.

&amp;#x200B;

I got me thinking because lately I've realized that ALL guys that were romantically interested in me after I graduated high school were lawyers/went to law school and are lawyers in the making. Actually all the guys that were hitting on me in high school also ended up in law school. It wouldn't be suprising at all if I also studied to become a lawyer or at least someone else from the field like judge/prosecutor, but I'm in med school intending to become a doctor one day. I also don't have any lawyers in my family or my friend circle. I met those guys rather randomly: in high school, through mutual friends, at a bar/club or on a dating app. They all turned out to be lawyers.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is that? The only thing I seem to have in common with them is that I'm really into politics and I'm open about it. I often talk about political topics and post articles or stuff on my social media. But it's more towards economy than legislation so I don't know if it makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have anything against lawyers, but I just don't see them as life partners. They often appear to me as cocky and argumentative (and since I am too, it just pisses me off in a relationship). And I know there are prenups and shit, but one day I'd love to start my own business ventures and know I would be afraid to trust my lawyer man/hubby with whole paper work. Long story short: I'd be afraid they'd trick me into something. I don't know, I feel like I could never trust a man like that in 100%.

we’re been dating for 9 months now and i feel like he doesn’t trust me with other people whatsoever. i have these two friends who are male and are relatively close to me and we’re all buddy buddy no romantic feelings involved at all. i understand 1000% that he’d be cautious of me having guy friends and i do not talk with them everyday or leave him to call them or hangout with them etc, he’s my priority. i only hangout with one of them and i’m never alone its always me him and a childhood friend because he moved away and we barely see eachother once every two months. we were close before i started dating my boyfriend btw. so basically my boyfriend will always say “oh ur gonna leave me for them” or “he texts u like all the time” which let me say, one of them has been texting me a lot more recently but only because we talk about fnaf lore since security breach came out LMFAO. he always extremely over exaggerates saying we text all day everyday which is completely untrue and its a little annoying when nothing i say is heard. he makes up things and then doesnt listen to me. one of them edates a lot and has clearly stated he has no romantic feelings for me. the other also has stated he has no romantic feelings for me at all, and has many feb and relationships. they are both aware of my relationship and have no intentions of intervening. i have told my bf multiple times that they are just friends that i’ve had for a while (one years before him)and he always says theyre only talking to me because they want to be with me which sucks and is so annoying because its untrue. its not like i’m talking to 100 guys everyday, i just have these two friends who are literally just friends. he believes that friendliness = infatuation and its just too much sometimes. he wants me to be completely isolated from everyone and gets really irritated when i talk to people. i dont even know what to say to him anymore because its like i love you but you need to understand that i have friends too. 

he thinks that anyone of the opposite sex immediately likes me and it hurts tbh. i dont know what to do, i dont know how to make him less.. obsessive? thats a harsh word but i mean taking a step back its really too much. girls are allowed to have simple basic friendship with guys without it being romantic at all. its just two people who are friends. i’m openly pansexual to him and i talk to a bunch of girls and non gender conforming people. why is it so different that i have two guy friends?why is it so hard to understand that theyre just friends? he’s a year younger than me so maybe hes just not as mature but one year shouldnt make THAT much of a difference… 

i have ABSOLUTELY no feelings for the two at all. he says he believes that and trusts me but doesnt trust them which i get but he takes it way too far. 

i talk to them both a couple times a week. what is so wrong with having friends? why does their sex determine so much :(

I've known my friend for almost 3 years now, but we met in person for the first-time last week and have been together every day since they were vacationing at my place. We met online over an online game and over time we grew to be good friends. And, yes, we've video called plenty of times before now. I didn't really think of it at first but something about seeing them in person and realizing how similar we are really sent my heart a flutter. They often joke about their lover tendencies and it showed so much. Music is their language and being polite is their nature. And it's **so** dreamy. They are a really sweet person and I appreciate them completely. I couldn't help laughing and smiling really hard around them because every second was absolutely great with them and it felt like it was mutual. They left today to go back home and I feel a bit sad and empty.

*Nothing sexually happened between us, but* ***GOD*** *I had a deep urge to kiss them when I was sending them off. (I didn't.)* We just hugged for a long time three times and talked a bit. I had to break myself from falling into a deep conversation because it is that easy for us to ... It hasn't been an hour yet and I miss their presence. They said they would call me on their way since the drive is over 6 hours and I feel that I'm like a puppy waiting at the door.

I'm not in a rush to say anything to them just yet but I'm really nervous about my feelings because I don't want to dive into my emotions and possibly loose such a great friend if the feeling isn't mutual. Cupid hit me in my skull and I'm wondering whether I should pull out the arrow or be brave (eventually).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1149969,public,self,Friend Crush ...

Put simply, like most human behavior, our experiences make the difference.

Asking for your help here. 
I (F, 24) have really been into one of my colleague (M, 24) for a couple months and I am analyzing everything instead of making a move… I need your help!! 
I have the gut feeling that he likes me but I would like some feedback. 

Here are good signs : 
- he initiates eye contact pretty often 
- he tries to get to know me and is smiling a lot/laughing/making jokes when we’re together 
- he can also talk about personal stuff when we’re just the 2 of us. Once he even showed me ALL the pictures on his phone for an hour long, telling me stories about his friends, his family etc
- he sometimes make comments such as « oh you didn’t make any comment on my shirt today » (I tend to compliment people a lot and he knows it) 
- he started to initiate contact on social media, texting me after work  but keeping it short and sweet (asking questions or sending me funny stuff) 
- he seems to be really curious about me. Even if we’re with other colleagues, he would ask generic questions to everyone but await for my answers, looking at me and asking back until I answer
- he compliments me in a weird/indirect manner (he saw a pic of my sister, told me that we look just the same and that she’s super pretty…)  
- He once brought a female « friend » to one of our party and we spent the whole party just the 3 of us, but we only talked him &amp; I, and he texted me after leaving the party telling me that her friend thought I was really nice. He then texted me the day after to have my opinion on a subject we had the night before 
- he once came to my place with other colleagues and he looked everywhere and was really curious! He made compliments about my flat and emphasized on the fact that we live really close

But some of his actions unfortunately make me doubt! 
- I initiate contact more than he does 
- He sometimes doesn’t text back/doesnt try to start a new topic by text msg
- he can me more distant at times. We can spend 4 days at work doing everything together and then have almost no contact for a couple days
- We aren’t really touchy, he doesnt really initiate physical touch
- I invited him twice (once for an activity and the other one for a drink), he wasnt in town both times, but he didnt invite me back or proposed another day


I am obv more invested than he is but sometimes I feel like he might be too shy to make a move ?? 
I feel that people see me as a pretty confident girl with a strong, direct personality and I don’t know if that scares him or if I should just give up lol.

So I started talking to this girl on hinge a week and a half ago. I feel that the conversations we’ve had were pretty normal and good.

I put quotes there because I’ve had a couple girls in the past give the same excuse because they just didn’t want to go. But my question is do y’all think I might have done something?

I told her I had a good time and let’s do it again soon. Never replied. She said prior to meeting and on our date that’s she’s not on her phone much and horrible at responding to people. Do I just chalk this up to her not being interested and gave me her number to be nice? Or do I wait a little while longer and text her to definitely ask her if she’d like to go on a second date?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1150039,public,self,Worth it to ask for a second date?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rynpgw/worth_it_to_ask_for_a_second_date/,no_ads,0,,,

And we seem to be forming some deep connection (at least i think so). 

Initially, I just wanted started talking to her to have long term friendship which I stated to her at the beginning. She told me she was looking for a long term relationship /friendship. So we just started talking getting to know eachother (at this point we don't know what each of us looks like etc) and she wanted to connect more inwardly first rather than by physical appearance. We really communicated happily and talked about goals, relationship etc etc  it really was a heart to heart chat. After talking for a couple weeks, she sends me her picture and also ask me to send her my picture. She is the most gorgeous person I've seen, and I just feel like a potato and feel pretty insecure about my appearance. She also jokingly asked me my height/weight. And as a short dude I tell her 'around' 5'7 (I actually don't know my height but it's probably closer to 5'5)  because I'm quite insecure about it (probably my biggest insecurity). She is 5'6. Which means I'm like an inch shorter. Also, she is extremely wealthy and smart and actually been helping me earn money through investment. Now I feel so damn inadequate as a man. 

Anyways we just keep talking, and i emotionally feel so connected with her, and now want it to be more than just friendship. But I can't stop thinking about my appearance. I want to express my true feelings and meet her but my insecurities are holding me back. Also, I would feel so selfish if i ask her to be my gf since she is infinitely times out of my league. But again, I don't want to be just friends with her anymore; it would break my heart. So I'm getting anxiety thinking that she likes me (my personality) but then when she sees me, she might get disgusted. So I am not sure what to do at this point.

LONG POST. Back story: I’ve had an extremely hard past one month, both physically and emotionally. At the start of last month became very physically and mentally unwell in a matter of days, lost all my appetite, barely ate anything a day for about 1.5 weeks and lost 6kgs in a week. Had heart palpitations, weakness, etc. too and developed a constant dizziness that is, although my appetite is mostly at least back, still stuck with me and doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. Been to multiple ERs and was finally admitted to a hospital for a week where they gave IV and tried to figure out what’s wrong, unfortunately mostly couldn’t and ended up getting discharged still not too well. 

Well, I was discharged from hospital a day before Christmas Eve and on the next day my family was booked in (me included) to fly for a week’s holiday interstate for some intense hiking. On the other hand, my boyfriend of 8 months has also had a trip scheduled to the same state but completely different places, and since I was unwell and his trip was to be a bit more chilled just visiting friends and family, and we didn’t want me to stay home alone for 8 days, he invited me to go along on the trip with him and his 8 year old son (met him before briefly). I was scared since still so lightheaded and weak everything was a huge effort, plus the whole situation, but I was also sooo excited  to be with him for 2 weeks straight and create memories with him, this was our first holiday together ever. 

Well. Mostly it has been amazing.. we drove 17 hours a day and lots of road trips, hanging out with him and his son at his house for a few days before we drove up interstate, going shopping, shooting basketball, visiting family, him and I started watching a series together every night, and each night I had some alone time with him to look forward to... and just lots of chilling, laughter together. Although dizzy still every day, had a great great time. It was out of a dream. Feel like I’ve gotten to love him so much more and developed some kind of bond with his son.

The last few days of the trip were a bit weird and, well, in lot of ways uncomfortable. Well firstly, those who know me I’m a massive introvert, only comfortable socialising and being myself with people I know really well, otherwise with strangers I can be quiet, very shy and come off as straight up antisocial. Well we stayed at lots of different of his friends and family and I must admit I wasn’t too social, when they were in the room talking and chatting loud I rarely managed to come out and engage for long, just the way I am with people I don’t know well. I tried to force myself to for his sake but I just couldn’t. I felt awkward because of this lots of times and tried my best, and what HAS bothered me a bit is that he’s always tried to kind of push me to socialise and commented hinted on how I don’t talk to people and why I stay in the room for so long. In turn it has made me think that he’s disappointed in me because yeah people learn a lot about each other during a holiday and maybe he lost interest in me because of this ? Like I sure seemed like some big antisocial weirdo. I did talk to his friends here and there though quality over quantity. But I always couldn’t wait for our time together at the end of the day, the highlight of the day.

Then if this wasn’t enough, there’s this married  couple who have been his bestest friends since childhood apparently who we also visited, they have two very young kids, I found out before we got there that he and the woman used to date back in the day when they were teenagers and inside I immediately heated up, even before I found this out the way they talked on the car loudspeaker together made me uncomfortable, calling each other darling/honey, “love you”, blowing each other kisses.. we spent NEW YEARS EVE with them and the woman (who’s just two years younger than him) got high and a little drunk and got too touchy with him for my liking, even walked up to him and kissed the top of his head right in front of me and her husband (who is his absolute best friend), and seemed kinda flirty. Then my boyfriend is like to me multiple times that night: “Isn’t ....(name) so cute?” when she was dancing high and singing and he just seemed to stare at her laughing and like with adoration. I think from that night he could tell I was jealous, because I can’t really hide my feelings well on my face and I always could just nod and keep smiling in agony. But we didn’t bring it up cause obviously the holiday and stuff plus they’re his best friends and I didn’t want to make drama. THEN, I found out on the way back home from the holiday that we would be going to their house to stay with them for two nights and days! You can imagine:) well as I thought, it was a super hard and uncomfortable two days. He LOVED it though, was beyond excited to stay with them and see their kids cause they actually met through him and he says their bond is so strong like family. I’m already introverted around strangers (need a lot of time to warm up to someone and get to know them) then add into that some jealousy too.. ugh. So the day we spent with them, listen to my luck, the husband was away at work and so it was only me, my boyfriend and the woman at home for a day plus the kids. Uhh, awkward?? I ended up hanging with the kids mostly while he hung with her mostly the whole day, helped her cook, look after the kids, helped her with everything, listened to them chat all day, while they both knew perfectly well I was around, then we went down to the beach, she was a car in front of us and he called her for a brief chat from our car, then at the beach they went into the water with the kids and I was swimming around them trying to enjoy the water at least.. but I felt absolutely miserable the whole day. I think he could tell, yet he just hung around her. Got out of the water to chat  to her with a baby in her arms. Literally looked like they were the couple and I was a third wheel or a babysitter. When we walked back to the car they walked in front and I was walking with the kids behind them. He still called me honey and babe and talked to me briefly at times though. But I don’t know if he was just very exhausted, or/and that he had a 13 hour drive in front of us, or I don’t know, but the past two days he wasn’t very affectionate towards me, us two barely talked, and then last night for the first time ever since we’ve been together, he just came in, lay down and went straight to bed without getting intimate. I know how much he loves getting intimate, he never skips a day if we get the chance. We did have a long drive ahead of us but nevertheless. With his other behaviour. He just rolled over and went to sleep, no cuddles no kisses even. And that knowing we only had like 2 or 3 nights together left on the holiday for us, he gave that up. I fell asleep kinda crying a little cause I felt hurt by his sudden lack of love and that whole day was kinda a lot emotionally and in every wa dealing with the constant dizziness and stuff.
Today, we drove the 13 hours home and I’ve had this sort of fear for days, that maybe because he’s found out on the holiday that I’m introverted, antisocial plus all that stuff with that woman, that I won’t hear from him again after we get back. 

Despite these past events, the two weeks together have been amazing and I want it back so bad. I had him with me all the time for two weeks and now I just feel very lonely. It feels like it was just a dream and I miss him so damn much that I felt pretty much incapacitated for about 2 hours after I got home. Will take a few days to find my feet or maybe longer. Now add to that also the fact that what if he’s been planning to just ghost me or break up with me after we got back from the holiday? Few days ago we mentioned me sleeping over at his place for the night when we get back so that I can just go home the next morning. But today he said he can drop me off tonight actually and did so, even though I really wanted to spend another night with him but I think he may have just wanted to get a really good sleep after the marathon drive? Had instances during the holiday where we woke each other tossing and turning at night. We did get closer on the drive today and he said he’ll “talk to me soon” and kissed me. I know he’s exhausted but what if he just said that and he won’t. I mean he did see some more, quite problematic sides of me that weren’t too attractive at all",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1150040,public,self,Help,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rynuxq/help/,no_ads,0,,,

One of the things we both like are the colors of sunsets so we like to share pictures of the sunset from our sides of the world with each other. She's also told me before that she thinks it's cute when I try to talk to her in German, and that I've made her blush several times.

About a week or so ago I ""tested the water"" so to speak, by flirting with her when I sent a picture I took of the sunset by saying, ""A beautiful picture for an equally beautiful girl..~~I'd say that in German if I knew how~~"", and her response was ""Hehe, wanna know how?"". She then proceeded to show me how to say the phrase in her language. 

The next day (December 24th) she gave me a drawing that she made for me as a Christmas gift.

Skipping a head to New Years Eve I took a picture of the sunset and wrote ""Happy New Years From America!"" on it, and sent it for her and her family. 

A little bit afterwards she said, ""Just saying, meeting you was one of the best things to happen to me in 2021."". Somewhat at a loss for words I said, ""That means a lot to me.""

**Here's the part that's actually relevant to the title:** 

 I've found myself falling for this girl, but I'm not sure if she shares any of those feelings. She used to go out of her way to greet me with ""Good morning"" or ""Guten Morgen"", but just stopped doing it out of nowhere a while back. 

Sometimes she'll also take a while to respond to a message, like a few hours, but I'd see her pop on for a bit and go back offline shortly after in between, which I assume is her talking to other online friends. I don't overtext, and once the ""ball is in her court"" I wait for her to respond, but I'm just confused...

The logical part of my brain says, ""If she wasn't interested in you, as friends or otherwise she wouldn't be talking to you.""

The pessimistic part of me says, ""Well if she was interested in you, she'd find time to respond sooner wouldn't she?"". 

Am I overanalyzing the entire situtation? Does she just like me as a friend, or could it be a bit more than that (however small)?

I have always moved fast with previous partners. Typically spending everyday with them until we move in, but my two relationships have lasted 3 and 4 years. 

I was looking on tinder and ended up matching with an old flame from freshman year of high school. He lives in Houston and I live in dallas. We grew up next door to eachother and our families still live there in dallas. 

We ended up talking for a month and he came to Dallas for Christmas. The night we met he spent the night and stayed over for 23 nights in a row. We met eachothers family multiple times. Spent Christmas with both families + new years. We met eachothers friends and communicate daily. I have total trust in him. 
We would move in together but he's finishing law school and I'm finishing my degree. We have a plan to move in once he graduates in a year and we will visit eachother every week or two (we live 3 hours apart). 
I'm afraid it won't work, but doesn't have any reason not to. We are perfectly compatible in every way. Phone sex is a daily fun activity and we both have planned visiting times. He also comes to Dallas for weeks over holidays and breaks. 

Any advice on how to make the most out of this relationship. We are very serious about making it work, but I don't want to waste my time. I might just be pessimistic. I do believe it will work, but I have no idea what issues will arise since I've never been in an LDR.

I really love her and so does she and we spend a lot of time together, she sleeps at my place for multiple days and i go sleep at hers and we're really happy together with minor arguments about outside stuff and not about us or eachother so i feel really safe around her and i wanna grow our relationship. We met in November on a dating site and went the extra step in December and ever since we either live together or talk on the phone.

Before meeting her i had a fwb which i stopped seeing even though she told me i shouldn't but i respected my feelings for her and honestly lost interest in anything else but her. She broke up in august with her ex of 2.5 years and  she seems really happy that she left him and even though he is clinging on her she told me that she couldn't care less and she even went out with another guy before meeting me and she didn't feel happy around him and she broke up with him around the time we met.
Things are moving fast between us and we both acknowledged it but we both feel really happy around eachother. I've been in a lot of relationships before and so did she but we agreed to stay as special friends.
She doesn't mind if i am sleeping with other girls but she told me that she'd be sad about it but she also told me that she doesn't want to sleep with other boys and i don't want to sleep with other girls either.

I'm the jealous type, and more than 3 boys talk to her who actually love her on a daily basis and I usually would be crazy about it but i trust her enough to not mind it at all, and it's making me question my sanity because it's a big step for me.

The problem is she is leaving in august for Erasmus and before that she has a uni trip of two weeks to another country and she will try to go on vacation also to another country where she had another situationship with a guy after she broke up with her ex.
She told me that the main reason she doesn't want us to date is because she wants to be free when she travels, she doesn't want someone to hold her down, she told me that she doesn't have in mind sleeping with someone else but she is not sure if she will end up doing it.
Her trips are a bit far but with everyday I'm spending with her I'm getting attached more and more and honestly i don't know what i can do.

I need her now in my life, not only because i am challenging my biggest change in my life (international student) but also because I'm the happiest when she is around.
She is also out my league but doesn't make me feel like this and according to her she was satisfied the most with me and i feel like she is.

I have been writing to myself lately and I am not completely sure why? I am lost and there are a few things I know I could do to better myself but getting to that point is always a struggle. I got on here to just put my thoughts down where maybe someone could see them. I guess I don't know who or if anyone will actually see this but at least it is out there. It all started when I was about 20 years old... I was in love with this girl her name was Katelyn, she was my high school sweetheart and we were a month away from getting married when I found out that she was cheating on me... that ended the wedding and started a downward spiral that I have been stuck in ever since. I am not sure how I can even get out of this whirlwind of disaster. I was so young and naive when she had cheated on me and it opened my eyes to a world of chaos. Where everywhere I look someone is doing something that isn't morally right, or innocent. There is so much chaos in the world and I feel like I am contributing to it. But after she cheated on me I haven't been able to find love, most likely because I don't love myself never have and never will. But, I find myself entangling myself into messy situations. I once was loved by this girl, her name was Taylor... and it wasn't perfect but she would of done anything for me and you know what I did... living with her for 2 years, I decided that I wasn't happy anymore so instead of just leaving I started cheating. For another 2 year I cheated on the girl who care about me the most. Someone who gave up everything to be with me. And I didn't choose her because I was stuck in the past and didn't know how to let the love I had for Katelyn go so I ruined 5 years of this girls life for me to be alone. If I would of just sat down and really thought about what I had I would of never left. I would of stayed with her forever because she was the best thing in the world. And I will forever regret this day, the day I left her for someone who didn't even give 2 shits about me.... after that moment I have ran into relationships that don't last because honestly I don't love myself... and that's probably the reason nobody stays now. And now I am faced with another decision... a decision where this girl cares about me alot and is perfect in every single way. But I just don't care about her the same way she cares about me. She is literally everything I have wanted and more but I am just not attracted to her as much as other people. And I feel like if I go down this path then I would either be settling and or end up hurting this girl in the long run. And all I want is to look at her and feel everything I have felt. The love, desire, that moment that you know she is the one for you. For now and and forever I want to feel that. And I don't... but I also think that you can develop feelings for people after awhile.

Then he mentioned how he doesn’t think he’s attractive so how the hell do I think he’s handsome (this guy is very classically attractive). 
So I say “There were 3 girls we both knew that had a crush on you.” 
Take a wild guess who one of them was. This girl right here. 
Anyway, we joke around and everything is normal, he doesn’t react negatively or anything. He makes the old “we would have been a power couple” but that’s it - he’s a little emotionally unavailable and neutral kinda guy. He also kept mentioning how he was immature and clueless (he really was, three girls having a crush on him and this man watched football highlights in history class) 
Fast forward to tonight, he’s out drinking (we’re both at university quite far away from each other) and he posts a photo of him and two girls. 
I say something along the lines of “you’re getting girls let’s gooo” You know, how friends do. 
He replies with “No!!” and “It could be you!!” He’s clearly drunk. 
What do I do? He wants to hang out because we haven’t seen each other for almost 2 years and we used to see each other almost everyday.

Im just an average guy with average, “equipment”. I’m a virgin but I highly doubt I’ll be one of those guys who is super talented in bed and can give mind blowing sex. I know that’s just not going to be me.

The only solace is that 90% of guys are also not that and a lot of that 90% won’t even take the time to try to learn.

If I’m with a girl with a low body count, chances are she hasn’t had anything better that what I could do.
