I have a real problem with talking to girls that I find attractive. So like the thing is almost never try to initiate conversations with girls because i always under the assumption they don't like me automatically/ i get too scared that ill end up embarrassing myself so i never try initiating conversation (im fat, 190cm, 125kg). I get scared of what ill say and i get too scared, ive probably never talked to a girl one-on-one before.

We went to school together for 9 years. After we graduated, we still went out with our group (2girls, 6 boys) for like a year or so. We had no problems between us, we used to chill at my place etc. After falling and breaking my leg, i decided not to go out with them until my leg had healed completely. I had cast on leg for month and couldnt walk without crutch for another month.

One boy kicked me and another guy from the groupchat we were in. After that i havent talked with that girl and and another 3 boys since 2017 july. Recently i started seeing that girl in large store working as cashier and i just cannot get her out of my head. I keep thinking about her, but im afraid to do anything

What should i do to get her out of my head? I mean she obiviously is cute, not gonna lie. But im sure a boy like me would have no chance with her.

She shouldnt have a boyfriend either, because the one she had, is now dating her best friend. She also removed pictures and tags of him.

I was so nervous I wouldn't find anyone to date as my own relationship was sexless and I was looking for a hook up. I found a nice guy on tinder who is okay with a friends with benefits situation. He was a very generous and sensitive lover which made me feel like I hit the jackpot because a lot of guys just go straight to pound town. He's nice, normal, attractive, decent job, and respectful. Couldn't ask for more in a f w/b. 
   Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, I noticed this girl at work was so cute but I'm terrible and flirting with girls. By a miracle she asked me out to dinner this week and last night we came back to my place and fooled around. It was her first lesbian experience and my fourth. So now I've lucked out to have a cute guy and a beautiful woman in my life who both want what I want. Not sure if I believe in God but he's definitely made this transition into being alone WAY EASIER. It feels awesome to be intimate with people who are kind and respectful.

My plan is to start my own practice and eventually do a no-bullshit self-help organization and write fiction books, create podcasts, etc.

I would say my looks are average. I have a decent physique, but nothing special. As someone who is just starting graduate school, I don‚Äôt have a lot of money. I can get along with almost anyone, but am rather shy about my personal life, especially when it comes to friends and romance. 

People that know me would describe me as kind, responsible, a good listener, hard working, calm. I am also a virgin. I do not know how to ask for or initiate sex, how to seduce someone, etc. To be honest, I have always been very intimidated by the idea. I have no idea why.

What I am getting at with this thread is that the sense I am getting from reading these threads is that I have to get everything absolutely right in order to be considered attractive looks, money, confidence, including initiating sex and showing desire.

13,ovalox,1627750262,Is it unattractive that I (20M) live at home with parents and commute to school for a reason?,"

20M in college, my parents and I live in a suburb about 20 min north of my college campus. I lived on campus my first year in a dorm, great experience, met lots of people. However, now ive been living with my parents and commuting for a few years now, and it‚Äôs mainly for a few reasons:


1. I have very high aspirations for my future after college, I want to work for a company in a big city, get a job in the field I love, while I also get my masters part time while working (company would sponsor). I want to get out of the midwest. I have a job that I have been working for during this summer and my lab scientist told me I can work throughout the school year part time. So I can make money while taking classes. while I could afford an apartment with friends and go to bars and house parties, I really would hate for my paycheck to just be going to rent, when I live 20 min away and could drive down to meet friends and hangout, so I want to save that money


2. Sure, I‚Äôm not ‚Äúin the college scene‚Äù, but I have in person classes, have season tickets for football, and I‚Äôm planning on joining clubs to be more involved on in campus related activities. My day is just, leaving in the morning, being on campus all day, coming home at 7 for dinner and repeat. And yeah sure, I guess I can‚Äôt go down and party on weekends, but I see that as something that would hold me back if I overindulge (I would binge drink and smoke so much weed my freshman year on campus, like every weekend). Even thought being at home sucks, I‚Äôm saving money, focused on myself and not succumbing to things I would be distracted from, while also getting the benefits of being on campus and being engaged with on campus activities.



3. Party life is cool, but I know if I take part in it too much I will be offset from my goals. I found myself first year really just having FOMO if I wasn‚Äôt at a bar or party on the weekend and doing work, I almost like had to not be sober because it was ‚Äúcool‚Äù to do that stuff to be social. When I live 20M away I don‚Äôt even have that thought. If I lived with friends I really think I‚Äôd be distracted, the apartments down there are also just a rip off for how much you pay. My campus is near the city, so there‚Äôs high crime rates in off campus housing, and the area is a bit rundown. Not the best investment for the college experience, especially when your at the risk of getting pepper sprayed or robbed on any given night coming back from classes.

I talked to my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù about this and they were saying how I look ‚Äúweak‚Äù and ‚Äúunattractive‚Äù because I‚Äôm a 20M living at home, and that if I did meet a girl she would be turned off at the fact that I commute to campus. I honestly didn‚Äôt believe them and thought it was a load of bullshit because no one actually thinks like that.

I have a friend around my age, and she's really really shy, but I'm as chirpy as they come, and can hold conversations well so that wasn't a problem, one day she randomly asked to hig me and we did.. and well one thing led to another and we ended up hooking up. 

This went on for quite some time.. until one day while we were err... Together.. and she said she loved me. I felt it was too early and wasn't sure of my feelings.. so I didn't say it back.

This happened I think 2-3 times, my smooth brain chalked it up as heat of the moment thing. Eventually we stopped hooking up , cause she said It feels too emotional after for her..
Fair enough.

Now it's not like I didn't have feelings for her, but I wanted to confess In a better way (hopeless romantic that way), so I tried to know what she really wanted..
So I asked directly.. do you want me to be with me ? She sorta froze and replied... 'Idk what do you want?'

Well I wanted to tell her about my feelings..but before I could, she started giving me the cold shoulder.. stopped initiating conversations as well.

I tried talking to her and asking what happened, as usual no proper response.. and because it started to feel one sided.. although her replies were always instantaneous, I backed off.
I take is seriously, if I feel a girl has no interest, don't want to overstep my boundaries or chase someone or make em feel uncomfortable.

As a result, didn't even wish her on her birthday, we r still added on social media, haven't blocked or anything just don't talk.

BUT.. she wished me on mine.. and she randomly still comments on my posts.

My friend set me up with her friend a few weeks ago and we have been talking primarily through text since then. The entire time I have been trying to take her out on a date and for the past couple of weeks I have been attempting to arrange plans to do so. Our schedules don't align most of the time which is why finding a window when we are both available is incredibly difficult.

Once the day and plans were established I continued checking in every now and then to confirm it was happening to which she would always reply yes. All was going great until the day before we were supposed to get together and she told me she only wanted for us to be friends.

I suggested we still get together. Instead, we don't think of it as a date - simply a way for us to get to know each other better. She agreed to it until the next day, a few hours before the get together, when she said she needed to do something with her father.

I keep getting the suspicion that she's afraid of starting anything serious. The friend who set us up told me about how she had a bad experience dating in the past and is worried about things moving too fast in a relationship. Is it possible she's trying to end this before it even starts?

I want to believe she's still interested in being at least friends considering how she said she enjoys our talks and still reaches out to me to this day, but I keep getting the suspicion that she doesn't want us to meet in person despite her always agreeing to make plans to do so. How can I get her to be honest with me? What can I do to make her feel safe with me?

Yes Ive had dates where I took a girl out but couldnt afford our entire bill and she had to pay for her share before she blocked me. But Ive also had dates that had gone smoothly but she doesnt even make an effort to afford her time for a second date. 
 
So after I joined the service I have started going on casual hookups(no correlation) one after another up til recently where i had intimacy with 4 women in the span of less than 10 days. Even one woman I had interest in at first and she did too but I could not even bring myself to commit to her or even make an effort. I simply had no desire and I dont know why; she was a good person with some tropes that can be overlooked/worked on, but I already did not want anything to do with her after our 3rd time being intimate

TLDR: I had intimacy with alot of women over the years and I realize i have no desire to focus on one and Idnt know why.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ovd6yg/can_you_lose_your_ability_to_pair_bond_tldr_at/
40,ovdaf9,1627759441,How to Just Get Oral Sex from a 1st Date?,"I'm a pretty cute, always respectful guy who frequently uses dating apps such as Tinder, etc. There have been numerous occasions where I have brought an unattractive 1st date back to my place, and we are sitting on the couch watching a movie.

I know they are into me, but bc I am unattracted to them, I can't bring myself to have sex with them, or even go as far as making out. However, I would love to get oral sex from these girls (with nothing at all on my end expected in return).

A lot of the girls I bring back say they are really into sex, some into fetishes, etc. but I can never bring myself to just say ""please give me a bj."". Maybe I should just be this forthcoming about it?

I think my main reservation is, as much as I just want oral sex, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. A girl doesn't have to be the smartest lightbulb to understand that if a guy wants a blowjob, but no kissing or sex, that he does not find her attractive. But conversely, there are plenty of girls out there who enjoy making guys happy...., but its still hard and awkard for me to unsubtly just ask for a bj.

So my question is - once I have a 1st date Tinder/Hinge girl on my couch and watching a movie, how can I make a move to get oral sex, with nothing at all expected or implied back on my end?

I recently asked someone out who I‚Äôve known for a little while and had good chemistry with. She let me down very graciously and said she still wanted to be friends. I said that was totally fine. 

I don‚Äôt necessarily plan on hanging out with her in the future, but I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre on friendly terms. It‚Äôa a bit of a shame since she kept hinting that she wanted to do a bunch of things with me and explore the outdoor areas I‚Äôm familiar with. 

That very same night she said no, I went to the bar with my friends. We ended up hopping around and ran into another group of friends. Ironically we ended up at the same club/bar the woman who I asked out goes to a lot.  
 
I had this sense that I was going to see her there and sure enough there she was, with the guy she‚Äôs apparently seeing. It‚Äôs a crowded space so even though she was there, we could have easily missed each other. I do my best to keep it cool and then she *comes up to us* to ‚Äúsay hi.‚Äù She‚Äôs all over her guy while they‚Äôre talking to us and I‚Äôm just thinking about the lack of awareness. I wouldn‚Äôt personally go up to someone I just rejected that same day and say ‚Äúhi‚Äù while I was with the person I‚Äôm seeing. 

I don‚Äôt know, it just felt like it was being rubbed into my face. I was cordial and they left shortly after. Kind of ruined my night but it was ok, I just end up dealing with things like that so much that it genuinely feels like I‚Äôm being trolled. Anyone else?

42,ovdn8f,1627760646,This close to giving up...,"27F here. Not sure if I am venting or asking for advice or both. Talked to this guy on a dating app for 2 weeks before we met. We clicked immediately over text and had similar personalities &amp; senses of humor. We texted till 2 AM on multiple occasions about our thoughts on children, marriage, religion, life, etc. It felt very comfortable. He even had expensive flowers delivered to my work the day before for the date with a note saying he was excited to meet me. He said he normally doesn't do a grand gesture like that before meeting, but he just felt like he needed to do something special for me.

The date went great, right from the start. Immediate chemistry. We were joking, laughing and flirting like we had known each other for years. Very touchy-feely as well. I even kissed him first cause I just couldn't wait any longer. I have been on enough bad dates to know when I have a good one. The date lasted over 6 hours and ended with him dropping me back off at my house and kissing in my drive-way for quite some time. We had briefly mentioned during the date about hanging out again but nothing concrete. He texted me when he got home and we talked until we fell asleep. Then the next day, we had some small talk over text but nothing like before- something felt off. I figured we were both exhausted from the date and didn't want to smother each other so I didn't think much of it but I couldn't ignore the weird gut feeling I had that something was wrong.

Now it is has been a whole week since the date and we small talk over text once or twice a day but nothing compared to what we had before we met. He will just send me a snapchat of him or his dogs and captions it ""I miss your face"", or he will send me a text about something irrelevant. No staying up late texting or anything close to romantic. The closest thing to that was him texting me asking ""Do you miss me yet?"" which came across as a fuckboy thing to do, if I do say so myself. I confronted him over text earlier this week asking why communication had slowed and he assured me that nothing was wrong. I thought maybe after that, he would reach out more often but he hasn't. ***Now I could reach out first or ask him out again, but why would I when I feel I am already being slowly rejected?*** I don't want to seem needy either.

I really did like him and it was very apparent we had chemistry. So what gives? He won't ghost me. But he hasn't asked me out again either, or make it known he is interested in continuing to pursue me romantically. A guy who was interested would have already asked me on another date. I am just going to take the hint and walk.

Why is it that when you have chemistry with someone, they want nothing to do with you!? And then you go on a date with someone where you have ZERO sparks and yet that person won't leave you alone? It's so backwards and I just don't understand dating anymore.

So I am a mid 20s male going through the transitional kind of period that I *planned* to have been done with a couple years ago. I was in college, getting ready to finish up and become a fully fledged adult, contributing to society, career, etc. But there was a family crisis and I dropped out for a couple years to do what had to be done; family will always come first for me. 

So now I'm 23, halfway to 24 and headed back to finish college and get back on track, ya know. My point is... now that things are cool, everyones out of the woods and all that, and I'm rebuilding my life, part of rebuilding is getting back into the dating world. However, I realize at this age, most other people probably have full time jobs, their own places, etc. and that potential partners will likely expect the same from me. Which, unfortunately, I'm not able to deliver that yet. I live with a parent and quit my last job to move here with them. The only one of those independence related things I have is my own truck.

While here, I met someone that I really, *really* like. Admittedly, we've only talked a few times, however we have a lot of shared interests, he's a lot of fun to be around, and he's absolutely adorable ü•∫. Being around him makes me feel bubbly.

I leave in two weeks, and I'm considering asking him out. What I'm really looking for is a relationship though, and, \*if\* we were to end up dating, I'm worried about the distance. This is probably a dumb question, but I've never been in a relationship, much less a long-distance relationship. Is 5 hours a lot?

I'm typically free on the weekends, and I work, so hypothetically it would be possible (if expensive, although the money I make is entirely disposable income) to catch the 6-hour train and spend the weekends together. I've made friends here and the town is great, so the thought of doing so doesn't bother me. I'm absolutely a ""touchy-feely"" kind of person, and physical contact would be important to me.

I really like him, and (particularly being gay and going to a very, *very* small school) its incredibly hard to meet people. I rarely meet people I like. I want to be with him, and I've been told by a couple of people that he likes me, and it would be heartbreaking to date him for a week or two and then never see him again. Is this doable? Is it long distance? What is it like? Of course, this assumes that we end up dating and that he would be ok with the distance. Moreover, I'm not suggesting that I'm thinking about committing to a relationship of any kind right now. I'd need to spend more time with him, of course... more than a week or two which would mean making the trip to see him after I leave.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ove579/dumb_questions_from_someone_thats_never_done_this/

What annoys me is I don't even really want to be especially social in the sense that I'm not really interested in clubs and bars.

I just want to introduce myself to people and get to know someone on a date.

Often when I'm outside people are with friends, with family or with their partner. I can't approach people, I'm shy and it doesn't look like anyone wants to be approached because they're all busy or taken.

I'm not your average confident man, I don't talk loudly and can be quite shy. I'm not especially lively or expressive, being social just doesn't come naturally to me like it does for most people.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn‚Äôt interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn‚Äôt get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response‚Ä¶ thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn‚Äôt think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn‚Äôt want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn‚Äôt need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn‚Äôt talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn‚Äôt know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room.

67,ovgorj,1627771483,"Guy I've gone on two dates with is going away next weekend for who knows how long and invited me to his house, what should I do?","So I (26F) met this guy(32m) on bumble, and so far  I have been on two dates with him. First for a coffee date and one ramen date today. During lunch, he told me he's gonna be going to visit his parents in another province who he hasn't seen for two years (pandemic restrictions). He's leaving next weekend. So I asked him when he will be back and he said he doesn't know, when he gets bored/tired he'll come back. He works remotely so there's no rush for him to come back for a job. We walked around a bit after and he asked if I'd like to come over to his apartment Wednesday evening (before he leaves) to watch Luca and meet his roommate and his dog. I said okay and we could discuss more later. But now I'm at home and reflecting about the situation.

Should I be suspicious about going over to his place since he's going away with an undetermined return date? Should I tell him I actually can't go? He's a quiet, introverted guy and a little awkward. So far he hasn't been forward and tried to kiss me or anything during the first two days, but he's a covid conscious guy so I attributed it to that. When our second date ended I initiated a hug with him. He seemed keen to see me again and also was the one who arranged the previous dates. 

When I asked what he's looking for during the first date he said he's looking for a monogamous relationship.

I have never had a boyfriend before and I'm relatively new to dating so I'm pretty green and trying to figure it all out.

Will he try to advance our relationship sexually at the apartment, lose interest while he's gone and then ghost me? Just trying not to get hurt here and do anything I'm not comfortable with. 

TD;LR: Met guy on bumble, went on two dates, he wants me to go to his apartment to watch a movie for a third date. After that, he's going away to visit his parents for a couple weeks.

69,ovgrt9,1627771791,I honestly don't know what is her deal," 

Before we begin, I think it's necessary to give you the context of my relationship with her. About a year ago I went to write entrance exams and when I was done and was waiting outside for a friend, I began having small talk with a group of girls who were sitting next to me. There was one girl among them who was really cute and funny, so we exchanged social media and started talking. Eventually, we started going on dates and things were going pretty well, with her even directly telling me we're not just friends. However, Greece went into a second lockdown and we lost contact.

2 months later she messages me out of the blue. She responds almost instantly and seems really willing to talk to me. She eventually started being flirty again, sending hearts and saying stuff like ""I can't wait to see you again"". 4 months into lockdown she got tired of waiting and ask me out. I was really excited and was happy to see her, but she mentioned something I wasn't expecting. She casually told me she has a boyfriend.

I tried to take it and move on, but she kept messaging me in a way her boyfriend wouldn't be fond of. She once even sent me a picture without her shirt on to ""have a look at her new tattoo"". I was really confused, but I kept being patient and at some point, she finally told me she broke up with him. I ask her if she wanted to meet up and she said yes, so I thought I finally had a shot, but I got bamboozled,

When we met up, all she did was go on and on about how bad her ex treated her. Don't get me wrong, I care about her, but I felt I was just her shoulder to cry on. A friend. That's what she kept calling me that day and she even mentioned there's another guy she's interested in dating. I decided to stop playing around and mentioned a female friend of mine (without telling her what my relationship with her is) to see her reaction. She seemed really concerned and even asked to see a picture of her. At this point, I didn't know what's her deal and decided to wait until our next meetup.

When we met up again, she told me she and that other guy are now officially dating. She then asked me if there's anyone I'm interested in, but I told her it was complicated. The rest of the night ran smoothly, but I was still trying to make sense out of her behavior, so I decided to mention my friend again. This time she asked me ""Is she your friend?"". I tried to avoid the question but she kept insisting I tell her. I eventually told her she and I have once had crushes on each other but decided to go our separate ways because she was planning to major overseas. She then said, ""Once she's back in town, ask her out. I'm sure she'll say yes."".

We happened to speak today and she told me she's still with that other guy. I honestly don't know what to do. I want to get an answer from her, but I don't know if it's a good idea to be upfront with her or not. Why is she leading me on, but then goes with another guy when she's single? Why did she get jealous when I told her about my friend, but still encouraged me to ask her out? Why does she keep calling me her friend, when she has admitted in the past she didn't see me that way?

I tried indirectly mentioning our ""cute moments"" and she doesn't even try to change the subject. I tried telling her what I thought indirectly, but aside from some visual signs showing she got what I was saying, she hasn't really been frank with me.

We got along real well but never knew each other too well. We'd see each other at parties and have quick, cute chats.

Fast forward, a year later, we run into each other at the supermarket and have a longer chat and actually exchange numbers. She says we should get a drink. Turns out her relationship is ending, but slowly.

I try to plan a drink but she cancels and then later flakes out. I give her space because I'm not sure of the situation and don't want to get my hopes up. I like her and don't want just a hook up and feel confused.

I don't reach out for 6 months when I run into her again. She reminds me of the drink, I text her a week later and she seems excited to meet up and we make vague plans for the next day (because of work) but I text her the next day to confirm, but she doesn't respond.

6 months later, she follows me on instagram and I'm hesitant, but follow back and we chat, it's the pandemic and she says she wants to hang out. Bars are closed. She knew where I lived and apparently comes around my way a lot, so I just tell her to let me know when she's around next, and I'll meet her for a walk in my neighborhood.

I never hear from her. I comment on a few of her instagram stories, but never ask her out. We chat a bit, but it's covid, so everything is closed.

Two months later I run into her on the street. She says hi but then walks away.

I think we're done now.

Two months later, she reaches out and asks if I want to go for a walk. I say yes and we do. It's ok, kinda feels platonic but I'm also confused by her. It's perfectly fine and we feel like old friends, but I also don't know her. After the walk, she has things to do so we make plans for another time.

Next time I text her and ask her if she wants to get a coffee, she doesn't respond.

I mute her on instagram and delete her number.

It's been 4 months now and she still looks at all my instagram stories and occasionally gives reactions.

I just ignore it but am confused.

When we game, he gets too aggressive when he rages and I don't appreciate how he rages at me at times. I asked him to tone it down and control his tone, but deems it as special treatment and I'm being too sensitive and that he does it to everybody he plays with. I played with two of his friends and it was more playful banter than just groaning and insults. I have friends I shit talk to but we aren't insulting to each other. If we do, we apologize and fix it so it doesn't happen again. This has happened three times within the last two weeks, not including the multiple times before. We've argued about this before and I expected a change even as a friend, but it's gotten to a point where my patience is growing extremely tired of it. We've split from gaming with each other on this game today, but I feel the beginning of an end.

After I had seen that video, I was in a weird place and was depressed the last couple of days. It turns out that she was pretty much living a double life. 

We met up at a bar and she explained to me that her and her ex‚Äôs relationship was still existent. Long stories short, she met him in a sugar baby/daddy website 3 years ago and was providing for her. She also met another man on the website during the earlier stages of our relationship. In total, she was seeing 3 men including myself according to her words, but possibly more in my opinion. The two men are all in their early 40s and 50s. I didn‚Äôt know how to process this information since she had told me from when we had started dating, the relationship with her ex was non-existent.

When dating men, fair, I have created this expectation that I want to feel their masculine energy in their ability to plan a first date. In my mind, if someone can plan a date, I feel more secure and think we will likely be more compatible. Ability to plan is important to me - so in a first date it can be a good indication, anywho. So when texting on dating apps, I show signs that I'm interested and open the door for them to ask me. Things go well until they ask me to go on the date and I say yes. Then this phenomenon starts to happen. ''So what you thinking?'', ''Any suggestions?'', '''whats your perfect date?''. I then say something like ''I am open to anything'', ''my suggestion if for you to give me suggestions'' or ''my perfect date is one that I don't plan''. And then the teeth pulling begins. Text: drinks? (Okay fair date idea.) Me: Yeah, sure where? Them: I don't know./hmm. Not sure? WHAT?! Pick a freaking place dude. Anywhere! (we are generally in the same area) Theres soooo many places. It's a freaking first date, who cares! If I don't like your suggestion ill tell you so - but like why wouldn't I be okay with your suggestion? I feel like the best dates are the ones that are straight forward, have a date, place and time. I just want to be able to enter my feminine energy and let the man lead. I feel like this is hard nowadays... Why are men so afraid of taking the lead on a first date?

There are an insane amount of women putting only the IG in bios on Tinder &amp; Co or say you should contact them there because they're more active there. Why do you even have Tinder if you're not active?

What do you want from that? Fame? More followers? It got so incredible bad that it even became a turn off because it seems lazy. Like they don't want to invest energy into finding someone. 

Why do you do this? Like seriously? I know you have a lot of Likes but from nothing comes nothing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ovifcx/why_do_women_only_put_their_instagram_in_bios_on/

We've been on a number of dates as well as spending many hours together at our respective abodes. Its safe to say that she likes me however we haven't had the discussion about it being a full relationship.

However, she has this habit of starting text conversations and dropping off half way, as if she isn't interested.
There are days that we are busy and don't get to see or talk to each other, she would text me to see how my day was going or to catch my attention, we would talk for a few minutes only for her to reply to my last text a couple of hours later.

I kind of want to tell her but I don't want to be ""that guy"" or am I just being pedantic?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oviid9/am_i_being_pedantic/
89,ovij2w,1627778645,Insecurity and rejection--how to you get that oh so appealing self confidence?,"In order to give you the full scope of what we're working with, I'll give a long and winding backstory:

I am an Irish twin and was always very close to my older sister. It was easier for my parents to lump us together and since we went along with it so happily it just happened that it worked out that I was basically just moved up a grade in most social settings. My sister's friends were my friends, her interests mine and so on and so forth. And, while I enjoyed growing up like this, I've since come to realize that I think this might have had more of a negative effect on my than I thought.

I was a late bloomer. To name a few of the curses that plagued me, I had a horrible sense of fashion, a big forehead, crippling anxiety, that ungodly hormonal acne, a gigantic butt, and about a hundred things more. Meanwhile, my sister has always been gorgeous. From the moment she was old enough to get a boy's attention, she's had it. She had long legs and great muscles, all the things I never had. She was skinny with pretty skin that never got acne. I was always a little jealous, and to be honest I still am. But her luck didn't stop there. Beyond being gorgeous, t she was charismatic and extroverted, and drew people to her effortlessly. Even as children, the guys we played with innocently flocked to her, while I always ran along behind trying to catch up. Boys ALWAYS had a crush on her, and I, jealously wished to be just the same. Obviously, she was a big hit with with the guys throughout our most formative years, meanwhile the most I got was that I was ""a lovely young flower waiting to bloom"", or, even worse ""she's got a great personality"" (which I did and do have, thank you very much--I am funny as hell).

Whelp, I'm struggling to feel like I've bloomed. I'm 24 and after years of anxiety, depression, and endometriosis doing its damage, I've settled into a mediocre human being. (wow, don't I sound sad. Trust me, sometimes I look in the mirror and think I'm hot shit). I'm moderately sized, although I usually end up being the fat friend, which is never the most encouraging female. Hormonal acne has remained my closest companion and probably will remain as long as my body continues to tear itself apart from the inside, and I'm still just a bit too shy and socially anxious to light up the room when I walk in the way my sister does. My forehead is still big, though I've learned to live and work with it, I've sort of figured out how to dress myself, and it turns out the proper term is dummy thicc and not, fat. Over all, I've grown up and for a while I was thinking I hadn't done too bad. I would have maybe called myself a 7, and if you take things like a great sense of humor and a little cute nerd behavior into consideration, maybe even an 8.

But, my friends, we're fading fast.

I've had a few attempts at dating. They've all ended fairly quickly, mostly because the guys who seem to actually be interested usually turn out to be very desperate and pushy, like their starved for water and I'm the water bottle that got left in the car last week and is now tepid and gross. It's like, I'm not what they want, but they're desperate for satisfaction, so I'll do for now. It's not exactly the most wonderful feeling, and I've almost just given up looking entirely because of it. I always did my best not to base my self worth off of male attention, I don't think it's a healthy way for anyone to live their life, and yet, feeling like nobody would want you is a hard thought to shake, and there's something a little humiliating about your friend getting bought a drink by that hot guy at the bar while you sit there and try not to acknowledge the creep in the back whose been making weird faces at you all night.

That being said, I've persevered until recently.

My self confidence took a HUGE digger last summer. Around that time, I'd come to realize that for me, it's important to know the person I'm dating before we agree to date. I really need a friendship before I can move on to something bigger. That being said, that's easier said than done, and so I'd been bemoaning that fact all year. Then, my sister got engaged and planned a wedding and the most amazing thing happened. The best man was a guy who'd I'd grown up with since a tiny tot, and who I was very familiar with. ANd...he'd gotten hot. And because fortune smiled upon me, it got even better: he was single and *looking*.

I couldn't have imagined anything more perfect. Apparently, as his family was friends with mine, our mothers had been chatting and this guy was really wanting to find a girl who could match pace with him--who was into adventures but not clingy, who liked the outdoors and animals, but also liked providing space. I was like ""hello, avid trail rider, hunter, hiker, and introvert??? I am the woman he has been waiting for??"" Honestly, he was too perfect, and that probably should have been the first hint that this wouldn't work. But, I tried anyway. As the wedding approached, I did my best to both be forward enough for him to get the idea I was interested, but not intrusive. I didn't want to be annoying, I only wanted to put the idea in his head.

Either I'm \*very\* subtle, or I'm so average I'm invisible, because I'm here talking about the way my self confidence took a digger. He barely even noticed me. 

Now, if you've made it this far I applaud you, it's a lot. But, thankfully, we've finally reached the summary where I ask for advice.  I'm a young woman who knows that confidence is sexy, but is struggling to overcome being the unsexy ""blooming flower"" all her life and start to believe she's desirable. I'm still staggering from a rejection because, *for once*, it was someone I genuinely was attracted to and **really** wanted to try a relationship with, and it was almost like I was invisible or maybe even worse, actively not wanted. I cannot help but hear the voices that say I'm undesirable. I cannot help but hear the voices that say ""if you just did \_\_\_"" or ""if you just fixed \_\_\_\_ guys would actually be interested"". And, I KNOW those voices aren't fair. I know that self-confidence is attractive, and hell, I even know that I am a great person with so much going for her. But, how do I fight off the sting of rejection, and how to I pick myself back up and get myself in the ring when it's so engrained in me that I'm not that appealing? How do I look at myself and tell myself I'm likable/desirable when there never seem to be any relationships/interested guys around to prove it?

It‚Äôs been about 4 months into this journey and while I‚Äôve healed from my last experience, I‚Äôm still feeling moments of loneliness and feeling left behind every now and then. I look at my life (I have an amazing core group of friends, a well paying job that I enjoy enough, supportive and present family, no debt and a sizable amount of life savings) and I feel like I should feel blessed and happy. Of course there are things for me to work on, I‚Äôm still studying to stay relevant in my field, applying to jobs, learning how to work out and picking up a new hobby. I do feel blessed and satisfied most of the time, but sometimes I look at my life and realize the only thing missing is that one someone to share my happiness with. I‚Äôll go out and see couples walking about or hear from one of my friends that has found their person or is getting married and soon after this wave of loneliness hits again.
