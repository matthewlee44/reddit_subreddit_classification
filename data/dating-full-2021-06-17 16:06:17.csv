- The majority of men have strict race criteria and if you are part of 1/3 of the world population's races you are immediately rejected by 90%+ of men.
- You need to have beautiful facial features like a movie star or model to get matches on dating apps or easy dates.
- Everyone tells you the reason you're struggling is you haven't dieted and exercised hard enough because you don't yet have visible abs on par like a pro gymnast or lingerie/magazine cover model. 
- People tell you through your entire teens and 20s not to worry about dating (just accept you must be alone) and maybe when you're in your 30s and have a good job a low quality man will accept you for your accomplishments.
- Dating apps provide no significant number of matches/likes no matter how many pictures you take and profile reviews you get.
- Some men accuse you of being creepy and harassers if you try to talk to them in public - some men will call campus police on you if you're in a university.

If this was the reality you woke up to every day, be honest: How worthless would you feel?

I really don't think most women even try to imagine what this is like for 5 minutes and that's why the advice many women give is so disconnected from the reality.

Try to understand the reality men face and you'll understand why so many are struggling. We need real solutions and so far I don't see any.

When questioned about it she said it’s not the same guy and I’m being dumb. When I asked her to just be honest she said it was him and lied to me. There’s also been days now where she suddenly talks to friends she hadn’t spoken to in years. One day she went to meet a friend who tried breaking us up and she said she wouldn’t talk to again but refused to say where then it was a friend from work the next day and then a friend she hadn’t spoken too since high school the next.

If you aren't interested in reading all the way through essentially I would be very grateful If I could have some help starting conversations and some general tips (and pep talks?!?! 😂) for a Brazilian girl who wants to video call me.

For more context:

___________________________________________________

 I very recently met this beautiful brazillian girl online. We are both 16 (you don't have to point out thag we are young, I knoe) and despite the language barrier of myself speaking negligible Portuguese and her very basic english we have made some conversation she asked me to video call her sometime soon. I've been holding it off today, staying off my phone because as you can expect I am pooping myself, to stay less vulgar. In a way it is the closest thing to a real interaction we can get thanks to this little barrier called the ocean (Damn you water!) so I don't want to mess this up - I don't know what to say. You know, all of this ""first impressions are everything"" malarkey has me feeling quite threatened. Also the previosuly mentioned language barrier is less than ideal... 

I'm not just saying this like some normal delusional teen, she is absolutely gorgeous, she looks like one of those women you only see on instgram that many believe to be myths with her and all her exoticness- A solid 9 or 10 compared to me who is quite a bit below the level she could pull which Is why, for a change, I am quite nervous and suprised that she has taken at least a little interest.

Anyway, it’s like my sex drive comes in waves. Sometimes I feel super turned on around guys in my life but I don’t know if that’s attraction as sometimes I feel nothing sexually towards them.

I thought most women see men on dating apps or on tv and have deep sexual fantasies. I never have sexual fantasies unless I’m in a talking stage with a guy and that has been ages :(

I feel like a big part of the 'game' is to 'like bomb' the shit out of every new post a woman makes. I see male Realtors doing this to female Realtor friend groups all the time in an effort to create attraction/ interest/ jealousy among friends in friend groups and general intrigue. The man will just like every new post for 20-30-40 attractive females continually till he starts getting attention. Whatever it is, this is most certainly a thing that is being leveraged to great results by people that do it well.

Here's the thing though, this is clearly manipulation, so I can't engage in it. But it works.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think it will work in the long run of a relationship however, only as a pick-up skill.

Once a relationship starts I feel like this would become very constraining, you should love in a way that allows the other person to be free, and this is not freeing. This behavior is onerous, monotonous, tedious, and has to continue and when it continues it loses it's mystery and make you a predictable nice guy stalker THAT WILL NOT GO AWAY WHEN THE REALTIONSHIP ENDS.

We've started of casually, and have talked about past hook ups/ fwb and relationships.

Ever since meeting up, we're having a great time and we both acknowledge each other. 

I do have to admit that I feel some type of way for him, and what we have is more than a fwb situation.

I'm really angry at myself that we didn't label our ""relationship"" as anything and just went with the flow.

Even tho we had a great time, there were also some bad periods too. I don't want to go too much into detail, but he didn't want to break things up even tho I told him that I wouldn't get mad at him if he'd want to cut me off as it would've been completely understandable.

This past weekend I got a bit angry at him, because I thought he was having sex with others (we agreed to not sleep with anyone else so we don't need to use condoms). 

We talked it out, and as I understood it it's really just a fwb situation for him. I am important to him but it's platonic. At least that's how I grasped it. 

I guess I just got influenced by the comments of my friends, cause everyone agreed on the fact that we are more than fwb.

I CAN NOT talk about my feelings, idk why, but something just stops me. So I decided to write him a letter and give it to him the next time he's here... 

I really let my emotions take over and didn't hold back while writing. The letter hes about 6 pages lmao, and yeah.

I showed a little bit of it to my friend and she started crying because even she felt how strong my feelings are. 

I don't think that I have ever cut someone off this way. Well, I'm not cutting him off - I wrote that I can't act as if there isn't more, and that I need time to sort my emotions out.

If I know that it's just a fwb situatiom for jim I'm fine with it, it's just that I need a break.

I know I’m younger than a lot of you, but I do understand that dating can be super hard. Until recently, I had not dated in a year. No one had ever taken me on a date and all my relationships lasted less than a month. The only relationship that was long term lasted 3 months and it was incredibly abusive. I had very low self-esteem and felt like guys would only ever want me for sex and that was it. Due to the abuse I experienced and other things, I really struggled to have any kind of positive relationship. I was aggressive and manipulative because I was scared to deal with the constant pain I was feeling. When I was around 17, I started to really work on myself. I focused on deciding which morals I wanted to follow and stuck with them. I began treating other people better and I slowly began to feel like my old self from before the abuse happened. Not only was I happier, but the people around me were happier. I began to work even harder to be fair and kind to people, and soon I not only had a lot of friends but guys showed interest in me for more than sex! I had a few crash and burns before I met my current boyfriend, who is amazing and everything I’ve ever wanted. We are fair with each other, we argue but do not fight, and we are happy. It’s been a huge weight off my shoulders to feel like I can be loved. This all happened because I became a better version of me. I think the question to ask yourself today if you are currently miserable and single is if you are your best you. Not “are you perfect?” but rather “have you become someone that not only others love but you love?” I promise you that it can be very frustrating to know you’ve tried and failed when you’ve done your best, but I urge you to keep trying. If you’ve put in your all with zero results, it’s not your fault. The only thing to do is keep trying.

Basically what the title says. I’m 22M for reference. I had a big massive awkward crush on a girl I used to sit next to in class who I got along really well with, I was always too shy to do anything about it, and was a bit of an ugly duckling so nothing ever happened, but all my friends knew and would tease me about it in front of her. Typical high school shit. We talked and messaged for a bit and I told her I liked her, she told me she’d already known for a while and when it became obvious nothing was gonna happen I kinda let it be. We’re still on good terms though obviously and I’ve saw her on a few drunken nights out where we’ve been happy to see each other. I was completely over it years ago, now it’s just something I look back on and laugh at.

Over the years I’ve become better looking and less awkward, and she got a boyfriend.  One night at a New Years party we bumped into each other, and her boyfriend was standing right there while she was getting all close to me and saying ‘you know, it’s such a shame we don’t talk anymore, I miss you so much’, being all flirty, etc., she was clearly really drunk and her boyfriend was looking at me like I’d murdered someone so I kind of just exited the convo as soon as I could hahaha. It was kind of gratifying to have your unattainable high school crush kind of flirt with you, but that was it really.

Anyway, i recently started a new job and out of curiosity checked the schedule for my shift tomorrow to see if there’s any familiar names (it’s kind of a small town), and guess who’s on my shift with me. Yeah, her. I was vaguely aware she worked there a couple years back, but was under the impression she went back to an old job she had. But nope, there it is.

Even though I have no feelings towards her, I feel like seeing her is gonna make me revert into that shy and awkward way I used to be. There’s just a bit of history there I suppose; she knew I liked her, we were pretty close at one point, the whole thing at that party that one time, etc., I just think there could be a bit of awkwardness there. I feel like I just have to act completely aloof and like none of it happened, and just be friendly and happy to see her, but it just makes me internally cringe knowing how shy I was with her and how badly I handed that crush. I know she still thinks well of me, but it was all so awkward and just full of high school bullshit. I have no idea how I’m gonna act around her. How can I not act the same way around her as before?

 I don’t know if this is the proper subreddit but I would greatly appreciate any input.  I (26F) don’t want to misjudge an acquaintance from childhood (26M), who I have kept occasional contact with. Some background: 

We has crushed on each other in elementary school. This changed as we got older, but I’ve always sensed that he hangs on to it, but I am unsure? 

He attempted to flirt in middle/high school. I would not engage if too direct. We would talk, but sometimes I felt the need to distance. On occasions, we talked after high school. Two years ago, we met for coffee. I enjoyed catching up, and mentioned that it could maybe be a yearly thing. 

However, he made odd comments like, “I see this as a new beginning. I see this as a new chapter. I want to keep seeing you and creating a friendship. Even if you have only fifteen minutes when you come up to your parents for a walk, I can always drive and meet up with you.” He offered take me out for a drink on my birthday, I politely declined. I felt uneasy, like he was trying to push something on to me? I tried to communicate that my main focus is school. 

Today, he reached out and asked to meet for coffee. He said I could join him for a walk with his dog since he is often near the area where my parents live. 

He is a genuine person. I truly want to see him happy but I am not interested in him. We have different communication styles, goals, etc. I worry that if I agree to meeting up, he may make odd comments again. It's just awkward because I don't know how to respond. I do not want to say anything that would negatively affect him or his confidence. I just have this odd gut feeling. I don’t think he would do anything bad, but I just feel uncomfortable?

Am I misinterpreting his intentions? Am I misjudging this gut feeling I have?

It happens relatively naturally, and there’s no strong emotion associated with the statements. In a way, if he had substituted “my ex” with “my friend or brother” it would’ve been really normal. Plus I understand that, in a way, it’d be almost odd if he didn’t think about his exes because they were once an important part of his life. The only weird feeling I’m getting from this is how much more frequently it’s been happening, if there is a need for him to bring them up every time he’s reminded of them, and if I’m weird for thinking something of it. Also- he’s mentioned that he uses cosmetics that his ex left at his house- again, am I being sensitive or is it great that he doesn’t feel the need to purge everything that reminds him of his ex/be wasteful.

For most of my life I was fairly outgoing and had no trouble meeting people and making friends, of both genders. But girls never saw me in the light of someone who was “datable.” Of course it was because of my condition but I never knew. All that changed when I started TRT 6 months ago. Physically, it helped to finally put on some muscle and start to look more my age. While mentally, it gave me a kind of confidence that I never had before. NGL, looking back I feel like twice the person I was before I started. 

I can’t ignore the fact that it's changed the way girls see me as well. So far, I’ve been pretty lucky that only major giveaways I have physically are things like a low WHR and softer, less masculine facial features. Still I don’t expect women to be attracted to me for reasons like these, and until recently this was always the case. But now with TRT I feel like it’s somehow masking those aspects and I’m worried it might trick some girls into thinking I’m a normal guy. 

I should put it out there that I’m fully aware of the fact that XXY men are not “real men” and shouldn’t try to trick girls into dating them. And it's absolutely not something I plan on doing. If I hooked up with a girl without telling her I don’t think I would ever be able forgive myself.

While, I don’t actively try to date, situations have inevitably started coming up. For example, recently I’ve had multiple female friends try to set me up with their other friends and some of them are pretty adamant about the idea.

Hi,

FWB is constantly late, and often cancels, changes or moves plans. I realize some of this is out of his control as he is military, and has extremely demanding work hours that often run late. (Sometimes 80 hr weeks)

However, when we first started seeing each other a few months ago, he was on time, so I know he can manage his schedule like an adult. I am admittedly more uptight about time than a lot of people. I consider lack of punctuality a sign of contempt. I’m 10 minutes early everywhere and then I wait for the appropriate time to knock/enter/ask for a table/what have you. In my view, there is a 5-10 minute grace period, within which is tolerable, but should not be frequent. Beyond that, you are rude and doubly so if you don’t notify the other person. 

I try to tell him it bothers me, but he says my irritability about it is pushing him away. Quite frankly I find it horribly disrespectful, and I’m OK with pushing away someone that completely disrespects my time. 

On top of that, his response to it is that he works quite a bit more than I do, and so therefore his time is more valuable. I don’t necessarily agree to that. Between my day job and my side business, I work 55 to 60 hours a week, I am scaling back to start grad school in two months, and I’m trying to publish a paper. Even so, we each have 168 hours in a week. He chose his line of work, and I don’t think his choices should be my problem. 

What started as sexy and fun is now feeling really one-sided and disrespectful. We typically only have sex once a week (low libido on his end). I don’t feel like my needs are being met. At the same time, I’m hesitant to 86 it because he is extremely attentive in bed (but not in any other area). I’m making this post because he’s making me feel as though I’m being unreasonable for asking basic respect. 

TLDR- FWB is being disrespectful. Am I out of line? Can we adjust or do I just yeet him?

So, I decided to stay for the cupcakes. Then while I'm sitting down with my best friend who also had honors. I saw him, He looked like a Senior and when asking if he was he turned out to be a freshman like me. Moving on, Long story short he had 3 classes with my friend and I was able to go in two of them. (cuz it was almost the last day, none of the teachers were doing anything so we were able to go to any class we want.)

Anyways, the day ends, and I wasn't able to talk to him.  Cuz 1. I was scared and Lil nervous. Anyways the next day is the last day of school. And my friend gave me his snap. I added him and say hi. Which i was going to delete cuz I didn't believe he was going to text me back. Since he takes forever too. But he did text me back. So, we started chatting and getting to know him better. Right now, we are playing would you rather and it's taking 2 days to respond.  But, the first time we chatted, He did mention he had bad wifi. So I just assume, It was his wifi. cuz I after two days, he randomly opened the message and texted me back. 

Now, this dude knows nothing bout me and I don't know anything about him.  Just some information that my best friend told me like he is very dramatic and Rude to one of my other friends.  But when I talked to him  In person, he seemed very nice in person, and in chats, he is pretty sassy. ( i just get sassy vibes in our text messages.)

{I also befriended one of his friends, who told me he was very friendly} =\^= and plus my friends don't hang out with him that much.

After eating, we walked around the neighborhood for what felt like a very long time. Then, we went back to her apartment and cuddled a bit before making out. The last few dates I've been on prior to meeting her, the kisses felt OK, but there was nothing there. This one was a very electrifying kiss, and I felt enamored by it. I think she did too.

For a brief moment, I opened my eyes and noticed she was smiling while kissing me. I was also smiling, but seeing her reciprocating made me feel warm and fuzzy. We'd stopped for a moment and she said something like, ""Wow... I feel floaty"" as she was sort of awkwardly laughing.

Eventually we had to stop as it was getting pretty late. She'd made several remarks about not wanting to lose touch with me, about planning more dates, and doing more things together in the future. That night was also the first time we really, truly complimented each other's looks outside of just being like, ""You look great!""

As weird as it sounds to say, it was also the first date I've had all year where it ended with a goodnight hug and kiss. I didn't realize that until later.

About 2 months ago, I went out with a guy I really really liked from a dating app. We spoke over facetime once for a few hours ( I was nervous and never dated through a dating app) and we went out twice. I really liked him and was so excited about him because he was exactly what I was looking for and exactly my type physically. The first date went well and when I spoke to my friends I kept saying how scared I was about how much I liked him even though I hadn't known him that long.  

The second date was nice but I was not myself. I was much more closed off, quieter and did not let my personality through at all. He was really nice and tried to engage with me but I was so off kilter I was not being my warm, fun self at all. 

He even waited with me for over 20 minutes in the heat for my transportation even tho I told him I've and over he didnt have to wait with me. At the end before I left I told him I had a nice time and he seemed surprised I said that and stammered out he had a good time too. But the response let me know the inevitable. 

The next day he texted me he had a nice time on our dates but he felt we were missing something. I responded I understood where he was coming from but asked him what it was he felt we were missing. He said he felt like I was too closed off and he wasnt able to open up and attributed that to us not having the best chemistry. I totally got where he was coming from because I was closed off but I thought it was  becausw I really liked him a lot more than any other guy I dated and it was only the second date. I told him I understood his thoughts and appreciated his honesty and then explained that I was just very nervous because he was the first guy I ever dated through a dating app which he knew, but that I also was unsure about his intentions (if he wanted something serious, casual, hookup)which also made me closed off but I still appreciated him telling me and at least now I know to be more open. He said he was happy to hear what my thoughts were and I said back, of course, good luck and good night and the next morning he responded and said thank you, you too. 

Since then I've dated 2 other guys through the app and even an ex came back that I had the courage to reject again but I still havent stopped thinking about this guy. A part of me thinks if he rejected you and didnt see the potential than keep the L and move on but a big part of me feels upset at myself that I couldn't just open up and be myself around him because we definitely hit it off in the beginning and I was just so nervous that I second guessed everything.

We talked Monday evening, and everything seemed well. Things were flirtatious, things were fine. I suggested that he take Tuesday afternoon off to spend time with me...I suggested it in jest, but...I would have been all for it. But, he just laughed, so I let it go.

As it was, I had an order pickup in his city, let's call it Gotham City. I live in a rural area, so the home improvement store in his city was the closest one that had the item in stock. I also had a cabinet that I was wanting to pick up there while I was in town.

Now, I didn't tell him I was coming to Gotham City. For one, I really didn't know my plans 100%, so I figured I would just let him know when I was up there. If I saw him, I saw him; if I didn't, I didn't. Secondly, I didn't want him to feel obligated to see me, especially when he was working, and I was doing my own thing.

So, when I got to the home improvement center, I sent him a picture, and also told him they had a particular part he has been looking for. He replied relatively quickly, but all he said was that he was looking for a different part. But, he didn't say anything about me being in Gotham City. Not the response I expected at least. I expected a ""Oh my gosh, what are you doing in Gotham City?!"" or something similar.

Anyway, I haven't heard from him since. Now, it's only been a couple of days. He could be busy, he could be working on projects. It might be nothing. It just strikes me odd that he hasn't shown even the slightest curiosity of why I was in his city.

I do wonder what the chances are that he might be upset....upset that I came to Gotham City without telling him I was coming. Also, that I came without any plans to see him. Maybe I am getting the cold shoulder?

He was already in a partnership when I met him. The banter, and conversations flowed so easily. He was consistent with our texting, and I was overjoyed that I met someone that met my energy and was open to a non traditional way of dating. I felt more comfortable with him, and confident in our relationship then I had felt with any previous relationships and that surprised me because it was very fresh. It didn’t bother me that he had another partner  when he was consistently showing that he was prioritizing me in his life. We went on a total of four dates, and I thought I met the guy of my dreams when I hadn’t felt this way since my last ex of over two years ago. Last night we talked on the phone and we’re getting on the subject of his birthday and how he was going to the skate park, and was inviting me to join him and friends. When I told him that I wanted to do something one on one it started the conversation of that he wasn’t looking for a primary partnership with me. ( his partner ending up breaking up with him less than a week ago while we were  together. He said that he felt sad and unfilled. I cried on the phone and I told him that he didn’t seem to care and said he was processing his feelings. At the end of the call he said that he still wanted me in his life and that we would talk later. Still hasn’t texted me and I’ve been crying in waves all day.  :(",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,844420,public,self,Trying out polyamory for the first time,0,[],0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2dvui/trying_out_polyamory_for_the_first_time/,all_ads,6,,,,
