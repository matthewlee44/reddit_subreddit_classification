I'm still not sure what I want. All I know is I miss going on cute dates and getting to know someone. So I figured I might as well try. 

About 2 weeks ago I matched with a man on Bumble who felt similar to me in terms of the dating thing. He said he really just wants to find his person and be done with it basically. Which is what I ultimately want, but I say I don't because of the heartbreak I've experienced. 

Anyway we hit it off immediately. He seemed to be really into me. We talked on the phone a few times within one day. Texted each other back and forth nonstop the day we matched. Since then it's been silence. He texted me the day after we talked nonstop and I texted him that Monday and we exchanged maybe one or two texts and that's it.

I'm disappointed because I really did want to go on a date with this guy. And he even told me himself he'd take me out on a date. We had a lot of things in common. He seemed mature enough to me at the time and I didn't think he would ghost on me. But here I am having been ghosted. 

Honestly most of the time ghosting doesn't effect me, but because our conversations got super deep the first day of us talking, I at least expected a hey I'm not interested. He's also 33M vs me 27F so I expect maturity from a man his age.

So we didn't want to prolong inevitable, she basically told me she didn't have planned to date anybody but I appeared and some things happened between us. And she was afraid that if we stay together she will fall in love with me more and not be able to leave me and go abroad.

Breakup was kinda weird since she is working on part-time in my job so I insisted that we will meet like a week after break up and talk because I didnt want it to be weird between in work (main reason was I saw her cry in job the next day we broke up because she wasnt handling it well) So we talked and agreed that we will stay friends and continue on meeting each other.

So 2 months passed and things happened. Like all of sudden she sent me here cute photo when she was drinking with her friends. Then next days she was texting me how her day was and wishing me good night and so on. And basically we are texting every day and when we meet it's always great. Also I noticed that sometimes she is looking at me and smiling for no reason.

And now the 2 months after the break up I realized I still miss her and have feelings towards her. So I am asking for advice if I should tell her how I feel about her or better keep it to myself.

Sorry for my (21m) bad english. I've had a crush on this girl (18 I think) that I've known for two months now. I see her every weekend on a party in the park of a big city

She's easy the prettiest girl I ever saw in my life. Think a mix between Anna Nicole and Angelina Joli(?). I don't even know why she would hang there I got with my friend (17f) who I known for a long time about two weeks ago out of loneliness because I figured it won't work out with this girl. She hugs me but she never talks to me. I was away for a month but she will be there probably next week. My girlfriend will be there too. I feel like an awful person I don't want to hurt my gf. How am I supposed to act then towards the other girl ? She always asks for hugs I won't say no but my girlfriend?

tl;dr: I feel like a bad person because I have a girlfriend when all this time I've been crushing on a different girl. I don't want to hurt my gf because we've been friends for years.

After seeing so many men openly objectify women and rate them on a number it's so dehumanizing and awful. Especially scrolling through the comments on r/tinder and even on this sub and many similar subs. I'm new to dating and I'm only 19, I've never had a serious relationship and yet I'm so afraid of rejection and disappoint from men who will pick apart my appearance or be turned off by one single flaw I have. I've been seeing a lot of men even give advice to other men saying that they should play around with a girl's feelings and use her body and then just ghost her because it would give them an attention boost. And these types of comments get so many upvotes as if it's okay to dehumanize and use someone....

As I come close to my 33rd birthday, it's dawning on me that time seemingly moves faster the older I get. I am here now, at this age and don't really have a whole lot more to show for it that I did a decade ago. Sure, I have a little more money than I did back then when I lived in my student overdraft and survived on pot noodles (ironically I felt and looked far better back then on that diet!) but in terms of real wealth (love) I have am just as poor as I ever was.

I have never had a girlfriend. Never even been on a date. Throughout my early 20s this never bothered me much and I always figured things would just fall into place but as I got older, I started to realise that while in a lot of areas in life that may be true (jobs, money worries, contemporary fears and worries) with finding a partner, that just never happened. I also found as you get older, your interactions with the opposite sex become less and less frequent, and for sure less personal. You go out less, you meet far less single people, in short, your chances become more and more limited.

It took me nearly 33 years to reach this point, but I think I have finally fully given up on the prospect of ever finding love, going on dates, having kids, going on nice holidays to the beach, all that cute stuff. Its quite a sad thought when I sit here and actually consider it. I've never typed something like this out before which has made me think about it even more. Sometimes I kind of feel like what is the point of anything without having someone to share the joys and sorrows of life with?

Perhaps I'm just being a little too sensitive about it. My best buddy who kept me company all these years since I moved out of my parents (Milo), I had to put him to sleep last week. It was probably the first time I had ever cried in my adult life. The house sure does feel especially lonely now my dog isn't here.

So I ask you, men of reddit. Particularly the older gents amongst you. Do you still have hope? Have any of you ever been in a similar situation and then ultimately found love?

Everything was going amazing we communicate all the time, we talked about how we want the same things, his family and mine knew about one another, and last month we went on vacation. The vacation went amazing and he was even talking about out future and was saying how he would consider moving to where I live. Prior to the trip he was having issues with his business and I knew how he was having a hard time financially so I tried to pay for a lot of the things. I didn’t mention anything about how I knew he was having a hard time so I didn’t mind paying for things. The first couple  of days after the trip everything was fine but he did discuss with me how he’s having a hard time paying out some loans so he’s been stressed out about that and he hasn’t been communicating with me. I understood that but out of no where he started to go out every weekend and just would drink a lot. The lack of communication bothered me so I pretty much said I’m not happy. All I do is wait around for you to call or text me since it’s a long distance. When I said that he mentioned I’m just having a hard time with my business. I responds “I know and I’m trying to be supportive but I’m not sure how to do that if you don’t communicate with me or how are we suppose to grow as a couple if you don’t talk to me about this”. His  responds was I really like you but I don’t want you to get involved with me issues and if you’re not happy I’m not sure what I can do. 
I’m confused if he ended it because he’s having financial issues or because he rather go out and drink every night.

Keep in mind he’s 30 with a son and prior to this he hardly went out. He also had mentioned he couldn’t give me the life I’m use to.

We are from different countries but met through mutual friends and hit it off right away.
If the pandemic didn't happen, I imagine we would have seen alot more of each other and things would have progressed.

But as it happens time is now passing and I don't know if he likes me or not

Hes always been flirty, we share loads of common interests so get on well and have great conversations, he's super complimentary to me but in a thoughtful and insightful way, not just ""you're hot"" . He usually always initiates messages, though I do sometimes too, he sends pictures and videos of interesting things he does, and is always interested in what I'm up to. I try to mirror and do the same, depending on his level of interaction. 
But nothing has ever went anywhere, so although I like him, I just assumed he sees me as a friend and nothing more.

He then recently visited my country and picked me up and took me out for dinner, insisted on paying, we were there til closing and the staff had to kick us out. it was a perfect date, though neither of us ouright called it that. I think I then expected this to be the beginning of a ""move"" and that it would then lead to him saying something... but we have since went back to just our regular general chats.

I recently got to the point that I decided i was going to emotionally distance myself because he's clearly not interested in anything further, and Im just making things worse for myself waiting and hoping for him to do something, and then out the blue he surprises me with tickets to my favourite event next year.

I am hoping to get some insights about my particularly bleak situation. I am a 26-year-old man who suffers from a type of erectile dysfunction called a venous leak. Essentially, blood cannot be sufficiently trapped in the penis as more of it flows out than in. This is non-treatable at the moment. The only ""solution"" is to get a penile implant which is irreversible, costly, and not only causes a loss of penis length but also a loss of sensation in a significant percentage of patients. Needless to say, this is something I would only consider as a last resort. Given current strains on the health care system and its niche nature, I will likely be 30 by the time I could even get the surgery. 

As with most men who suffer from this condition, the first symptoms appeared at puberty. Since I really had nothing to compare to (except for porn which I always knew wasn't very realistic) it took me quite a while to realize I had a problem. While growing up, I always assumed that the issue was phycological. I told myself my penis would get properly hard once I was with a real woman and the reason my erections were poor was due to the lack of a real human being. 

I am also still a virgin. I spent my late teens and early twenties laser focused on school and work. There were some dates here and there but no relationships or sex. At age 25, I began to develop a strong feeling of being behind in my personal life.  So, after getting a better handle on some social anxiety and self esteem issues, I made a commitment to enter the dating market in early 2020.

I truly hope to find a woman who will accept my situation but I don’t know how realistic that really is. 

I feel like life has handed me an insurmountable double whammy. A sex and love life that was gone before it even began. It feels pointless to date now knowing that my “machinery” is broken.

The general vibe in that post was very much,I'm grand now. But that's not true in the slightest ahahah

So after talking to her friend the other week I realised I was a rebound. She had apparently broken up with the bf a week before we had started texting. Bummer.

Maybe I can understand how she wanted to just feel loved? 
Maybe she's just not interested? 

 was running through my empathy tank and lemme tell you that thing ran dry fast. 

So I do my bit of social media stalking and find her ex. Then I see that post I liked..... Oh wait. Why is she posing for her grad photos with him, ..ah for fucks sakes

So that's been fun

Like the spiral it had already sent me down was unprecedented. My mental health has never been worse. I've always had low self esteem and rakes of anxiety. Couple that with final year exams,not eating properly, drugs and yeah Im talking to the college counseling service. 

Like it's long overdue but all of this, would've been sorted if she had the balls to just say I'm not interested. 

I get sad cause I've never told anyone I had feelings for them. And I was really excited to maybe tell her. Ive had so many regrets of not asking that I just don't want to live the rest of my life as a series of regrets. 

I've always been shy and had low self esteem. In a healthy way this made me confront that more than I ever have. It's great just bad timing. I'm gonna fail at least two modules in college and will have to do repeats in August... yay

It defo fucked a bit with my sense of self worth and physical appearance too. Like objectively she's out of my league and here I was thinking, wow, maybe looks don't matter all!

Brings me back to my first tinder experience. I broke it off cause I didn't know how to handle my emotions. She was very appreciative but she could've left out the 'I never found you attractive anyway' bit.

Like I know I'm not that bad looking, could be toned up a tiny bit and lose the acne then I'd be a fucking model I swear to fuck hahahahahah

And I don't tell myself (cause ego) that I'm a talented musician but I know I am, I've been on tour and made records so that has to be mean something 

I'm sound. I can cook. I teach kids how to swim. I'm a lifeguard. I write music. I'm good craic. I'm easy going
Like what do you want ?

I will find someone hopefully. It'll take ages.... ugh but it might happen. Ideally before I turn 30


This turned into a rant again. So fair play for making it this far, hope you learned something cause I defo did!

Growing up, my parents were always busy working, so it was my grandfather and grandmother that practically raised me. Both of them thought me many valuable lessons on how to be a good person, a family man, and someone who is caring and respectful to all.

While never explicitly talked about, my grandparents (who happen to be traditional Catholic Italians) also implied how sexual intercourse was more about ""making love"". While I am definitely not religious myself, I've carried on some of these morals, including how I view sex. To me, I know that I wouldn't fit into the whole hookup culture nowadays. In college, I was definitely very sociable and well balanced with my studies and social life (attending sporting events, local parties, etc), but I never even considered hooking up with random girls. I've been in 2 relationships, and those were the only 2 women I've slept with. One was near the start of my undergrad, the other was near the end (both approximately 1.5 years). I actually ended both those relationships, for reasons I will explain in a bit.

So like I said, I've never been into the hookup culture. That being said, I was always the ""therapist"" in my friend group. The guys and girls I knew would text me/call me to talk about issues they had with their dating life, or family, school, etc. They knew I was very approachable, super non-judgmental, and a great listener. But ironically, here's one thing that stuck out for a lot of my girl friends: I was pro-sex. So while I'm not into hookups, I think others should have the liberty to do what they want and not be judged for it. Specifically, if ever my girl friends felt bad about their dating life or sex lives, or were ashamed about having hookups, whenever they approached me I always told them to not worry about what others think, and to just focus on what you want to do (while being safe!). And I did a pretty damn good job at making all those people feel better

A year into the relationship with the first girl I dated, we had a fun spontaneous night where we talked about our dating history. We both knew that neither one of us had dated anyone else previously. However, she admitted that during the first couple of months of dating, she had a ""ho phase"" (that's what she called it), where she was literally sleeping with a bunch of guys on tinder. In fact, she was still sleeping with some of her hookup buddies when we first started going out on dates (after I first asked her out). She told me that when I asked her to be my girlfriend, she cut things off with all her hookup buddies. This caught me by surprise, but I tried to shrug it off. But long story short, I had a sick feeling in my stomach for weeks after finding out about that, and I told her that I couldn't see her anymore.

I felt so bad about it, but I knew that I wasn't comfortable being in the relationship anymore.

About a year later, I was dating another girl. I knew she had dated just one guy prior to me, but once again on a spontaneous night she revealed that she had a ""ho phase"" too. But she was more honest with me than the first girl.... She told me that most of the guys she hooked up with were f\*\*\*boys, douchebags, etc. She was telling me how she was heartbroken after her first breakup, and used tinder to cope with it. She talked to me proudly how she built herself a roster of 5-6 guys at one point (after a dozen one night stands). She even admitted than she never used condoms with any of them, ""because it doesn't feel as good"", AND she had two instances of pregnancy scares (both false alarms) with 2 different douchebags. I tried so hard to shrug it off, and to focus on what was important: having her in my life in the present, not what her past was. But the biggest red flag wasn't even that. She told me how her ex-hookups and her were still friends on Instagram (and 2 on snapchat). She claimed that she never talked to them, and if a guy messaged her she would ignore him, and that she only keeps them around because they post ""stupid funny stuff"". I remember telling my cousin about that one time, and she was in shock, claiming that was incredibly a red flag that they're still around on IG/Snap. She even told me that whenever she herself gets into a relationship she cuts off any flings she's had in the past. While I trusted my gf at the time and knew she would never (physically) cheat on me, I knew this didn't sit well with me. This time around, I didn't wait weeks. I broke up with her the next day. And why I felt worse about it this time was that the reason she spoke to me so openly and honestly was because of the fact everyone knew how I was the Therapist, I've been known to be super non-judgmental.

I went back to my cousin to talk about this because I felt horrible. However, she (who was also close with our grandparents) told me that I wasn't in the wrong. She explained that I didn't enjoy being in a relationship with those girls anymore because I found out that they don't share the same values and ideals as I do, and that they certainly didn't share the same views of sex as I did. My cousin explained that it's okay to have let go of those girls. In fact she said she did the same thing once; she once broke up with a guy after finding out that he slept with an entire women's soccer team in college in a span of months. I wasn't entirely sure what she meant, until a mutual friend told me that my ex-gf I had just broken up with was on another ""ho phase"" (in the spike of a pandemic). As my cousin had said, ""the past may not matter as much, but it can still define who you are today"".

A couple weeks ago, I got on Hinge and went on my first date since April 2021. The girl and went to grab some food and had some fun wild conversations. Funny enough, she started blabbing about her past at some point to (she chuckled a lot). She told me she dated like 6 guys, some lasted a couple weeks while others lasted over a year. But what stuck out to me was that while she was dating off tinder, she was relationship-oriented. She focused on dating one guy at a time, and see if things work out. She also added that while swiping/messaging for the first time, she wanted to be intellectually attracted to the guy (ability to hold a conversation was key). If she felt the guy was a douchebag or just wanted sex, she would not pursue him. While being open, she even told me some crazy wild sex stories with her exes, which was far more wild than any of the ""ho phases"" my exes had. But hearing that, I actually laughed with her. I didn't feel uncomfortable at all with her telling me all this, because I knew that she had similar values that I had (specifically, view on sex). All those wild sex stories she told me involved men that she was committed to, even if it ended up being some summer fling guy. And most importantly, when she did get into a relationship she was 100% committed to the guy and had no ""residue"" from previous relationships or flings.

While we went on a few more dates, we decided not to see each other again since she worked overnight as a nurse, which didn't mesh with my schedule. But I'm starting to understand myself better. I spent years blaming myself, and I even looked to reddit posts from other guys who were in similar situations. Most comments I observed were typically the ""How dare you sl\*t shame her, she deserved better!"" or ""her past does not matter!"", which obviously made me question myself even more. But after that one great date, I'm willing to continue finding someone I can date who shares the same values.

That being said, I'm not sure how to spot out women like the girl I had a great date with. I'm not the best at reading people off first looks or texts. What should I do to integrate into the modern world of dating (apps and all), while not being disappointed if ever the girl doesn't match my standards?

TL;DR - I realized over the past couple years that I can't date girls who've had casual sex in the past. I don't care about body count or experience, but I'm strictly trying to date girls who have a ""commitment"" mindset and have high standards for themselves as well.

So I started to develop a little bit of a ‘work crush’. Me and a girl I work with have always had a kind of relentless teasing, sarcastic insults type thing right from day one. We just kind of clicked straight away in that we felt comfortable joking with each other like that. In the past couple of weeks though I feel like it’s been progressing past that into genuine chemistry; the teasing is the same but it’s become more like a funny inside joke we have, we kept having our breaks together and just sitting having those amazing conversations where you go from serious, personal stuff to laughing uncontrollably with each other over stupid shit. It feels like, at the very least, we’ve become pretty good friends. In the last couple of weeks I think I started getting a bit of a crush, but I’ve been insanely unlucky in dating, and am very hesitant to pursue anything with a coworker, so I just rationalised it as us being friendly.

But over the past couple of days it feels like it’s gone even further. When we talk alone now and someone else enters the room we sometimes drop whatever we were talking about and pick it back up late, almost like others are intruding. She was upset over something one day and I was comforting her over it and she laughed about how it was weird having me not tease her instantly, and I think it made her realise I do care about her beyond that. 

Today as I left work she told me she’d need to message me later to update me about something that was happening in work. I thought she was just saying that jokingly, since we’ve never really messaged or anything outside of work, but later on she genuinely dm’d me and we’ve been talking about literally anything we can all night. It feels like we’re just constantly taking little steps of getting closer and closer.

to preface why i cant be in a relationship, ive been cheated on in the past twice in two serious relationships, so thats why i have immense trouble committing.

as time has gone on, a few of my friends have commented that my fwb have more of an open relationship rather than a fwb kind of dynamic because of how often we talk to one another. i started thinking more about this and kind of agreed. im not sure if i could see myself in a monogamous relationship in the future because i just have a shitty feeling that all guys eventually end up cheating or at least think about other women in a sexual way, so why not have it out in the open and have open communication vs the false promise of monogamy just to be let down? if im honest with myself, if there was a chance at a truly monogamous relationship i would appreciate it but i just dont think true monogamy is possible especially with social media and the amount of choice both men and women have everyday.

So I started to develop a little bit of a ‘work crush’. Me and a girl I work with have always had a kind of relentless teasing, sarcastic insults type thing right from day one. We just kind of clicked straight away in that we felt comfortable joking with each other like that. In the past couple of weeks though I feel like it’s been progressing past that into genuine chemistry; the teasing is the same but it’s become more like a funny inside joke we have, we kept having our breaks together and just sitting having those amazing conversations where you go from serious, personal stuff to laughing uncontrollably with each other over stupid shit. It feels like, at the very least, we’ve become pretty good friends. In the last couple of weeks I think I started getting a bit of a crush, but I’ve been insanely unlucky in dating, and am very hesitant to pursue anything with a coworker, so I just rationalised it as us being friendly.

But over the past couple of days it feels like it’s gone even further. When we talk alone now and someone else enters the room we sometimes drop whatever we were talking about and pick it back up late, almost like others are intruding. She was upset over something one day and I was comforting her over it and she laughed about how it was weird having me not tease her instantly, and I think it made her realise I do care about her beyond that. 

Today as I left work she told me she’d need to message me later to update me about something that was happening in work. I thought she was just saying that jokingly, since we’ve never really messaged or anything outside of work, but later on she genuinely dm’d me and we’ve been talking about literally anything we can all night. It feels like we’re just constantly taking little steps of getting closer and closer.

Now, I’ve had zero romantic luck, and I think workplace romances can be messy, and I am painfully oblivious when a girl’s into me, but I have reason to get my hopes up at least a little here, right? It feels like there’s chemistry there for sure, it’s been comfortable and fun with her since the first time we talked, not to mention we have similar interests and view a lot of things the same way. On the other hand, if things go badly somehow, I’m gonna have to see her all the time, and I know from firsthand experience ‘don’t shit where you eat’ is a solid bit of advice.

Let me begin to say that English isn’t my native language so I probably make many grammer mistakes, I apologize for the mistakes.

To explain the story I will explain how we met in February. I saw her at my college as I was walking in the hallway. She looked lost and asked me where the cafe was. I explained to her in which direction she could find it and she asked if I could ’take her there’. We were walking and I asked just some questions, like: ‘’you study here too?’’ (she isn’t in the same college as me), ‘’you like this kind of music’’. After we reached the spot we said goodbye against each other. I accidentally found her social media 3 days later and started following her. I texted her via her social media and she remembered who I was. We did talk for quite some time and the conversation seemed smooth. I asked her number and she gave it to me, I was quite surprised she was talking to me, as she is a really pretty girl with many, many other boys trying to ‘’win her over’’. We did talk on WhatsApp for some time and the vibe seemed to be there.

In the beginning I had always started the conversation with her, but a month (or two) later she also started conversations with me and regularly send me ‘’goodmorning, how are you?’’. She also always liked my photos on social media and commented on it, or saying that I have a ‘nice’ picture on my profile. At this point I really wanted to asked her out in real life (as a person, I really like face to face conversation more in comparison so just texting). I asked to hang out some time and she said yes, but when I wanted to set a date she said that she was quiet busy at the moment and don’t know when she have free time. Of course I totally understand that, everyone have a period when you are more busy.

After that, the conversations where going on as the same, but when I asked her again to meet up this time she said she didn’t felt well for some time and that it was impossible to meet with each other at the moment. Again, I understand that your health is the most important factor in live. I did say that when she feels better, she should hit me on so we can meet. She agreed to that.

3 weeks later and we talked just normally (she still started conversation, quite fast responded to me) but never talked about if she was better or not and could meet with me. I know that I also could ask her if she was well enough to meet, but from my viewpoint it would seem that I’m pressuring her. Again I find her well-being really important.

2 months later or something and I decided to ask for the third time if we could meet, because in all those time I didn’t hear about the meet up anymore. This time she didn’t even response to that, she simply just ignored the question. After some time I send another text and she just response normal to that one. I was quite sad about that tbh.

Now we are in december and things went changing. She ignored me more and more and didn’t sent any goodmorning messengers at all. She also didn’t was that talkative anymore (we still had good conversation, but the ‘’vibe’’ was less i guess). She did say that she had some health issues but yeah. And randomly 2 days ago she just started to ignore me completely. I did send her 3 messenger already but still no reply in 48 hours, but she is still online, still on social media, still posting on her timeline. Does that mean I’m just done for her, I’m nothing to her anymore. She just found someone else, or she hates me now?

So yeah this was the story, I know it is pretty long but I wanted to explain it with my best abilities. Oh and to sum up some things about myself and her:

*Me 22m : I’m not a guy who stands out in a group. I’m always a bit to myself but like to talk to other. In the begin, I’m never really all open to others, but over time when I feel accustomed to you I will open up and can let me show me my real self. I know that this is not a good trait or something, but it is really hard for me to open up quickly when I barely know her, which can make me seem ‘’shy’’. And I really like to read books and I like to draw, so yeah not your standard cool funky hobby for a 22 old. People call me always very sweet, but also tell me that I should be able to stand up for myself when needed. I find my looks just average (I’m not standing out or something haha) I also haven’t really have friends since my only best friend moved out. :(*

*She 18f : from what I know she is very different than me. She is very open to many people (from social media, but of course it doesn’t always picture a good observation), have many friends, never shy and always like to hang around. She is really pretty and really funny. (Personally I always tought how could such a girl even wanted to talk to me)*

So yeah what does this all mean? What can I do or should I move on? I find it really hard because I experienced that girls just ghosted me a couple of times know, which have influence on my self esteem of course (I’m just a human).

We had two dates. The first one was in a bar where we got to know each other and talked a lot.  
We went on a Christmas Market for the second date and got more intimate and exchanged a couple of kisses at the end of the date.  

But I'm not sure what I should suggest as a third date.
I wouldn't mind just hanging out at my place or her place. We could cook something and watch a movie. 
I honestly don't have sex in mind but would love to get a bit cuddly with her.  
Is this going a bit to fast based on the fact that we only had a couple kisses at the last date? (It wasn't really making out).

So my friend sent me the link below and we actually both laughed about it and how oblivious the OP seems, honestly, I dont get a lot of options online, like I get matches but they eventually ghost haha and I thought there is no way girls would want to meet in person. I tried it today...honestly it works pretty well imo. I know a lot of guys (myself included) thought OP was being condescending but yeah this is actually not a bad idea. So doing daily tasks today I approached 10 women and I got 4 rejections (2 claimed they were taken, 2 said they aren't interested), I got 4 numbers, 1 Snapchat and 1 Instagram, the girl who originally gave me her Instagram sent me her number after a few DMs back and forth. Ive had back and forth conversations with all the girls that gave me their numbers and the Instagram girl, I dont feel like I am carrying the conversation myself which is opposite to what I get on online dating. I actually had one phone call and she called me first! These are all women who imo are attractive and probably wouldnt respond to me online.

But yeah guys I think there is some merit to what she is saying honestly as condescending as she may be. If everything works out I have 2 dates on Saturday and 1 tomorrow. It works I think at least try it out. Btw Im not like crazy handsome I can pm a selfie if you want, (5 foot 9, overweight but you cant tell haha) Im also not ugly lol and I have dimples so I think that may help. One more thing 2 of the women that rejected me outright were Asian, Im black, so you may just not be peoples preference and thats ok. I got the best responses from black and white women. Anyways just thought to share this, maybe try it sometime ngl its nerve racking in the beginning.

So my ex (M21) and I (F21) broke up back in August 2021. We were together for 2 going on 3 months when he ended it in a really shitty way if I’m being honest. He broke up with me on our way to our trip, left me in the hotel room crying while he enjoyed the trip. Not the ideal way to spend one of my free weekends. His mom had apologized to me and my parents absolutely hate him for what he did. I’ve been healing and taking time for myself during this time with minimal contact with him. I had tried to extend the olive branch for friendship but he rejected it and pushed me away. Now that I’m okay without us being friends and realized that it was for the better we were apart since he has a lot to work through, he came back. It started off with a message from him saying he wanted to talk. We ended talking about everything that went wrong with the relationship and my feelings on it. He apologized finally for everything shitty he did and I forgave him for it. In the end, we ended up being friends. When we were talking about school and helping one another with subjects, he brought up how his mom was talking about me. It was weird since we weren’t even talking about parents. He said that she was talking about his older brother and that older brother’s gf and somehow she started to talk about me. She was saying how I had a good vibe and how I always meant well but I think he was holding back some info. He then changed the subject. 
Now the other night, we were listening to music together on Spotify and somehow ended up talking on the phone for an hour. 
He had said he didn’t mind talking on the phone every now and then but he wanted to respect my space as we were new to becoming friends. 
I’ve asked a few guy friends and they said that guys don’t come back unless they miss something and how he must miss me.

I’m just confused on his actions. Any advice is welcome.

INFO: I’ve asked him if he has any feelings for me and he says he doesn’t. I don’t have any feelings for him.

He broke up with me because he was scared of how good it was going. Another factor was his ex girlfriend showed up to his house with stuff from their break up from over a year and half prior. I had confronted him about him.

Tl;dr Ex came back into my life and he has brought up his mom and talking on the phone.

I’ve struggled with dating due to lack of interest from women on dating apps (I’ve only gone on a handful of dates) and I don’t have a huge social circle. Frankly, I also work a lot (~60 hrs/week) so it’s hard for me to work on the social aspect, but it is on my mind as an area of improvement. I’m in the DC area. Here is a little about me:

Height: 5’8
Weight:~132 lbs. I have a four pack and working on getting a six. I hit the gym at least 4-5 times per week and do try to stay below my calorie limit.
Face: I think I have pretty good hair and decent face. I’ve received a lot of complements on hair from women. I’d rate my face+hair to be a 6.5-7/10 depending on the day.
Career/Income:Investment Banker (Yes, I make six figures so paying for stuff isn’t a problem)
Degree: Undergrad in Finance from a good school. Thinking about getting a MBA at some point. 
Race: Asian
Transportation: I have an Acura sports sedan, so I can get from place to place/pick her up, so logistics is not an issue.
Personality Type: ISFP at home/INTJ at work.
Hobbies: Cars, Investing, Trying new foods and Traveling (Been to major cities in US and abroad).
What else do I bring to the table: I think I’m pretty funny, I do have confidence and can read the room pretty well. I’m not socially awkward and can make eye contact with no issues. I have good communication and listening skills.

I am also looking for a partner but it seemed to me he may be looking to settle down relatively soon. 

In any case, his behavior since the date has left me questioning whether I want to see him again.

I pray that you know this” and it really rubbed me the wrong way given we only met once. Then I didn’t respond to a later text of his because it was getting kind of tedious responding with the time difference and he facetimed me while I was on my trip. He ended the call saying that “you can get back to your trip and not think about me” and I interpreted it as him kinda guilttripping me.I agreed to see him this week but I’m having major doubts and am thinking about backing out.
