It’s not just women I am wanting to talk about. I am willing to talk about toxic men as well but I can’t help but feel like it is truly time to end this one specific toxic gender stereotype. At a time where I feel like women have never been more unaware of basic male psychology and openly complain about men flirting with them while at the same time expecting us to keep treating them like they’re “the prize” in every relationship why shouldn’t we talk about this? I feel like ending this toxic stereotype would cause a domino affect that could cause many other positive changes to happen. Maybe men will finally feel comfortable talking about all the problems they experience in life if they didn’t have to bend over backwards for every women that they date. Either way you can’t call yourself a man and pretend like this isn’t a problem. Because it just is. We’re not options and I don’t think women will realize that until it becomes a world wide movement. They did it with “ending fat shaming” why can’t we do it for this? I want to start a page. Make memes. Spread awareness. This should not be seen as a “mans job” anymore. And by definition anybody who thinks other wise literally suffers from toxic masculinity. Men have emotions. Men have anxiety. It’s time for women to realize that not every gender specific issue/stereotype can be blamed on us. This is a toxic stereotype that is pushed by mostly women that needs to just end. It’s good starter problem for a lot of our issues because if you think about this there a lot of other issues that our connected to this issue too.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ngoy2f/does_anybody_want_to_help_me_start_a_reddit_page/

Now tonight she texted me that she felt like I would not be ready to handle her emotional state right now. 

So I called her. 

We had a long conversation. She confessed she suffers from BPD. But also stated that it is not very extreme. She doesn't hurt herself or engages in other self destructive behaviour. Only her emotions can be a rollercoaster and she needs time to trust someone.

I am a very emotional and empathetic person. I have a few friends who suffer from disorders like PTSD or Bipolar-pesonality disorder, and they see me as their anchor. They talk to me about everything and I feel like I can really help them sometimes. 

But those are friendships. 

I know have read a great deal of articles about BPD and tried my best to get some understanding of what people suffering from it go through.

I'm not sure what is like to date someone with BPD. I want to give it a shot because I felt a real connection on our first date + she is soo pretty that I can't help myself but have a crush on her.

Can you give me any advice on how to approach this whole thing? What can I expect? What are does and don'ts?

* Step 3: After matching, you can see his/her full profile then start to chat.

That's it, no swiping anymore. People will look at other heart first, then their photos later.

Earlier today I was at a subway/gas station parking lot. I looked and saw my ex in his car eating. We made eye contact and he waved me over. I went and got in his truck. He gave me a hug and we shared a kiss. We talked a little bit and he asked me what I was doing today. I told him I didn't have any plans. He asked if I wanted to hangout later and watch movies. 

MA couple hours later I went to his house. I was all dolled up and dressing really sexy. We just talked and cuddled on the couch for an hour or so. Soon after we started kissing and I pulled down his boxers and gave him a blowjob. We went into his bedroom and he started putting his hand between my thighs. I took my skirt and underwear off and we ended up having sex. 


After we were done we just cuddled on his bed and fell asleep for a while before I left. When I was leaving he gave me a long hug and kissed me again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ngs17k/does_he_still_like_me_or_did_he_just_want_sex/

I need to know if other people have heard it too. 

The story goes like this:

'This happened to a friend of mine, I swear. She went on a date with a guy, he dropped her home and she let him in for a cup of tea, but wasn't feeling sleeping with him, so she said goodbye, let him out and went upstairs to sleep. Later that night she heard rustling downstairs and thought her housemate must be home. The noise went on for a long time though, and she started to feel scared. She called the police and they came to check it out, but when they got there they told her, ""do not come downstairs, stay in your room and lock the door"". Turns out the guy from the date had broken back into her house and was laying down plastic on the walls, on the floor, setting up a Dexter scene. He had a hammer. He was going to murder her. So... don't invite guys to your house.'

We're not really friends more like aquintances because she tried to guilt trip me and the people in my friend group. On top of that she tried to break my friend group apart and when she realised that she couldn't she tried to play the victim. I ignored the stories as I didn't believe she was the type of girl to do that ESPECIALLY when she knew he's my bf. However as time progressed more and more people told me about her continuous flirting. I too started noticing all the flirting glances, jokes etc. Yet I ignored this as my bf told me that she's just a friend and I didnt want to seem jealous and insecure so I believed him. This was until my roomate whose also one of my closest friends asked me if it didn't bother me that this girl kept flirting with my beau. I told her it did but I didnt know what to do and she gave me advice which I followed. I confronted them both and we sorted everything thing out. Everything turned out great and I'm still dating this guy. However recently his friends started telling me that the girl is still flirting with him. When I confronted her once again she tried to play on my emotions and play the victim. I told him that I really don't like her and now he goes out of his way to avoid her which is really difficult as they share a few classes together.

I like to think being raised this way scarred me in a way that turned me into a dumbass basically in some ways and it took me a long time to shed it. But I probably was just stupid. A lot of it sounds more like a really stupid dumbed down “feminist” agenda than that though tbh.

Like I believed for an astonishingly long time that women wearing revealing clothing and flaunting themselves etc had nothing to do with sex appeal or seduction or flirting in any circumstances. That idea was sexist or something, can’t girls just be girls? That just cracks me up now. And I was sooo incredibly rude if I happened to ever get distracted and accidentally glance at bare skin or something. What a pervert. All kinds of shit like that. To this day I have no idea what a girl flirting with me looks like. Maybe that’s because women don’t flirt with me or maybe that’s because I’m an idiot. I have no clue.

I put women on this enormous pedestal. They never do anything shocking or naughty or bad or rude or anything like that and if you think any of them do you are soo sexist. Don’t you understand what women have gone through? I’d think that about all these “sexist”, pervert, gross guys the girls were fucking all the way back to middle school.

Okay so, I’m 19F and he’s 20M.
We’ve been online friends for almost a year but things changed since March
Indeed, like we were close friends I asked him advices on what lingerie I had to buy exct, he loved the idea of being my stylist.
We were joking about it a lot and finally we turned the thing into a game: If you get too horny about the situation you lose.
So we became friends with benefits. (No nudes but hella close)
It was really fun first but then the tension between us was so high that it became frustrating to not be together. 

We had a discussion and I told him that even if I’m not yet in love with him my body needs him asf and like I’m scared to be hurt in the future I prefer to be actually in a relationship with him.

He said that he felt the same but didn’t want a distance relationship cause he scared of being away from me for too long (pandemic anxiety)

So I responded that being friends with benefits was too frustrating for me and that if we stopped, I couldn’t seeing him as a «normal» friend. 

He didn’t agree and said he will always wants to be friends with me no matter what.

I didn’t respond for a week lol and I reached him to finally agree being simply friends but guys it’s so hard not tempting him or fully express my love .. 
It’s like I’m cutting my freedom, idk what to do 

Do you think I need to stop everything with him or not?

Which do you prefer and why?

It's no big mystery that dating in person is different then online. 

From a male perspective, it seems to inflate some womens' sense of value, and cause them to be pickier.

Men...are more or less the same. Dick picks/rude messages =cat calls.


Also, I've been doing some thinking, and had a question.

1) It's said that people are more shallow online, and things are mostly based on looks.


If someone swiped left on you or passed your profile, due to, ""not meeting their standards"" would that very same person reject you in real life?

If so, is dating in real life really any better?

I say this, because some of the profiles that I've seen are a little nitpicky (Must be 5'11 or higher, and such)

77,ngw6g5,1621504987,Even when we went on dates everyday he never texted me at night or even called and when I have him i have all of him and then nothing,"So I know this guy since 2 years, we have been close to eachother but this guy never asked me out even though he showed all the signs of being interested all his friends told me so as well, but he almost never texted me and hardly called me but when in college while together he treated me affectionately there is visible chemistry between us.

I was strongly attracted towards him but even after a he showed no efforts and I left the hopes tried not focussing on him even if it was so much difficult,

Later when we started staying in the same city we started hanging out all the time he took me to all his favourite places, to meet his friends,we started going on dates, I assumed atleast for now he may be attracted he will text but he almost never did, If I called sometime he would talk a lot

It would be different if he was just any stranger, I could let go
I've tried to let go even then 
Because it's hard not to miss him or not being able to talk but I can't help that he shows no efforts 

He being a friend there is somewhat of affection attached and even if I very well try looking away from him ,
even  If I'm n ot talking or contacting him , a part of me still hurts and a lot

Any similar experiences? How to handle this kinda situation smartly?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ngw6g5/even_when_we_went_on_dates_everyday_he_never/
78,ngw6qi,1621505016,Difficulty opening up,"25F here. Let's just say my parents are not the nicest people and as a result I have extreme difficulty opening up to anyone. Men I talk to/date will tell me about things that worry them in life, vent to me about certain things, etc-things that I guess normal people do in relationships! And to be honest, I do have a few close friends that I also do this with. But it took me a lot of time to get to that point with them. I had to know them very well for a long time before opening up and being vulnerable. The reason is this: my parents are very impatient people. They expect me to be this perfect being who never gets upset, never gets stressed, never gets sad. Anytime I've done any of the above, they have yelled and screamed at me. For example- There was a high chance we'd have to see COVID positive patients and the school HAD the vaccines but was not giving it to us due to administrative reasons and was giving it to those who had no patient contact-when I got mildly frustrated at the school my parents lost it with me, simply because I was frustrated and it's in their mind a sin to be anything other than happy. Bear in mind this is a rule only applying to me and my brother: my parents yell and scream at the drop of a hat and the idea of moving back home soon even temporarily makes my blood pressure spike. It's at the point that I'm so scared of my parents, anytime anything bad happens and I have to tell them, I stutter and stammer and I don't naturally even have a stammer.

So this lends me to not being able to open up with guys especially if I just met them recently. I have this inbuilt fear that like my parents, they'll snap at me and yell at me too. I know it's not logical, but at this point the fear of opening up is probably a little unconscious.

Anyone else face this too? How did you deal with it? I know vulnerability and opening up is crucial to any relationship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ngw6qi/difficulty_opening_up/
79,ngwdz4,1621505741,DAE forever remember the ppl they have sex with?,"Just curious to compare male versus female perspectives on this....

Ladies, DAE feel like they remember every single dude they ever had sex with? (This is def true for me, and it’s why I take sex quite seriously at my age now. To me, it means I’m allowing that dude to take up permanent real estate in my memory till the day I die, which isn’t a decision I take lightly anymore).

Guys, do you feel the exact opposite? Like to you, are women more like sexual meals you enjoy temporarily, digest, dispose of, and then you completely forget about what’s her name b/c sex is allegedly so matter-of-fact &amp; emotionally devoid for your gender, so the stereotypes make it seem?

As a result, I'm very very cautious to back out the instant anyone shows a sign they're disinterested. I know there has to be a middle ground here, so can I get some thoughts? Maybe some concrete examples of where someone crossed the line, or where someone chased intensely and it worked?

83,ngxkds,1621509695,The Uselessness of Dating Apps and Matches,"Dating apps have obviously gotten much worse in the past 6 years, after not having to use them at any time in those 6 years. I mean, I'm not gonna say that using the apps were easy back then, but they were so much better handled and I at least had a semi-regular influx of conversations back then, even if I was ghosted the next day most of the time. These days however, I have had maybe 6 conversations since September and all but one of them ghosted me within the same day. The other one ghosted after a couple of days. And I haven't had these problems for lack of trying. I put effort in my messages and responses and I'm on the apps I have fairly regularly. I consistently get to the point where the apps has no more people to show me. I'm even having to expand my searches to people 5 hours out of my way just so I can potentially have someone to talk to. After the shit that happened to me over the past few years and with how my last relationship ended, I'm honestly wondering if it's worth trying to find someone if I'm never gonna find someone.

So quick sketch of the situation: 
we're both women late 20's, met online 3 months ago, went on 1 date a month ago that went well (we just live across borders so seeing each other is difficult because of corona).

Up untill now everything wen pretty good.
But she never initiates. If I didn't say ""hi"", she could go days without talking. I'm imagining that she needs lots of alone time and I'm trying to give her some space. When we call tho, she can literally talk for hours untill the point i have to stop her. 

I'm sensing mixed signals. She definitely likes me, even told me she rarely feels so comfortable around someone. But at the same time she can be very private/closed off. 

I'm sensing this is her personality, but Im used to dating extroverted people. So im new to this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ngyn0e/dating_an_introverted_woman/
