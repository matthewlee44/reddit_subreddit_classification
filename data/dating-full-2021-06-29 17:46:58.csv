It all hit me like a flash flood. One day, I decided to finally end things which he immediately agreed on without any restraints. 

A week passed, after such a heartless response to our supposed break up, he texted me asking if we could try but as ""friends who have fun only"".

I have nothing but regrets — regret of wasting so much time and effort with someone who only saw me at his convenience and ultimately, regret of not loving myself enough to allow such an undeserving man to make me feel so unwanted.

I continued to see this girl at her job every morning when I went in to get my cup of coffee. For a couple days I went to a place across the street but this coffee was terrible so I had to go back to her job. It was kind of awkward at first I guess with the two of us trying to ignore each other.

Finally yesterday morning I went in to get my coffee and she actually said hi to me and I said hi back. Later in the day I got a text from her and she asked what time I was working until and could she call me once I was off work.

She called me last night and we talked for a while. She apologized for ghosting me and said that she has real trust issues and she gets anxiety a lot when it comes to dating guys. She also said she does like me and thinks I’m cool but she doesn’t think she wants to date anyone right now. On top of trying to work out her trust issues she’s really busy. She’s basically raising her daughter by herself and working two different jobs too. Plus going to school.

I told her that was ok and I wish she could have just told me this in the first place. She said it was hard because she wasn’t sure how I’d react. I said I understand where she’s coming from. I told her I think she’s a pretty great girl and at least we had two good dates and had some fun. She said maybe we’ll hang out again soon and I said that would be good.

We matched in April and he took me out to dinner. He seemed to be normal, very hard working and family oriented. He had told me prior to meeting that his dad (who he was very close to) was in the hospital from falling down the stairs and rupturing a few discs in his back. He told me he’s also been taking care of his little brother (who he’s also very close to) who’s 10 years old while his dads in the hospital. His stepmom (married to his father) apparently went ghost/MIA on the father and her 10 year old son because her parents were also sick and dying in the hospital. He told me he’d be his fathers main caregiver after his father gets out of the hospital as his fathers in rough shape. He also told me that he’d be taking on his fathers medical bills as his father was in a sticky situation with his work and had little to no health insurance.
 
A few weeks after our first date (we also hung out one more time after our first date), his father got released from the hospital. We made plans to get a hotel and stay overnight for the weekend. He told me he’d get a babysitter for his brother. Well, that Saturday rolls around and I haven’t really heard from him and so I send him a text confirming our plans and he had told me his father had passed away after just coming home from a few days prior. I send my condolences and give him his space as I can’t imagine what he’s going through.

He calls me at 3AM, the day his father passed. He was drinking and said he’s had a crazy day with his dad passing and everything and just wanted a normal conversation. He was drinking and driving and I told him he shouldn’t be doing that and I offered for him to stay over my house rather than drinking and driving around aimlessly. So he comes over around 4am and stayed over till the next day.

In between him taking care of his little brother and his father passing away, he tells me he’s moving into a new apartment to be closer to his work on top of making funeral arrangements (which he claims he’s paying for). One day he FaceTimed me and told me that he was house sitting his sisters apartment because she went to Florida. My first question to him was: why is your sister going to Florida when both of your father just passed away? And he said “idk I guess it’s her way of coping.” Seemed odd to me but I didn’t question the rest of it.

What also seemed weird to me was that he told me he was moving into his new apartment the day of his fathers funeral. Like how do you have the time to move into a new spot and attend a funeral? He also said his sister (because she went to Florida) and step mother did not attend his fathers funeral which seems wild to me. The day of his fathers funeral, he calls me around 9pm, tells me he’s still packing up some stuff for his new apartment. He asked if he could sleep over that night at my house, I told him sure.

A week or so goes by, we’re still regularly FaceTiming but then I noticed he wasn’t texting me as much. I send him a message telling him “I hope you’re doing ok and I’m thinking of you” and he apologizes for being MIA as this past month has been hectic but he still misses me though. I let it be, I don’t hear from him for a week but he posted on Snapchat. So I send him last text saying “hi, just thinking of you, I know things have been hectic for you etc”. And nothing, ghosted. 

What’s weird to me is that I don’t think his dad really died. There was no obituary online or in the newspaper. His own sister didn’t attend her fathers funeral. Why did he move into a brand new apartment the day of his fathers funeral…who has time to do all of that in one day? Oh and I looked up his fathers LinkedIn and he is still active on it, liking different peoples posts.

TL;DR at the bottom

I've noticed a lot of posts in the subs today talking about kissing, and a lot of people are talking about kissing on the first or second date. I didn't have a good amount of dating experience until the last two years (depression most of my 20s/late bloomer). So I feel like I'm out of the loop a little bit when it comes to dating.

Now that restrictions are loosened and more people are vaccinated I'm having decent success getting first dates off Hinge. Yet, I still haven't gotten past a third date with anyone. This is leading me to think that not kissing these women is telling them that I'm not interested/I'm sexually inexperienced (not a virgin, but it's been a very very long time). 

I will say that I always try to go for a hug or handshake when I first meet them. Some seem like they aren't open to any physical contact (reject the hug or even a friendly hand shake). So I respect their space and do not give them anything (and tell them I'm not interested after the date). 

Not to say I'm not a sexual person, but I just feel really timid kissing people I barely know (unless I felt a VERY strong connection which has only happened once). Am I ruining my chances of success at progressing to an actual relationship bc of this?

TL;DR: I've never kissed a woman on a first or second date. Didn't have any dating experience (and still have zero relationship experience) until the last two years. Trying to figure out if my lack of attempting kisses is ruining my chances at getting past second and third dates.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,868120,public,self,Is not going in for a kiss on first/second dates ruining my chances of success?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oaeobo/is_not_going_in_for_a_kiss_on_firstsecond_dates/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I am 10 years single and have no prospects for a relationship. I’ve come to the realization that I am pretty introverted. To me this means, being thoughtful about my words and actions and not trying to flex my uniqueness every chance I’m attracted to someone. I have very good social skills but do not feel the need for attention. I do not want to go to a bar/club, hit on a girl, dance with her, and take her home. That is not what I am looking for. I want a best friend that I can spend my life with. I don’t want to sit there all day and text some girl either.(Dating apps) So fucking annoying and boring. I want to spend time IRL with someone being fully present.

So if anyone can help, I have 2 questions.

How can I approach someone IRL and have the essence of my conversation be : I’m attracted to you, let’s go on a date and just get to know each other. Can I do this anywhere? Parking lot, when I’m a customer dealing with a worker etc.

And the second question, is it okay for me to do that and then set the date and wait to meet up and NOT spend my day sitting there texting about BS? In the past, I’ve done this and had girls cancel and say “I lost interest.” It was like 2 days between meeting and the date we set up.

As of now, I believe I have reached more relaxed and stable state in my personal life.

Unfortunately, due to high concentration on my education and career, I think I started to be more and more disconnected with ""fun"" and social life.  I rejected idea of having a girlfriend and ""fun life"" due to my commitment to education and career. I did not want any distractions during that time. Thus, it has been a long time since I had a girlfriend.

People have told me I’m funny as well, but I’m a shy girl who needs to be comfortable with people before opening up. For these reasons, I’m scared of meeting up with a guy and scaring him off if my personality shuts down or to them I’m uglier in person. 

My question is, how can I become comfortable around men and talking to them?

I've worked with a girl for a few years, we work in different offices and I occasionally bumped into her on work trips and training sessions pre-pandemic. She stays about 180 miles from where I stay and we've kept in touch through snapchat/IM at work. 

She's had a few boyfriends since I've known her and we've really just been friends but recently after she broke up with her last boyfriend we've been quite flirty with each other, but sometimes this would be on off. 

I am really attracted to her and would be keen to give a relationship a try, even though it would mean a lot of driving - and if it worked out would definitely consider relocating.

Since we've been talking, at first she didn't seem to be over her ex but now seems to be past this, but at the same time she has been talking to me she mentioned this friend who admitted he had a crush on her, although she didn't like him back. Over the past few weeks they seem to have done a lot together. Apparently the guy was in her friend group but it seems to be a bit more one on one. I can definitely see that he is trying to date her and I now appear to be competing with him. 

They definitely hang out like people who are dating or about to start.

I had been planning a trip to visit the city to see friends and potentially take her out while I was up there, but I feel like it would now just be as friends as I assume this guy will ask her out soon.

I really don't want to compete with someone, as surely if they liked me I wouldn't have to compete for them. This guy has the distance advantage as I would definitely have made a move by now.

I've liked this girl for a while and have seen her through two boyfriends - her friends set her up straight away after she broke up with her last boyfriend so I didn't have much of a chance.

I don't think I'd want to continue being as close if she dated this guy, don't think I could bear to see it.

I feel like it seems pretty set in stone that they will date soon, should I try compete? She says that it's not like their dating but I feel otherwise.

Scratch that, I barely have any experience with men since I don’t have any male friends. That being said, it’s no surprise that I’m terrified of talking to guys I find attractive.

I recently downloaded Tinder and got a few matches. There’s four guys that appeal to me the most, one being my age, one 20, one 21, and the other 22. My problem is that I have no idea how to approach them. I know I need to get out of my bubble, but I feel like I need to be a rocket scientist to crack the code of casually talking to guys without being a nervous wreck. 

What scares me even more than talking to them is the thought of ever landing a date with one of them. I have BDD so I don’t know what I look like, but according to family and friends, I’m beautiful. People have told me I’m funny as well, but I’m a shy girl who needs to be comfortable with people before opening up. For these reasons, I’m scared of meeting up with a guy and scaring him off if my personality shuts down or to them I’m uglier in person. 

My question is, how can I become comfortable around men and talking to them? An even bigger question is, how can I overcome the thought that I’m not pretty or good enough for someone to be interested in me? I consider Tinder to be exposure therapy, but I want to get to the point where talking to men is second nature.

During the week, we are constantly texting/snapping each other. We recently slept together too. During our second date, I mentioned how I’m not seeing/talking to anyone else and he said he hadn’t either. This most recent weekend, he was showing me some messages in his friends group chat and there was a message asking him if “that waitress from Friday ever texted him.” I asked him about it and he said when he was out on Friday, he was making some conversation with the waitress and his friend left his phone number without him knowing until they left. So then I felt like I had to bring up the “what are we?” talk.

I asked him if that waitress ever texted him, would he text her back, and he said maybe but he didn’t know. So I said I was under the impression that we were both only talking to each other and he said yes, that still stands. I said I was confused because of the waitress comment and he said that he’s not actively swiping on Hinge (where we met) but that because we never had the “exclusivity” talk, he was under the impression that if someone else interesting comes along, he’d be open to getting to know them. 

I understand that dating is complicated and everyone has different definitions, but I got so sad because I felt for a minute like I’m just keeping him company until he finds someone better. However, he did say that now that we are having the talk, we could be on the same page and he would like to make it exclusive so I said ok.

We met while we were still in university. I had friends that went to a university about two hours away from mine &amp; once when I was visiting them we were at a party where I met him. We hit it off right away, talking everyday &amp; visiting each other every other weekend. Things were very hot &amp; heavy for awhile. Then covid hit &amp; while we still talked everyday &amp; flirted all the time, we couldn’t see each other due to the fact that I had to go home &amp; I have family members that are immunocompromised. When I was able to return to school in the fall he would come &amp; visit me for the weekend about once a month. This continued into the spring semester. The spring semester is when I was introduced to his family. I didn’t meet them in person but sometimes when him &amp; I were facetiming if they were there they would talk to me &amp; say they couldn’t wait to meet me. He invited me to his house for the weekend recently, where I was able to meet his family &amp; they were lovely. While my family knows about him, they are deeply religious &amp; would disapprove, so I tell them is just a casual friend of mine. 
So even though we have talked everyday for a year &amp; a half, taken the time to visit one another, tried new things together, &amp; met one another’s family &amp; friends, he has yet to make things official. He is incredibly shy &amp; has a difficult time opening up, as do I, so whenever I try to bring this up, it gets real awkward &amp; goes nowhere. We are exclusive &amp; in some ways he treats me as if I’m his girlfriend. For example, he told me that his buddies at work kept referring to me as his girlfriend, so eventually he just referred to me as his girlfriend around them. I’ve also admittedly gone on a couple blind dates that my parents set me up on with guys in their church (since they would like me to get married in their church) &amp; he got very jealous about that even though I told him I just went on the dates to appease my parents. 
He is overall a great guy-he loves his family &amp; is very close with them, he has a small circle of good friends, he has very strong morals that he follows, he dedicates himself to his career &amp; hobbies, he is introverted &amp; easygoing. I just can’t figure out where this relationship is going. My friends all give me different answers-some have more of a negative view of the relationship &amp; say that he is probably just using me for sex or stringing me along until he finds a woman he really wants. Others say that he is just shy &amp; waiting for me to make a move or that it is good we are taking things slow because moving too fast this young will just lead to heartbreak. I would really appreciate anyone’s take on this, thank you so much in advance!

I’m a guy. And I have small amount of dating experience, just a committed relationship in that has since ended. I’m no psychologist but I do think this is interesting. A lot of men, including myself, have insecurities around dating a woman with that has had casual sex. I’ve never been able to understand it. All the justifications I’ve seen for this, vaginal tightness, human nature, pair bonding, really tend to lose water when you look at them more closely and some are just plain false.

After talking to a few of my friends about it, I have a theory that this insecurity comes from the idea of feeling lesser than the guy that was able to get a hookup out of someone we are trying to get a relationship out of. Let’s be honest casual sex isn’t for most men. Average looking Joes aren’t going to the bar and bringing a woman he just met back. It’s just a fact of life. So because a lot of guys aren’t the guys pulling left and right, the only way we can have sex with a woman is in a relationship.

If they know, guys like that are then confronted with the thought that this woman we’re dating, was willing to get intimate with some guy within a few hours of meeting him, but for us they’re making us wait weeks and after however many dates for an invite back to her place. This makes us feel like we’re lesser to the guy that was able to hook up with the girl we like in her eyes, which honestly has a good chance of being true. Who wants to feel like that?

This may be something that most guys understood they felt like, but I wasn’t able to articulate that this is how I subconsciously feel until recently. Am I spouting nonsense or is this actually a thing that’s common in guys.

Are there any women who understood this? How do you personally feel about this? Do those guys fears have any credence?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,868401,public,self,"I’m beginning to think I understand the insecurity a lot of men have behind not wanting to commit to a woman with a history but being willing to sleep with her, and I’d like to share my thoughts",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oai2mr/im_beginning_to_think_i_understand_the_insecurity/,all_ads,6,,,,,

It just felt so different than other first dates I've been on. I won't be dumb and call it ""love at first site"" but it seemed pretty clear we were both feeling whatever it was. I dropped her off at home and when I asked if she was interested in a second date, her reply was ""the sooner we can see each other again the better"". Needless to say, I was pretty excited. 

For the second date, we went to a ""barcade""/bowling place. Had a ton of fun there, and even had a group of girls come up to us asking what number date we were on. I guess they'd all made a bet and were shocked when we told them it was only the second date. One girl guessed we'd been seeing each other at least a couple of months. We went back to my place after and ended up talking on my couch until about midnight. When I eventually walked her to her car, we shared a really intense kiss and said goodbye. 

Third date was less than a week later. Cooked dinner for her at my place and watched a movie after. She had to call it early that night but still, it felt like everything went about as perfect as it could have. 

4th date, which was a week ago, was nothing special since we had plans for the weekend as well. Just dinner at some sushi place and she had to run to her parent's house shortly after so it was another quicker date.  

This past weekend, my sisters came into town to visit. Given how far away my family is from me, and opportunities would be limited, I told her she was welcome to meet my sisters if she was comfortable with it. She ended up having such a good time on Saturday that she asked if she could hang out with us Sunday too. Both of my sisters love her already and want to know when I'm going to ask her to be my girlfriend. 

On Sunday, she invited me to a 4th of July party next week where I'd get to meet her parents and pretty much spend the entire day with them. If you would have told me I'd be meeting someone's parents exactly 1 month in dating, I would have said you were crazy. 

We have had an open conversation about how we both realize some things are happening faster than some might consider ""normal"" but she says she is perfectly comfortable with it because she is extremely comfortable with me (of course, I feel the same with her). This morning I deleted Hinge from my phone. I haven't touched it since our first date but it felt like even having the profile at this point is stupid. 

Again, 1 month of seeing her and she has met my sisters, I am meeting her parents, and neither of us has even spent the night at each other's place yet (technically have planned it for this weekend, but still).

This is not hate towards women, just advice i'm giving off something that happened to me yesterday. Without further ado, theres this pretty woman \[Around 38-40W\] and about a 6/10 not too far from me so we're pretty much neighbors in a way. I never really talked to her just ""Hi"" and ""Bye"". Now I was minding my business walking around my neighborhood when I come across her, I see her as i'm walking. She says nothing so I say nothing. As i'm walking back, about 20 minutes later I pass her house. It's pretty dark at this time btw. Anyways as i'm passing I see her come out which caught my attention. To get to my place I have to kind of walk past hers, so as i'm passing she comes out randomly. I look and her breasts are literally poking out.... no nipples showing but they were so out that if she jumped a nipple would pop out..... so i'm already thinking of one thing which i'm sure yall are too, because it was clear she intentionally wanted me to see her. So I shoot my shot INSTANTLY, im not one to waste time. So I simply say ""Hey"" just to see her response in case she wasnt trying to send me a message, which I was HIGHLY sure she was but you never know. So she responds ""Oh hey, sorry my breasts are out, I didn't expect to see anyone."" in my head im like thats bs but I felt she was just playing hard to get. So I said no its okay. I then say something else that I forgot but it was followed with me simply asking for her number. She gave it to me so at this point I knew for a fact I was in there because any woman who wasnt interested would say no in this situation or say I have a bf etc.... So after she gave the number I just said forget it and said ""You free right now"" she says ""No"" straight up. So at that point I just said okay forget it some other time maybe, didn't want to push too hard and potentially disrespect her. So I said 'Alright then"" and was moving on with my night. As i'm walking away she asks, ""Did you want to come in"" so im just thinking ""What???? You just pretty much said no but of course I want to come in"" so I said 'Yes' and as i'm walking up she shakes her head no again..... so im like wtf..... ""Can I come in???"" and she shakes her head no again..... so at this point im just confused because she just invited me in but now shes randomly saying no, so I tell her i'll see her around and I leave. I text her yesterday and just asked her why was she playing games and she goes off on me. Calling me a pervert and saying im waaay too pushy...... in my head all im thinking about is she CLEARLY came out when she knew I was gonna see her, that part is obvious as day.

I turned to him and said ""no thank you"" and he said okay and smiled. We both went on our way and he didn't try to dance with me the rest of the night. I know his advance was slow and on the side of my hip, but should I tell the bouncer about him next time? Is that normal club behavior?? 

When I told my friends about it, they were confused because they thought I would be telling a story where a dude would just thrust into me without giving me a chance to react or held onto me after I moved his hand away. Later in the night, I did start dancing with some dude and it was more than just grinding. We started to pretty much have sex on the dance floor. Like I was throwing it back on him and he was thrusting into me. After sometime of that, he slowly moved his hand up towards my boob (above my shirt) and I swatted it away because boundaries. Again, he didn't try again, but is that normal to make moves like that in a setting. Again when I told my friends about this too, one literally said ""well what did you expect if you were dancing like that"" and told me she saw what I was doing. Is that victim blaming?

Bottom line, what is everyone's experiences and while I think the guys were assuming they were being respectful because they stopped when I informed them to stop, but I would rather them ask me beforehand. But then again, the music literally blasts your eardrums out. There is no room for talking anywhere with how crowded it is. Next time, should I go to a different club if I don't want this type of interactions. Is it fair that if I throw my ass back in the dance circle someone won't try to dance with me later.

We split up once after 3 months because I felt an overall aloofness from her and only when we tried being friends did I start to actually *feel* her desire for something more.

I don't have any tips for making this feeling of irritation go away. I just want to point this out for the people who are giving the advice as to why the guys have a tough time swallowing the truth they need to fix their problems. 

It's NECESSARY for the men who are having issues forming relationships to fix themselves via self-improvement, 100%. But their sense of feeling like a dope is valid when you consider their point of view and realize that they're oftentimes one of the few, or only, guys in their social circle to require turning to the Internet for help on doing something the rest of their friends were able to do purely by instinct. 

It makes them go, ""Why am I so incapable of doing the most basic forms of human interaction compared to everyone I know?"" And that feeling sucks. It really does. 

And the other factor is time. There are more men without any sexual partners under the age of 30 than ever. Telling someone who's in that demographic doesn't make them go, ""Thank God, there are more people like me."" It makes them think, ""Shit, we're all boned.""

If you feel dejected because you've lived years of adulthood without a single woman expressing any romantic affection for you while your peers are making ample progress, that's understandable. Knowing that it'll take multiple years of dedication to get to a point where you're a desirable person to be around in general and date will make ANYBODY feel some despair.

The issue is that these friends, none of whom I have met, all have expressed some interest in my girlfriend or made advancing comments toward her.

For example, one of her friends asked to kiss her about a month before her and I met. She declined, but after having a strictly friendly dinner last month, he got weird and sent her texts about how he couldn’t be friends with her. Another “friend” (who truly is an employee at her gym she met only recently) has decided that my girlfriend will be her therapist. This resulted in late night hour long calls while he was drunk, and has evolved to him begging to buy her gym shoes/take her shopping which she continuously rebuffed. Another guy (30 years her senior and her family friend) recently commented that she’s hot.

To my girlfriends credit, she opened up to me the other day and told me about all of this, saying she didn’t know if I wanted to hear it (because, to be fair, I’m a bit of the jealous type) or If she shouldn’t say it in fear that it would upset me. In the end, I told her her how much I appreciated her being honest and said she should keep her guy friends, especially those that preceded me. I simply asked that she should use her judgment in sharing details and that I would only be upset with a serious advancement or if one of these friends disparaged me or her. So what do you think? Did i handle this correctly and does any of that sound weird to you?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,868597,public,self,My (26 M) girlfriend (24 F) has a lot of guy friends and it makes me uncomfortable,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oakcp5/my_26_m_girlfriend_24_f_has_a_lot_of_guy_friends/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Struggling with a persistent issue… turning to the almighty Reddit for advice. I’m a 19 year old guy and in a relationship with a girl who’s 4 years older than me. One of my first serious relationships if I am being honest. I can’t find the root of this problem, but I’m persistently afraid of losing her, more specifically to a “better guy” who’s out there. This is even to a point where I’ll have the occasional dream about scenarios where my gf is choosing someone else… as crazy as this may sound, she has had similar dreams before about losing ME to someone else… what is with this feeling of inadequacy?? And why are we both experiencing it?? Everytime we voice this concern to each other it is met with loving reassurance, only for the fear to return later.

Does anyone have any experience with this / healthy solutions? 

I can’t tell if this is a common issue that I’m unnecessarily anxious about, or some symptom of past trauma that I am unable to immediately understand. 

It’s very clear we both care about each other very much and this relationship has been amazing, but this fear is somewhat of a heavy burden (for me at least).

A lot of people apparently believe that the fact that there are men out there that do this explains everything about why most men struggle with dating struggle with dating.

But they don’t all agree on how it does specifically. Amusingly enough.

Sometimes it’s a symptom of extreme entitlement. So any many that feels entitled to any degree can be said to be in “nice guy” territory. And how easy it is to claim that someone is entitled if you really want them to be. So they need to get with reality and realize no woman owes them a damn thing (I think most guys struggling with dating understand this concept very well personally because that’s exactly what they are experiencing lol)

Sometimes it’s a symptom of having no clue how women and dating work. So anyone that doesn’t really know what the fuck is going on might be in “nice guy” territory. So they need to grow up and figure things out.

Sometimes it’s a symptom of extreme neediness. If you’re feeling needy at all, you might be in “nice guy” territory. So you need to stop caring what people think about you.

Sometimes it’s a symptom of narcissism. So if you’re proud of your accomplishments at all, you might be in “nice guy” territory. So you need to realize it’s not all about you

I’ve even seen some people try to tell me it’s simply caused by being too nice. Nobody can be that nice, so eventually they’ll lash out when they hit their limit. So they need to grow up and start taking what they want more. Or something like that.

Sometimes it’s very vague and it’s just a symptom of being a very bad person. No solution for that. Just fuck em.

And then we all pretend we’re all talking about the same thing.

How about this? One thing is certain. Those original guys that behave that way exist. Everything else is a theory. About how that happens. And most of them sound sexist as fuck.

I’m just wondering if I am unique in this regard, or if others think like this also. I’m confused as to why in an evolutionary sense I would think like this.

There is a distinction for me between hot and beautiful. What I mean is, I am not sexually attracted to people who I am romantically attracted to, in any normal way. Usually the women I am romantically interested in are not my type sexually. This may sound weird to some but I would never have a romantic relationship with someone that I was too sexually attracted to. It actually makes me uninterested in them and is a big deterrent because I don’t trust my senses or self control around them. 

When I see people who are very unique in appearance and intelligent, or have something admirable about them, but I am not particularly sexually attracted, all of a sudden I am romantically interested in them. 

I have actually gone celibate in long stints when I get interested in girls, which one may think would be the opposite.

I think of it like getting a McDonalds burger and a soda vs a nutritious salad and an herbal tea. One tastes better, but the other is better quality, and I would never want to have the burger all the time.

For context, I’m a bisexual woman. I’ve dated two girls, and one guy. I ended the first one after half a year or so, because I had to stay up on calls late at night just to convince her not to harm herself. The second one, she broke up with me after one year; we both got into fights all the time and overshared our mental health issues and became completely codependent. These two were when I was younger and less mature, so I figured that maybe the third time would be better. But after dating the guy, I broke up with him a month later because I was uncomfortable with all the sexual implications in conversations, and he just wasn’t very interesting to talk to (with all due respect). 

That being said, I’ve never actually liked the people I dated, but have said yes because I feel like I won’t have many chances to be with someone, and because I don’t want to hurt them. Which is dumb, because leading them on hurts even more. I’m not exactly pretty, maybe a 6 at most. And I like to take things slow. I’m still a virgin and want to wait for the right person- which the guys I’ve met don’t really seem to like. 

Not only that- I always find myself in relationships or friendships with people who take advantage of me; a fairly shy person, who never says no. As of right now, I’ve given up on dating. I know a lot of decent people exist, so why is it so hard? I'm just wondering if I even have a chance.
