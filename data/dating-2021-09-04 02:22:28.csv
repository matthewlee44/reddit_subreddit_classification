0,phn2po,1630740530,How to decide if someone is in for a serious dating?,"Ok so recently I started using dating apps for actually meeting people but I was quite clear in my mind that I wanted to hangout first and build a bond with people before I proceed with anything romantically serious. 

So this one guy doesn't come online that often, we have met once and he was polite and nice. Nowadays we text more often and he is smart and sweet but he is just too interested. Not that I hate attention from someone I am attracted to but he sounds like someone who is ready to jump into something serious despite not knowing me well. He is decent looking and well off and I don't think he has a shortage of girls. But maybe I am wrong and he is feeling lonely? I am not sure. 

But he opened up to me about being an introvert and not talking much. I am also a but of reserved person myself so that only makes him more attractive. But he has been too upfront about liking me. He said he liked me ever before we met in person. He likes the way I text and think ( he said something along that lines) but we haven't had many long convos because he hardly comes online due to busy schedule. But he is more than willing to meet me and has been trying to plan dates and it's been our out of sync schedules that make it a bit tough at times.  

I asked him directly if he wanted anything casual and he denied. Still I just find someone's interest in me too soon hard to believe. I am insecure about myself but honestly I am no stunner, I m a normal regular low-key boring girl. So loads of interest from someone I hardly know and him being so upfront about me just make me anxious. I don't want to be played by someone. 

Can anyone here advice if there is something to be concerned about or if I am being too paranoid?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phn2po/how_to_decide_if_someone_is_in_for_a_serious/

When I'm with my friends in a bar or in a coffee shop sometimes we are meeting with new people there. But I am always the second choice. Sometimes not even a choice, when my friend leaves us together to go and grab another drink, between me and their conversation just stops, and I feel like they are answering me just for kindness, not because they are into me.

They are looking into my friend's eyes, talking with them in a cheerful way, laughing at everything he says, but for me, I don't feel such kind of energy from them to me. I cannot feel the excitement from them when they talking to me.

Yes, I am an introverted person, I talk less but I talk. I do not make nonsense talk. I am trying to get to know them usually. My appearance is not bad also, people say that I am handsome. I am a short man not tall, a bit belove the average. A bit thin, but with defined muscles.

9,phnneh,1630743558,Should I contact him again?,"We matched on Hinge. After we met, he said he felt the sparks and definitely wanted to spend more time together. However he was worried about the distance (50miles away) but it was not impossible either. We are both separated for about a year and we both have young children. He did tell me he didn’t know how to merge family if we were so far away. 

We didn’t have our second day till 10 days later because he had to travel for work and we had opposite schedule with kids. It was challenging to meet but we had even stronger chemistry on the second date. We talked for hours and had so much in common. 

We were gonna meet again two days later but he canceled on me because of his fishing trip with his buddies. I was not happy about that because we won’t see each other for another ten days and he was gonna spend the whole weekend with his friends. He told me his friends decided to sleep over at his place and they planned to leave early next morning. 

I didn’t make a big deal and we met for the third time after another ten days. The whole time we texted every day and tbh, I was not satisfied being just pen pals. 

We met the third time and we were on fire. I invited him over to my place but he hesitated. He asked me what I was looking for and told me he was worried about liking me too much. I told him I just want to get to know each other and see where things goes. He again told me he was worried about the distance. He suggested to spend the night at my place next week before his business trip.

Then he canceled again, proposing to meet the Sunday after his trip. 

I was very disappointed and felt he wasn’t really making much efforts to spend time together. So I told him that we should stop seeing each other. He responded a few day later. 

This is what he wrote: I just got back from Portland yesterday afternoon.  I hope you had a nice week!  I have really enjoyed the time we spent together and sorry for coming across as reserved or hesitant.  Honestly, I think the hardest part for me would be the distance for anything beyond friendship or some combination of friendship and non-serious companionship but I am not sure how those things normally work out.  So, I would still be up for having a friendship at the very least if that’s something of interest?

This is what I responded: I will be happy to keep friendship but not sure how to do it since I have romantic feeling towards you 😝. I just feel you are hesitant about spending time together. I am not expecting anything serious at this moment but do want to someone to spend quality time with. I thought you were hesitated to do that because of your concerns of the distance. It’s not that I like to avoid considering problems. I just think no matter how people plan things, there are always unexpected challenges. Sometimes, even we plan every step ahead, things can still go wrong. For me, what’s more important is to find someone compatible and motivated to be together. With those two qualities, any problem can be solved with teamwork. 

He didn’t respond after that. I moved on and went on date with other people but haven’t met anyone quite like him. I came across his profile on okcupid and found I am still attracted to him.

Should I contact him again? Would it even worth it another try? I was just gonna say, I saw you on okcupid and like your new pictures.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phnneh/should_i_contact_him_again/

I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit, i don't use reddit a lot... i'm sorry if i'm posting on the wrong one.

So recently the government in my country set up rules for going to the bar, restaurant, club, festival and things like that . You either have to show a proof that you are vaccinated for covid or show proof that you are tested negative. For testing, you have to pay money and in a lot of cases this costs more than the actual going out. Now i did want to get vaccinated but when i was young i had this severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis twice to medications and me and my GP decided, becaues the vaccines have a bit of anaphylaxis risk, that i won't get vaccinated. I am also 23 and the risk of me getting severe covid is very small, and i indeed got covid las month and luckily i got mild symptoms.

However, i still need to test negative all the time to go to an event or show vaccination proof and i just don't have that much financial possibility as a student to pay all the time, and i just physically can't get vaccinated. But i really want to meet new people, because i don't really have friends, i really want to make my social circle bigger and maybe also potentially meet someone who i like romantically (never been in a relationship)

My university is still going on with online classes as well and because this all is going on for a year and a half i don't know what to do anymore... does anyone have any advice to me maybe?

17,php7ql,1630751898,I (20f) am torn between me and lovelife (24m)," I posted it on another subreddit, but I didn't recieve enough advice tbh. I still cannot make up my mind.

Ages - 20f 24m

relationship lenght - 5 months

Dear redditers.

NGL, I (20f) made a new account, since my regular one has a nickname directly tied to me. I study away from my hometown, the road there is 2 hours away. Due to pandemic and having a lot of online lessons I am back at home, as much as I can.

I tried to assimilate at my uni-city, but it does not feel right. I do not live in USA, but in an European country so 150 kilometers mean that there are a lot of cultural differences. The thought of getting back there makes me sad, since I have a month left at home. Recently I have gone through a breakup with a (24m) - he was not ready for a new relationship and I am not obliged to be his therapist. I have a big academic project going on, and I need to focus on it. I struggle with depression myself, so that breakup left me devastated - but left me with many thoughts.

I feel like my hometown is my place, all my family lives here - my parents, my grandparents. His family lives here too. My grandparents survived COVID-19 but their health is detoriating. My Dad(50m) is giving them 3 years. The time that I will be at the uni campus. The thing that healed me from the breakup was a new hope - a hospital at my hometown is going to build a ward that is suited for me. OF course I know that there is a possibility of me not getting a job there, but ngl I cried happy tears, when I heard that information. That means, that I will be max 10mins away from my fam. The other possibility of the same work is a city located an hour away from my hometown

I am an independent woman, I always was and always will be - but the only model of family I know is that family lives nearby. But COVID-19 made me realize that my independence stripped me from my childhood. I have recently started playing videogames with my father, having a better contact with my mother. And I am just sad, that I have to leave it back here and go to another city for a portion of a week. My parents are not toxic and overprotective - they are reassuring me that even back at my unicity, if I decided to stay there (and that's very unlikely, only possible for a 1-2 after I finish uni due to my bond with family) they would be visiting me or I will be visiting them. But I just feel that's not right and I am not made to stay away.

Recently my ex wrote to me, that he misses me. We were together for 5 months. Thats not a lot I know. But I treat my bfs like they are the one, even if I am not feeling ""butterflies"". I haven't felt butterflies with him, but at the begging of our relationship there was chemistry. We kissed on the first date, he bought me flowers. When I tried started to emotionally engage, he started to be distant. When I was immobilized in my bed for a week, he did not check on me, despite being 30 mins away by public transportation. I was fed up with that. The thing that made me breakup was also that he wants to move to my uni city and stay there and not get back nearby my hometown, despite him having a lot of options of remote work and building a carrier. He had a hard childhood and has a little to no bond with family. I told him, that for him I would move to the city near our hometown, I mentioned it previously. Its an hour away. Recently he also confessed that he sees a possibility to move even further from my uni town due to his ex living in said city.

I am troubled, I do not know what to do now. A week is not a time to resolve his problems, that he has today and I, due to the troubles with our future plans colliding I do not know if giving him a chance once again would not hurt me even more. For sure I would want to talk with him, since he wants to talk with me, but I am not feeling like giving him a chance, not now that the wound he made opened once again,

TL:DR I do not know if I should give my bf of 4 months a chance once again, despite our future plans colliding",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/php7ql/i_20f_am_torn_between_me_and_lovelife_24m/

25,phqdaj,1630757299,"When I tried to break up with my abusive ex boyfriend of 2 years, he said “Oh, I thought sex would keep women hooked.”","I am having my evening tea and snacks and scrolling on Reddit, when the visual of me sitting in my ex’s room trying to break up with him popped into my head. He was vicious. Total emotional and physical abuse. I got together with him when I was 19. He was 28 (groans out of disgust). 

I was naive, overly empathetic and compassionate. He successfully manipulated me into being his girlfriend, he was also my first real boyfriend and intimate partner. I eventually got so saturated with all the gaslighting, lies, emotional dumping. It physically felt like I was being punched repeatedly. It hurt and exhausted me, to deal with the imbecile, the manchild. 

Coming to the break up conversation, when I heard him say “Oh, I thought sex would keep women hooked”, in the most nonchalant, careless way, I think I heard a buzzing sound in my ears. I was so still. I couldn’t believe his apathy. The man who claimed to love me so deeply, was simply using me for sex. 

Towards the end, when I tried to get rid of him, he wouldn’t “allow” me to break up with him. He simply said no. 
He ended up coming to my apartment complex, causing a scene and threatening to go upstairs and tell my family everything (I had kept the relationship hidden from my mom). He then gave me an ultimatum- that if I don’t go with him to his house and have sex with him (he stayed 2 mins from mine), he would tell my mom about us. He then painfully held my hand and dragged me to his house where I had to endure the most numbing experience of my life. The asshole even made sure he ejaculated inside me because he knew I’d have to go take the effort to buy the emergency /plan b pill. I was emotionally blackmailed into sleeping with him one last time, his way of taking revenge for the fact that I wanted to leave his ass. It was non consensual. It was rape. 
I still 2 years after that day find myself feeling enraged that I couldn’t do anything about it. That I wish I was smarter and not so gullible. I didn’t go to the police because I didn’t want to put my family through that mental trauma.

Anyway, I’m done with my tea.

32,phr37d,1630760283,Want to shoot myself,"So last summer I met a girl who I really really liked, and for once in my shit life she actually really liked me too, we can call her J. We had a great relationship all the way through and when she left for university in September we were boyfriend and girlfriend, Sadly she was going through a lot of stuff during the winter and so was I, we were on lockdown and the situation was gloomy. When she came back for Christmas she broke up with me citing the fact she wasn't in a fit mental state to date anyone. I was disappointed but I understood, and hoped one day we might be able to get back together again when we were both feeling better.  

I have been dating other women for the past 9 months but haven't felt that same spark that I felt with J and continued to have feelings for her, just these last couple of weeks I reached out to her and she agreed to meet me yesterday, she seemed enthusiastic which was reassuring, but in the hours leading up to me meeting her I began to feel very anxious and nervous. We met up and it was great to see her, but I was still in my own head a little bit and struggling to be present. I had planned on not being too forward with her or telling her that I had missed her quite a bit, and instead focusing on resparking her attraction for me. Sadly my brain failed me and I kept freezing up, I didn't want their to be awkward silences so I kept blurting out things like 'Other women haven't given me the same feeling.' I instigated a kiss which was good and then said things like 'kissing you is much better than kissing other people.' She had been up since the early hours but the date only lasted 2 hours and whilst she agreed to meet me next week and we shared a kiss, I can't help but feel like I just totally fucked that up. I sent a message to her saying I hope she got home safe, was nice to see her and i'll message her this weekend and we can sort something for next week. She has not responded. I think yesterday I was blinded by my anxiety and didn't really process what a mess i'd made of it but today I feel fucking terrible to be honest, I really like this girl. I was prepared for her to not still have feelings for me, I wasn't prepared for her to still have feelings for me and for me to fuck the first meeting up so badly that she might immediately start having doubts.

33,phr49a,1630760398,How do I stop looking for my exes personality traits in new partners?,"Even though me and my ex broke up. I still think about certain aspects that made our relationship fun and exciting. A lot of her personality was very unique in my eyes. She was very aloof, awkward, weird. Not very structured. The type of person that would follow a butterfly in a theme park rather then a map of where to go. 

I feel like i take certain things parts of my exes and try to look for those things in new people. I know it’s not really wise or good or even possible to really replicate the personality traits and the “way” a person is but it’s something that I’ve noticed that I do. 

I try to see new dates as fresh and their own unique person but a lot of the people I’ve met are just so…strict, career orientated, and just kind of limited to how they express themselves. My last ex wasn’t limited. She was very much weird as fuck and most of all made me laugh. None of my previous relationships had an ex that was so dorky and odd that they could make me laugh as much as she did. 

I find that comparing new partners to your past ones isn’t fair to the new person but it’s hard to really let go of personality types that really brought out such fun in your day to day lives. 

I’m wondering, do you just keep searching for someone that can come close to making you feel the way an ex made you feel during the good times? Or do you just accept someone new and kinda hope for the best out of the situation?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phr49a/how_do_i_stop_looking_for_my_exes_personality/

But my boyfriend told me on phone today that it’ll be 3-4 years before we marry. I know that’s not entirely unreasonable. We’ve been together 7 months now, and dated for like 3 months before that. 

Even when we started dating, we both made it clear that we are dating to marry and not dating to date. And he kept on talking about future and babies and everything. And always says, when we are married….. all the time. Which made me believe that he truly sees a future and wants to start a family. We even have names for our babies and even touch the talks about prenup. 

I guess it’s my bad since I’m the one having expectations but somehow I thought he would propose in a year.

I guess I’m just disappointed and I don’t see myself just dating him for more than 2 years. We see each other once a week since he is a very busy lawyer and I know how hectic his work schedule could be. I will not live with him unless we are married. I just thought that I will get to be with him more if we marry and start sharing our lives together. 

I guess maybe, I’m hoping to get married so things may change. Once a week is not enough. I know he tries so hard even when he is hectic. I know there are weeks when it’s hard to even meet but he tries even just for a dinner. 

I’m so disappointed right now. I really thought he was in it with vision, with the actual plan to start a life with me. We are both in good place in our career. Finances in order. We have traveled together. I met some of his friends and he has met some of mine.

I know I’m not that old. But I am not that young either. I don’t know what I’m trying to get out of this post but I just wanna voice out my disappointment. When he told me that, I jokingly said, 3 years is my cut off and if there’s no ring in my finger i’m out. I don’t know if I got the message across. I don’t need to put a time dreams on this but I’m just really ready for the next stage of my life, things are starting to feel stagnant.

37,phrs47,1630762934,Word vomited my feelings after too many margaritas 🤡,"I reached out to a guy I previously ended things with after 4 months of casual dating. I decided to pursue things with another guy I met (I still liked guy 1 but wasn't feeling super close to him after having not seen each other for a month. Also being a 1-guy-at-a-time girl I felt like I should only pursue one of them) but ultimately realised I made a mistake. He had kept things open when I ended it, saying he'd like to still stay in touch and as such was keen to meet up. We had a lovely catch up over dinner and bowling and I felt the same fun and excitement being with him as I used to.

Drinks were flowing. I decide to tell him why I wanted to reconnect. Loose lips engaged, I ended up spilling out all of my previous and current feelings and concerns, many of which I would've rather kept close to my chest. I WISH I would've conveyed a succinct ""I made a mistake ending things and I'd like to start seeing you again if you're open to it"". If he wasn't, I 100% wouldn't blame him and would respect that and take it as a lesson learnt. 
He was taken aback and said he was expecting me to say I had a new boyfriend and had reached out in a friendly way. I can only imagine his shock once I spilled the rest of my guts, I'm mortified now thinking about it. 
We did end up kissing and talking things through a bit. I emphasised I was aware I'd bombarded him with a lot of info and didn't expect him to gather his thoughts there and then, but I wouldn't be surprised if I've completely scared him off now. 

I'd love to talk it through again with a sober head but I don't know if there's any clawing it back from here. We discussed meeting up again before I go away in a week (before said feelings vomit) so fingers crossed. 

I'm not sure if it's a good thing that he's had an insight into my thoughts and feelings or if I should've kept it simple for now. What I did say are genuine concerns I have and would've discussed at some point soon if he was keen to start over. 
Just not sure this was the right time to voice them: I may have scared him off and saved myself future hurt or perhaps it's better to have eyes open before deciding to pursue something again or not?

Hi. I hope there’s someone familiar with a Nepal dating/marriage tradition, I don’t know where to ask this but I did try in a nepal page but I never got an answer and I hope this doesn’t find any of you offended or something. I’m not a Nepali. But my boyfriend is, well ex boyfriend. We have been in a LDR, for almost 4 years now. And just 3 weeks ago, maybe 4 now. I don’t know, I’ve lost how many days now, he just ghosted me. I know it has nothing to do with his race, but maybe, maybe he have been set up in an arrange marriage? He’s in Europe right now, living with some of his relatives. He mentioned before that traditionally,  a caste system is a big factor in terms of marriage. I’m not a Nepali, but I’m Asian. I asked him if his family would approve me in the future, he said, he doesn’t think so. But he get mad at me when once the topic of where we would live “if” ever we get married arise, he was already decided that of course, we will live with his parents back in nepal, because he said he doesn’t want to have conflict with his parents. I do love and respect his parents, as an Asian, I love to take care of them too. But I thought we could at least have some independence from them as a couple like his brother does. He once played around before. But I forgave him. Sometimes I think I get on his nerves when I’m bit of clingy and maybe overbearing to him. But like couples, we have ups and down, and before we usually make it out after just day or two. But this time, after a week that we were all okay, he just went silent. I called him and ask what’s wrong since he stopped answering my calls and texts. He just went full rage on me and said I should get lost, and I’m making his life miserable and just to kill myself. And next thing I know, he have blocked me everywhere. I don’t know what happened. Maybe he met someone, I don’t know. But he was so angry at me. I tried to contact one of his family and I’ve been blocked too. 

I’m losing my mind to think of any reason why he just left without any reason. I know LDR is a lot of work. But we made it for 4 years. I just I’m so lost. I can’t stop thinking of what he said to me. Maybe killing myself will just solve our problems. Maybe this time I’ll
Make him happy and this will take my pain away. I love him so much. So much. I never love someone like this before. I know I’m not perfect. I know I’m annoying sometimes, but I don’t know why he hate me so much.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phs1wl/im_really_lost/

64,phv4mq,1630774310,going on a first date for the first time in 4 years tomorrow and I need some advice (24m),"
So there’s a couple of things I need help with regarding this date. 

The first thing is that it’s the first date I’m going go on in 4 years if it still goes ahead. I was in a relationship for three years and I’ve been single for a year, in fact a year this month and I feel like I’m up for going back out there dating but I don’t know if a year it’s enough it probably is but I just wanna make sure. The girl I’m talking to mentioned the idea of going for drinks first and last weekend we were talking on Snapchat while she was having her birthday party with friends and she was drinking obviously and I was hanging with my friend while out drinking. He was super supportive after my breakup and was egging me on to ask this girl for a drink basically saying I’ve got nothing to lose and it’s worth a shot. I asked eventually and she said she would love to meet. The dates potentially this Sunday, I originally suggested Saturday but her shifts rotate. 

I’m going on Sunday (tomorrow) though but and this is gonna sound stupid but my parents don’t really know and also we started talking via hinge and they don’t really get online dating they kinda look down on it and in some cases I can see why. I get it I’m 24 but I don’t wanna cause anything if you get me. What would be the best way to approach this or should I not. I live half an hour away from the city we’re going to by train and she’s 5-10 mins away by train.

We’re wanting to go to a couple of bars to get to know each other. I’m hoping to just keep it casual and not come across more unconfident that I probably will be naturally. I also don’t want to mention exes I feel that it kinda brings the mood down. Any tips on how I can have a good time and be stress free? 

Thanks for any advice if it happens I’ll update with how it went .",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phv4mq/going_on_a_first_date_for_the_first_time_in_4/

77,phwcch,1630778290,Why is being single such a challenge?,"Hear me out. 

I don’t speak for everyone, but I’m sure many people would agree that being single is very challenging, emotionally draining and lonely. For those in their 20’s sure, it probably doesn’t bother you as much. When I was in my early 20’s I have absolutely no desire for women, dating or being in a relationship. 

Then all of a sudden in my late twenties, I woke up one morning and that’s all I could think about; it was like a biological clock just went off in my brain or something. Now I’m 30 and feel pretty much haunted by the fact I’ve never been in a meaningful relationship for my entire adult life. I’d love to be a dad, have a beautiful wife and just do the life thing together.

What makes being single so challenging for me personally is just all the blatant punches to the face in society: My favorite radio stations playing nothing but songs of love and sex. All the couples out on dates in restaurants, movie theaters and events; hell I can’t even fill out a form without having to list marital status. Even hanging out with friends can be emotionally draining. 

Just yesterday I got invited to hangout with a friend of mine at a BBQ but she’s married. There had to of been maybe 20 people there and all of them had their husbands and wives there, I was the only single person there and it felt awful. I definitely enjoyed the night and their company but it nothing but of reminder of how single I am. 

Despite being happy with myself and being the best possible version of myself, I think single people need a break. 

Unpopular opinion but I think being single is way more challenging and being in a relationship. We deserve more credit.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phwcch/why_is_being_single_such_a_challenge/

There’s no need to overtly verbalize your feelings. First, they very likely know already. If you want to ask them out, don’t make a big deal out of it. By simply asking them on a date, you are demonstrating that you are interested in more than friendship. Pick a nighttime activity like dinner or drinks that implies romance and wouldn’t be typical of a friendly hang out.

i try so hard to look my best but i can’t be as pretty as my sisters or the other girls in my grade. i tried doing this so i can be more confident in myself, but i’m still ugly either way while everybody i’m surrounded with are all so beautiful and smart. even pretty girls back in middle school would comment about my appearance and give me the most backhanded compliments. and boys would be grossed out by my appearance and never step foot in my direction. no one i’ve ever liked has returned those feelings, and i’ve been rejected once. 

i’ve been called pretty by my classmates a few times this school year so far, and my sister even says i’m starting to get prettier. but from what i’ve experienced in the past, it feels like they’re all lying or just saying it to be nice. plus, im wearing a mask and nobody could actually see how ugly i am. and if i don’t like what i see in the mirror, how could anyone ever?

TL;DR — would i ever find someone who would love me? i’ve heard people say that low self-esteem is a total turn off, but would at least one boy ever find me beautiful one day?

89,phx8xd,1630781254,Never been in a relationship and not sure why (24M),"(Still young, I know.) 
I’ve always wanted a serious relationship yet I’ve never been in one or had anyone I was seriously interested in reciprocate. I don’t have problems socializing or flirting, but I’m a bit reserved. I’ve slept with 8 different women (all ONS; I don’t tell anyone this obviously) from my senior year of HS through the first two years of college, with a few of those girls being the one to initiate so I’m pretty sure my looks aren’t the issue. I’ve come to realize sex isn’t a super high priority for me as I feel like I would enjoy it much more with an emotional connection. Most girls I’ve been interested in liked me as a friend and wanted to hang out, but were never interested romantically.

I’m in a pretty good spot in life with a good job, friends, hobbies, and goals and aspirations I’m working on. I’ve always been skinny and have recently gained some weight which I feel really good about (135lb). I do have a history of depression, anxiety, and ADHD from HS/early college but those are well controlled by medication and I don’t have any trauma/baggage. I don’t think there’s any red flags I’m giving out, nor any my male or female friends have ever mentioned.

Until recently I’ve been pretty content with my life and being single, but I have literally no idea what it’s like to have someone I love who loves me back (non-platonically) and it’s the only part of my life I feel is missing. I want someone to share all the cool things I’m doing in life with, and who will push me to grow as a person (and vice versa). I’m fairly certain I will find someone *eventually*, but as I approach 25 the loneliness creeps in and I ask myself if I’m just unlucky or if there’s something I’m missing I need to change or work on.

I had my first post-college date two months ago from a girl I met on Hinge, then another two dates with another girl from Hinge last month. We had a lot of fun and shared values but she ended it after that. On the date she brought up the topic of past relationships and I told her I’ve never been in one. I just found out that’s a red flag, but it is what it is. I don’t ever bring it up myself and I will always be honest if it does come up, but it’s such a frustrating catch 22. If asked what I’m looking for, I say something serious.  I am open to casual/hookups if there’s no feelings but I don’t say that to avoid seeming like I just want sex. I also try to avoid coming on too strong or moving too fast. I will keep trying to meet girls both IRL and online (~10 conversations/week), but my social life has fallen off a cliff since college (seeing friends once every week or two). 🙃

Just for background I’m a 24 year old 5’7” East Asian man living in the southeastern US, but I don’t think about that too much and it hasn’t stopped me before. On the weekdays I usually stay home and play video games, watch movies, or DJ in my bedroom. Weekends I hit up a lot concerts and music festivals or try new things (rock climbing currently). I’ve met hundreds of people and made many friends from these. I also like snowboarding, scuba diving, motorcycle riding, and occasionally volunteering. Eventually I can add adopting hundreds of cats to that list at the rate this is going.😸

**Quarter-life crisis TL;DR**: I’m happy and my life is good, but it’s starting to bother me that I’ve never been in a relationship and I don’t know if I’m just unlucky or something’s wrong with me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phx8xd/never_been_in_a_relationship_and_not_sure_why_24m/
90,phxat3,1630781430,[Question],"Hello all! First of all happy saturday and i hope everyone is having a great weekend aswell as those in America happy Labor day.

My question is and kinda a small rant at the same time haha

Why don't us guys get as much attention from girls as you girls do from us? What are we doing wrong please help us out. 

When a girl post something about friendship or dating her mailbox is full while for us its dry its really depressing

Some of us are actually the nice guys that want a serious relationship but we might be shy or not the best looking but still want a relationship and get married don't leave us behind",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phxat3/question/
91,phxdwn,1630781720,I'm worry I'd never be good enough for her,"I have some feelings for my friend. Both of us are women and have a flirty friendship. We've both expressed interest in each other, but it hasn't been the same feel at the same time. She is much more independent than I am and prepared for living on her own. My diet isn't as healthy and I don't cook a very wide range of foods. She is also very well read, and I dont read many books a year. I admire her so much for the things I wish I was, but I'm not there yet and it may take a long time before I could measure up to her. I feel like I'm hiding how imperfect I am in front of her. And if we got too close she'd see me as immature or wouldn't like me as much. I need advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phxdwn/im_worry_id_never_be_good_enough_for_her/
92,phxfpv,1630781887,You have to stop focusing on what girls want.,Girls are attracted to guys who don't give a f#ck about what girls want.  Only what you want is important. This is what attracts girls. This is your natural instinct that you don't follow anymore. When you see a hot girl you get turned on. You must follow this instinct to it's end result.  You never do this.  You wuss out.  Girls get turned on and attracted when you follow your natural feelings about them.

93,phxhzj,1630782079,Ask again: should I contact him again.,"Sorry it is long, but I feel I needed to explain it to get give context. Please give me your two cents. 

We matched on Hinge. After we met, he said he felt the sparks and definitely wanted to spend more time together. However he was worried about the distance (50miles away) but it was not impossible either. We are both separated for about a year and we both have young children. He did tell me he didn’t know how to merge family if we were so far away. 

We didn’t have our second date till 10 days later because he had to travel for work and we had opposite schedule with kids. It was challenging to meet but we had even stronger chemistry on the second date. We talked for hours and had so much in common. 

We were gonna meet again two days later but he canceled on me because of his fishing trip with his buddies. I was not happy about that because we won’t see each other for another ten days and he was gonna spend the whole weekend with his friends. He told me his friends decided to sleep over at his place and they planned to leave early next morning. 

I didn’t make a big deal and we met for the third time after another ten days. The whole time we texted every day and tbh, I was not satisfied being just pen pals. 

We met the third time and we were on fire. I invited him over to my place but he hesitated. He asked me what I was looking for and told me he was worried about liking me too much. I told him I just wanted to get to know each other and see where things go. He again told me he was worried about the distance. He suggested to spend the night at my place next week before his business trip.

Then he canceled again, proposing to meet the Sunday after his trip. 

I was very disappointed and felt he wasn’t really making much efforts to spend time together. So I told him that we should stop seeing each other. He responded a few day later. 

This is what he wrote: I just got back from Portland yesterday afternoon.  I hope you had a nice week!  I have really enjoyed the time we spent together and sorry for coming across as reserved or hesitant.  Honestly, I think the hardest part for me would be the distance for anything beyond friendship or some combination of friendship and non-serious companionship but I am not sure how those things normally work out.  So, I would still be up for having a friendship at the very least if that’s something of interest?

This is what I responded: I will be happy to keep friendship but not sure how to do it since I have romantic feeling towards you 😝. I just feel you are hesitant about spending time together. I am not expecting anything serious at this moment but do want to someone to spend quality time with. I thought you were hesitated to do that because of your concerns of the distance. It’s not that I like to avoid considering problems. I just think no matter how people plan things, there are always unexpected challenges. Sometimes, even we plan every step ahead, things can still go wrong. For me, what’s more important is to find someone compatible and motivated to be together. With those two qualities, any problem can be solved with teamwork. 

He didn’t respond after that. I moved on and went on dates with other people but haven’t met anyone quite like him. I came across his profile on okcupid and found I am still attracted to him.

Should I contact him again? Would it even worth it another try? I was just gonna say, I saw you on okcupid and like your new pictures.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phxhzj/ask_again_should_i_contact_him_again/
94,phxj5o,1630782186,Is he leading me on or am I overthinking,"I know I sound crazy and obsessive. But I’ve been seeing a guy for a little over a month. We’ve spent a lot of time together and have spent multiple days in a row together. And within this month we talked about being exclusive but wanting to go slow. He made it very clear on multiple occasions how much he liked me and that he could see us going somewhere. When we started talking he was also talking to an old friend back home that was trying to get at him. Now at the time I didn’t know this I just thought she was a friend. But we met and really hit it off and at first he just told me they were friends and I didn’t care cause we only knew each other for a little. But one night we’re getting ready for bed and this “ friend” keeps blowing up his phone. Apparently she was drunk. The first time he answered it was while I was in the bathroom and took it outside. He came back in and was like “gosh she’s crazy and drunk, she’s crying and just can’t get words out straight” so I just said okay not trying to make a big deal but then she keeps blowing up his phone. So he answered again and took it out of the room. At this point I was confused. Anyway he comes back in the room and starts off with “I know this seems suspicious and I’m sorry, I know you have questions so ask them.” I really didn’t know what to say. Long story short he had still been talking to her in that way but he just didn’t know how to tell her he wasn’t interested in her anymore and met someone else. I told him that if he wanted to be with her then that was fine, but then we’d be done no hard feelings. He said he didn’t want her like that and wanted me. We talked about it for a while and came to an agreement that he would deal with it. Now when we first met he told me he was going home for her birthday. But then like 2 weeks later said he didn’t want to go home and wanted to cancel the trip but he already told his family so he was still gonna go. So he told me that he would talk to her then and deal with it. So flash forward to last weekend we spent three days together. It was amazing we talked about really deep personal things and the future and all the things we want to do together. I talked to him about how I was scared he was gonna get weird while he was gone and come back not wanting me anymore cause that’s happened in the past. And he told me he was nervous that I was gonna leave him and was too good to be true. We got really deep into this and he told me he was gonna get weird when he was home but that was only because he would be super busy and barely be on his phone. So I chose to believe him. But I’m on day 6 of 14 of his trip and he texted me very little since he left. He did call me for 10 minutes the other day while he was driving and we talked a little and joked around. But then after I texted him and he never got back to me till 5pm the next day. And I’m not gonna lie I’m the type of person who will check a snap score and his will go go up a few points while he ignores my message. I know he warned me about him being weird but all my trust issues are flaring up. I really like this guy and we actually click very well. He’s been really good at communicating his feelings and what he wants or so I thought. Should I sit around and trust him while he’s back home or should I just tell him that it’s not worth the anxiety of the situation and call it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phxj5o/is_he_leading_me_on_or_am_i_overthinking/

97,phxxho,1630783551,Life lessons from a series of fuck-ups.,"Damn dating is hard when you're seeking something more than just a casual fling. Sometimes even the casual fling is hard to come by. I've seen so many posts sharing their success stories and how people can benefit from them. So I thought why not put out my life lessons that I learned from making a series of bad decisions and some personal experiences.

KEEP IN MIND THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE KIND OF POST TO READ IF YOU'RE SEEKING INTERNET VALIDATION! HARSH TRUTH AHEAD!

The post is a bit long and you might feel the need to say mean things and I won't stop you. Express your feelings but try not to hurt other people. Everyone is going through something. I promise you these lessons will help you in future and will definitely save you some severe pain.

*1. ""NO"" doesn't mean ""try harder""*

- I'm pretty sure you're intrigued to go all in with this chick that just told you that ""no, I don't see us being in a relationship"" and you'd feel like if you tried harder she'll fall for you (or he'll). But things don't work like that buddy. You need to respect their decision and respect yourself enough to move on and let them be. Allow yourself this, you're not here to burn yourself out for people who don't feel the same for you.

*2. Physical appearance matter, but only to get you though the door. After that your personality helps you stand out.*

- As humans we're wired to form opinions based on looks. All of us find different kinds of people attractive. But physical attractiveness is important to get you through the door... or spark that initial ""zing"". After that you're going to show how good of a person you are and that will change your life. People love someone with a strong personality and won't give two fucks about their looks if you make them feel safe and appreciated. But in order to show them your personality you gotta be presentable. Think of looks as resume, 20secs of brief overview then focus on the actual personality.*

*3. Desperate/clingy behavior is an instant turn-off*

- In simple words... it's showcases insecurities. Everyone has them, but it's our responsibility to work on them. Support each other but carry your own weight. No it does not show how much you love them it shows how insecure and afraid you are.

*4. The ""taken for granted"" behavior.*

- If you're being taken for granted... feeling like your emotions aren't being respected and/or reciprocated then it's time you drop this ""good for nothing"" relationship because it's making you miserable day-by-day. If you're treating someone like that... taking them for granted (which you'll not know, unless you're deliberately manipulating them) and have some doubts that the relationship is not working, break it off. The sooner you get out of this the better.

*5. If you have to chase them, it means they don't wanna be caught*

- Another harsh one, but if you feel like you're constantly chasing someone and they're simply not interested, then you need to GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE! Trust me the amount of pain that you'll save yourself from would decide if you stay sane or not. Sure they're always the ""hard to get"" routine, but after a while it will start to drain you emotionally and you'll feel nothing but empty after trying so hard to get someone to like you which never wanted that in the first place. The ones who choose you won't mentally torture you and that's a fact!

*6. Communication is as important as physical intimacy*

- Physical, emotional, mental intimacy should all be taken care of. If one is lacking, bring that baby up. Communicate, do activities together, relax together, and do it!

*7. You're replaceable and so are they.*

- No matter how good looking and/or rich you are. You're still replaceable. It's a privilege to find someone who'll go against the world and choose you, no matter what... but we all know that's rare. We can only be that person to our partner and if we're lucky they'll reciprocate (which is usually the case in a healthy relationship). And same thing applies for your partner as well. But that doesn't mean it gives you both the right to cheat. Hold on to each other if you want it to last.

.............................

These are some of the most important and HARDEST life lessons I encountered because of my bad decisions and I hope you find this helpful and that one day you'll be the person you want to be and have a good, healthy relationship. Definitely share your life lessons too. I wish you all the best! &lt;3",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phxxho/life_lessons_from_a_series_of_fuckups/
