I couldn't take it because they were very obviously interested in him as well and they lived in his city, sometimes tagging him in stuff.

So I told him I didn't want to date him, I told him I felt like he wasn't interested in me. We weren't together so I didn't feel like I could tell him I knew he was simping hard for other girls.

Now that we don't talk he's stopped liking their pictures, he's completely stopped activity with them. And one of them knows about me.

1,qehtan,1635037750,I think I might be in an emotionally abusive relationship...,"Me: F26, him: M29

I've been seeing this man for 2 years. 
It started very well. 
Lots of affection, he adored me. Made me feel special, wanted, heard, loved. 
That stopped. 
Now it's on and off problems. 

I'm at the point where everyone in my family and friends group hates him. 

I'm always walking on eggshells about whether or not I should share my feelings with him. I know that if I'm having a bad day I'll feel like I'm boring him. Or that he needs me to be happy or he'll be annoyed. 
If he frustrates me and I share that he frustrated me with him, he will pretty much ghost me for a little while because he's pissed or thinks I'm being sensitive over dramatic.

We agreed to be in a monogamous relationship but he won't let me call him my bf. He isn't sleeping with anyone - I know this for a fact - but he doesn't want people to think he's in a relationship. He makes comments to remind me we aren't together if he feels like my expectations of him are getting too high. 
For example we made plans for this Saturday. On Thurs night he goes off about how he is so glad he isn't in a relationship like his buddy because he doesn't owe anyone his time. 
Then I got frustrated and told him ""I feel like you're saying this so you can cancel Saturday on me"" - he said it had nothing to do with Saturday. 
Cut to Saturday and I haven't heard from him. I text him ""guess you aren't coming over"" - nope. ""Too tired"" 
So I ripped into him a bit and said ""I'm really disapointed"" now he isn't going to reply or speak to me for a while. 

My sister said she thinks this relationship is borderline emotionally abusive. I don't know. 
Sometimes we have lots of fun and he makes me feel good. But sometimes...I don't know. I feel like I'm alone. 

I've almost dumped him once before. He ended up crying and saying he can't live without me so I took him back. Still can't call him bf though. 

I don't know...
Real emotional abuse is very serious. I don't know if this really qualifies.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qehtan/i_think_i_might_be_in_an_emotionally_abusive/

Little things that seem inconsequential to my freinds really bother me and I'm sure its the reason I've never been in a relationship becasue to be in a relationship you need to be really forgiving. 

The last person I was talking to was very sus.

I told him I had naturally curly hair and he asked me ""you can straighten it right?""

I told him I was trying to stay sober but unfortunately I had developed a sweet tooth and started eating a candy bar everyday (obviously over exaggerating) and he asked me ""do you workout afterwards?""

anyone whose had an eating disorder like myself will know thats a very insensitive and unhealthy response. 

He says ""I think women just want to be men these days.""

THE REAL KICKER

He follows teenagers on instagram, and as a 30 year old man I find that troubling. Especially since he says "" men are  very visual creatures."" Which means you are absolutely looking at these girls. You're saying its in your nature as a man to look at girls. Some of them were in high school.

4,qehxvv,1635038215,Is there a double standard in dating between genders?," I feel like finding a long term relationship is just a lot harder for men because of how society works. We're always expected to have everything together, have all the answers to life, be emotionally strong and those just aren't rules everyone can live up to. Whether we like it or not, some of us need more support than others and that goes for both genders. But I feel like it's only men who are expected to somehow be above this. I know women have things that they probably struggle with more than men, but no matter how I sugarcoat it, I can't deny the fact that A LOT more is expected out of you as man to get a lasting relationship. This shows in divorce rates where women initiate divorces far more than men do. Of course we can debate about why that is, but I think it's somewhat obvious that the reason is because society believes it's okay for women to place bigger expectations on men and also that love is a lot easier to find it as a woman.

5,qehz3a,1635038336,Should I (M21) pursue this woman (F25) after an intimate first encounter,"Hey r/dating_advice,

So last night I, **M(21),** went with my buddies to a local bar and I ended up having a really great time with this woman, **F(25).**

Pretty much I had a sense that this girl was attracted to me from the very beginning.

**By the way, F(25) is** ***my*** ***buddy's girlfriend's co-worker and they have known each other for well over 1+ years so I think I will end up seeing her again one way or another.***

**She also has a career while I am still a senior in college. Luckily we are both Finance people so it is nice to have that in common as well as a lot of similar interests. And our humor really clicks with each other too. Overall I feel the connection with her and she seemed to feel it too.**

# Anyways... here are the details

**10 P.M.**

When I first got to the place, we all met up and I was ordering my drink at the bar and I couldn't help but notice this girl constantly looking at me and ""accidentally"" bumping into me. I figured she was just a little tipsy, which was partly true, but I also figured something was up with her.

So I got my drink and we ended up talking for a little while and I was flirting with her and she was flirting back with me just as much.

She was pretty touchy as well. Even let me start sipping from her drink that she ordered. As well as coming back up to me to keep the conversation going even after we got separated earlier in the night.

**12 A.M.**

Then I let her know I had to move my car because my parking limit was about to expire. We ended up leaving together and once I got into the car, we started making out and getting pretty touchy.

**So I think everything is going well for me.**

So then after we realize we still need to move the car, she walks back with me to the bar and we let our friends know we'll meet up with them at another bar.

**2 A.M.**

We were pretty much 100% sober by now even though before we were only a little buzzed so it wasn't just a drunk encounter.

So yea we never met up with our friends either LOL. We ended up driving out to Wendy's and grabbing a quick bite. And kept getting more and more flirtatious and intimate in the car. I moved it into the backseat to make ourselves more comfortable and I think she reciprocated the idea because then she was all over me - kissing my neck, biting, grabbing my dick, sucking on her tits, etc. Everything but sex.

So then she tells me...

""*I feel really embarrassed saying this...""*

""*I really want to fuck you.""*

**This made me so happy hahaha. All I could say back was ""can you guess what I want to do?""**

&amp;#x200B;

So then I eventually asked her if she could give me something.

And I couldn't put into words, but **I asked if she wanted to blow me.**

So she tells me that she wants to, but she's worried it will lead to sex and she is always unsure about sex on a first meet.

I didn't take this personally because I am not the most extroverted, wild guy that I was acting like tonight... so I ended up finishing up and driving us back to our friend's place.

His girlfriend drove F(25) back home and we all waved goodnight and I drove back home too.

**Luckily, I did grab her** ***digits. I sent her a text today saying 'hey I had a lot of fun last time. we should hang again sometime'.***

&amp;#x200B;

**Today, she responded, ""hey aww i'm glad. let's hang out again sometime :)'**

&amp;#x200B;

**So,** r/dating_advice, **should I pursue her with all the signs flashing in front of me?**

7,qei14m,1635038542,Dating app depression,"When I open a dating app these days, I literally get hit with a wave of depression. I work about 55 hours a week and I can't reduce the number of hours. I never get to do anything for me. I don't meet friends, I almost never meet new people. I pretty much don't leave the house except to go work. From my perspective, it's dating apps or bust. But I don't know how I'm going to meet anyone when I just get so depressed just going on it; it make me want to turn it off immediately. I also feel resentful because it eats away at the very little free time I have, and I could actually be doing something fun instead. But obviously a fun distraction isn't going to make my life any better in the long run. My male friends say that while no top model I look good and I should be no problems finding someone, but my profile is not ideal or conveying it that well. In my mind, I wanted to go out and take new photos, but I don't know that I even really can afford to take a day for that. It's not even the day for photos itself but finding new clothes, buying a tripod to take photos on my own and figuring out how it works, thinking of locations to go to. I don't even do grocery shopping anymore because I don't like how it puts me behind on my work. I work 7 days a week. If I take a day off or even half a day off, it inevitably screws me over and puts me behind on work. 

I talked about this with my therapist last month but he was totally unhelpful and compared me to other clients. For example he said ""I had a client who had no personal life for 5 years because she was in psychiatric residency. I bet she was working harder than you. Everyone is suffering, you're not special."" He also told me a lot of his clients struggle professionally and I shouldn't complain because I'm good at what I do. I told him that was unhelpful, but WTF can you even say to that? Only reason I tolerate it is because I've known him for a long time and he has positive sides, but sometimes he has these moments where I just don't get how you can think saying that is useful. I'm not interested in having 0 personal life for 5 years, and I don't care if other people *chose* to do that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qei14m/dating_app_depression/

Everything has been great between us. We stay loyal to each other and we always talk as though we are in a relationship - sometimes he talks about if we were married and had kids. He even talks about his future with me in it.

The thing is, when we first started seeing each other, he told me a few times that his preference is usually brown (Indian) girls (he is brown, I am white). Once I asked ""okay so why are you seeing me then?"" and he responded, ""well obviously because I like you."" This has been an ongoing insecurity for me. I fear that he sees me just as something short-term until he finds the woman he actually envisions himself with.

I do love him but I have not said it yet because I fear I will overwhelm him or scare him off. I also haven't had a conversation with him about our status and the future of us - honestly because I'm scared of what the answer might be. I'm really crazy about this guy, but I'm not sure what to do.

The thing is that it seems that in my post-apocalyptic world water does not seem to exist. Water just exists in the luckier worlds that I get to see from afar. I sometimes wonder why I was born just to suffer desiring companionship when companionship is not something that is in the cards for me. It feels like my life is a dark humor comedy. All my life I have struggled with bullying and racial discrimination and that has taken a huge toll on my self-esteem. I see couples happily talking down my apartment hall day in and day out. I can see couples walking all the time down through my window in the city. And old lil me just constantly gets ghosted online or just gets ""wish you the best"" or ""you are such a great guy someone else will appreciate you so much"". I am just so tired of this. It just feels like my body just drank a gallon of bitter despair, spiced up with sadness and a drop of cherry anger madness. I can hear from the distance the ageless platitudes of ""work on your self"", ""just hang in there"", ""those guys who are getting girls put the effort"", ""stop complaining"", ""man up"", ""you just need to find the right person"" and all that jazz. I honestly feel that the people who give advice do not know how horrible it feels to feel that no one will ever love you. You guys probably had a gf before.

To me it many times just feels that people give advice to just prevent other people from offing themselves, but they honestly have no clue what they are talking about, or they just cannot understand how painful it is and feel that other people are just exaggerating or whining, like how people feel about people who are depressed.

A week later she messages me stating that she wants to meet up and apologised for her reaction to me stating that I’m serious. We met up and had a good couple of hours of food &amp; convo. Then I asked her if we’ll meet again and she said she’s not sure about it. 

At this point I was certain it isn’t going to materialise into something so I stopped chatting with her again. However, she keeps on messaging me or responding to my stories as if she cares. But whenever I ask her if we’re ever meeting again she says “I don’t know”. I feel really confused by this behaviour. I’m even losing sleep as I really wanted to know her better and see if something works out between us.

She responded several days later to what I shared and then said “I would be interested in talking more!”

I’m not sure how to respond because in my lengthy answer I did ask if she wanted to move to texting or phone, and I’m glad she focused on replying to the things I shared in my story, but then ending with “I would be interested in talking more!” doesn’t really answer my question of moving to text or talking on the phone.

I'm good at conversing and can pick up social cues on when somebody isn't interested, I have my own life and hobbies, my own place, a job, I'm in grad school, etc., I think I'm decently good looking, and I think I have a solid personality and good sense of humor.

I get matches and they just don't respond or stop responding, I'm not being weird or creepy either. I had one date I was supposed to go on but I called it off because she smoked weed and that's something that I really don't care for and don't want in a relationship.

This whole concept of being offended by this is just so backwards I think. Sexual attraction is always the first thing to happen. 

Unfortunately most girls that are especially attractive tend to be dull, self centered, mean or crazy. These traits become extremely amplified after having sex I’ve noticed. Hopefully crazy shows up before sex lol these are dangerous times we live in, if you know what I mean. 

Almost every guy I know wants a best friend they can sleep with, that is the ideal girlFRIEND. Like you know, a friend lol if a girl doesn’t have the capacity of being a friend and just wants to control, well, sex is probably the only motivation for the guy to keep being nice.

This night was uncharacteristic of me; I try to get to know people and genuinely am looking for a connection.

65,qempdj,1635057705,Dating someone with commitment issues/depression,"I (30F) have been talking with a guy (30M) for 4 months. For the first month, we generally saw each other once a week, and I told him I wanted more “real” dates as opposed to Netflix and chill. He acted on it but was not very consistent with planning dates, even though he would text me everyday. In the meantime, I know he’s talking to another few girls (which was ok with me until one of them came to stalk my social media…) I’m fine with proposing dates as well, but I ended up confronting him at ~3 months about his low investment and told him that I’m ok with letting it go if this is not going anywhere - but I want us to be on the same page and I don’t want to be strung along… He was very nice about it - said he liked me a lot but he had commitment issues from his last l relationship (which ended a few months prior to when we met) and he could’ve communicated better. After our talk, he made a bit more effort in that same week to meet and hang out. And since then, I have not seen him for 3 weeks… he says he’s busy during the week and would consistently text me every single day to check in. We live in the same city.. Last week he mentioned he might have depression, but the meantime, I can see him interacting with other girls on social media (who have more exposing/sexy photos/captions). 

Should I claim the loss and tell him I’m moving on? Or would he come around and I just need to be more patient since it’s only been 3-4 months? I’m perfectly fine with being single but I’m looking for a healthy connection and it sucks to feel up in the air all the time. I’m generally supportive and warm towards friends with depression, but in this case I’m really tired myself.

Girls generally find me attractive, I definitely get a lot of compliments, looks, and I usually have many girls around, but every time, I fail at going at the target

This is making me feel really depressed, because I see even the most ugly or shy guy getting girls, getting laid and I have like a success over 100 chances

I know it's very vague this way, but I needed to talk about it and I tought to write this here


Last example, last night

We went out with friends, there were four girls, two I was attracted to

With one, I previously tried and failed before kissing her, she ended up with another guy in front of me yesterday

We went out to dinner, I picked her up, I paid for it, and there was some good flirting going on and things like that. She took pictures of her food and the view bc she said she wanted to show her family, she was dressed up, and she told me she went to go get a haircut that same day, which I thought was cute and idk if it was for me lol. 

What stood out to me is when she said that she felt protected and safe since we were walking around at night, she complimented me on my “facial structure” lol, and she said I could be a model which was nice. 

It seemed like we were just teasing, joking around, and getting to know each other. We have another date/hangout set up next weekend already snd she said she had such a good time and everything. 

I just don’t know if should be straight up and just be like I just wanted to make sure it was a date. At the same time that might kill the vibe, so I could just keep escalating things and go for a kiss maybe, and then I’ll probably get my answer.

88,qepks6,1635071477,Today,"The title pretty much says it all. My ex best friend (who I’ll call Jessica) married my ex boyfriend (who I’ll call Jack) yesterday. Jack is the older brother of another friend (who I’ll call Aubrey).

Me, Aubrey, and Jessica were inseparable from the time we were in junior high all the way up until Jessica started dating Jack. I had a crush on Jack from the moment I laid eyes on him. I didn’t try to hide it either. Aubrey knew right away. I even told her once when we were about 14 that I was going to marry her brother some day.

I started dating Jack when I was 16 and he was 17. It seemed like he finally took notice of me and he asked me out. I was so happy. I dated Jack my last two years of high school. We stayed together when he joined the army, and I started college. We’d get together every time he was home on leave. 

After he came home and I graduated we got more serious. We moved in together when I was 22 and he was 23. For a while things were good. Then I started to feel like we were drifting apart. We wanted different things in life I guess. He wanted to start a family someday. I felt at the time that I didn’t want kids. Our jobs kept us apart too. He was busy training to be a carpenter and I had started my career as an RN. 

About a year after we moved in together we ended up breaking up. What a heartbreaking time it was for me. For him too I guess. At leas the said he was heartbroken. We went no contact and I didn’t see or hear from him for almost six months. 

Then I started to hear things from friends who said they’d seen Jack out with Jessica at places. At first I scoffed at the idea. They must have been hanging out with Aubrey, right? Then I heard that one of my cousins saw them holding hands at the mall. So I called Aubrey who said it was news to her. But we compared notes and realized that Jessica had seemingly dropped out of both our lives over the previous few months.

Aubrey went and confronted her brother about it and he said yes, he had started dating Jessica! Aubrey was furious with both of them. I felt complete betrayed by Jess. How could she do this? I finally worked up the nerve to ask her and she had no answer. She said it started with Jack pouring his heart out to her about me breaking his heart. Then she said they started spending more and more time together and one thing led to another. Less than three months after we broke up he was already banging Jessica.

I wish I could say I kept my cool with her but I didn’t. I went off on her. I told her our friendship was over and I told her he was just using her to hurt me. I truly believed that was what he was doing. I called him and told him off too. I said pretty much the same thing to him. He denied it and said he loved Jessica. I told him I hated him and that he was trash for using my  friend against me like that.

Aubrey sided with me and stopped talking to both of them. I begged her to please not end her relationship with her brother over me. She said she was just too mad at him to even talk to him. She also thought he only did it to get back at me.

I don’t know how much Aubrey talked to them. But a year after they got together Jessica had a baby girl. I remember being shocked that it had happened. Jess had always been another person who said she didn’t want kids. After the baby came I think it broke the ice between Aubrey and her brother. She told me that the baby was beautiful and the two of them seemed legit happy. She said the baby had Jack’s blue eyes and Jessica’s dark complexion and hair (she’s Mexican). I could tell Aubrey was really in love with her niece.

Over the last few years I’ve avoided the subject of Jessica and Jack when I am with Aubrey. I moved on and dated other people. I’ve had a couple long relationships but right now I’m single. Then last year Aubrey told me that Jack had proposed and Jessica accepted. The she said Jess had asked her to be a bridesmaid. I knew they had repaired their friendship somewhat because of the baby. I know Aubrey adores her niece. I can’t be mad about any of that. But it did sting a little. The three of us had spent hours talking about our wedding days and how we’d be each other’s bridesmaids.

So yesterday was their wedding day. I don’t know how to feel. Part of me is still hurt over what happened. I can’t lie. It does hurt. And Aubrey told me once it seems like they’re genuinely happy. I know it’s petty but that hurts too. They’re both happy and I’m single again. She was really trying not to bring them up much but sometimes they would come up. She told me that right now Jess is pregnant again too. So I do wish for their kids sake that they have a long and happy marriage. But part of me is still hurt over the whole thing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qepks6/today/

 he has work today or holiday? 

because he works in hotel so has to be available there 24/7 , sometimes he get holidays but those are not fixed ones.

I unexpectedly stayed the night at his. It was GREAT. Except I couldn’t sleep because I was so anxious. 

There is massive history with this guy for years since high school. Never went anywhere because I was in a committed relationship before. This is the first time we are both in a position where it’s possible for things to progress past the friend zone. They slowly have been.

I stayed at his, couldn’t sleep. So I asked to cuddle and we did. It was CRAZY intense. We didn’t speak much because we were both so nervous. His heart was beating so fast. We separated and got little sleep. When we woke up we cuddled more and everything seemed pretty normal. Coffee. Then I left.

He messages me telling me he wants to pull back. I will 100% give space always. But I can’t help wondering why. I think he’s scared to get hurt. He’s pulled away before but has come back in a more serious committed way.

I gave him space but then asked if I made things hard for him and he said no, just different. 

I’m gonna give him more space. We are casually texting atm. I’m a bit scared to push him into a flirting zone again. He’s not very forward so I’m normally the one to initiate stuff. (I do like it that way) he is very shy and very nervous. 

Why did he pull away? What should I do? My intuition tells me to keep taking things slow and test the waters here and there if it feels right.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qeq5g6/why_did_he_pull_away/
