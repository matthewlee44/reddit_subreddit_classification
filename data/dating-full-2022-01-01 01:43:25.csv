So most women and some men will say body count doesn’t matter and your sexual choices don’t determine your worth. Which I agree with, it’s okay 100% about insecurity and I wouldn’t feel secure in myself dating a woman who was comparing me to the 30 hot guys she hooked up with especially considering I cannot hook up with a woman.

But back to my main point, they don’t think it should matter. But if a guy asks, they usually either not say or lie. But if they thought there was nothing wrong with having a high body count, they’d tell the truth right?

And if he has a problem with it, she could just leave him. Or even if she felt the need to lie because she thought he’d judge her, why would she not then just leave him?

Long time lurker and this will only my second post, so I apologize if my lack of experience comes through. First, its NYE and I want to wish everyone a hopefully good day full of the things you all love and enjoy, and if it’s a painful day, that you aren’t alone and have my thoughts.

Now onto why I am here. I (37f) just went through a breakup with my partner (32m) of 2 years. I have come to realize that he had grown resentful of me to the point that the things I would say that would be perceived to him as me saying he wasn’t good enough or that I didn’t like him and that I wanted him to change. In the end, he felt like he couldn’t provide me with what I needed (his words, not mind), and it was tearing him apart and he felt tired of that feeling and needed space. While we had our issues, his decision to end it really came as a surprise to me. We had gone through a lot in the past two years, and I felt that we were committed to work through whatever issues lay ahead, as we had before. While two years isn’t a terribly long time for me and in general, this relationship was extremely meaningful to me. It was different than any of the others I had experienced. And to be completely honest, I really thought he was the one. 

With that said, the new year is just around the corner. I was supposed to come visit him but instead, am now by myself to ring it in. I am still going through a lot of emotions and dealing with some resentment and anger. My current state of thoughts revolve around how I could still have been with my family (they are far from me, and I just came back from seeing them so I could go visit my ex) while also feeling sad and completely heartbroken to have loss someone that I have spent the majority of my time with for the past two years (due to pandemic and closed circles). I am feeling alone and lonely in my current town. 

But while I feel those feelings, I still want to focus on healing, trying to understand what I can of what happened, and gain some different perspectives so I can grow from that. I know I can’t understand it all, but I’m hoping to hear some stories of others who may have been in a similar situation. I hope that may give me insights into what I could have done differently, if anything, and provide me with a new way to look at things. Thus, the purpose of me sharing the following is to seek perspective or advice of those who have been through something similar, and especially those who have or are dating something with untreated depression/anxiety and substance use. I would love to hear experiences from both sides.

Some context about my dating history and background: 

In the past, I tended to date whoever showed interest in dating me as opposed to actively seeking what I think I want. I have had some very abusive and toxic relationships in the past, but also healthy ones. Additionally, when I decide to commit to a person, I easily begin to care about them as I would care about my own family or friends, adopting their goals as part of my own. I’ve been told (from family and past loves who I am still friends with) that I give great support while also walking the fine line of not enabling and am good at cheering people on to help them achieve their own life goal that lie outside my own. I am highly independent but am never too afraid to ask for help (or at least see it as a bad sign if I am afraid to do so) and am blessed with a great support system of family and friends. My general philosophy is that I don’t believe any one person can give you all your needs, that we should strive to feel fulfilled on our own, and that romance and friends should add to my life if that is what I desire. 

I also believe that we all carry our own past experiences that shape how we communicate and perceive. Further, I am sensitive that many of us have physical or mental health issues that can take a lifetime to work through. However, we all deserve love and care as we progress through life and the trick is to find what differences are compatible. I am also highly empathetic and non-judgmental while able to hold my own stances and opinions.  At the worse, my traits or behaviors have led me to stick in bad and toxic relationships for a long time and it wasn’t until the past couple of years that I learned more about what boundaries were and started to implement them. I also have a background in mental health so in the past (and possibly present), I conflated any knowledge and understanding how someone could feel and act a certain way with what I should personally accept as behavior towards myself. My traits, along with my lack of boundaries led me to emotionally burn out in 2019, as I gave so much of myself while asking very little back under the guise that I understood, loved, and so long as I believed the good intentions of someone, I’d be there to support them. I admit that sometimes the line of “this is too much for me” can be blurred once I deeply love, leaving me to possibly accept “breadcrumbs” if I am with someone who always seem to have challenges greater than mine. I often have the narrative that everyone goes through hard things in life, timing can be a pain of when we come into each other’s lives, but we all still deserve love, care, and support - I can patiently step aside my own non-urgent needs and give someone the support and space to grow, try out new things, be there when it may “fail” and love them and watch them grow. I also see a therapist and while I am still recovering from the emotional burnout that led to my first major depressive episode, I am much better now than I was two years ago.

If you have read this far, thank you! But I have yet to get to the actual relationship recap…

My partner and I met right before the pandemic hit. Because of this, most of our time getting to know each other was constrained by the pandemic. Over the course of the past two years, we saw each other for a weekend about every two to three weeks so this was a much slower pace of getting to know someone than I was used to. I’m providing this context because I believe our frequency of seeing each other contributed to how long it took for me to realize some things. Additionally, he is severely allergic to my cat (though he still loves them). It was a “quirk” we accepted as I was ok to always be the one to go to his place. Thus, getting to know each other happened at a slow rate, and usually under the same context (being at his place). Additionally, because this pandemic occurred, it was hard to assess whether the challenges we would face were “rare and unique” to the pandemic over what it could be like under otherwise normal circumstances. Thus, while I am grateful that the pandemic provided a unique opportunity to learn how each of us handled uncertainty and messy life things, I often wondered, if it made it unnecessarily hard at the beginning as we were getting to know each other. 

On the (slow) realization that there is something deeper going on:

The first time I came over to his place, I learned that our daily life surroundings were strikingly different (his room was a mess, he didn’t really have any cook wear and thus never cooked or have things to store food in, didn’t really furnish the place so there was no place to eat or relax other than the bedroom). I honestly didn’t think anything of it. To me, people are different and enjoy different things and being a late bloomer in some areas of my own life (and having friends and a sibling who are also late bloomers in various way) I didn’t see this as any sort of flag or cautionary thing. And even though I did feel like I was going to a dorm room every time I came over (packing my spices and cook wear so we could eat during the pandemic for example), I didn’t hold any of this against him or make any judgments from that about his character. It wouldn’t be until later on that I would see this as a part of a recurring larger pattern of lack of self-care, manifested from underlying issues which grew my concerns.

After he left his job, he eventually was able to find another one using a prior work connection. This was now during the midst of the pandemic in early 2020. This job was a work from home job and for him, this was terribly difficult. He realized that he couldn’t be productive at home and believed that he was one who needed to go to an office to be productive. I get that and being someone who has had to carry work from home, I tried my best to provide some tips or tricks that could help (creating a separate workspace, boundaries, etc). As time moved on, it became obvious that he was really struggling with motivating for work. It was also around this time when he started having days of withdrawing from me (via texting) and when I would reach out and check in, he began revealing that he was experiencing really bad depression. Hearing this, I tried to think of all the ways I could offer support and help. I knew that this was a good working opportunity for him in the moment, as it was remote during the pandemic, and also his boss was very understanding of who he was and his need for flexibility because of his history of having on and off days (he has Lyme and there are still some things, I believe, that influence how well he can feel on certain days). I didn’t want him to lose this job and knew that if nothing changed, that it was a possibility. I offered to help him rearrange some things at his place, use/borrow my furniture so he could have a table, figure out whatever was needed so that he could set up a separate workspace…whatever I thought could help based off my own experience of working from home but also what he said he may want. However, I am never one to force (and again, my history keeps me of reminding myself that my general rule is to try to not put more energy into something for someone else that they are not putting energy into) but did keep reminding that I am more than happy to help when he was ready for me to. Unfortunately, this offer was never taken and eventually he loss his job. 

Over the course of the next few months as well as retrospectively looking back, I began to notice more of how a lot of his behaviors indicate undiagnosed/untreated depression. He didn’t care for his surroundings, he never seemed too excited about things, he lacked motivation for basic life things, tasks like checking the mail was too much, etc. Along with this, while I knew he smoked week recreationally, I noticed that his use (or at least what I was around to see his use) went from after work (most likely every night) to all day, every day. I rarely saw him sober. I also know that a lot of choices and decisions are invisibly shaped by use (and how we manage mental/physical health. I started to wonder which of my current partner’s behaviors (forgetting some convos or things he would say, his need to have me leave his place after some time, not wanting to pick me up at certain times since he wants to be sober while driving, moodiness, etc) were being shaped by this. However, in these earlier moments, I just took things visit by visit. After all, it is only weed, is what I would tell myself. And additionally, things are hard in life (pandemic) and with the lack of a job and too much time, someone’s use could easily increase. As someone who happens to have highly non-addictive tendencies, I didn’t see it as a major problem (I know) until I knew he couldn’t stop even if he wanted to. I tried my best to navigate his behavior and anticipate his needs (he often didn’t know or want to think about what would make him feel better. Additionally, it was a learning curve for me to understand or figure out what things made him more anxious rather than helped. For example, I learned about how we handled hard situations differently. I tend to be someone who seeks out information in order try to prevent or maintain safety. I would keep up to date about the virus, learn things from how to appropriately wash hands to reading articles of how we believe the virus transmitted (remember how most of us were scrubbing our groceries?!). Further, my vigilance also came from my partner being more high risk so I wanted to do everything I could to make sure we could remain safe when we saw each other. He, on the other hand, wants to completely avoid the news and shut it all out. This revelation came when I went to call him (learned that that was a no-no as he hates phone calls) to inform him that grocery stores may be shutting down soon so he should try to get what he needs. This was the first time I experienced him being upset at me for giving him information and I felt awful. Thus, one of the first challenges I had to navigate was trying to figure out how I could keep myself feeling safe as I knew he didn’t keep up with any pandemic information (does he know we should have circulated air? Be wearing masks inside and out? Be socially distancing?) while respecting his boundary of not discussing or bringing up pandemic news. Another example was that when he was feeling down and we hadn’t seen each other in a month, I mailed him what I thought was a cute letter letting him know I loved him and that things will be ok but learned that it made him anxious to get the mail). I think he resented that he felt he had to get the mail which of course, made me feel bad because the purpose was to have him feel better and loved. I’m sure there are many other instances where I thought I was providing space, love, and care, but was doing the opposite. 

It would take me over the course of the next several months to really put a name on the behaviors I was seeing and discovering that mental health and substance use was part of what was going on. I knew he needed support, but I didn’t really see the big overall picture of why. I also believe this was slow to realize because we tend to have similar preferences (homebodies, inherently lazy, both like watching movies and shows and playing video games, and i also don’t have anything against weed on its own). At the earlier moments, I would see his behaviors as him having some hard days and would try to give him what he needed. It wasn’t until much later and looking back, that I saw the larger pattern of self-medicating unmanaged depression and anxiety, using that as his main coping mechanism, in hand with isolating and escaping through movies and video games. I didn’t realize that this was a potential driver of some choices he made (like when he could come get me because he didn’t want to drive while high). I saw that nearly every aspect of life was becoming very overwhelming for him. In terms of our relationship, I would often try to check in and make sure that he still wanted the same things I wanted (marriage, kids, me haha) and he assured me he did, and I really believed this. Once I realized what was happening, I slowly, when I felt appropriate, began to use these words in our dialogue, telling him I cared a lot about him but that I believe he should seek therapy or help to manage his depression and anxiety and substance use. He eventually talked to a doctor who prescribed him some anti-depressants. Though he wasn’t interested in maintaining that relationship (or one with a therapist), I tried to understand that that was a good first step and not everyone is in a place to face these challenges. In the meantime, I tried to show support in other ways by listening or being there for him. When he needed space, I gave it to him, even if that meant going another week or two without seeing him. When he got frustrated or angry, I stepped aside and tried to not let it eat at me personally and gave us space. When our first Christmas came around, his family asked me for tips of what to get him, and I gave suggestions that I hoped would help him feel happier about his surrounding space (basic cookware, furniture, patio set so we could chill out on his lovely porch!). 

Eventually, this wasn’t enough. He never found work and eventually, I was hit with news that he would have to move back home which was quite far from where we currently were. Selfishly this devastated me. He was the one person I saw during the pandemic and the thought of someone who was such a large part of a crazy period of life disappearing was quite scary. We decided to try long distance and I began to view that this was the right choice for hm. He would be close to family who can provide him care and support and room to breathe. 

His move was extremely distressful to both of us. We went through the painful process of counting down the time until he left. I helped him pack when he didn’t have the capacity or energy, and we reassured each other that if we could get through a pandemic, we could get through this. He assured me that he still saw me as someone he wanted to grow a family with and be with for a long time. I really believed that I was learning how to navigate extremely difficult challenges in tandem with someone, giving space and support while also protecting myself. Our general hopes was that we could both look at this time where we had to be apart as a chance for him to get some breathing room and space to get back on his feet and for me to keep working on my own career goals - so while it is hard now, that it will be worth it in the long run. Fast forward to a couple of days ago where I got back from traveling and we attempted a video call (I missed him and was excited to see him!). Anyways, we tried to maintain good spirits during the process and discussed how we can make it through with good communication and setting dates up and eventually we planned our first visit (over NYE) to see each other. 

Since he moved, he began becoming increasing frustrated with me. There were a few days where he wasn’t very talkative via text. After a couple of days of this, I reached out to see how he was doing and tried to state what I needed was for him to be present when we did chat (he was frequently missing what I was texting or didn’t read it correctly or would skip some parts) and that I need communication. He stated he hasn’t been as communicative because things have been overwhelming for him and that he also didn’t want to tell me that he spent all day smoking. I told him I understood that but that I would rather hear from him even if that is what he has been doing, after all, I love him, love hearing from him about the small and large things in life, and also there was no expectation that he would just stop smoking cold turkey and that things would magically change when he moved. At the same time, I knew that this whole process has been overwhelming for me too, and I was starting to really feel that the space for my needs were increasingly diminishing. The call didn’t last long as when he mentioned that he hoped to unpack boxes in his room, and I replied with “that would be nice!” which triggered him to be in a bad mood and feel as though I was judging him (this was not at all the case). But again, I believed we had learned how to better navigate these things by giving space and time and distance. I thought that that would be the groundwork that gave us a chance to work together for what may lie ahead. However, in the end, that wasn’t the case. This led to the next couple of days of tension and then resulted in him feeling anxious about me seeing him (he also mentioned traveling with the new surges happening) and cancelling the trip and us breaking up. This was also when I placed a name on the reactions as being feelings of resentment, which he then later believed was happening as well. Looking back, I wonder if it was also probably around the time when I started discussing him seeking treatment that my words of support and encouragement began coming off as me not liking who he is.

Now here I am. 

Despite the challenges we faced, I really did love our relationship, at least right now looking back. I loved the fact that \*when\* we did talk and communicate, we did so very honestly and directly. We eventually got to the point where we were very good about handling conflict and our induvial differences by saying we needed to stop and can return to an issue, allowing each other space to cool off, and also, we never tried to place blame or make situations be right or wrong. It was quite refreshing. I did also feel like he really listened to me, and even if he didn’t understand why I would feel how I did and would attempt to make changes or do small things that showed me that he cared about how I felt. I felt like I also returned this. Finally, I had the opportunity to practice my boundaries because I felt safe in doing so. While we are very different in many ways, I saw how many of these differences could be resolved through communication and willingness, something that I find important in a lasting partnership as conflict will always arise in new situations. I will always be forever grateful for that. 

I felt like I did everything I could to show support, provide help, and allow him the space he needed. In the end, I know that I can’t ever fix a person, but show them that they deserve love and self-care and that if they are ready and willing to tackle these issues that they themselves no longer want, I would be there. As his partner, it was painful to see this happen to him. I also knew I couldn’t fix anything. I did what I thought was my best in navigating this line — show my love and support through being there for him, giving him he space he needed when he didn’t want to be around anyone, providing help when he did need or want it. Now I am pondering on what I have done that may have caused someone to feel such resentment towards me. One day, I may be ready to move on, and it is most likely that I will probably meet others who have similar struggles and want to learn how to be supportive without causing resentment.

When I was younger, I remember feeling like the world was falling apart when my parents fought - I remember wanting to do things to help patch them up. The thought of them splitting would traumatize me - I also remember feeling suffocated and shriveled up when my parents would ask my who I wanted to live with. 

All this being said, I’ve come out pretty headstrong… 

The point of this post (and the backstory) is me seeking help about this feeling that I’ve always had and have never been able to rationalize: when I was younger I hated the thought of looking at toys or anything else that regular kids (myself included) would collect and source a ‘certain child-like’ freedom. I remember going to the extent of wanting to get rid of them (I’ve throw them away a couple of times) to get rid of the pit-like feeling in my stomach. 

Recently, while I was at college (before winter break) - there’s this girl I really wanted to ask out but i had the same pit-like feeling that’s always kept me from getting what I want (emotionally).

What is this? Is it just regular jitters or something more? If I had to dissect it , it isn’t the ‘asking out that’s daunting, its what happens after

Stop being desperate. Stop actively and aggressively looking for a gf. Work and improve on yourself. With time and chance, someone will come along, see you for the great person that you became, and decide to want to be with you. Simple as that. 

This is to all my dudes who are just simply desperate for a gf just to make themselves feel good or happy or just to boost their ego. Trust me; not to brag or flaunt, but once I came to this realization, I decided to focus on myself and move away from “the game.” Although I am not yet in a relationship, things have finally come about to where I notice that someone finally seems to have an interest in me. 

Plz, improve on yourself with only your well-being in mind, and it’ll help you long term. And if you do improve and no partner comes still, well guess what? You’ll still be happy on your own, and with greater freedom, as you won’t have to consider the feelings of another person.

As I'm trying to get better at dating and evaluating my worth, i still don't know how I can react or how i should react to certain ""things"" that dating brings since I'm a very romantically driven person.

I've been talking to this guy (26) i matched with on Tinder for about a week now. He was born and raised in my hometown in Greece but now lives in London. Since the beginning, he said that he's looking for ""friends"" considering the circumstances etc to which i replied ""There is no need to be a label, just go with the flow"".

Since we exchanged social media accounts we talked for some days. These days he seemed very interested, very sweet and very romantic. He was a little bit too much romantic at times (using the word ""us"" or things that imply a romantic intimacy) to which i am no fool and tried to be as rational as i could. He seemed to forget that he said the ""only friends"" scenario. Very weird.

We said that we should go out asap since the vibe was really good and this is where trouble starts. At first he said he wasn't sure when he would be able to and since he's leaving mid January, we could schedule it sometime. 
That was fine by me, after that, we didn't talk for one day, next day i text him and he leaves me on read after a very dry conversation, today he texted me and we chatted. I brought up the issue of going out again even suggesting some dates (to which he ignored) and his general response was ""I don't even know"".

Now i get that he might be busy with family etc but I don't really understand how you can ""supposedly"" like someone so much but have legit no time to set a date? I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt but it's all kinda BS to me.

I’m not actively looking for a relationship, but if it happens so be it. I matched with a guy on Tinder earlier this month, and we clicked. We’ve been on several dates, and he always makes an effort to see me. After our first date, we agreed that we could see things going well between us.

We had good chemistry over text and went on a first date. We held hands and made out, and a few days after the date he said that he was obsessed with me, falling for me, and could see himself spending his life with me, and that he might be my perfect match. 

But he wanted to have unprotected sex in his car on the second date and if it was good, we'd be in a relationship. I'm a virgin and didn't want to have my first time be in a car with a guy I only knew for a few weeks and only interacted with in person once before. He said that we didn't have to have sex on the second date, but that us being in a relationship would be delayed until we did, because he needed to see how good the sex is first.

We stopped talking to each other shortly after that, but since then I've been going back and forth between thinking he just wanted to have sex with me and kicking myself for having a really attractive guy be really into me for the first time in my life and then me ruining it. 

I messaged him on social media last month and asked him if he actually liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted sex. He said that he did like me at first but I ruined it.

After thinking about it for a bit, I came to the conclusion that he actually ruined it. Taking him at his word, he was falling for me and liked me enough to see himself spending his life with me, but he was so insistent on unprotected sex on the second date, even though I didn't want to and was hesitant about it. That's not what I'm asking.

I'm just wondering if I phrased the question wrong, only giving him those two choices.

They’re all great - Including being at each other’s homes. We’re open and comfortable with each other real quick.
We’re texting most days and all that jazz - everything’s really clicking. Wonderful!

So everything’s going great. She’s super enthusiastic and would even insist driving way across town to spend just a bit of time with me some nights (she’d come to mine more than I to hers)

After a month of us being really into each other, I asked her to go to a museum on a Sunday, she can’t make it - no biggie.

We make plans for the Thursday but she cancels cos her brother got Covid (he’s in another city) and her Xmas plans were now a bit up in the air and generally she was down about her brother being sick - OK, no worries.

She gets in touch on the Saturday saying she’s still feeling low. I offer to come over or do whatever she wants, or nothing at all together, to try and cheer her up. She says thanks but no thanks …. Hmmmmm.
She’s expressed she wants some space at this point to deal with her shit and I totally respect that boundary.

Anyways, I gotta go visit my family for Xmas which is in another city. She initiated contact, wishes me a great trip and Christmas. I do the same to her and say if she wants to reach out and chat over the break, hassle me anytime. Once again I dont want to hassle and crowd her.

There are a few merry xmas texts checking in that get replies but kinda go nowhere over the break.

Then a week goes by ….. nothing.

So I address it by texting that things seem to have cooled off for some reason and if you want to call it off please communicate honestly with me so we don’t waste each other’s time.

She replies she has Covid (I feel terrible about her being sick) and that we should call it off because she “would hate to waste my time”. Ouch.

So, I’m sad and agree and respect her decision. But I’m just wondering what the hell I did wrong!?!

Did I blow it bringing it to a head with that text or was I a dead duck all along? Sounds like another guy maybe….?

Call me naive but I just don’t understand how someone changes tack like that! (Being so into me to shutting me out) I probably need a few days to get some space on this to see it properly.

But I will try and keep it short. Feel free to ask me questions about anything, whether that be below in the comments or my DMs.

Some background: I am a 22-year-old virgin man. I also come from an abusive background where I have consistently been taken advantage of. Because of this, I suffer with some mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. I have had to visit the hospital before, but I go to therapy, and I take medication. I feel pretty stable at this point. I am currently a sophomore in college but have no real home to call my own because I cut ties with my parents. I have several friends, but no one I feel comfortable fully confiding in (apart from one online friend).

I have precious little experience with women, but what experience I do have is not that great. I have tried dating apps, but that has almost always ended with me being ghosted (I barely get any matches to begin with). I have been introduced to a girl by a friend, but that didn't end well either and I was just strung along. I have even stepped outside of my comfort zone before: I've attempted a cold approach before (bad idea) and even acted on trying to start a relationship with a little crush I had (she stopped talking to me). I cuddled with a couple different girls, but the experience wasn't special to them in the slightest, and it crushed me.

I honestly have no idea where to turn. I think having a girlfriend would be awesome and maybe even help me out in some ways. It would be nice to be held and feel loved, you know? I want someone I can feel safe with. But I have had no luck, and I feel this overwhelming sense of loneliness day after day. I've lived a dark and pretty hopeless life. I want someone to share my life with now, instead of walking alone. I understand getting a girlfriend won't magically solve all my problems; hopefully I am not giving off that impression. And I understand that relationships are a two-way street, and I would also be there for her.

In short, I feel like I have exhausted all of my avenues to getting a good healthy relationship. I don't know what else to do.

He's my ""fwb"", who I'm attached to more than I'm supposed to. After him asking to see for month and me saying no because I knew he'd cancel last minute, I gave in and said yes. He seemed excited or so I thought. Not surprisingly, he cancelled five minutes before.   Here's how the conversation went.  

Me: ""How are you feeling?"" (2 hours before I wanted to make sure he didn't have any COVID symptoms)  

Me: ""Should I change?"" (20 minutes before our planned meet up)  

Him: ""No I'm not feeling well."" (2 minutes before)  

Me: ""Was it so hard to text me an hour ago?.""

Me: ""Is it COVID? Do you need a rapid test?""  

Him: ""No. I don't think so.""  

Me: ""Does it boost you ego....getting me to say yes and then bailing?""  

Him: ""Wtf. No.""  

This is when I got really mad and blocked him. But my friends made me feel really guilty and said that he may have COVID. So I added him back and said ""Sorry. I exaggerated. Add me back.""  So he added me back and sad ""Man. Please. I'm not feeling good.""  At this point, I thought that he may have COVID because the numbers are really up where I live and asked him if he needed me to drop him a COVID test.  

He said: ""No. It's not COVID I'm just not feeling it. Moody.""  

This is when I got really disappointed with myself.  I probably said things that I should have but here's how the conversation went.   

Me: ""I hate you. Mainly because I really like you. And every time I say no he won't have the audacity to cancel five mins before and then you do. And it just hurts me and makes me put into question if I even have the slightest worth as a human to you. Maybe you’re really going through something but saying you’re not feeling it just makes me think you just didn’t want to see me and we both know this is not the first time you do this I know it’s just a “fwb” relationship and it’s not that serious but that doesn’t mean you get to treat me like this.""  

Him: ""I know. I wish I was in a better state. but I'm not.""  

Me: ""You're never in a better state. Mainly because you never really liked me. So you don't even try. I've seen you three times in this whole year. You're obv not that into me. Idk why I keep wasting my time.""  

Him: ""Stop being dramatic. I going through my own personal shit.""  

Me: ""You say this every time. Are you saying the world turned upside down in the past 24 hours?""  

Him: ""yeah.""  Me: ""Just tell me what happened?""  

Him: ""Nothing. I'm allowed to not want to hang out to focus on me.""  

Me: ""Wtf. You've been asking for a month. You're just talking to another girl and don't want to see me so you don't ruin things with her, How would seeing me for an hour ruin your focus? How did I let this happen so many times? I can't believe I'm this dumb. You just get me to say yes ad then premed to be busy. This is textbook definition of narcotic behaviour. I'm just saying my last words. I'll never fight you again because that's exactly what you want. Not that you care but I'll see someone else and you'll never see my face agin and instead you should see a therapist. Otherwise, you'd just end up alone snapping your pe\\\*\\\*s to random snapchat girls.""  

Him: ""I'm not seeing anyone. Please stop."" 

Me: ""I'll stop. You simply didn't;t want to see me. You'll never understand how much this hurt so there's no point of fighting.""  

Him: ""Bro. I DON'T FEEL GOOD.""  Me: ""Hope you feel better one day. Bye.""  

Him: ""Thanks I do too.""  

The end.

To understand this story it’s going to take a minute, so if you don’t really care nows your chance to leave.

I went to a summer camp in Moab. It was a fantastic experience and I made a ton of new friends. I had tried not to focus on girls as I thought it might ruin the experience but as the week began to wind down and we all left and went home.. the girl who I secretly had my eye on the whole time said she had a huge crush on me. Normally this would be a dream come true except she lives 621 miles in another state completely out of reach. I had been in a long distance relationship before and it was catastrophic so I was immediately pretty bummed. But I really liked this girl so I decided I would do my best and just see where it went.

Fast forward 1 month later, we had talked every single day for hours on end. She surprised me and was coming down to visit for three days. Needless to say, I fell in love with her during those three days. We visit led everything there was to see, watched countless movies together, went driving, blasted music, laughed. And to top it all off she was my first kiss.

The week after she left was hands down the saddest week of my life.

Now once again, fast forward 5 months and the relationship has lasted 5 months longer than I thought it would.
I miss her every single day and I’m starting to wonder if I’ll ever see her again. 

I’m not really sure what I’m asking for I just really wanted to vent. And who better to vent to than random people on the internet.

This is my first relationship so I’m not exactly sure what I’m doing. This isn’t his first relationship but it is his longest lasting one. He was the first one that said I love you and that was 3 months in. I initiated our first kiss during the first time I slept over at his house which was 5 months into the relationship. Some extenuating circumstances made it unable for us to see each other for November and December. I’m finally able to start seeing him again January 9th.

I must also note that while I am fully out, he is only out to friends and not family, therefore I haven’t been around for that part of his life even though he’s met my immediate family. For more context pertaining to the title of this post, I never once thought I’d be in a committed romantic relationship as I was content with having purely sexual encounters. Now that I met him, my entire outlook on my previously nonexistent dating life has changed. I haven’t had sex since the pandemic started because it felt unsafe. I now feel like I’m at a point where I want to start being sexually active with him. He’s never had sex before and I have no idea how to bring it up to him as he isn’t a very sexual person in general. He has expressed interest in it though. This has been the only struggle I’ve had so far in our relationship and I don’t want to ruin it because of one thing. However, I feel like if I wait for him to make the move, it won’t happen for a while because neither he nor I know how to initiate the conversation.

He then proceeded to conclude his lecture with, ""Not to be like your parent but you know better."" I was shook.

In another instance, he's very good at reading me. He often asks if there was anything he could do to help.

For the sake of the story I’m just going to give him a generic name like Adam. 

I just got out of a three year relationship when Adam and I started talking. I immediately recognised Adam and I had a lot of similar traits. We even worked in the same field. I loved Adam’s sense of adventure and ambition. 

We’ve been seeing each other for a month. I like sex as much as the next person but I’ve been hesitant with Adam because of his background. Years ago I had a really close Afghanistan friend who told me Afghanistan guys will always date but never marry outside their culture. I was upfront about my concerns with Adam and he told me he wasn’t dating an Afghanistan girl because he felt like they had to be brought and he liked the idea of a more equal relationship. I want to give Adam the benefit of the doubt but I’m scared of being someone’s experiment.

In the month we’ve been dating Adam hasn’t really been a touchy person. He doesn’t kiss me goodbye, he doesn’t touch my leg or do the typical things to show me he wants me. The only way I can describe how he’s been is very abrupt. He goes from no touching to aggressively making out with me. The most that had happened is slight groping before I stop him.

One day, he encourages me to nap in his bed. I’ve slept in his bed before and nothing has happened. But also to add to that, as a bi woman I don’t think anyone has the right to your body without your consent regardless of the gender or situation. I wake up because he started slipping his hands into my underwear and feeling me up. Instead of getting angry I just move his hand and hope he gets the point. He persists a second time, I move his hand. He does it a third time but this time tries to finger me. I move away from him and show I’m awake. It’s obviously awkward as hell and ends with him apologising but also saying it’s hard for him because we’re cuddling. I forgive him but make a mental note of the situation. 

One night we get drunk at his place. I eventually want to go home but because we’re both drunk and I have my car there he told me to stay at his. When he saw my hesitation he told me he’d just sleep on the couch. So I go upstairs. Pass out. I wake up and realise he’s in bed next to me but there’s also a pillow barricade next to us. Apparently it became really cold in the living room and this was the only way he could control his urges. 

Am I being an idiot? Part of the reason I’m not as upset about the sa as I should be is because I do want to sleep with him but I want more reassurance + flirtation + foreplay. And obviously to be awake. So… thoughts? Was it just a mistake?

I have no right to tell other people how to experience life.  All I can do is share my experience after living nearly 50 years, 30 of them with the same man.  

I don't remember how I found Reddit.  I feel like I am a minority here as a middle age white woman.  But, I care about people and can't help but hurt for the number of people who seem to feel alone and unloveable.  

Here's what I want you to know: 

1). Everyone has worth and deserves respect.  I believe everyone has a purpose in life, even if it doesn't seem profound.  It's not about what we do in life, but how we make people feel. You're more likely to make an impact listening and being patient with someone than if you were to find a cure for cancer.  

2) living and caring for yourself and others is a choice.  How you respond to life is a choice.  There are a lot of things that we can't change in life... What we're born into, our race, our height, many medical conditions... Lots of stuff.  But when it comes to (good) relationships, it's really not about us.  It's about how we make others feel.  

I chose to treat people with respect.  I chose to reach out to others and listen to them.  I chose not to be judgemental.  Dating today seems to be more about rejecting people rather than getting to know them.  We have laundry lists of what we don't want.  While I believe there are some big things that make good dealbreakers, the fewer demands you have, to more open you are to love. 

3) you're not looking to build a championship football team.  You're not looking to hire a crew to send a rocketship to Mars.  You don't need to find 3 or 10 or 100 people you are attracted to and who all want to be together at the same time and same place.  You are (probably) looking for ONE person.  I kinda believe in the idea of ""the one"". And I kinda believe in ""soulmates"".  But I don't believe there is only one soulmate that we have to find like looking for a needle in a haystack.  

Close doesn't only count in horseshoes and hand grenades.  Perfect doesn't exist.  Once you get CLOSE to finding someone that you care about and that cares about you, choice carries you the rest of the way.  That's because in a good relationship, we choose to listen. We choose to communicate.  We choose to be patient and kind, and we choose to forgive.  

You don't have to find The One.  You're not going to find someone else ""perfect"" for you. That's like trying to find a person whose fingerprints match your own.  Finding your person is less about that perfect match, than finding the glove that fits.  Not every glove will fit.  Not every glove will match your style.  But one thing is certain.  You're not going to conjure up a glove out of thin air.  You have to reach out your hand and try on a few styles to see what's really the best fit. 

I don't know who's reading this.  But whoever and wherever you are, you are important and loveable.  Wishing you peace and joy in the new year and years to come.

Ps... My husband and I choose over and over again to be there for each other.  We choose to show respect.  We choose to be decent to each other.  We choose to overlook each other's flaws.  We are far from perfect.  We make mistakes.  But we choose to overlook what's unimportant for the sake of having tomorrow together.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1144181,public,self,"Finding the one for the lonely, anxious, depressed.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rtfp6c/finding_the_one_for_the_lonely_anxious_depressed/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

Well there's this guy that I have been talking to for a little bit now (not like that, just talking to talk and not be lonely) I worked with him a while back. He's super cool, he's in a band and plays shows. We talk about music and share songs, feelings blah blah.

I'm on Tinder and I saw his profile and I swiped right. What the heck, doesn't hurt to try. A few hours later, I got a notification. He matched with me. We didn't bring it up for a few days. Didn't talk as much. 

But tonight he texts me and asks how I am tonight. Honestly I wasn't too good. Kind of in my feels. He said he wanted to come see me then we talked on the phone for 45 minutes. I was at my parents for new years tonight. I texted him address and he came and brought me food, plus we watched a show together that were both in to (peaky blinders) Yall it was so nice. He was a little stoned but it was so funny. We chilled for a few hours. He was so sensual that it made me feel all kinds of things. He put his arm around me. We kissed a few times. We were playing with our hands together and just sliding our fingers around the others. Eventually he laid on my lap and was rubbing my ankles amd giving my calve a massage. I scratched his back and he fell asleep on my  lap. It was so cute

But anyways we both got tired and called it a night. It's like he knew I just needed to be caressed, and held. It was awesome. That's all it was.

We’ve been together for nearly 4 years now and the past year has been hectic. I feel like he’s too busy for me. And before I sound ungrateful please hear me out !! I can never get tired at someone for being tired or for being busy, I don’t expect to be a big big priority in his life because he has his own life to live. Seeing how busy he was made me want to start doing things to make myself busy too so that I don’t wait around for him. 

But he’s so busy that we don’t really get to speak to each other at all for days on end. I haven’t seen him for 3 months even though he lives only 20 minutes away. I’m not really complaining about not seeing him, I guess I just wanted to talk to him. 

He would tell me he’s going to speak to me the next day but then when the time comes around he gets too tired. The thing is, he’s genuinely trying. He’s honestly the kindest person I’ve ever met and he would never intentionally hurt me. I know all of this is unintentional (even though it probably doesn’t sound like it because of the way I worded it) but he’s really trying. 

Even though he’s trying I don’t seem to want to speak to him anymore. I guess it’s tested my patience a lot, it’s been like this for a whole year now, since January last year it’s been like this. I find that little things he does irritate me. Sometimes I’d make plans to play a game together and he would be too tired. Even though we had a decent conversation last night, I still don’t want to speak to him today. 

I have communicated how this hurts me several times, I’ve explained to him that my wants in a relationship has changed and he’s very understanding about that, he was so sweet about it. 

I almost feel guilty for not wanting to speak to him and feel like I kind of have to force myself to do so.

We had plans to go on a date before I left but I had to cancel due to a COVID scare. But we have talked on the phone for about an hour every day since and text all day. He is very good looking, about 7 years older than me, and I really enjoy talking to him. We have a lot in common and are very similar, but I cant help but feel insecure.

He does photography on the side of his 9-5 job. He takes photos of GORGEOUS women (one of the things we have in common is photography). It makes me insecure. I am pretty attractive, but not influencer IG attractive if you catch my drift. I have also recently gained weight due to a health issue, so I just don't feel like I even begin to compare to any of these girls. 

He is so sweet and very consistent in communication which I like. But he also always talks about wanting to meet my family eventually (I have been with them over the holidays), go on vacation together, calls me pet names (i.e ""my love"", ""babe,"" ""baby"" etc), and he has made a list of future activities we will do together when I am home in a few weeks, even though we have not met IRL. I have been in an abusive relationship before, so I am very scared that this is lovebombing. He sent me ""I have such a good feeling about you. I love my life the way it is but you would be an amazing addition to it, I look forward to talking to you everyday - you make me smile so much.""  He even told me that he told his best friend about me, about how much we have in common, how ""beautiful"" I am, and how ""comfortable"" he feels when talking to me, and as if he can tell me anything. He has sent me ""you are my favorite person"", ""can we just get married already,"" ""I am so excited about you, you have no idea"" and we sext almost everyday in addition to that. I feel as if those things are a tad intense for not having spent anytime in person together and dance on the line of lovebombing. 

I am also nervous that I cannot live up to the expectations in his head / I will be a disappointment when he sees me in person. I looked at his IG and saw a girl who I think is his ex. She is an absolute BOMBSHELL.. I cannot even begin to compare to this Victoria Secret-esque woman.

I am really excited about him. And the attention from him has been so nice. But the things I mentioned above make me want to end it before it even starts because I am already insecure. I send him selfies and pics of my body, so he does know what I look like. But it is hard to look at his IG that's full of smokeshow women that he photographs. I feel like he is so successful and could easily date one of them, so why the hell is he talking to me??

 I am confident in my personality, intelligence, my face etc., but my body is by far my BIGGEST insecurity. So its hard to see these gorgeous women in bikinis with their insanely amazing bodies when I know that is NOT what my body looks like at the moment.

I guess I am just looking for some guidance here as to whether this is lovebombing / if this is even worth pursuing.

I feel like I've come a long way over the past few years, but I keep finding myself thinking about one particular relationship in the past. A few years back, when I was 19/20 and starting college, I was mutual friends with this one girl on Twitter, who is transgender. I don't really know what she saw in me, but she eventually confessed that she liked me. About a week later we started dating. Things were going pretty good, and to be honest, I really liked her. She was really pretty, we had a lot of similar interests, etc. Eventually I pretty much dumped her, because my parents are your everyday Conservative, fundamentalist Christian type, and I was worried how they'd react. I hate to think about it, but at the time I was an insecure kid who just recently started college. I turned something that wouldn't really have been that big of a deal into a huge problem, and I dealt with it in entirely the wrong way. (And as much as I hate to say it, I was somewhat right about my anxieties. My parents have said some pretty shitty things about trans folks in the years since).

Now, soon after I immediately realized that I fucked up big time. And again, being an insecure kid, I dealt with it the wrong way. I was 100% That Ex. Rambling apologies, saying a shitload without really getting across what I wanted to say, etc. After taking a lot of time to myself, eventually this year we talked a bit, and she acknowledged that we've both changed over the years, and she doesn't have any hard feelings whatsoever. We'll wish eachother a Merry Christmas every year and occasionally chat about stuff like we used to.

But I can't seem to escape the knowledge that, if we had started dating a few years later, like today, we actually could have been good together. Every single problem during and after the relationship was entirely my fault. If I had just slowed down for a minute, and talked to her about my family anxiety, we could have figured out a way to push through that together. Instead I ripped the relationship in half, and set it on fire when there was still hope for a second chance. I don't blame her at all for just wanting to be friends. It just hurts because I STILL feel like I've never explained how much I wish things could have worked out.
