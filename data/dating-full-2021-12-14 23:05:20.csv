From what I can tell she doesn't really talk to anyone else in the class, and is not as outgoing when questioned or greeted by another classmate. We had a class lab and our seats were separated far apart, yet she still came to me (seemingly before she even came to the teacher) to ask me for help on the lab which gradually turned into casual conversation before we had to attend to our business. On one of my tests where we weren't supposed to look at another's desk she out of nowhere peeked at a question I was struggling with and gave me some hints on the knowledge I needed to solve it, without me even asking for help. Another event was  me politely asking her if she needed help when she made her sighing loud and clear as she was doing homework. She immediately responded no, but then continued the conversation towards the subject of being tired/not wanting to be in this class and asking me all sorts of questions about how I was enjoying class like she did on the first day. When doing work in class she constantly glances at me (can't tell if she's judging me or my actions) sometimes for extended periods of time (1.5 extra seconds) before I return the glance and she always immediately turns her head back. Outside of class though, she seems hesitant to talk to me and at times ignores my existence. I'd appreciate some help here, does she have a minor or major crush on me, does she think I'm a friend or is she just trying to get my attention?

I met this girl recently, she's flippin beautiful and we get along well, we have a lot in common. She's a friend of a friend so we've hung out in a group and even had some one-to-one time, and honestly, she makes me feel that giddy/lovey feeling that I haven't felt in years. 

We were out with friends the other night and spoke about having a day of watching this trashy TV show that we both like together, or going for a walk in this beautiful park near my place. I went to bed last night with the biggest smile on my face, I could barely sleep because of all these loved up feeling that I had. 

I decided I had to ask her out, so I sent her a message asking if she'd like to go the park with me at lunchtime on Thursday or Friday. She responded with a pretty resounding yes, saying that it sounded amazing, but told me that she's busy on Thursday and Friday lunchtime. I suggested we could go in the morning if it was easier, but she suggested we do it around New Years instead. 

All good signs, right? Yet, somehow I feel depressed about it and have convinced myself that her response means she's not interested. It's really dumb because she basically said yes but is busy this week, yet I somehow flip it around in my head like she's just trying to be nice without saying on. 

This is a problem I had years ago, I'd have a fantastic experience with a crush or girlfriend, yet the moment I left her, I felt like things had gone to shit. 

For example, right now I'm thinking ""She's probably going to bring a friend, I didn't explicitly say that I wanted to take her on a date. She's way out of my league, and she's a lovely person, so she's just trying to be nice. If she really wanted to go on the date, she'd want to find time this week in her schedule"". 

I know this is just bullshit, and my friend is telling me that her response was an excellent sign. I'm just anxious as fuck about it and wish I could just settle with her response. I got over this problem years ago, but I feel like I haven't liked someone so much in a long time, and COVID has wrecked my social skills. I haven't been with a girl in years, so my dating or sex game is another story.

I realize I'm totally overthinking this, and from my own experience, getting carried away with thoughts like this can completely wreck an opportunity. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to deal with these thoughts, as I'm sure I can't be the only one...

**TL;DR:** Met a girl I really, really like, asked her to go to the park with me for a walk and she said yes, but not for a couple weeks. Somehow my brain turns this into a ""no"", and I have depressing anxiety as a result. Any one else deal with such thoughts?

Every day, I chatted with one of the guys (outgoing and talkative, the type that gets along well with everyone), the other one was around but didn't say much. If I'm completely honest, I didn't even notice him properly. Then the talkative guy took his annual leave. The remaining guy was very reserved, and when he came to talk to me, I was busy doing phone calls regarding an urgent issue. He walked off. The next days he didn't come to see me, so I went to his office and asked how he's doing. He said he was busy, but later admitted he felt a bit too shy to approach me without his friend. We talked a more and then something changed. He told me about himself, we told each other jokes and he really seemed to open up. He even gave me his phone number so that I could meet up with his friend and him on the weekend. He said that his friend is bringing his girlfriend. We talked in the mutual chat group but I didn't text or call him yet. I would want to, but it's just difficult for me to see if he is interested, too. One day I was sick and the next day he immediately walked up to my desk and said he missed me, he asked a co-worker and was told I was sick, so he was worried. Sadly I actually didn't have time to meet up with his friends and him that weekend. I really hope he didn't think I was just making up excuses.

(Absolutely 0 texting skills)

But the moment I see someone I like all that confidence of talking freely just vanishes off (*poof*) and my mind goes completely blank....and so finding a date the conventional way is also gone.

What do I do?

They lost contact for a few months bc a girl he liked at the time asked him to stop talking to her. He did and now regrets doing that to her bc he never even dated the girl in the first place. His friend got possessive with his future GFs since then.

***Now what happened is:*** We (relationship length: +3years, we're all 24yo) used to go to the gym together before covid hit and the gyms closed. He recently asked me (early December) to resume going with him, and I replied I'd go starting January bc I'd already started an at-home exercise program weeks ago and I wanted to finish it first. Interestingly enough after I said no, he says she asked him to go with her. He told me he'd stop going with her once I went. (His gym membership allows him to bring only 1 guest along with him)

My initial reaction was positive, as they hadn't gone out much before this, so that he could go out his longtime friend. But last week:

* *Her mom asked her if I wasn't mad that they were seeing each other so much* (I'm a med student and see him 2x a week. They are going to the gym 3x per week. With this he admitted that it's a bit weird for him too to see her more than me)
* *He forgot about a date we had bc he was at the gym with her*. Instead of picking me up at 3pm, he came at 5:30 (because I called)
* *He called me by her name* (twice, says **he also accidentally calls her love sometimes, that he is always mixing up the names**, as if that's supposed to make me feel better) 

So I asked him to stop going with her or at least to tell her of our initial arrangement, (that I am going with him on January and that he'd stop going with her). I just don't feel comfortable with them seeing each other the same amount of time we do. And then he felt I was being controlling and manipulative (like the girl in the context) and said I was no different than her. About our January arrangement, he says he will now go 6x a week, so he can go 3x with her and 3x with me. 

According to him this is totally okay bc it's just the gym, he is not inviting her to dinner like he does with me, and bc I was the one who said no in the first place and now it would be odd to tell her they can't go anymore. He doesn't want to upset her bc of a GF again, says my motives for going in January are only to keep her from him and that's controlling. I feel he IS inviting her to the gym he pays, so it IS like inviting her to dinner, and that if I can't go to something I'm easily replaceable.

*TL;DR: When I said I'd go to the gym with him in January, not this month, his female best friend asked him to go with her. Originally we planned he'd stop going with her once I went. Then he forgot about a date we had, has called me by her name twice, and they are going out 3x a week when I only see him 2x a week. Now that I asked him to tell her Im going in January or to come with me, he feels he's being controlled and instead plans to go 3x with her and 3x with me a week, completely changing what we had previously agreed on.*

 Any advice would be appreciated, I don't know if I even want to go in January with him anymore or what does this says about him not taking my feelings into account.

I'm not terrible at dating. Although I've only ever had one girlfriend, I've gone on well over a dozen dates with other people over the course of my life. I even captured the interest of two different women a few months ago, one of whom even gave me a second date (but sadly one lost interest in me, and I lost interest in the other).

But now I'm trying to get back into the dating game. I'm struggling to find out what to say on these dating apps when I send women intros. 

Typically, if they share a hobby or interest on their profile, I'll ask them about that (i.e., ""who are your favorite metal bands?""). But so many women have nothing worth talking about in their profiles. They just write, ""I'm just trying to figure out life, i LiKe fOoD aNd bObA, not sure what I'm looking for on here, message me because I can't see likes 😊"" - and the absolute WORST one, ""if you wanna get to know me, just ask 😊"" There's nothing about that profile that allows me to easily start a conversation. I don't even know what I'm supposed to do with that.

The problem is that a lot of women want us men to be ""interesting"", but I find that this is extremely hard to do when most woman have empty profiles.

I thought of a variety of valid explanations:
-I was raised in majority-white environments
-I saw white men as love interests or objects of desire in the media
-I’m self-hating and insecure about my blackness and sought a closer proximity to whiteness
-My own black father didn’t get to spend enough time with me during my formative years and now I seek the opposite of him thinking a white man will be more reliable

I think there’s truth to all of these possibilities, but recently I’ve uncovered a larger preference that also encompasses my racial preference. I want someone who seems very mainstream and well-established by traditional American standards. When I re-examined the specific kind of white men I find attractive it’s WASPy, clean-cut, older, white-collar, politically moderate to conservative professionals who went to top-ranked schools and dress in preppy clothes and have traditional interests like golf and wine tasting. My general preference doesn’t extend to white Europeans, bohemian or alternative white men, or other men who notably deviate from this type, even if they are white. 

I think this comes from an urge to be accepted or viewed favorably by society at large. Like if I can get this guy who looks good on paper and fits a conventional idea of success and desirability then it reflects well on me.

His phone was fully charged when he left and has never ever died during the day before, plus he sits on a computer with a charger right next to him, and he has a Apple Watch he could have messaged me off if he wanted to. 

When he got home I was waiting for him in new Lingerie in his favourite colour and We had sex. He finished but it seemed like he didn’t enjoy it as much as normal.

I got his favourite cake which is really hard to get here I had to go 1.5 hours away for it. 

He really loves video games and the Gundam figures.
I got him $100 Xbox credit for coins on his favourite game which he’s always saying he doesn’t have enough of, and some of the Gundam action figures he didn’t have, and preordered one which hasn’t arrived yet. 

After I gave him those and we had sex I said 
“what do you want to do now? We could play Xbox or watch your fav show or something”. 
All he said was that he wanted to go to the gym, call his mum then go get food for himself. 

I told him I ordered for his favourite food to be delivered for dinner (we live in barracks and don’t have a kitchen or else I would cook for him). He said no he just get something himself.

Now he’s super pissed at me because I said I wanted to do that for him and offered that stuff to spend time together and says he can’t do what he wants on his own birthday and to leave him alone for a while.

I do feel very sexual and I am so very grateful of my body and looks, but I have always had a weird relationship with my sexuality and the idea of “giving” myself to another person. So it was my first relationship, lasted for about three years (we kissed after 8 months, had intimate relations 1,5 years into it). It was very deep in a superficial way I seem to think now, he saw me (he a friend of my cousin, M27) and decided/pursued the relationship and I was naive, and said yes eventually because he was persistent (he is not a bad man, but I would not have been with him if he had accepted my no’s). I think we both had issues and allowed our comfortabilities and codependency to trap us. We didn’t communicate well, I had no idea what I was doing (growing up with not much knowledge of how to be a girlfriend?) after trust issues from both parts, we decided to end the relationship. I then found out I was pregnant, he wanted the child but was still supportive when I decided to abort. We both have been civil since the break-up (rarely get I miss you texts) he is usually toxic, but he stopped after a while and now he is in a relationship and acting very respectful towards me (we move in the same circles). Just to explain my love life in a short story, 

I am good at being open and good at making conversation, but usually I just get bored or have a feeling like this is not the one. Think since me and my ex broke up, maybe 9 men have been in want to be more with me. So like they still check up on me to this day (I am usually very honest and hate bad vibes, so I never play men for a fool) - but I am obviously the problem, but what is wrong with me? I do not feel like my ex and I should be together but not a lot of people have the kind of vibe that I fall for (can this be a case of me being too set on a type??) I appreciate confident people, humble but who do not feel ashamed about being themselves in any way. Apparently in my experience that’s not the case, men seem intentional at first then it kinda changes and I always am in control or they do not understand boundaries…

Today in work me and this girl I work with had what was probably the most fun conversation I’ve had with anyone in a long time. Like that way you’re with someone and you can’t stop yourself from laughing at something every 2 minutes you’re around them. The kind of one where when someone else enters the room the vibe kind of changes, as if they’re intruding a little on your alone time. Where you’re teasing each other relentlessly but then you kind of make eye contact and start cracking up over it. It felt really fucking good.

Anyway, I’ve been here before with a previous work colleague and other girls. It’s never ended where I wanted it to. That first girl is now one of my best friends, but having 2 years of unrequited feelings for her when I was younger taught me a shit ton about this kind of thing. That started the same way and felt amazing at the time, but in the end it led to me having to force myself to get over her as she had a boyfriend and when I told her how I felt it got a little messy between us. We both handled it really maturely and are great friends again, but it took a lot of work on both our parts to cool things off. To this day we still have to keep our distance from each other a little and it was never quite the same. I should have learned to accept the friendship for what it was from the get go.

Anyway, I know this isn’t going anywhere logically. She is insanely out of my league to the point it’s ridiculous. I know she’s just being a friend and we just have a laugh together and I shouldn’t read into it. I know from firsthand experience work related crushes can lead to heartbreak. I know that the fact is we’re both just the only single people around the same age at work and a little flirtation is probably just natural in that situation. I know it won’t lead anywhere and I told myself I’ll never be that into someone again without dating them, but I know asking her out would be stupid when you have to work every day with each other.

Basically, I don’t want to let this become a big thing in my head. Right now it’s manageable; I look forward to seeing her a little and we have a good time together, but I know I need to keep it under control and to myself and I’m not thinking about her all the damn time like previous crushes. She’s just one of those people who’s really nice to everyone and it’s not that she likes me in that way, it’s obvious she just sees me as a friend. 

So, how do I keep this under control while it’s still kind of a small thing? I just don’t have it in me to fall too hard for someone again when it’s not gonna happen, it’s happened too many times and I’m sick of it. While it’s been nice having that kind of tension with someone again, I realise it’s probably mostly in my head and that it’s gonna be a whole lot easier for both of us if I just learn to keep it as no big deal.

He'd occasionally invite me over and as the sex was good I obliged to the point where I mention becoming friends with benefits or fuck buddies. He agreed and we both established that we weren't looking for a relationship due to our busy lives. Weeks would go by and I noticed that we had frequently texted and met up with each other. I've only ever tried out fwbs once so I wasn't entirely sure how far the intimacy would go, but I've noticed that he's initiated cuddling and pillow talks at the very start. I pass it by and let it continue but of course with how tricky emotions could be handled I realized I had caught feelings. I definitely should have brought it up for my own mental health when I started seeing him differently, and now it's a mistake that I am learning from. 

He's shown some weird signs that he might actually care more than he's letting on. This has only happened a few times but when I would be too busy to respond back after he had hit me up, I could tell that he was very passively mad. I jokingly mentioned this one night and he denied that he was ever at all mad about it. There were also a few times where we've talked about the hookups we have had recently and he asked for a picture of this guy I saw before him. I told him that I personally don't keep photos of my past hookups but he would obnoxiously press me for them. Not really sure why but I questioned it and its because he wanted to know if the dude was hot. Whatever that means. 

He's also shown more affection throughout the past few weeks such as holding my hand throughout a whole car ride or the sex would be noticeably more passionate. Just a week ago, he suggested that we go out to dinner after I recommended a restaurant that he should check out. I again joked that I would be down if he paid for it, but when he took it seriously I had taken it back pretty quickly knowing we are just friends. He again offered to pay telling me it was his treat, and so we set a day. 

Before we even got to the place we were talking again about other people and he mentions his other fwb. This isn't private knowledge at all because I knew about the other girl he was seeing, though he now only mentions that they dated and broke things off because they both wanted to explore with other people. They broke things off just a few months ago (Right when we first started hooking up) and is still continuing to see her as a fwb. Then I started to realize this was the same girl he wanted me to have a threesome with and honestly it was difficult to wrap my head around. I thought it was strange because that wouldn't really be my approach after breaking things off with someone, but I decided to let that go and feel out the rest of the night. He briefly mentions his ex every so often throughout dinner with him. That really put me off and I barely finished my food. He also forgot that he ever even mentioned paying for dinner, I can't tell if he really did forget or if he was just playing it off. So we split the bill and to put the cherry on top he makes out with me before he drops me back at my place. 

I don't really know what to think about that. I know the first step would be to  tell him how I really feel and learn to accept whatever the consequence would be.

Just need some outside input on whether I reacted appropriately to this.

So, I’ve (29F) been seeing this guy (39M) for about 4 months once a week. It’s definitely a casual thing but I thought it was close to a FWB situation. Our arrangement was that I come over, always at night, we hang out a bit, eat some dinner, hook up, cuddle, maybe round 2, and then I leave. He lives in a downtown area that does get sketchy at night. I always park at a parking structure across the street. I would usually leave around midnight to 1am. Because I think it’s relevant to the situation, I’m a petite attractive woman and I would dress up nicely whenever I went over. I’ve been assaulted before but I’ve never disclosed this info to him. 

Up until our last 2 get togethers, he would walk me to my car. The second to last time, he walked me to the door of his apartment, and then closed it behind me as I left and he said bye. I was confused because this had never happened before. I assumed maybe he was too fucked up (high and drunk) and it was an honest blunder. Anyways, I was hollered at by a group of sketchy guys as I was walking back to my car but thankfully nothing else happened. 

This most recent and last time, I told him that he needed to walk me to my car. He was lying in bed and started complaining and basically kept saying that it was only across the street. I asked him again, mentioning that I didn’t feel safe going alone. He continued to raise a fuss because he was already comfy and warm and falling asleep. I’m not one to beg from a man, so I got up and left.

The next morning, I sent a text basically saying that I’m cutting the cord, it was fun while it lasted, but I will not tolerate being treated like a random sex worker. We are professional colleagues (in the same field) and, at minimum, we were friendly, maybe even friends. 

I blocked him after sending the text. I did it because I didn’t think I’d be strong enough to stay away if he apologized or argued his way out of it. I am hurt because I was always very nice and I don’t understand where this devaluing behavior came from. He used to be such a gentleman. I figured if he’s already acting like this, it’s only bound to get worse.

I’m bummed that I have to search for another unproblematic D to fulfill my weekly needs. But even with these casual situations I feel that I should maintain my dignity right? Or did I overreact?

I know, I know, the age difference, but I pass for late 20s and I'm pretty immature. Anyways.

Our kids are friends and I see him pretty frequently in our little community. We're always friendly, but I'm terribly awkward and shy when i have a crush, so it's been a slow process. He was at my house for a play date last winter and I got a very nervous vibe from him, which is kind of what got me thinking about him that way (I'm not accustomed to making men nervous haha).

I have his number from waaayy back (kid related) but we haven't communicated by phone/text in nearly a year. I decided to go for it 2.5 weeks ago, so I texted him one evening with just a ""Hey this is so and so, is this still a good number for you"" kinda thing. HOWEVER, I later learned that not 2 hours before I texted him, he had left on a work trip that keeps him out of cell phone range for days at a time with only random, quick trips back to civilization. My luck, right?

So it's been 2.5 weeks, no response, haven't seen him, and I'm stuck in limbo. I know he has had cell service a couple of times, but no idea how long or the context. Is he ghosting me? Has his number changed? Did he assume it was about our kids and just not bother to respond since he's away? I managed to overhear that he's back later this week, and I don't know how to follow up or even if I should.

If I don't happen to see him, could I try Facebook and mentioning I tried to text him? Too stalkerish? If I do see him this weekend, can I mention it to him then? I prefer the idea of doing it virtually; better for my nerves and he can think about what he wants to do. 

Or should I just accept the ghost and cut my losses? I really can't see him ghosting me - our kids are buddies and there was nothing about my initial text that would have suggested I was going to ask him out. Plus he's just a sweetheart.

Obviously I'm waaayyyy overthinking this, but it's my first move in a guy in 14 years (was married) and just the going incommunicado + how long it's been have really shaken my confidence.

We hit it off right away and she really wanted to hangout before I went back home. I gave her 2 dates that I was free before my flight but she was busy for both (no biggie, I was moving there in a couple months anyways). 

Fast forward a month and we start talking again. We’re now approaching ~3 weeks until I move into my new apartment and things are going REALLY well. So much in common, we’re FaceTiming every couple days for hours and she’s really putting the time and effort into this despite drowning during finals season. She’s coming up with date ideas since I’ll be new to the area and she knows of all the “cool” spots to go, etc. Complimenting me, flirting, all the good stuff. I even started to think it was too good to be true. I did a little “am I the only guy test” just in case someone suggests she may have other partners lined up. Here’s how that went: she wanted to do my astrology chart (I thought great, red flag), but actually she just thought it was fun to read about but obviously doesn’t base her dating life around signs. I read in one of her “stars” that women like her are always late to dates and have multiple guys lined up in the city. So jokingly, I say “ah so you got multiple guys AND you’re gonna be late for our first date?!” She laughs and is like “oh god no I’m never late and I don’t mess around when I’m interested in someone. I’m an all-in type of person and I feel like depending on the person, it might scare them off”. I’m the same way so perfect, right?

I feel like I should add that there was one subject that she was really touchy about. She’s an indigenous woman and anything to do with the island she’s from (not gonna specify) gets her really upset. I’ve had small glimpses of this and she acknowledged that her reactions to indigenous issues are big because she’s passionate about her heritage. I really loved this about her because as someone who’s a bit more reserved it was inspiring to see. When these discussions came up I was an active listener  (she even said that I made her feel “seen”) and would always support her or be an ear for her rants, etc. 

Here’s why that information is important. All of her previous summer jobs involved some sort of forestry and that’s what she was studying in school for her first couple of years. She told me a few weeks back that she had switched to psych because when she was in lectures, a lot of the information about her home was incorrect and it would really frustrate her. The profs would thank her for pointing stuff out but she didn’t like all of the attention put on her from her classmates and profs when they found out that she was from the island in question. Fair enough. 

One day we’re FaceTiming. We’re laughing having a good time, talking for over an hour while she’s in a café. She decides to take me with her on her walk home still on FT. She’s showing me around campus pointing out the buildings and mentions something about engineering and how shit she is at math blah blah blah, but she isn’t liking psych anymore because she feels like it’s all memorization and multiple choice exams. I agree and say “why did you switch from forestry again?” This is where I think I upset her. In my head I meant to say what made you choose psych anyways? I know that a lot of people take it as an elective during first year (I did when I was in school) and have a pretty good idea of what it’s gonna be like. She’s goes “really?” with a bit of a sigh and starts to say the things about forestry that I mentioned above. Mid sentence, her phone dies and I wait like an hour and text her good luck on her exam tomorrow. Never delivered, calls straight to voicemail. I got blocked. Today is my birthday, and its been 4 days since she blocked me. It just hurts.

I'm 26M and got out of a relationship that started in highschool just this year (she cheated and is with the guy now since I dumped her so tbh I'm pretty insecure at the moment), so I'm relatively new to the dating scene and a little out of my element.

I've been talking to this one girl 24F for a month and a half now and I just can't really read her. She takes really long to text me back every day and it's usually me who's setting up dates. My friend read her texts and she says she thinks she's interested as her texts are trying to be funny and show genuine effort. However I just have trouble believing that if she were really interested she wouldn't want to text me right away. She sends selfies and did venmo me money for a coffee on my bday which I thought was sweet and not something someone would do if they didn't have any interest, I dunno. 

We just went on our third date and I picked her up and actually met her family, who was excited to see me so I think she's been talking about me to them. But she seemed a little cranky that day, not sure if she didn't want to go out or was just tired or what. At the end of the night she was a bit bubbly though, and I actually called on my way home to tell her I like her a lot and want to go out again. She said that she feels the same way but has to figure out when she could because her sister just got engaged. We each have a week off next week so we're trying to plan for sometime then, she just isn't sure which day yet.

Part of me feels I'm just overthinking it, we still talk every day and are trying to plan a fourth date after all. But I can't shake the feeling that I'm putting in most of the effort and she's not as eager as I am. She did tell me that she's only dated people she already knew (we met online) so she's not sure exactly how this works, which is the case for me as well. Nothing physical has happened mostly because I'm too chicken shit to make a move so maybe she just thinks I'M not interested, who knows. She gave me a hug on the second date and that's it.

I just feel if she were really interested, even if she were busy, I'd hear from her more often or she'd be trying to set more things up herself.

It all started in sophomore year of high school, she was the new kid in school and barely knew anyone. We never talked to each other, but we did have a class together. The reason why we started talking is she became friends with another girl I was friends with. The three of us went out for a small birthday celebration, that’s when we started talking more. 

Nothing really changed between us until halfway through senior year of high school. 

I came back to my school after leaving for that semester to take college courses and online high school classes. She was excited I came back, including a lot of other her and my friends. I got back on the school tennis team and started practicing again with my old teammates that didn’t graduate last year. I jokingly asked her to join the team and she said she would join with me. At the time, nothing really seemed special between me and her so I never really thought of us being in a “relationship.” When she joined and we started hanging out more, I started to like her more. We would always practice tennis outside of school every week and just have fun. After awhile, we started going to activities together and going to restaurants. 

This is where the story takes a turn.

After graduation, we had a lot of free time. Every week I went to her house and watched her favorite movies and shows. The first couple weeks were just me and her sitting there watching the tv and us talking. After a while, she started laying on me and touching me; which caught me off guard. Probably a month in, she was literally on me and and rapping her arms around my body. At one point, she literally grabbed my hand and put it on her ass. That night of the ass touching, we both went outside so she could say bye to me when I was leaving, and we did a 30-60 second tight hug, which was kinda awkward since I’m quite a bit taller than her. She also brought me around her family and her mom and dad loved me. Her dog also LOVED me, it was hilarious. She’s also in pageants and won the city last year and she was competing for state queen. I promised that I would go but something came up and it made it where I couldn’t see her preform. So I got her a small gift for what she did, and it was a cameo of one of her favorite actress’s congratulating her on what she did. When she saw it, she almost cried. 

After the gift, was when I gained up the courage to tell her my feelings. She did say that she cared also but since we were going to colleges that are pretty far apart from each other. Which I understood, I was in a long distance relationship at one point and it fell apart. So do you guys think I still have a chance or was she playing me in some small way? The thing that stings about it if she was playing me is that she seemed like the one. Whenever I tried to talk to other girls after her, I would grow disinterested with any other girl because they weren’t her. She was the perfect girl I was looking for; funny, smart; likes to play video games, same religious standpoint, and same political views. I know this is surface level but she is beautiful and she would always complain about her “assets” but I thought her body was perfect the way it was. I’m not a fan of girls having big “assets.” 

Some other stuff that happened that I don’t want to somehow cram into the story

- when we were playing video games together, she started talking about baby names and which ones I liked. Then she followed up the names she liked with my last name. 
- after the whole situation, her mom followed me on Instagram. 
- she out of the blue started checking up on me when I went off to college",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1137471,public,self,Should I(m18) try to keep in touch with her(f18) or is being quiet for months going to tarnish our friendship as a whole?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rgpuri/should_im18_try_to_keep_in_touch_with_herf18_or/,no_ads,0,dating,,,

I replied same &amp; thanks for the date. No mention of wanting to see me again. 

He wasn't much of a texter before the date but it feels like the enthusiasm after the date dropped. But why can't he just ignore or tell me upfront it isn't working out. If I ask him a simple question he would still give me a very elaborate answer. Is he just too nice? Doesn't want the guilt to be the first to reject? But that would save a lot of headache and overthinking honestly. 

Do guys just keep texting until the girl gets the hint? 
Maybe he's just not sure and wants to explore all the options first? Maybe he just is really nice and considerate of other people's feelings and doesn't want to come across as rude for ignoring or mean for rejecting?

I haven’t officially discussed liking this guy with him. I’m just starting to catch feelings for one of my friends but last time he got drunk he mentioned to me he would get violent whilst drinking, e.g; break a vase, punch a wall. He has also hurt a mutual guy friend. I was super taken aback because I didn’t realize he was an aggressive drunk and he is so so nice to me. Is this just an immediate red flag? Am I just ignoring it when I should be acknowledging it? I definitely am taking it into account but I’m not sure if I should just write him off completely. I also just want to add a piece of info he has lived with females his whole life so I don’t know if that would change anything. Never been in a situation like this!
