We dated for almost 6 months. I tried to break up with him after new years at 5 months in, I let him convince me it could still work. (Sigh). We did both put some work into it, to try to learn each other's language better.

A month later, still together, my body was telling me it wasn't working. Sex life died and I just didn't want it. I didn't want to kiss him, I felt nervousss at his place, and couldn't calm.

We had a language barrier and I couldn't connect to him, I wasn't attached. I could speak his language but not like a native speaker, and not great socially. I enjoyed his company. But, signs showed me that we didn't actually ""get"" each other. I knew that in his native tongue, he was a different person, not bad. I just knew that with me he couldn't be himself - he spoke his second language and he was not great at it. Our conversation was empty. He missed a lot of details about me. I spoke all the time, he tried to, but not as much. Miscommunication on little things added up. Nothing serious but... enough to know this wasn't working.

He told me I was wonderful and I think, he compared me to his ex and I really was a good catch for him in comparison, that he was willing to be blind to issues.

I just couldn't go through with it, despite the many kind things he did for me, the many kind ways he had about himself, and his love for me.

We ordered some food.  She ordered a pizza that was clearly more than she could eat and a cocktail. I ordered a personal pizza and a coke because I don't drink and drive.   
Either way in the middle of some casual conversation she just tuned out. We even had that uncomfortable moment of silence and it got to a point where I knew this was going nowhere.  I must have said or did something that just eliminated me but for the life of me I can't really figure it out.  She ate two slices and asked for a box, then whipped out her phone and started messaging and ignoring me. 

It was an awkward moment and knowing I have nothing to lose, I just excused myself, went to the cashier and paid my half plus a little more and a tip and left without saying goodnight.  She was still tapping away on her phone oblivious that I left.  She sent me a text ""you could have at least paid for dinner.""

Some good conversation on the last post so I thought I would follow up.

Originally I had said I really didn't think I could make more of an effort than I had been but I decided to test that this week since I didn't have the kids. I went to her place 3 nights this week. Each time it was an hour in the evening and then about 40 minutes on the way home. Both are relatively high traffic times, the evening is worse. 

By last night at her place I was exhausted and kind of feeling it - I had an edge. I have never really had an edge with her before and she said something in regards to an activity we were doing and 'making me work for something' and I just kind of stared at her and said 'the drive here was work.' It immediately changed the moment from joking (she was joking with me playfully) to negative and it also highlighted something for me internally. Even though I've always known it - I hate commuting. I've worked most of my career in such a way that I can work from home so I don't waste my time commuting. I hate it. My ex and I started in a relationship that was distanced similarly but just a bit further (about 40-50 miles vs 25 here) but the traffic situation was similar - same freeway basically I just lived further south than I do now. 

I hate the commute. I dig her but I fucking hate it. I can't do it more than once a week and it's worse for her if she tries to come my way so she doesn't really do that. Plus it's got me getting up so early that I am pretty tired for the rest of the day.

It sucks. I hate it.

Back to the moment, she recognized it and said she was surprised I made the comment as she felt it was a 'pet peeve' of mine and one we weren't allowed to bring up. I think she has some feelings too. I was too tired last night to make it into a more serious conversation and I wanted to reflect a bit more (I mean stall) to put my own thoughts together. 

My son really likes her, I hate that if I break up with her that he will be part of it too. She and I have been seeing each other for almost 2 years (in may) and we've been exclusive for just over a year now. We were on and off a bit in the beginning. 

I feel terrible too because I'm the one who pursued her when we were off the last time. I renewed it and now I feel like I'm just going to hurt her more. 

I also feel like I'm so numb these days because of the pandemic, fighting with my ex over custody stuff with our older son and working through all the paperwork and financial stuff after divorce (which I'm still doing) AND my job's changed quite a bit during the pandemic and I just don't have the same work/life balance I used to. I almost feel like I'm just fucking the pain away with her. I really do enjoy her company and I believe I have the feelings for her I tell her I have (love) but over the last few months other parts of my life have been incredibly intense and it's just really affected my ability to feel anything.

I'm exhausted emotionally at this point and I am just a deer in headlights about the idea of bringing up my heart right now &amp; telling this woman that I just need to be on my own because as wonderful and supportive as she is and has been, I literally can't feel it.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,67296,public,self,Update: Long Term relationship but tough schedules and just enough distance to make seeing each other on the regular kind of tough,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sq9bh4/update_long_term_relationship_but_tough_schedules/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Should I get her a card at least? Maybe a little gift? Or should I just send flowers on the actual day? Or do nothing at all?

In the mean time, I got her number and did platonic things like biking and music on the square picnics. Then my serious relationship came back to the states and  divorced after a year.  I was still platonic friends with my infatuation, which stopped one day, when we were going to go biking and I cleaned her garage light while waiting outside for her to change(I’m handy) she got upset, what are you doing!,, then she said she wasn’t going biking, I said ok have a good one.

My marriage was mentally over years ago. I moved out and live on my own. I was seeing a married man (40) and I’m not proud of the affair, nor looking back at it think it was a good idea or the right thing to do. Please don’t lecture me on this part because I’ve heard it all. I get it. But shit happens and here we are. I wound up with very deep feelings for him, and he couldn’t or wouldn’t reciprocate. He told me he doesn’t have plans to leave his marriage, and he can’t promise me more than we had at that time. So I heard that finally, loud and clear. I’ve been mentally preparing for the end. I know it’s a matter of time. He said he won’t hold me back from where I should be. 

Fast-forward to recently. I started trying to have conversations and date casually other men. It’s a jungle out there. Damn. But I know I need to move on. I met someone recently that I got along with. We went out a few times, talked for quite a bit. I knew I needed to eventually come clean about the other relationship. New guy and I had said “no judgements. No shame. Past issues and relationships don’t matter”. I felt comfortable and vulnerable enough to tell him about my affair. He was supportive at first. I told him I know it has to end and it will. Mind you, we’re not exclusive, I didn’t really have to tell him anything about anyone else I’m seeing, I told him because I was honest and knew it was done. A few days later it was done. I was crying and sad for me. It was hitting me hard, a divorce, an affair I regret, doing things alone, it all came to a head. He had asked me if I was ok, and I told him briefly what had happened.  He was silent the rest of the night, comes back late with a big long “breakup” text on how he can put up with a lot, but not someone hung up on a married guy not leaving his wife. How it was the last straw me crying over him ( I was crying for myself mind you. I was taking back my power and taking control of things finally. I’m not heartless, it’s going to be emotional). I told him all of this, he didn’t listen, said there is no room for discussion, stopped answering my texts and ignored my phone call. What an ass!  So I asked him to at least talk to me on the phone. Can you think about it and call tomorrow?  He comes back and says he’s not thinking about it, he’s bowing out, and to quit calling him.

Kind of a long post ahead...

I met a person named Charlotte last summer on a Discord server that has to do with dating in our age range. We chatted for a while using Discord and she told me she lived in Glasgow, Scotland (I live in the US), worked for a tech firm, and so forth. All nice ""get to know you"" talk before she asked to move over to Google Chat/Hangouts. I use that myself so I was fine with that. There was more chatter, sharing of pictures, all those kinds of things. We did one video chat which didn't last long due to a crummy connections but what I saw of her looked like the pictures she sent so, in my head, she was legit.

Because I had it in my head that this person was real, I ignored the warning voice in my head even when talk moved to finances which then moved over to ""will you give me a loan for"" reason X, ""will you help me with a project at work"", and similar talk. Of course, my intuition was telling this wasn't right but the other part of me was in a ""damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead"" mode. Yes, there were the promises that I would be paid back and I believed them because I was so emotionally caught up with this person, that we would meet, and so on. No amount of logic was overcoming my desire to fully believe this woman and her words. She claimed to work for Tesco as a crypto analyst, if such a position even exists. Even when I was reading contradictions in what she wrote (like where she worked), I just excused them and kept on going. I shared WAY too much personal information with this person.

Well, I'm out around $17,000 cash US and have $30,000 US worth of credit card debt. My credit cards were cancelled due to all of this nonsense I let happen and my credit score, which used to be great, has really taken a hit. I finally got my head out of the sand during the beginning of January to realize that I had been catfished...this even after some people had warned me that I was being scammed. After freaking out for a bit, I managed to pull myself together to start to think about what I need to do. I first got in touch with Tesco and Glasgow police to see if they could help me gather information. Glasgow police told me the street address this person gave me didn't exist. Tesco gave me a bit more of a canned response that they would never ask an employee to do what she asked me (gift cards, of course!) and to contact my local police which I did. Talked to them and sent lots of emails, pictures, and screenshots to the officer who was working with me. He then moved it over to a detective who sent Google a request for information about the email address this person was using to chat with me. As you might guess, it was created in early July, 2021 in Nigeria.

The past few weeks have been very busy: I changed tons of passwords, closed out a couple accounts, put in fraud alerts with the 3 major credit bureaus, and filled out online forms with the FBI, among other things. Got a personal loan to pay off the credit cards. Did everything I could think of to secure my financial world. Emotionally, it was tough but the thing that really stuck with me was how I continued to ignore my intuition. I still beat myself up a bit over it at times, even after reading about these scams, how these people are professional criminals, and are so good at being very convincing. I realized how I was an easy target for this kind of thing, too, so I'm working on coming to terms with that and how I can (hopefully) protect myself both emotionally and financially. I need to learn how to trust my inner voice.

So, for those of you who have had similar experiences, I feel for you especially having been there (and am still there, really). It sucks to believe in someone who turned out to be not that person at all and is really out to scam you. **Please, please, pay attention to your intuition** even if you don't want to listen to it as I've done. Be safe out there and watch out for these kinds of people and be aware what they can do to you.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,67367,public,self,Catfished: a Tale of Caution,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sr5ain/catfished_a_tale_of_caution/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,454190e4-26b1-11e9-93d9-0e688abd8430,dark,,,,,

Talked to him this week (I initiated via email asking why he just threw everything away for one mistake and he called in response) for the first time about 6 weeks after our break up (2 yrs together, very good relationship IMO). We have been LD for about half the time. He broke it off because I lashed out at him because of my own stress. First time this has happened. He’s apparently got some mistreatment trauma in his past. 

Right now, he’s got a ton going on with his startup (moving, another investment raise, teetering on break even but not quite). He explained to me during our call that he shut it down because he was not going to be a punching bag. He was touched and appreciative when I told him one of the things I loved about him was that he was not a doormat. This was the first time in the relationship, he knows me better and I made a mistake. He seems to get that I’m very regretful and understands I’m working on learning stress management techniques. It was a calm conversation, even some laughs were had. I think if he weren’t in the midst of these big things right now, he’d probably be more open to reconciliation at this point. 

So, he made two conflicting (in my eyes) statements that I’m hoping to get some insight on. First he said “I’ve moved on…Though there isn’t someone else or anything like that.” I completely believe him, he’s too busy and moving to a different city. So he’s claimed to have “moved on”. Then later in the conversation he offers that he’s open to something in the future (again I believe him), we kind of landed on a few months of NC both so he can be settled and I have time to “work on myself”. How can someone both move on and be open to something in the future?

I'm an author for goodness sakes, lol. 

But I'm getting so close to giving up on ever finding someone compatible. I'd rather do that then give voice to the fear that is arising in me everytime I try again. 

I date for marriage. And I think you're not supposed to do that any more. At least that's what the last two women I dated told me.
