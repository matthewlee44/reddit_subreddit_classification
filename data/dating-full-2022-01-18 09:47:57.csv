I'm worried it will look desperate and after already revealing feelings, but I feel like it would feel nicer to see a face after everything. I never even got to see him.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a casual distance thing end. I was in lockdown (Melbourne) for SO much of it, it was nice to have when I really didnt have much else. He was in Perth, with freedom. It started when we were gonna see each other in a month, pandemic’s made it so I’ve not been able to see him the whole time. He was supposed to come a few times but covid stopped it.

A few months in, he said wasn’t over his ex. He reminded me again recently he didnt want more (after an unexpected conversation) and it ended. He was saying he did want to see me, but I started pouring out my feelings cause I thought something was building (I believed him the first year, the second year it got intense with him emotionally connecting more). He was going on and on how we were helping and supporting each other thru and that he cared about me. We’ve both been going through a horrible time with pandemic, we both work in the music industry.

I went NC, it’s been 2 weeks and I was going to do it indefinitely. But now this.

With omicron going crazy, he got stuck in Sydney after doing a show. I thought he was going to stay there until Perth borders open early Feb, cause it’s where the rest of his band is. But I just saw a mutual friend post on her fb story going “bye miss you already” to him getting on a motorbike.

I literally NEVER watch fb stories, wtf. This girl I dont even have on instagram, so I never would have seen it there. I just know he must be coming to my city to see his best mate etc. Where else would he be going? He always wanted to come back, but couldn’t due to covid.

I deactivated my insta so I wouldn’t keep rereading the last msgs. I have no idea if he might have thought about telling me. I mean prob not after this :((( He has other ways to contact, but that was the main way we spoke, he’d prob take it as me not wanting to hear from him.

Fucking horrible timing. I would have got to see him if things didnt end 2 weeks ago, if I just didnt ask those questions yet. It was a conversation I always wanted to have face to face, not over text. Now it’s actually happening that he’s here. I’d been wanting for over 1.5 years for this. What the hell.

I might reactivate in a day or two, then leave it a week. Its gonna kill me if I have to be the one to reach out. 2-3 weeks is too soon to even end NC in general.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT what if he’s leaving it to me? - Last thing I said (the next day) was that the friendship did mean a lot to me, and I dont want to lose that, cause he was going on about friends so much. Then I said “But I obviously need a break.” What if he’s gonna respect I said that?

It just feels weird to go through all that together and not see each other. Is it pathetic to be the one to say that? To say we could meet and just talk, for that sake?

I also never wanted to hang around like a doe eyed idiot, cause I'm the one who has feelings. I think it will have to be just once. I realised, even tho I said that, we can’t actually be friends after that. But just once.

I dont know what to say, I dont want to look like a stalker (even tho I didnt go out of my way to see that). Maybe just start by acknowledging that he WAS such a good support for me. I didnt tell him back how I really did feel supported (didnt want to compliment him while he was reminding me he doesnt want more).

Then see if he tells me he’s here?

Who wins the situation? What would everyone feel for each role?

My ex and her best friend showed up at my bel air mansion party the first night I came back to town since my ex kicked me out of the spot. Her parents paid all our rent because I was homeless and had all my property stolen. We broke up bc she was super drugged out on acid and shrooms one night and her best friend convinced her break up with me because she was mad that I was drunk 24/7 and my social media was not making money to support myself anymore. At my party, my ex was being completely annoying and rude when i tried to talk to her maturely alone. She blocked me on everything when we broke up, so I just wanted either closure or to start it up again. I made a ton of money of NFTs and only drink past noon since we were apart for 2 weeks. She idolizes her best friend, an IMG model, that was taking care of her since the breakup bc she was so depressed and suicidal. She tried to get me kicked out of my own party then stormed off, stranding her friend at my party. I was previously living with her friend at a hotel for months after the SWAT raided my last mansion so we were already close, so we became close again and started clubbing every night. The next month, my y ex came to my table one night and we hooked up while super drugged out and drunk. She planned to come back to my mansion the next day where I was surprising her by recreating our entire first day dating then bringing her and her friends to 50 cents performance at Poppy, then throwing her a party in my new mansion. She ended up sending me a drugged out voice memo then blocked me. I immediately went to her best friends house and had sex with her. After dating for a week, and me having bags at her house, we posted us making out on instagram while blacked out in a party limo. She saw it through a friend's instagram and her friends boyfriend and her sent both of us voice memos saying they would kill us next time we showed up to the clubs I promote, but neither of them could talk normally because they were on so many drugs. We had the best laugh over it because neither of us remembered posting anything and then started posting the cutest content and faked an engagement and pregnancy on instagram for the next week. To end the week my ex and my now current girlfriends ex boyfriend sent a hitman after me and my new girlfriend (my ex's best friend). Now my ex made a diss album on us. I am crazy in love with the current girlfriend but she kept getting blacked out and drugged out at my mansion, so the homeowner banned her from the property and chased her out with a sword. I am in love with both of them, but watching them fight like buffoons over me publicly has made tons of other models interested in me. Is it dumb to move into my girl friends spot and leave my new free mansion? Her house is NOT a mansion and is kinda ghetto in comparison. Also I wouldn't have free rent there.

Girl #1

She would take my lips and almost my whole face around the lip area in her mouth and suck on it and then take another piece of my mouth in her mouth and suck on that and on and on like that, opening her mouth repeatedly in a chewing motion (no teeth, of course), as she took parts of my mouth into her mouth. There was no tongue action at all.

She complained about my kissing, but didn't say specifically what bothered her.

Girl #2

She would just press her lips to mine and open her mouth only very slightly and there was no tongue action at all. I kept trying to push my tongue into her mouth, but she seemed not interested in that at all and her mouth was not open enough for any tongue contact to happen.

She told me I was opening my mouth too much.

Now don’t get me wrong I’m really grateful for this job and for the chance to grow myself as an engineer. But I’ve just not found happiness in life and I think the main reason is because I’ve not built the best relationships with people over the years.

My schooling years went in grinding hard for exams and assignments, which have definitely reaped a reward but I can’t help but think my youth has been destroyed completely. I’m average looking and need dental treatment which will make me look much better. But my crooked teeth and a lack of a good smile make me unattractive to girls and I’ve not been able to find a girlfriend or even someone who has shown an interest in being with me. 

I’ve hooked up with people before mainly at parties but nothing has come out of that (as in nothing beyond the couple of instances of hookups). 

What makes me unhappy is that it seems like nobody sees anything good in me to want to initiate something more than just being friends. I have a feeling it’s just the looks aspect that’s lacking or maybe it’s me not being proactive enough wrt asking people out. 

I hope I’m not coming out as whiny because I know that it’s unrealistic to expect every single thing in life to work out. Life just seems to be a little empty atm especially seeing others with their partners.

We stopped in between for a big chunk but recently ive been getting over my porn addiction and now she seems much cuter to me i dont know why. Successfully restarted our conversation but its still me initiating it.

Anyway ive been using this dumb line of finally getting her to try cheesecake when i meet her because honestly i got nothing else and i was genuinely shocked when she told me she hasn't tried cheesecake but theres a really good cafe just walking distance from her apartment complex ive been trying to get us to go but subtly.

we talk all the time and i could tell that she was catching feelings for me because she would keep sending me kiss &amp; heart emojis along with texts. she would tell me everything that happened with her throughout the day for last 6 months. basically we couldn't spend a day without talking with eachother.

she would always say that she wants to meet me and wants to hang out with me. wanted to be with me. that she wants me to come see her in england and honestly i thought that shes just messing with me but no she really does have feelings for me and i kinda like her too. im not gonna lie, shes so cute. but i never said anything because of the age gap. i thought it was creepy of me to say that back like ""oh i wanna meet you too, i wanna hang out with you too, send her heart and kiss emojis"" so i always replied like ""haha, ohh but u live so far from me, lol. etc etc)

but last night she confessed her feelings to me through text. word-to-word it started like:

""i'm tired of pretending to be friends with you when in reality i love you.im tired of saying we're just friends, because were not! i love you. i cant pretend anymore!""

she directly out of nowhere texted me a bigass paragraph of reasons why she loves me so much &amp; that she wanted to date me (LDR). ive never had a gf shes never had a bf. i cried after reading that. i haven't said anything back but i like her back too. i just said i need time to think on this. i don't know what to do. im freaking out. what if it won't work out? also the time difference! i need an outsiders perspective on this.

I was initially attracted to him although he isn't my type and as time passes, I'm starting to wonder if I really am into him physically. We had sex for the first time a few days ago and honestly, it wasn't bad. Unfortunately, he's a little smaller than I'm used to down there and he didn't last too long inside, however, he did make sure to draw out the foreplay and try to make me feel good. I did not orgasm but I was close and he did several times. 

While we were intimate, I would open my eyes sometimes to see him staring at me intensely and it was hot in the moment but thinking back now it's making me nervous that he is way into me more than I am into him. He constantly texts me and keeps in contact with me and always wants to spend time with me. The thing is I'm not sure if I would want to be in a relationship with him just based on the fact that I don't have a strong physical attraction to him when we aren't being sexual. When we aren't being intimate, I don't have an urge to rip his clothes off or have sex with him. I don't really like his haircut or how he dresses either. 

To preface this, I have never been in a relationship and he was my first time having sex. I attempted to break things off a while ago before we had sex but didn't commit to it and folded because I chalked my nerves up to inexperience and fear of being hurt if I fully let myself go in this ""relationship"". 

Not sure what to do...I feel like I should end things but we just had sex and that same night he went home, he texted me, making plans for us to see each other again. 

How am I supposed to feel with a potential partner? Is the sexual attraction supposed to be there already? For example, one of my friends is a guy and I had (kind of still do like him) a crush on him and I instantly found him super hot and could imagine getting intimate or kissing him. I could tell for a fact that this friend was also attracted to me but I didn't pursue anything with him because of his situation with his ex.

She said she did it because I was still texting my exgirlfriend by the time we started dating BUT what she doesn't know is that I was breaking up with her (It was a distance relationship and we never met in real life, our chat was in English and my girlfriend doesn't understand as Engish isn't our native language) so yeah.. a break up text vs sex with your ex it. I tried to understand and be open. 

Then, around 2018 I started working in an English institute as a teacher, I met people of all ages, I became friends with many of them, and very good friend with a girl (like 6 years younger than me) so, as I used to do with other students, we used to chat a lot in English for her to practice. I used to archive the chats related to my job. But one night she looked into my phone, found the chats, ignored most of other students' and focused on hers. We had a huge argument about this. I never sent her a picture, I never touched a single hair of hers and the same backwards, never an indecent proposal or any hint of unfaithfulness from me, just chats in English but I tried to put myself in her shoes. She said she understood and ""forgave me"" cuz to this very day I'm sure she still believes something else happened. 

Then I found a job 3 hours away from the city in 2019, which meant I had to move but still I was able to visit her and my family on weekends (a trip which was very tiring and exhausting due I had to take many busses and taxis). But yeah, it was hard as we used to see each other every single day, but still every weekend I was back to her. Meanwhile she started studying in college and she met many new people alongside meeting again with old friends (it's a small town). Of course in my new job I also met loads of new people and I became friends with a woman who also started on the company the same day as me. She's like 8 years older and married. One day it happened that we all had to leave the office early because of riots in the city, so we had to take our laptops home and work remotely. She didn't have any bag to take her stuff home, I had mine and offered it to her. ( I used to live a block away from office so taking my stuff wasn't a problem for me) She returned it the day after. 

The very next weekend my girlfriend said she wanted to come visit me as she wanted to buy some stuff to bring back home. So I was happy. She bought more than she was thinking of so many things didn't fit in her bag, I offered the same bag I offered my co-worker. When she got home she found an earring in the bag. It was co-worker's. I had no idea. I tried to explain and after another large argument she ""forgave"" me again. I even had to talk with my co-worker and put her in this discussion. My girlfriend still thinks I cheated on her. (Lots of guys try to hit on her and she's got many male friends and I'm alright with it, but I can't have any female friend as she's so jealous and problematic) 

While my time away on weekdays we used to have many arguments at first and we didn't talk much. I remember I ever found pics of her with her friends or chat screenshots on her phone and if I ever found something suspicious she explained and I understood. On weekends we tried not to argue and enjoy our short time together. I even used to buy snacks and food for her week while she studied. 

Then covid happened so we both stayed together in lockdown, it was scary at first as we'd live together all alone. But things got better and better. Then I got a full remote job so I moved back my hometown with her and. It's good until today. These 2 years have been the best by her side and I love her truly a lot. She's been there always and has helped me many times. She's been so unconditional. 

A couple of days ago there was a strong argument in her family. Her sister (19F) which dates my girlfriend's friend (Mr. X) was found smoking pot with him and her friends (Her brother is in jail because of drugs, besides she's the little sister so you'll understand) and my girlfriend hasn't had the best relationship with her and tried to warn her and they both fought a lot. Her family loves me so much. So that night her sister texted me my girlfriend cheated on me and kissed at least 8 people while I was her boyfriend and even worse, Mr. X was one of them. She claimed they used to sext and send nudes and kiss. And that she cheated on me as well with some people of her college while I was working in another city on weekdays. She sent me some pics of my girlfriend wearing Mr. X's glasses and that he obviously had deleted her nudes. And she had Mr X, one of her sisters, and Mr. X's family as witnesses. So in the end I had nothing but what her sister told me. So I showed it to my girlfriend and she was very relaxed and her attitude was like ""of course it's a lie, there's no even proof of anything and all that sounds so forced and convenient"" which I agreed. So obviously I believed my girlfriend. 

BUT last night she had to leave for a couple of hours and left her phone. I was hesitant on taking it or not. Aaaand I did. All I could find is Mr X's chat where he says like ""Sorry, I love your sister and she doesn't deserve that, and your boyfriend is a great guy so he knows now about us and the pictures and everything"". In all their chat she NEVER denied anything. She said ""All I can say is you're a bad influence to my sister"" 

So after I read that I called Mr X. He told me lots of stuff.. and the worst is that he gave me names and lots of details there was NO WAY he could have known. Names and details only she and I knew. Names of people we had arguments for and she always found an explanation. And as he kept talking everything felt like a puzzle being solved. Everything he told me fits with problems we had while I was away. He said she always used the earring and my student incidents as an excuse to do what she did. The same thing as when we first started, when she had sex with her ex she used as an excuse my mysterious chat in English of my breakup with my ex.
And I remember when that happened and I still didn't know she was overly sweet and lovely. So much it was so strange. And guess who's been like that since yesterday! 

So basically I have no proofs besides what Mr X told me. And to make things worse.. her family already knew about this. I feel so humiliated and like a clown. Now when she tries to kiss me or touch me I feel a void in my chest I haven't felt for a long time since she cheated on me first. 

I always said, alright, it happened once so it's your fault. But if it happens again then it's my fault. And I feel like it's a pattern, like, she did it once, why wouldn't she do it again? What can assure me she won't ever do it again? 

I've turned my back on my family and friends just for her. Now I don't feel like I can trust her anymore... what should I do?

I met a guy right after the time I broke up with my ex, and we clicked like immediately—great conversations, great chemistry, synched sense of humor, and we were both extremely attracted to each other. But he was terrible at communication after we would end our time in person together.  

He was awful at texting and would make plans w/ me but would often bail last minute which made me really upset bc every time, we hung out it was actually so much fun but his reasons for bailing were always a little too good to be that upset and he’d try to make it up to me. 

Regardless, could tell I was putting in way more effort to make this work than he was. We had a lot of talks about what we were Along the way (all prompted by me but he was always super interested in keeping what we had going and maintaining an open dialogue). Anyway, it’s been about 6 months now, and he’s still the ONLY guy I think about and have actually been connected to since breaking up w my ex. Like, I’ve been on a LOT of dates with many different men, none of them compare to him and he’s even said he has feelings for me, but then why doesn’t he take me more seriously? The connection is so intense when we’re together, idk if you can all relate to that one person you just clicked with immediately, that’s him.

I finally ended things w him today and he seemed kind of sad but also said he doesn’t think it should be the end for us—should it be the end for us? Also, what on Gods Green earth am I doing wrong that I can’t connect with one other person like I have with him him, but he can’t take me more seriously?

Went out on my first date in five years last night. About seven months out of a four year relationship that sapped my confidence in pretty much every aspect of a romantic relationship.

Met this gal OLD, got into some great witty banter for about a week, then met in person last night. Yesterday, anticipating the date, I was pretty miserable: anxious, self questioning, saying to myself “it’s too soon, you should call it off.” Mustered some courage, and the date itself actually went great. Talked at a bar for five hours! She indicated at the end that she’d be up for a second date; I agreed. 

But I woke up this morning in a cesspool of anxiety. My inner monologue is screaming, “you can’t do this,” I can’t focus on work, and I’m just really distressed. Clearly fight or flight here. Having a really hard time figuring out what to do. Do I ride out these nerves, plan another date? Do I respectfully communicate “I’m sorry, I’m not ready to do this?” The latter feels like giving in to the anxiety, letting it steer the ship. But I also feel like this response is telling me something, like maybe I don’t feel safe enough yet to be putting myself out there in this way.

I pursued a relationship with her friend J who is average looking but intelligent and well-mannered.

At first I didn't specify it was a date I messaged J asking to talk over coffee. But it was obvious as I dressed really smartly in formal attire and paid for her coffee. I bought her some hot chocolate stirrers and a mug to go with them as she likes chocolate. I was very polite and well-mannered but she seemed very negative throughout. She was dressed casually.

I remember J played Pokémon Go when it came out so I was talking about Pokémon a lot since I play the games and am a big fan. She's intelligent so I focused on my battle strategies etc and offered to lend her some games and she said no thanks that she's not into video games.

So I took the hint and asked J about her work since that's a more mature topic. She said it could be stressful. I said I could get her a job at my work, she said no to that. I offered to help with a CV and get her the interview and she still told me she wasn't interested. I came up with other ideas for jobs for her and she seemed to be getting bored so I asked if she wanted to go somewhere nice after the coffee. 

J then directly asked if this was a date. I said yes it was and I think it would be good if we were bf/gf. That I would be prepared to give it a try. She said she was focusing on her job at the moment. So I said I would help her get a new one so she would have time for our relationship, but she again refused.

After the date I realised I messed up and was perhaps too persistant about her career. I remembered she likes dogs so I went to a card shop and bought a cute dog with a love heart that I plan to give her on our next date. I text her apologising saying sorry I was so nervous and babbling too much. She didn't reply so I sent her a picture of the dog saying I hope it makes up for it and we can go on another date at the weekend. Or a double date with my friend and her bf.

She said she didn't know it was a date (I don't believe that) and she thinks I tricked her. Also she doesn't think we are a good match. I told her about a movie I'd like to see at the cinema this weekend and asked if she's up for it but no reply yet.

It wasn't bothering me much as we're Polish, so it's quite common to be asked about that. I live in Ireland tho, so also live a bit different than my fam in small western Poland town. But since then things started popping up in my head and it even made me feel a bit depressed once I actually realized my position.

I'm 32F, single for 4 years after long relationship (8 years) that I ended. I'm well educated, having good job in IT, surrounded by many friends, outgoing, extrovert. My biggest passion is history and foreign affairs, especially in the central-Eastern Europe region. I travel a lot to Balkan countries, because I prefer a good history and society lesson than sunny beaches (but there you can have both). People say I'm cultured, I am able to talk about almost every topic. I love listening to people and learn new things every day. 

I hear compliments about my looks very often, even from strangers. I'm more on chubby side, but I've always been proportional, I have perfect body-wast ratio, skinny face, big eyes, that people compliment most often. I don't really like my heavy legs, but when i look at myself, they're actually making my entire posture very proportional. I'm size 14 UK.

I'm saying all this based on my own subjective opinion, but also what I hear from others, that are usually shocked finding out I'm being single for so long.

It's not that I don't want. 

I've dated countless number of guys last years, very different personalities, looks, professions, nationalities. I'm not super picky while meeting guys, because I love people and every single one can teach me something new. But none of them, literally nobody was interested in more than having sex with me occasionally or staying fwb. None of them was pursuing the relationship or wanting anything. I liked some of them to the level I really wanted to go further,  but I was always rejected. I ended up questioning my social skills and planning some strategies of behavior towards them, but I quickly realized I'm not this type of person, I like clear communication, hate games and shit. And sometimes when I wasn't too much interested in a guy, but after a while I changed my mind and started to be a bit more into him, he automatically disappeared or seemed not interested anymore.

At this stage I gave up on dating around a year ago, because I was just overwhelmed by the number of rejections I experienced. I read comments here sometimes, was trying to understand how dating scene works, how I should behave, because maybe I'm doing something wrong, if me being just me doesn't work. I gave up, because dating was not fun for me anymore. For first 2 years I was enjoying single life, but after that I really thought it was a moment I wanted to stop being single. Either before or after making this decision and changing attitude, nothing else has changed.

I know it may sound stupid, but I started to live like I'm gonna be single forever, I even take serious life decisions like mortgage on my own. I accepted the fact of never being a mother. 

I understand I can have some issues I'm not aware of, but it's super stupid to ask for feedback once someone rejects you... so I'm just living like that, not trying to make any guesses. I accept myself, but it just simply hurts me that I can't find anyone who'd accept me and simply like spending time with me apart of f*king me.

Hi, as the title said, I broke up with gf after 4 years (I'm 24 now), and now I have realized I've lost all game :D, well not all, but the texting game is where I'm having trouble now

I guess having a girl kinda made me lazy and I stopped talking to other girls in general, only a few old friends of course.

So I need tips, it can be your own ideas or websites, links, books (GOOD ONES, with examples and shi) about texting. These days I find kinda hard to text a new girl, I LITERALLY don't know what to say to crack her up and have a fun conversation. I'm basically only having boring convos. Especially after I get girl's number from instagram for instance, then the conversation gets boring real quick when we're texting for real. And when and how should I ask for the date?

I just need to find my rhythm again, you know? But at the same time I'm tired of these games of ignoring each other back and forth and compete to see who shows less emotions, but anyway since the world's like this now, I have no choice.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153557,public,self,"Broke up with my gf, got lazy and now I have no game",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s71nry/broke_up_with_my_gf_got_lazy_and_now_i_have_no/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,

I met her at work about 4 months ago and asked her out on a date last month. We’ve been on 3 dates (I know it’s not a lot but we’re both busy) and we text each other everyday and see each other at work on the weekends. 

I really like her and she says she is interested in me and what we can potentially be. Right now we’re taking it slow because she’s never met someone that has shown interest in her first and has actually been respectful to her so she wants to do it right. We’re both Introverts if that helps. She tells me that she knows that she’s complicated and confusing (she doesn’t like to text during the day and mostly at night to ask me how my day was and she always texts me first) (we also haven’t done anything intimate or physical at all) and she really appreciates me and it makes her feel comfortable and I’m fine with all of that.

The only problem is that she is going away to college in august. She is going to dorm there and probably quit the job we both work at. The college is 30 minutes away from my house which doesn’t really feel like a lot and my college is 20 minutes away from her. Even though it’s not a long distance I don’t really know if she would want to continue what we have since she will meet so many people at college. 

So I’m just wondering if I should just end things so I don’t get hurt in the future when she’s at college. I’m just conflicted because I don’t want to get hurt but I also want to see what this could be. I also don’t want to pressure her into being in a relationship with me because she wants to take it slow, but I don’t want to invest so much and get hurt in the end when she leaves and maybe I should end it now. I know that would hurt her for me to end things because she’s told a lot of personal stuff and values what we have now, but I also have to protect myself because you never know with someone.

I just don’t really know what to do anymore, I feel like I’m going back and forth here

i have **quite some dating history**, and haven't been in a relationship since late 2019, though i have dated around 20 people since (often several simultaneously. no one got covid at any point.)  
i'm starting to wonder **how come i never end up in a relationship** \- do i not deserve it? am i any different from the women my lovers refer to as their ex-girlfriends? **what do men even imagine under a ""relationship""**?  
and **do i enable certain behaviour in men?** a behaviour where i provide them with all they want and they no longer have any interest in a relationship?  
i am diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder which i developed on top of my Asperger's and my understanding of other people's emotions/of other's social behaviour is generally a bit fucked.   


the **repeated scenario** is this:   
a man who used to have relationships before meets me. we're vibing, the sex is amazing, we start meeting regularly, and i start hoping he gradually develops feelings for me. when i bring up the subject of a relationship  he's susprised - he certainly doesn't want one, not at this phase of his life, and he thought i didn't either! there was no way to tell, **i allegedly behave like i just want to meet for sex**. (when i ask what they mean by this, it's difficult for them to describe it or provide more feedback.)  


for example at the moment **i'm stuck with these 3 men,** all of them artists and workaholics.  i probably seek out people like them for the sake of a quality conversation:  
\#1 we met and hooked up fairly quickly, we've been meeting at his studio for a year for mixed drinks, good long conversations and phenomenal sex. i hoped he would fall for me but it appears **he's happier just doing whatever he wants and sleeping with me** without any added responsibility  
\#2 is someone i met this summer, the connection felt like complete magic and fate. he says he loves me but i deserve better than him - someone better financially equipped, someone who will have more time for me. he says eventually he **would like to have a relationship but the time isn't now** and he doesn't know when the time would come  
\#3 is the youngest among the three and i met him only recently, we have been talking online pretty much everyday for 3 months, started sleeping together only recently. unlike the other two men, he gives me a lot of attention, always hears me out, is there for me whenever i need him. **what we have is basically a relationship - except he doesn't want a relationship**, because they are ""exhausting"" for him.  


these 3 guys think i subconsciously seek out men who are unavailable like them. my therapist says she thinks i don't want a relationship at all. a relationship is the only thing in this world that i want, mainly so i can fulfill a social expectation/norm and tell my family and friends that i'm in a relationship.

From august to December I was seeing someone, never got too serious but we had fun. She broke it off as she thought I was getting too attached, I suggested just a fwb situation but that didn’t go far 

She messaged me Christmas Day and we’ve been sleeping together about twice a week since then, been quite a lot of fun and I don’t expect anything from her as her moods do very 

She invited me over last night and didn’t talk to me or touch me for until we got into bed and she asked me weird questions like “am I intimidating, how’s your love life” and apologising for being a dick. She was texting other guys on tinder whilst sitting next to me. Obviously we’re not in a relationship so she can do whatever but I thought it was kinda rude. So we have sex after our weird talk then go to sleep.

Now she tells me her sister is coming round on Friday so we might not get together that night, we planned this before.

This has made me feel a bit sad and unappreciated so I think I’m gonna tell her later unless she treats me better I won’t be seeing her anymore

With my big surprise we actually did meet on Sunday when we planned to and we had dinner together, we were always laughing and we had a great date. During dinner he said the reason why he’s so bad at texting it’s because he runs his own hotel and uses WhatsApp to text all his employees so he misses messages and sometimes has to work late on weekends. 
We were planning to meet on Saturday but he said he was working and told me that he might be free on Sunday. Well since Saturday night I haven’t heard from him and he completely ignored me (I have attached our last texts).

We keep the chat going, but 2 days ago I did not replied and she did not kept the discussion going.

I sent a message this morning and we just talked all day long, getting a little bit flirty. Well I was a little more flirty than her and she was receptive. I was even saying from time to time that I was sad she was already taken and at the end of the day she said it was sad too.

We plan to keep chatting and stay friends, but there is this séduction between us and that's pretty weird. I don't see myself seeing her as a friend and not trying something if we meet.

Hi reddit. I recently got on a dating app and was approached by this one guy. We talked for a bit and he asked if I was looking for something serious or just a hookup, I said the first and he said he was too, although the would be willing to see where the road goes. We met the day following day for a walk and hit it off immediately. The next following days we’d talk a bit, not too excessively, which was nice. He asked for “daily pictures” of me. He initiated  second date a few days late and we met up. The date ended up with sleeping together, he knew it was my first time and I could sense he felt a bit off afterwards as he kept telling me to not go home and overthink everything- I haven’t, that much. He also said we were “almost dating” which left me confused because we barely know each other. Then he said he wouldn’t be able to see me because he’s going away for two weeks. I didn’t know what to say. 

The night felt right but has left me confused about my feelings for him. He’s also still quite active on the app we met on.

I've mentioned to him a few times that maybe we should slow down/cool off/step back because, to me, it seem like we're going a hundred and crazy percent. And I'm a slow-to-trust, practical, logical person. I'm pretty much a Vulcan. With that said, these *feelings* are surprising to me.

So anyway! About week ago, I was in my cups and as we were falling asleep, I inebriated, half-asleep, and stupidly asked, ""how weird is it that I think I'm already falling in love with you?""

Crickets.

And then he laughed at me saying, ""well that's sort of the opposite of cooling it, don't you think?""

I felt so embarrassed and so rejected and started backpedaling immediately with, ""obviously I can't be though, because I barely know you and that would just be stupid if I felt that way. If you leave before I wake up and I never hear from you again, I get it.""

He says something along the lines of, ""I think you could make a pretty good guess."" I assumed he was talking about me never seeing him again and so I made some joke regarding that. Then he added, ""I think you know I have feelings for you too.""

Aaaaand it hasn't come up since. So, I actually have no idea what happened. What does *feelings* mean in this context? I know I jumped the gun on all of that. I know I can't possibly be in love with this man in this time frame, but there was *something* I wanted to express and tell him and I don't know if he was saying we were on the same page or not.
