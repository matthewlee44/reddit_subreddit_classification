2,qo72wr,1636225943,Can I get someone else's perspective on this?,"I've been seeing this girl for the past couple of weeks. We've been out on 3 dates and they've all been cool. In person, our connection is pretty great and I really like her. The problem is the downtime in between the dates. We live pretty far from one another and we never see each other outside of dates. And the thing is, during this down time, texting her is just so damn exhausting. It doesn't matter if she started the conversation or I did, she'll still take 4 hours at the minimum to reply. A simple ""how did your day go?"" conversation will literally span an entire day, sometimes even a couple of days, because of how long she takes to reply. 

There were points during which I genuinely thought she was no longer interested in talking to me and I actually started to distance myself, but she's always come back to either confirm a date or ask me what's up.

I guess, from my perspective, I've always associated interest with the flow of conversation in texts; if we're texting and someone's taking hours just to reply, all the time mind you, I automatically assume they're not interested in talking to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qo72wr/can_i_get_someone_elses_perspective_on_this/

4,qo7lf2,1636227569,I quit the hot and cold game,"When I was a bit younger I used to worry about how long it took someone to message me back and I would carefully only respond to them after a certain amount of time had passed, you guys know the game I mean! 

After a while I just felt a bit drained from worrying all the time about whether I was being too keen or being too distant. I started to think about how I bet the other person isn't wasting so much time carefully tailoring responses so they come across just right or timing my replies so I don't look too keen, too available etc.

My solution was... just respond to them in the same way I respond to my friends....without a single thought or second guess. And I stopped worrying and I just relaxed into being myself. If they thought that made me too keen, then I knew it wasn't something worth pursuing and I would move on. 

This approach made me much more confident and sure of myself, it also meant I enjoyed the experience of chatting to someone I liked so much more!

8,qo8da2,1636229939,I feel lost and afraid and I can’t do anything,"Hi all!

Been dating a girl (22f) and we’ve been on 4 dates. They’ve all gone really well and we’ve both never had relationships or gone past 2 dates. Our previous date was us laying near the water stargazing and we ended up cuddling together and her telling me how comfortable and safe I make her feel, and on the way home we talked about what we wanted to do for the 5th date and then we had a longer than usual goodbye hug.

Here is where I am lost ;__;
On Monday she asked to rain check our date (that was gonna happen this Sunday) until next week due to having a family event that she forgot about and having to get uni work prepared for when she starts on Monday. She was also out of state all this week with her girlfriends on a vacation and got back Friday night. We used to text all the time for the first 2 weeks and she used to initiate most of them and send me good mornings etc. We date once a week due to our busy schedules and live nearly 50 mins apart. Between the 3rd and 4th date the texting was still there, but no where near as much. Now ever since she went on holiday and told me about the rain check that I mentioned above, she hasn’t said like anything to me :/ 

I don’t think she’d ghost me as on our 3rd date she asked me about my past dates and I told her about how a girl lead me on for weeks cause they couldn’t tell me that they didn’t wanna go out anymore and she thought that was really wrong and told me that the guys she’s been out with in the past that didn’t work out she told that she wasn’t interested. 

I’m so confused and lost on what to do. We still haven’t picked a day for our date this coming week and I was thinking about calling her tomorrow night (Monday night) and seeing what happens out of that. I’ve never rung her before either. Any advice is much appreciated, I really like this girl and I’m not sure if I’m overthinking it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qo8da2/i_feel_lost_and_afraid_and_i_cant_do_anything/

10,qo8dw0,1636229995,Just about ready to quit the dating game for good 27M,"Hey all

I’ve just grown completely dissillusioned with dating and have increasingly started to believe that love is not going to happen for me.

I’m 27, gainfully employed funny outgoing and kind. I’m very average looking (bald at 27 lol) and not somewhat that would turn any heads. I’ve been in one relationship in my life during 2020 and it lasted 7 months before she dumped me.

Ever since it’s become pure drudgery in the dating market. It’s all one off dates that go absolutely nowhere. Usually ends after one date and a ghosting.

I just got my stupid hopes up one last time today and met with someone who was really cool. I felt we were really hitting it off until i broached the idea of a second date. I got a long winded answer saying basically she doesn’t want to waste my time and she doesn’t know what she’s looking for…. 

I naturally turn a critical lense to myself. Is there something wrong with me? Am I not attractive enough? Weird in person? I rack my brain to figure out what my problem is. 

I’ve officially lost the fun of dating and it’s become drudgery. I’m about ready to delete my apps and give it all up. 

Problem with that is… without apps I’ve never successfully secured a date. It’s become even harder since I’m not in school. Deleting hinge and the rest means I’m deleting dating from my life.

Should I do it? Delete it all? The crappy dates are starting to wear on my self worth. I just hate the idea that I’m resigning myself to eternal bachelorhood.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qo8dw0/just_about_ready_to_quit_the_dating_game_for_good/

I think most of the time when someone says to you “I’m not ready for relationship right now” they mean with you. The “with you” is silent. It’s unfortunate but most likely true. They either are still playing the field or looking for better options. You deserve someone who puts in effort to be with you and you should do the same for them. If you’re putting in all the effort (always messaging first, planning dates, asking when to see each other) it’s pretty much over with.

18,qo8sfn,1636231256,I’m looking for couples to interview for a research project I’m doing on the limits of communication,"Hi, my name is Imran, illustrator, animator, and – at the moment – researcher.

I’m doing a research project on the things that keep us from communicating our exact thoughts to one another, specifically our partners. Things like the limitations of words. Sometimes we have something really meaningful we want to say to our partners, for example telling them about a life-changing experience, but when we put our thoughts and feelings into everyday words, it doesn’t sound all that special, a lot of that meaningfulness is left behind.

Ultimately, I want to explore how people can sometimes talk without losing any of that meaning, and what exactly hinders their communication most of the time.

The results of all of my research are going to be used in the making of an animated short film.

All kinds of couples are welcome, the only condition is that both partners need to be willing to talk individually. Interviews will be recorded but only for their transcriptions, everything about the interviewee will remain entirely anonymous.

Number 1, The only social media that she uses is snapchat. I have requested to befriend her on snapchat but it's been 24 hours and she has not accepted. On snapchat, if you don't know, when you add someone, it says how you added them. For example, I had to search her username, so she'll know that I've done that.

I do not want this to sound egotistical at all but I have been told before that I’m a handsome guy. I work retail and occasionally have girls give me their numbers. My coworkers joke about sending the “pretty boy” to the sales floor to stock. I don’t typically have a problem getting dates.

However, I’m still crazy timid before approaching women I find attractive. What makes it especially bad this time is that we go to a small college and the class we have together is very small (like 8 students). I’m worried about being rejected and having to awkwardly finish out the semester with her there. I also am a huge over thinker. I over analyze everything. We’ve texted twice but the conversations didn’t last more than maybe 5 minutes, and I’ve second guessed everything I said to her even though it was all about our class and none of it was flirtatious. 

I’m good at relationships but subpar with dating if that makes sense. I want to play it safe so I don’t come off as overbearing but not too safe so it seems like I don’t care. I suppose I just need advice on initiating a conversation with her to eventually ease my way into asking her to coffee or dinner?

25,qo94ci,1636232300,Did I 25M screw up badly? Really need some advice here,"So a couple days ago a girl 25F from my 25M mutual friend group whom I’m close friends with texted me and told me she broke up with her GF. Anyway, I didn’t want to pry or anything and so I just told her I was sorry to hear and said to call if she needed someone to talk to.

Fast forward to yesterday afternoon, she texted me about hanging out in our friend group last night. She told me that the rest of the girls knew about her break up (I’m the only guy in this group fwiw) so I at least knew everyone knew about it when we got together. She called me about two hours before we were all expected to hang out and told me that she would talk more about it when she saw me in person and were together. 

Anyway, I went over to one of the girls houses prior to us all hanging out and this particular girl (Katie) is one that I’m interested in courting and so her and I were together. The others ended up canceling due to other commitments that came up last minute so it ended up just being me and Katie so it was kind of like an unofficial date. I called the girl who had the break up and told them everyone else canceled but that me and Katie were still planning to go out and so I invited her to come with us. She initially said that even though Katie and I are not actually a couple, she would feel awkward being around us because she’d feel like a third wheel. I told her I understood but still encouraged her to come with us so she could clear her head a bit. 

Long story short, she decided to come along, so Katie and I went over to her place to pick her up. Shortly after, I asked ‘so tell me what happened’… I assumed it was safe to ask since the other girls already knew and she had told me we’d talk once we got together. Anyway, she became uncomfortable after that and later told me she was taken back that I’d ask about her breakup in front of Katie and said the whole night was uncomfortable for her and that she felt awkward. I heavily apologized and said I didn’t mean to make her feel uncomfortable, as I thought it was safe to ask considering Katie knew and she also told me we’d talk once her and I were together in person. 

Do you think Katie would’ve thought I was a jerk for asking about our friends breakup? And was I in the wrong to ask about it? Bear in mind we’re all close friends, so I didn’t think it was the wrong time to ask. I told Katie afterward that I felt bad bringing that up but thought it was safe and she didn’t seem like it was a big deal and kind of brushed it off.

TLDR; I brought up a break up with one of our mutual friends and it made the whole night out feel awkward.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qo94ci/did_i_25m_screw_up_badly_really_need_some_advice/

(He tried to say that billionaires need to die but I expressed that people with the money to get medical care are not the ones dying). He also said that he would support r kelly and pay for his music even though he is a rapist and trafficker. I am also the type that wants to get to know people before sex happens. I also expressed to him that I am a virgin. He said that's annoying now I have to teach you everything. But I thought that regardless of sexual experience if you are with a new partner you need to teach eachother what you like and don't like. We made out and I enthusiastically consented to it. But then he kept asking if he could eat me out. I said no three times and he finally stopped asking after my third no. But I feel like a viable person to be in a relationship with would respect your boundaries at the first no. It took me a few weeks to realize what happened and that he was absolutely pathetic. Because of my neurodivergence it takes me a while to realize things about other people. But I am glad I got out of that situation anyhow. And also is it normal for someone to ask you to be in a relationship after two dates?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qoa2dc/i_feel_bad_for_ghosting_but_i_was_in_the_right/

I’d say we’ve been good friends for two years but I understand that he is now single - we’ve also been talking a lot more lately. 

We had a drink last week and I cannot seem to A/ get him out of my head and also B/ wonder whether he felt the chemistry too. 

There was a lot of looking into each other’s eyes, talking about more intimate stuff (family, plans for future…) - a step up from what we usually do and talk about. We’ve also texted EVERY SINGLE DAY since. We did not even have anything interesting to tell each other, we just would not let the conversation die. And talking so much is definitely unusual in our relationship (or any of my friendships in general, save for maybe one very best girlfriend). 

I know why I kept the conversation going (he’s on my radar since last week) and I’m thinking that he would not keep chatting « just be cause » either as it is not something we usually do ? We’ve spent two years being great friends and sometimes not talking for weeks. 

If it had been a drinks with any other guy I would consider it a complete first date success. But because we’re friends and friends do see each other for drinks, I wonder whether it’s all in my head. 

Should I just be bold and ask him out again (and just go for it if we have another drink soon) ?

60,qocexx,1636242679,From best friends to relationship and back to friends again,"I might write a full entry at a later point because it is one roller coaster ride of a story. We met each other at the hospital 4 years ago. I had attempted suicide. She doesnt know why I was there yet. I think it is time to tell her.  


I developed a crush on her after about 3 weeks at the hospital. I stayed there with her for 9 months. I couldnt kiss her though because I was really unlucky with getting infected by an antibiotic resistant bacteria which put me in quarantine for 4 months.  


I lost contact with her completely since she left the hospital before me. But I had her number. So when I got out of the hospital, I called her. She told me she honestly never expected to see me again after the hospital but we caught up where we left it at.  


Chatted about everything for hours on end and we probably went on somewhere around 20 dates before we eventually kissed,  


Then we were together in a long distance relationship for a year or so. It never quite worked out. I visited her but she had mental issues like PTSD and anxiety for large crowds, social anxiety etc. It didnt appear so but it made her quite immobile so all my plans on going on vacations and what not never worked out.  


So even though she is a fantastic person. Much more than she realizes herself, I cant be with her anymore. We never broke up. It just gradually transitioned from a relationship and back to a friendship again.  


We are still in a grey area but it seems like we both have realized that I have come further in my recovery than her. She says that she envies my ability to just go out and meet new friends, study, work out and that I am actually going places.  


I am telling her that I believe she can do a lot more than she thinks and that I believe in her. And she is supporting my visions for the future but she dont think she can join me.

62,qocql4,1636243674,"Is the ""spark"" real? I had a great first date, but...","I recently went on a wonderful first date. We made great conversation and had so much in common! Conversation was effortless, and for me that is HUGE because I tend to be a very shy/reserved person who can take more than a few dates to open up. But on this date, I totally felt like I could just be myself. I feel like we were both very comfortable around eachother: we flirted, shared laughs, and had loads of fun.

On the date, he mentioned more than once (with no suggestion from me) how much he wanted to see me again. I agreed, and so we made tentative plans (I unfortunately had an obligation the following weekend), but it seemed like a sure thing.

However, days have passed...and it's been dead air from him, despite a fleeting text exchange. He had told me on our date he would like to text and talk on the phone. I let it rest (we had a very long date), but after a day or so texted him and asked if he wanted to chat. He said he was busy, and I haven't heard from him since.

This has obviously made me think, what could have gone wrong? And I honestly can't think of a lot, except there wasn't really a ""spark."" While we got along and enjoyed eachother, I honestly did find him a bit boring at times. I'm not sure why this is, because he is an exciting person who has lived a pretty colorful life, as have I....but he was just a little...boring? I wonder if he felt the same about me? There were a couple core issues I am really passionate about (when I say issues, think interests/hobbies) that he showed complete disinterest/almost aversion to - so that kind of bummed me out and made him a bit ""boring"" to me I guess.

Which leads me to ask these questions: *Is* there such thing as a spark? Were we missing a chemistry spark? Is that why he hasn't asked me out again?

I'll admit - I'm not terribly upset that he hasn't asked me out again, the date was fun for what it was. What I am more concerned about is that I have been on a string of dates now that have followed a similar pattern. Things seem to go well, but the guy never follows up for a second date. This date went way better than any date I've been on recently, though, so I find it particularly strange.

What does everyone think? All feedback is welcome.

We got back together shortly after, she was slow to open back up to me and I proved myself as a bf and she as a gf. We are very tight, but I still sometimes wish I was single because I feel like I experience deep personal growth when I am single. I feel so stunted in a relationship for some reason…. Whenever I go back and forth between wanting to be with her and want to be single I experience this crazy anxiety that lands me an appointment with a therapist. That must be because of the burning indecision. I know breaking up with her will hurt her on a deep level, when it comes to that I’m sensitive and hate feeling responsible for others pain in any capacity. Bottom line, I want to be with her and I want to be single, but I don’t even know if I’ll accept either option as “good enough” and maybe that’s life.

72,qodh9h,1636246177,Help/advice with breaking my dating failure cycle?,"

I have this “cycle” that I have finally decided that I need to break, hence me just recently beginning therapy.

I usually meet someone, we get to know each other 1-3 weeks, then maybe we go on dates or get closer. We then reach a “high point” of them saying how they see a future with me, promising me stuff, being affectionate, calling me pet names and giving me attention.

Then, 3-6 months in, they start to withdraw either from not being over their ex or over what their ex did to them or claiming that they are not ready to settle down/want to “focus on themselves” or see other people.

I’m really tired of getting burned like this and continuing to fall for the same people and repeating cycles. Are there any books, advice, or any materials to help people like me who have this issue? I always end up feeling bad about myself and like I’m not good enough when things ultimately fail. Now I feel distrustful of new people and like I’m gonna keep repeating the same mistakes.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qodh9h/helpadvice_with_breaking_my_dating_failure_cycle/
73,qodl0c,1636246527,My date was annoyed / upset / defensive during a conversation we had over safe sex,"The new man I'm dating were discussing sex over drinks today. I mentioned I'm not on any contraception. The pill made me emotionally volatile and took me to some pretty dark places. The implant is also bad with my moods, plus one of my friends became pregnant again despite the implant; and the coil is super painful. For me, I avoid pregnancy and practice safe sex by asking my partners to wear condoms. I've never been pregnant ever, even after I got off the pill, so clearly it does the damn job. 

I told him what my preferred method is, and when he said how we expect to practice safe sex, I said via condom use. Alternatively, one can get a vasectomy which can always be reversed. Not too different to a woman having a coil implanted, right? 

He got pretty upset at this. He crossed his arms and legs, the smile disappeared. He said this is something he feels very seriously about, as well as some of his male friends. Apparently condoms are temporary measures, used for casual sex. When it comes to a woman you want to date seriously, in order to feel super intimate and close with her, apparently unprotected sex is a big part of that (following sexual health tests). It becomes uncomfortable so I say I'm joking and change the subject.

When I find attractive women online(after covid struck and I've been focused on my uni studies so i haven't had no luck on having dates with women, and my biggest power is my personality so I don't think i can reveal this at once when i meet women).

Whenever I showed up about me online, the women messaged me back were curious and wanted to know about me. And whenever I say I'm a man, they suddenly ghost me.
Some had troubles with her ex, and had kids. Well as i'm finding my future wife, this makes me uncomfortable. So i'm out.

I've been even desperate and saw women's pictures on bisexual/lesbian subreddit.

Plus, whenever they wanted to see me after telling about me, i show them my pictures. And they ghost me. And they even say you are not attractive and you are asian.(...Wow)
Yeah. I am an ESL. I learned English like in 3 years to read, write, and speak. I deal with English in an academia ALL THE TIME.

I do workout a lot. I am tall. 5'11"". I go to university clubs to meet people. Yes. I always strives to find my possible partner. I dress well a lot. I do use skin care routine cosmetics. I buy nice perfume.
I do have online apps more than 5. Tinder, okcupid, bumble, badoo, etc.
I can't go to the bar cuz of covid issues. It is not over yet.
And I don't drink.

I've been busy and so stressed due to the workload required from the university. The uni i am attending to is always in top 10 in the world, supressing its students to study all the time(this is not the point that i am complaining about rn.)

Finally, this made me conclude am i just suicide? Nobody wants me.

Oh. I'm correcting my previous statement.

'Some' girls wanted me. And i don't want them and they don't attract me.
This is the real problem. There are woman who likes me but i don't like them. And there are attractive women, but it seem they don't like me.

Its the first time in a long time that I've jumped back into dating. Almost all dates I felt nothing. Even if I had feelings before I keep getting rejected. This girl is different and its really throwing me off. 

So quick story. It was so difficult meeting up it took us a month of chatting before we finally had a first date. She was soo nice. It was the best date I had been on. But I've built up a hesitancy to believe someone is interested in me. I was thrown off by how interested she seemed. It took me off guard and kind of made me freeze. She played with her hair, touched my shoulder,  gave eye contact. 2nd date scheduled friday. 

So friday.. Almost a week away. I'm suddenly overthinking things I think. Like we texted some today and Im kind of not sure what to say anymore. She actually called me up for like 5min today to basically say sorry for forgetting to text me something earlier that she said she would. She wanted me to know that she wasnt ghosting me. 

I think I set good first impression because I was literally on a vacation to a national park which made for easy conversation and I sent her pictures. Now our conversations are back to reality so things will get more interested to see if we are actually compatible. I have this annoying fear that once people actually get to know me they wont like me. 

I think Im falling for a trap I've been in before. When I catch feelings my brain runs wild. I go from depressed to happy throughout the day. My mind quickly will focus on this one person even if I have other girls in my dms. 

I want to see if she would like to call instead of text sometime. If that okay after a first date or should I keep things casual over text?  


Im just worried im going to self-sabotage.
