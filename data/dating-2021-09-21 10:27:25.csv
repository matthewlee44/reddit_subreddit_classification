5,pslzy3,1632240820,If she is seeing multiple guys,"Hi,

I am 27M and just started seeing a 27F we have been on two dates so far I have a strong suspicion that she is seeing other guys (always online on dating site) which is ok, her right etc.

The thing is she barely initates any texting at all, when I message her she does reply normally around like 4 hours later etc but never develops into a conversation, on the dates we have has a good time but don't feel or at least having seen any signs that she is into me, although she has agreed to see me for the third time.

I feel like if I am just an option or backup etc, I don't won't to be in that position, in my eyes she either shows interest and initates also etc or no Bueno, doesnt feel like she is actively trying to get to know me at all.

I texted if you are interested in meeting up on the weekend let me know when you are free and she said I'd like that and Saturday?

I don't want to seem needy but at the same time don't want to be an option or something she isnt actively trying to date etc. 

So in your opinion should send a text of sorts too her or, just stop texting completely and if she initiates after a while maybe say something like, I see that I am always initiating contact or trying to to to know you, if your not interested tell me :)

I havent had much contact since the pandemic. started dating since 2 months ago. they all faded or ghosted as I know im acting too need and desperate. im aware and need to make the adjustments. 

anyway a girl wrote to me. shes very nice. 2 things. she lives far-ish from me. and I loathe the city shes in and I hate driving there. no way would I see myself doing it over time. no way. she has no car. public transport to me is a nightmare, very limited times as well. 

we can say and she does to..she doesnt mind to come to me. but this is only good for the beginning. I know what will happen and eventually I will do the brunt of the drives and I simply dont want to pair with someone far. I want to find someone close. 

being that she and I dont like being alone for fridays, I asked if shed like to meet as friends and get something to it. we set it up. I saw she was interested. I knew I wouldnt be before meeting. shes a nice gal. I cant see myself holding long term and i dont want to lead her on

basically im using her to cope with my loneliness. I paid last time. and im happy to pay again. she want sto meet tomorrow and Im thinking shes still trying to push it to a relationship and im trying to stay friends. shes also lonely and I think she likes my company as I do hers. but we also talk throughout the day and I know shes aiming for that. 

I feel bad for using her. we hugged a lot but I did not kiss her and I restrained myself. I need a friend so badly after the hell ive went through. I also think it will help me cut some of my neediness when meeting other women so I dont seem desperate. once im in it and get topped off with some time spent together I will be good. its not that I need attention. its that I need to love another. it makes me feel good to love.  corny",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psm627/2_different_expectations_dick_move_on_my_part/

They don't even want to spend the night after sex they all leave like I'm a call girl or ask me to leave because they are ""tired"". Why is that so bad to want intimacy? I know I deserve it. Dating seems easy but all they want is sex usually even when I make it clear that's not what I'm after. I'm emotionally drained and lonely. I feel so alone even though I'm secure and confident in myself. I just want someone I can be affectionate toward and they reciprocate. Why is that so hard?

10,psmm5l,1632242607,Is this normal‚Ä¶?,"I was really close friends with this guy that I met earlier this year and we ended up becoming best friends. We really got to delve deep into each other and find out everything, and eventually we started hooking up. When we were friends, he told me all about his past dating experiences and talked about girls pretty openly. He told me some messed up stuff‚Ä¶ he was dating a girl for a couple of years and while he was with her he had crushes on other girls and constantly checked out other women. He admitted this to me and even went as far as telling me that he slept with another girl the day him and his ex broke up. Eventually, me and this guy started hooking up.

I started falling for him pretty quickly. We were best friends, and combine that with sex, it was feelings right away. However, i noticed that throughout the time we spent I would go insane and just wonder if he thought about other girls. I‚Äôd cry to myself and think ‚ÄúI wonder if I‚Äôm enough for him or if he thinks of others like he did with his ex‚Äù. It would be a constant thought and it was honestly toxic for me. It messed me up a lot and I even went as far to find the previous girls he‚Äôd check out and stalk them here and there, comparing myself. I just didn‚Äôt trust him. He never did anything to me but since I knew how he was with his ex, I couldn‚Äôt get it out of my mind he‚Äôd do the same to me. Eventually, things ended because he told me he had commitment issues and didn‚Äôt want to commit to me so young, we‚Äôd revisit the relationship at an older age he said (were both 22). 

However, I think this relationship messed me up. Every time I look at another guy I wonder if I‚Äôll ever be enough. I wonder if I‚Äôm pretty enough for anybody. I wonder if he liked other people or if any of it was real. Am I insane for being so insecure about it or did he make me insecure?

11,psmow2,1632242819,"I'm can't see when this will end, I don't even know if that's bad or not.","So my gf and I were good for a while but things kinda got a little rocky when a lot of the things I have now were up in the air still. Like we didn't know if I was going to have this job I was trying to get (something much better than what I had before), my mom stopped helping at all with practicing driving and we didn't know how I was really going to get my car. She cares a lot about me and wants my life to go well so all of this was really putting a huge stress on her, especially the driving practice cause it felt like she was the only person supporting me. Like I was super reliant on her and if I didn't have her then I'd have nobody. She's also had two like really major traumatic events happen to her in the past and one of them related to having someone like that in her life. Someone who's dependant on her and only her. So that was already a pain for her, but then we went on a trip to upstate. The trip had me, her, her brother and her mom. Now is also in a relationship with a girl. This is gonna be pretty important later but I wanna tell it in the way that it happened. So yea my gf and I were out at some point, just hanging out and trying to find something to do and while we were out she told me that she wanted to talk about us. So of course I said yea let's talk, she started saying that she wasn't really sure anymore about us. That she wasn't sure where we'd be going or how much further she could go with me. I didn't really press for much more than that and I just kinda agreed while trying to not show my sadness at this sudden revelation. We left it in that kind of up in the air situation and went on with our day on the trip while trying to be more apart. Night came and we were hanging out in a room alone, so we talked about it more. She started venting about so many very personal things to me, her traumas and how much it hurts and affects her  to this day. How it bothers her that it has influence on how she's acting while she's with me, that she doesn't want to put me through that and through her moods that she'd always say switches so much. That she needed time and space so that she could go see a professional about this and work through it, to better herself. Of course I tried to reassure her of some certain insecurities, then she asked me if I'd wait for her while she did all this. Even if we weren't going to be really together, that I'd hold onto us. It sounded like just a break so I agreed, vehemently agreed. It was only space. So we sort of made up but after that night I was still left in the dark about where exactly we were at, so then the trip ends and we go back home. Things are still weird. She offers to come over and hang out in the morning right? So I, wanting to clarify everything about where we were and everything else, agreed immediately and was like ""totally yes come over."" So she came over and after a bit of a tension breaker with a board game, we started talking. I asked the big question. ""What are we right now? What are we going to be?"" And she explained everything. You see on the trip, she started to reevaluate everything about our relationship because her brother and  his gf both have really good paying jobs and are moving in together and are a really good couple. Now this is important because on revaluation of a lot for her, my Gf realized that it's that type of relationship that she wants. One that she can envision her partner being stable, having and maintaining a house, being responsible, wanting to move in together. A partner that can plan a getaway trip or even just small things like going out for a dinner every now and then. A mature relationship. She didn't see that in me. She loved me, she loved who I am and all those immature pieces of me. The ditzyness, being aloof, having the child-at-heart wonder, being grounded and seeing things one day at a time and giving her complete unconditional love and support and freedom. That she loved all of that when she first met me and she wouldn't change that for the world cause, in her words, it was all of that that helped her relearn how to love herself. But because she does now, she had the chance to see that it's that relationship that her brother has with his gf that she really wants. That would truly make her happy. Before, with one of the guys that she had a past with, they had offered her a life and relationship like that. But she wasn't ready, she felt like she was rushing through maturity and that she forcing herself to try and grow to meet him. Now though, she is ready for that. She's ready for moving forward in her life and she doesn't want to drag me along for it since I'm not there yet. Since I live my life so slow and she lives here so much faster than me. Since she knows how it feels to force yourself to grow. I told her that, in reverse, I'd also hate to force her to wait and suffer that agonizing feeling of stillness while your partner tries to catch up to you. To feel so limited in scope because the person you love just isn't there enough to see that. It's because of that that she couldn't stay with me. That we had to end it. She asked me how I felt about it and I told her that I, honestly, felt so awful. Just a full body dread and sadness. Then she said that I shouldn't be sad, that we'd still have that bond. She said that nobody else could call her bt her nickname the way I do, that nobody else was allowed into her headspace as much as I was and that I'll always have her. Of course I couldn't fathom how I shouldn't be sad about being broken up with, so I said that even though it may be true I can't help but feel this sadness. That I'm not gonna have her in the same way. But she was adamant about not feeling that way, so I said something so so stupid. I told her ""Hey it's okay, don't worry about me I'll just get over it in a couple days you know me."" Of course that was a complete lie, but I didn't want her to be thinking of me. To worry about me or anything. That kind of settled things and she left, the days following were so awful. I had an unending weight on me, every day I woke up and had to go to work. I'd see her and feel nothing but despair, thinking of how I couldn't make her laugh like before, that I wouldn't see her in the mornings, see her smile like that, hear her say my name all concerned when I say something stupid or act ditzy, about how much I loved her. I didn't really know it at the time but all the dread also came from all the things I left unsaid. After nearly a week and a half of just feeling straight up awful and practically avoiding her to keep from feeling that way I got the chance to talk to her again. I had to ask her a favor to take me to get my cut since I didn't have my car just yet, she also had some errands to run so it worked out and we met up and hung out while doing all that. When we were done we started talking about everything, I admitted that I lied through my teeth. That it was going to take so much more to just get over her and maybe I wouldn't really get over her ever. Just cause of how big of an impact she had on me and how much she changed for me. I truly don't think I'd have pushed as hard as I had to get where I am now without her. Maybe I'd still be here, just not as fast. That I introspected about all the flaws in my life and in my environment and how badly that definitely would have affected her. She told me more about how my mom's sneaking around with stuff around me also really bothered her. It's a little unavoidable too since I currently live with her. Especially since before I let her pretty much walk all over me. I told her that I missed her, I missed talking to her and being able to look at her and hear her be happy and see the way she looked at me when we were even just friends. That the lie I said was just to hopefully help. She told me that, of course, it only really hurt her since it sounded like I didn't care or that it didn't mean much to me. Now obviously that wasn't true so I just reassured her of that and said that even if it was just friends I just wanted her back in my life again. She agreed to that too. I got to think about it a lot myself too and draw my own conclusions and now I just feel that I care about her. I genuinely love her. I want the best for her and I want her to do whatever will make her happy and feel fulfilled. But it's because of all that, because of all that care I hold for her, that I can't be with her. The picture she has for herself, for her life and her partner? It doesn't include me, at least not in that way. It's a bittersweet acceptance. That I can't be that for her, I can't be what she wants and what will make her truly happy and that's why I have to let her go and let her grow away from me. But it's the best for her and I love her, so I need to be content with her going away. I'm sad and happy at the same time cause at least now I know that, despite us not being together, she can go on to become even more amazing. To find more joy, to help herself more, to find someone perfect for her. Even if it isn't me. It's been a month and a week and a half since all this happened, we're better than before in terms of talking and stuff like that. We're back to being good friends, I have my car, my new job and my old job. I still have my hobby of gaming and am trying to pick up playing keyboard and driving for fun. Even with all this, it's like I can't stop thinking of her. I can't stop feeling this inkling, a leak of sadness that keeps dropping small bits of it through everything I do. She's done so much for me, means so much to me, I loved and love her so much. Part of me wants it to disappear, but at least this means that it was all so real. Maybe it's better that I never forget how I felt or feel now, so that I never forget how good she is to me. I know this is all for the best, I just wish could feel the same.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psmow2/im_cant_see_when_this_will_end_i_dont_even_know/
12,psmqhg,1632242949,The problem with me and dating is that I'm too damn specific and niche,"I'm not saying I'm a special person who's above everyone. But I am saying that while I do possess a broad variety of things I like and do, there's just other parts of my life where it could be too unscripted when compared to most.

When I try matching up with normal people on sites, I've noted that everyone seems to be leading or wanting to lead these normal courses of life. They like to read, write, hike, camp .etc while they've graduated from college and hold these jobs based on their education. It all just seems too vanilla for me and there's nothing wrong with them or that, I hope they find their eventual pairings.

But when sizing them up against what I'm doing and where I am in life, it sticks out like a sore thumb. I've been in 23 relationships in over 17 years and the people that I've seem to have attracted and been with, have either been outcasts or people who're on society's backburners. Myself included.

The kind of people where the most we've ever achieved is high school, we've had our struggles throughout our lives, we're into things a lot of people would say are too childish or things we should've outgrown from.

What I'm trying to say is that, it's a pain in the ass to find people who're similar to what you're into specifically. Otherwise, it's like looking through someone's scrap book.

Turns out we're both frugal people and have a shit ton in common, including love languages, hobbies, and equally matched sarcasm.

Went to the fair and had a fun time on our 1st date, and have two more planned this week, one being a formal dinner. She's about 30 minutes away and a single mom. We both had had previous issues with a spouse that cheated, and are both kind of self-conscious about our looks. The thing with her is that she is super pretty and has the most amazing green eyes I've ever seen. So, unnaturally for me, I told her this the second I met her in person lol. This alpha shit just works, but it's also being honest with my thoughts and wants. We've both said something to the effect of ""holy shit, why is this cute person even talking to me?"" - seems like a good sign? She's very receptive to compliments and also dishes them out to me which I am not used to at all.

You could say that my life was on easy mode thanks to that, though I wasn't aware of it at the time. Then depression hit me and I gained 45 lbs and suddenly I felt like I was living in a whole different world. Men would only approach me at bars/clubs, folks at stores would either ignore me or recommend ""slimming"" clothes without me asking. I had someone calling me a sumo wrestler. I cried myself to sleep a few times a week. 

Now that I almost lost 30 lbs(currently 5'0 and 100 lbs), things are going back to ""normal"" again. And it's honestly heart-wrenching. I find myself obsessing over my looks and having a massive fear of gaining weight. You might think I should stop caring about what others think of me but as 20something, I can't help but care. I'm a heterosexual moderately-horny girl, it's nice to be wanted by dudes. 

Anyways, being on both sides taught me how shallow we are and now I question that body positivity shit cause I experienced none of it from others when I was fat.

19,psnraf,1632245882,My recent desire for intimacy makes me feel like I am going insane. Please help.," 

At 34 I have never put much effort into pursuing relationships, I have dated sometimes when I am bored and had relationships when they just sort of happened but recently I have had some kind of crisis. 

I took out a loan and bought motorbikes and never am at home, always out with people, trying new things. I started noticing that I am getting increasingly more angry and crying over stuff that really shouldn't be a big deal and generally noticed I am actually quite depressed. After a particularly bad day I drove home crying for hours and wished that I had someone who I could turn to, eat pizza with, watch junk on telly, have sex and cuddle and that would make me feel better. Since this I realised that I have been craving intimacy for a long time and been in denial. Initially I felt better cos great now I can do something about it but it is getting to the point where I am actually angry and tearful a lot. I had a dating experience with a guy who is confusing me, told me he wants to be exclusive but isn't making any effort to arrange a date and I feel neglected and ignored. I have said to him I need to arrange a date to feel connected to him and he has read my message but not replied. I am craving sex and cuddles so bad I can't even masturbate or watch porn without crying.

I feel like I am losing my marbles and am desperate for that kind of intimate connection with someone. How do I cope with this? I feel like feeling this desperate will kill off any chances to meet someone! It's crazy, I have never felt like this before, I always preferred being single.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psnraf/my_recent_desire_for_intimacy_makes_me_feel_like/

I went on a 'date' with this girl yesterday, I met her and her family randomly in a uni dorm elevator when they were looking at different accommodations, met the family etc and went to lunch, nice people.

The daughter moved in to the same property (not same block) and asked me out for a coffee, i agreed, we met yesterday, and it was meh, bit awkward, but got a laugh, was just a short walk around town

I waited today (the next night) to let her know i enjoyed it and if she would like to get a pizza when she's free. and she said  ""sorry, i can't commit to anything right now, but it sounds like a good idea"" and ""i'm just trying to used to the new schedule"" - should i just leave it at that?

21,psnwmi,1632246318,Why did she block me from seeing her Instagram story?,"I‚Äôve (M26) been talking to this girl (F22) for the entire  summer after we hooked up on our last day of semester at University (we met that night). Initially, it seemed like she was pretty into me as we‚Äôd text all through the night on many occasions, I also noticed she added me to her close friends list on Instagram almost straight away when we were both at home (she‚Äôs from Greece and I live in the U.K.). We‚Äôve been speaking from early July till now which is a total of more than 2 months. The only problem is, I never seemed to get past first base in the sense that our conversations were often very basic and superficial and was rarely anything deep or complex so I felt we never really connected on THAT level. Most of our convos would just be asking how we were doing that day and what we were up to and she would send me videos of what she was doing and I would do the same. Due to the nature of the conversation, there were periods that our chat was pretty dry which then made me say things to close it (and just wait till we went back to university to talk again just to not drag things out) but she would keep it going. I saw this as her continued interest. However, I noticed she started this habit of blocking me from seeing her stories and then re-adding me again after a period of time. I first noticed this when she posted a story but my signal wasn‚Äôt strong enough to view it so I waited till later to check and saw that it had disappeared. I then went to her page to check the story and saw nothing there. I noticed that she had some story highlights previously and they all vanished. I asked her and she said she deleted the stories. The next day (after 24 hours) I suddenly saw her  highlights again when I checked her page. I googled this and saw that when someone blocks you from seeing their story, you‚Äôre also unable to see their highlights. I kept talking to her anyway but realised a marked change in her texts. She would now take much longer to respond and usually ignore half of what I‚Äôd written and only answer to one part with one liners. 
Again, I saw her post a story which I couldn‚Äôt load because of my signal and then when I went to view it later on, I noticed it was gone and her story highlights had disappeared again. 
Just out of curiosity I followed her on my second account and she accepted and I saw that she was truly hiding stories from me although she was still replying to my messages.

I can understand if she‚Äôs no longer interested but she has almost 10k followers so I just don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôd specifically hide them from me. And what I‚Äôm more perplexed about is the fact that she does it on and off. So sometimes she‚Äôs okay with me seeing them but not other times? And it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs something crazy she‚Äôs hiding as the stories I‚Äôm seeing from the 2nd account that she‚Äôs hiding from  me are the same ones she usually posts. 

TL:DR; met and hooked up with a girl on the last day of semester and have been speaking to her all summer and noticed she has been constantly hiding and unhiding her Instagram story from me. She‚Äôs showed less interest recently but don‚Äôt understand why she keeps hiding stories and then changing her mind about unhiding them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psnwmi/why_did_she_block_me_from_seeing_her_instagram/

I've only recently started trying some online apps after some friends suggested it. I've had some matches, one of which we seemed to hit it off until the 4th date where something switched and it's like she lost interest all of a sudden.

I've been really lonely ever since my breakup, aggravated by the fact that I was living alone abroad during the lockdown.
That girl was the closest I got to truly forgetting about my ex. She's funny, knows how to keep a conversation going and we have a lot in common. But I can't but help thinking that I was trying too hard to replace what I had with my ex. 
The feeling of having someone with whom you share everything, talk about everything, and do everything.

Is it weird that I'm only looking for a meaningful relationship with real connection, instead of just hookups? Could it be that this fact about me is what scared my date off? I never really talked about it at length, we never really talked about our history but I did mention my ex and the duration of course.

26,psoeed,1632247747,Am I putting in too much effort or should I do more?,"
I‚Äôm (29M) dating a girl (24F) I met OLD. In nearly a month we‚Äôve hung out 4 times for 3 dates and two of the nights she came to my place. We‚Äôre both busy adults so I only plan our dates on the weekend. In between seeing each other we don‚Äôt communicate much. From my point of view I would send her enthusiastic messages and she would reply with short/dry texts. Then I‚Äôd back off because I was thinking maybe she‚Äôs not that into me so I‚Äôd text her less and try to reciprocate her energy. 

Apparently her point of view is different. On our last date Saturday, I asked her to meet up with me at a nice spot in the city to grab a drink. She agreed but said she had to meet her friends at 10. Our date was going great! But at one point the topic of our communication got brought up. She said that she told her friends that we don‚Äôt talk much, she made it seem like it was my fault. She said ‚Äúoh I know you‚Äôre busy with work‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to bother you‚Äù she‚Äôs also told me on multiple dates now that‚Äôs she‚Äôs surprised I asked her out again and that‚Äôs part of the reason she doesn‚Äôt text me much. I told her yeah I get busy but I‚Äôll make time for you. I also said of course I keep taking you out, we have a really good time together, you‚Äôre funny, beautiful, etc ‚Ä¶ So anyways we both agreed that we will put in more effort to talk to each other. We admitted that we aren‚Äôt the best texters as well so I told her I‚Äôll call her too. 

So the night goes on. Our conversations started to heat up so around 8:30pm I asked her if she wanted to go back to my place (I live an hour away) she said yes and I asked what about your friends you‚Äôre supposed to meet at 10? She said they‚Äôll be fine. (I should note this is the third time she‚Äôs had plans with her friends but chose to hangout with me instead) We took separate cars so we both drove an hour back to my place. When we lay in bed together I try making a move but she tells me she‚Äôs on her period. We‚Äôve hooked up before so I‚Äôm questioning why this girl really just ditched her friends and drove a whole hour to just stay the night with me??? It‚Äôs confusing. I was convinced she just wanted to go on fun dates and hook up with me. We literally don‚Äôt talk much outside of our dates and every time we meet up I feel like it‚Äôs a first date all over again. 

So anyways she stays over and we cuddle all night. She doesn‚Äôt leave until almost 11am. This was sort of a problem for me because I was supposed to pick up my friends at 1:30pm to go to a music event in the city but I didn‚Äôt say anything. We‚Äôre running late and I obviously am busy out with my friends all day so I don‚Äôt text the girl that I‚Äôm dating. 

So it‚Äôs Monday and I text her a nice message. Basically I fill her in on what I did Sunday and that next time I go to an event I‚Äôd like her to come with me and I know she‚Äôd love it! And of course she doesn‚Äôt reply. 

So later that day I post all my videos out with my friends on my IG story. I‚Äôm not sure if this would affect anything but my friends I went out with were girls (just friends) and the videos were of us dancing together and having fun (nothing sexual or grinding) Btw I know some girls get jealous so on our date I did let her know I‚Äôm going out with my friends who are all girls. Anyways the girl I‚Äôm dating looked at my IG stories every time I would post something new but still ignored my text.

Today is Tuesday and she still hasn‚Äôt replied. So idk what to do. It‚Äôs odd that she told me I‚Äôm too busy and I don‚Äôt text her like it was my fault. So I put in effort and she ignores me. I also find it strange that she would want to ditch her friends just to spend the night with me, a guy she barely knows and not even get sex out of it. She came over to cuddle for over 12 hours so that makes me think she must have some feelings for me. But if that‚Äôs the case, why not text me back??

So do I keep waiting for her to respond? Do I put in more effort even though she doesn‚Äôt do the same? Or should I just move on and let her go?

TLDR: confused if I should even bother putting in effort for a girl that doesn‚Äôt seem to apply the same energy she expects out of me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psoeed/am_i_putting_in_too_much_effort_or_should_i_do/

37,psp53z,1632249900,Childhood neglect and the desire for love later in life.,"2021 has been one of my worst years for dating (worse than 2020 for some reason), blame it on whatever you like, I still haven't been completely unsuccessful following unlocking. However, I've noticed that I have this constant, burning desire for companionship. Be it in the form of love or sex. I started beating myself up for not getting laid enough. All day I lament the fact that I have no one texting me etc. I'll save you every unhealthy thinking behaviour I get into, but I will say that I have eventually been sucked into the FA subreddit (as well as this one, which has similar posts, albeit with more advice which is shot down) and end up feeding off the miserable loops of self condemnation to an eternity of solitude. Now, I have been quite successful in my dating life as a person, and have very little right to start feeling sorry for myself. So I began trying to analyse why I felt this constant emptiness within me. I call it 'the craving'. It also extents to friends and 'fun' in general. 

I think what I've identified as 'the craving' is directly linked to my childhood neglect (parents worked a lot, divorce at 9, lots of ugly details in between). It's extremely difficult to put into words, but I feel a constant crying out inside of me of something that is unattainable. When I read about FA people on forums, be it here or on that subreddit, the endless desperate, hopelessly frustrated cries for love and attention speak of a sadness far deeper than a simple lack of love. I will not sit here and pretend to understand the pain that being romantically unsuccessful so late in life is like, I imagine it is excruciating. However, the fact that I relate to their feelings despite having been very successful in this sphere of life says betrays quite a lot about my own way of thinking. I know many unattractive people who are romantically/sexually unsuccessful and are not consumed by feelings of inadequacy, frustration, sadness and desperation in their every waking moment. However, as I lurk on such forums, I start to believe this is the norm. 

And thus, what they perceive to be 'hollow' suggestions to self-improve and fix their issues from 'normal' people are, in fact, completely correct. However, they may also be incredibly difficult to achieve. The foundations for inner peace must, unfortunately, be laid in childhood. I am not condemning anyone to an eternity of suffering. However, I'm acknowledging the scars that a not-ideal upbringing can leave. As I have them myself and they affect me every day. It would be much easier to put a plaster over it with love and sex. I believe this is the trap that I have once again fallen into. For many of you this may be a 'yeah duh' post, and this is something I acknowledged myself very early on in life when I judged people who stayed in abusive relationships. However, I've fallen into the trap myself. I may be completely wrong about this, but I hope I'm not because it will allow me to stop judging my perceived lack of romantic success so harshly and find other joys in life.

43,psprmd,1632251710,Is it just me or there's generational differences in photos?,"My personal perspective as a single straight man swiping through dating apps so unsure if there's any similarities for others in their searches and settings according to gender identity and sexual preferences.
I'm rolling up to mid 30s myself or as some might call it the golden age where dating is 20s, 30s &amp; 40s for me üòåüôÑ 

What I can't help but notice swiping Tinder;

- 20s are all self prescribed models with poses, glamour shots and the oozing sex pics... surprisingly the local store clerk seems to live the life of a socialite based on that 

- 40s is all natural photos, no crazy over sexualization, no modelesque behavior, but not to say some aren't extremely beautiful! ...More tame with less staging for pics

- 30s is a mix of both above, can go both ways (not just saying their bi üôÉ) some go all wannabe models with sexualized photos each in a little itty bitty bikini striking poses like it's yoga class others just are out and about and simply beautiful in their pics without the amp up

Depending on what age range app is set to this rings true... is this just generational? 

What is it, 20s are finding themselves and grown in this overexposed life of wanting to portray themselves one way, are 30s just transitional, whereas 40s are self actualized to an extent. Or is it just the difference in the overall times we've grown up in? Some might argue that 40yr olds now would've done the same if they grew up in current times and were in their 20s... most likely 

This isn't judgment, just an observation atleast where I am, a densely populated major city with a lot of singles meaning tons of photos and easy math from first hand account. I just find there's such a facade, too much so

I'm sure guys have extremely douchey photos too... but I'm can't comment not having interest to swipe through themü§ê",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psprmd/is_it_just_me_or_theres_generational_differences/

47,psq4iu,1632252733,Dating apps for minorities,"Hey guys, this is my first post. 

Does anyone know if there are any apps out there specifically designed for minorities (mixed raced here)?

I've used bumble, tinder, and hinge but I hardly get any matches. Granted, I do live in a predominantly white society (UK). Most white women I believe do not find me attractive, which is fair enough as they are entitled to have their own preference. Ironically, I do get interest from women when they see me in person, but the problem is I don't really go out much as it isn't my personality. I think people that use those apps subconsciously fall into the trap of racial bias, but that's   a whole other topic that I do not want to get into.

Back to the original problem, there aren't that many female minorities on those apps in general, and I feel like my dating life would be a lot better if someone designed a dating app for that market.

So I figure I should ask her out since she‚Äôs really pretty and is into me. She says yes and we plan to get a pizza and watch a movie at my house. All is going well, the conversation is flowing and all. After like 20 minutes of sitting on the couch we start holding hands. I walk her home and ask if she wants to do something like that again she says yes. Later that night she texts me and says she had fun and thanked me.

About four days pass and I‚Äôm in town one night and casually ask if she wants to hangout for a bit. She says ‚Äúyes but just as friends‚Äù. So like what gives she liked me and the date went well. Why would she change her mind? I‚Äôd understand if the date went bad but it didn‚Äôt. She even did a lot of little things to show she likes me. Like when we held hands she did the thing where you rub you finger back and forth on the other persons hands. When she went to the bathroom she came back and sat closer to me then she was before.

It was such a strange coincidence that I decided to get to know him regardless of the age gap. Remember I said it was Saturday.. he asked to see me on Sunday and that annoyed me. We barely had a conversation so i made an excuse and said we‚Äôd meet later in the week. But as the week progresses, we speak on the phone everyday. This guy is successful, handsome, compliments me heavily and all the boxes are checked . BUT conversations were only about him. He barely asked questions about me, he just wouldn‚Äôt repeatedly tell me what he wants in a woman or about his car(s). Conversation would go quiet multiple times so i kept having to make questions.

We then went our separate ways and met up last year for the first time in 5 years. He was came to visit his friend from my state and wanted to meet up with me. I didn‚Äôt expect it to be a date but he kissed me and bought me dinner. It was a great date and he wasn‚Äôt expecting anything after the date if you know what I mean. He even joked saying he wanted to marry me. The conversation flowed and we were both flirtatious. We then went on another date and he picked me up and we went for a walk. We then were dancing and opening up to each other. He then goes back to his state and a week later or so tells me that he got a job opportunity in another state that was even further. I initially thought there is no way this is going to work but he was very very persistent on wanting me to go visit him. Even though I really wanted to, I was scared of Covid (this is when it first started) and I never flown on a plane alone before. He was understanding that I wanted to wait and said that he would make me feel comfortable once I was there. But after a while, I continued to say no because I was terrified. Not only because of Covid but because our two best friends (Mike and Alana) aren‚Äôt dating anymore. I brought up to my friend that Eric reached out to me and she freaked! Saying that I shouldn‚Äôt date her ex boyfriends best friend. She also does not like him because he hooked up with Alanas friend many years ago, who at the time, was dating Eric‚Äôs friend. Eric felt really bad for what he did and acknowledged what he did was wrong. So now, Alana, alanas friend, and that boyfriend, does not like him. This puts me in an uncomfortable situation. Eric and I are in our mid to late twenties and this situation happened when I was 18. Do I think what he did was wrong, of course. Even after it happened, Alana encouraged me to hook up Eric. 

Someone in his family passed away and he came back up to my state for the services. He invited me to go but again, covid. He invited me to see his friends and family.

Anyways, Eric and I went our separate ways again and he got a girlfriend. They broke up a couple months ago and he reached out to me a few weeks ago. Since then we have been talking. He said he going to visit my state and wants to see me. He wishes me good morning sometimes and invited me to go to an event in his state.

56,psqv5p,1632254904,I'm much happier when I don't date. I'm not sure if it's worth it.,"After I left my ex in June of 2020, I was totally celibate for a year. Did not even date until a couple months ago. My self-esteem was the best it had ever been, mood was great, skin was clear, etc. I was eating better and was so much happier. 

I finally felt well enough to date. I went out a few times with three different people. They all disappointed me in various ways. 

Yes, I am much more sensitive than other people. Or maybe I'm just more honest about it?

I don't like getting treated as an option, I don't like having to bend to men's whims and schedules when they don't do the same for me, and I don't like constantly feeling evaluated and not being made to feel like I'm measuring up. I also don't appreciate men treating intimate experiences like handshakes. I don't like slow fading or communication drop-offs. 

Some people would say, wait till your mental health is better. But it WAS. I was doing great. All I changed about my life was starting dating again. 

Some people will say, change the type of men you date. I genuinely do not feel I'm very picky. I am looking for 1) is he attractive enough to eventually have pleasant sex with? 2) Does he have a job. 3) does he genuinely seem interested in me and getting to know me. All these guys had these qualities early on in dating. #3 changes the most. 

I thought of one of my happier days recently. I was enjoying a delicious brunch with one of close friends. It was fun and intimate and carefree and comfortable and lovely. No men. Just be and my favorite girl friend.

75,pss6bn,1632258642,Might still be in love with my ex,"8 months ago, at the beginning of the year, I had my heart shattered and I was broken up with. She lied to me about so much, and I really should hate her, and I think I did for a while. It was a pretty bad breakup involving lots of tears, blocking each other, unfollowing social media accounts, and way too many people knew about it. 
And then I processed, healed, forgave her, but I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôve forgiven myself. I ‚Äòmoved on‚Äô, found someone else, and she‚Äôs really great and everything. She‚Äôs a lot of things my ex wasn‚Äôt, and vice versa, in a good way, mostly.
Is it possible that even though I‚Äôm in a new relationship now and I wanna believe I love my new gf, that I‚Äôm still not over my ex? That maybe I‚Äôm even still in love with her somehow? I actually miss her, I‚Äôm not even gonna lie. I know I shouldn‚Äôt, because she‚Äôs obviously happy with who she is now and living her best life.
I sometimes honestly feel like I couldn‚Äôt love anyone as much as I did her again. And I‚Äôve been looking for a place to rant about this all day, but there‚Äôs really no one I can talk to about this because I‚Äôve convinced them all I‚Äôve completely moved on.
But as much as I try to convince myself I‚Äôm over her, I still get lost in thought and memories and would-have-beens so many times in a day, which probably isn‚Äôt healthy. I kind of blame myself for the breakup even though I know I shouldn‚Äôt. It still kind of hurts sometimes. Will it always? It‚Äôs been 8 months now, lol.

This probably doesn‚Äôt help, but in an effort to convince myself and her that I was over her, I actually texted her again recently, platonically, and we made some small talk but not more than that, which is something I didn‚Äôt even tell my present girlfriend about. Probably why this feeling has been so strong recently.
Am I still holding on to the past? I‚Äôm actually really confused. I really want my present relationship to work. She‚Äôs really good for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pss6bn/might_still_be_in_love_with_my_ex/

I was the unattractive, unpopular, loner so I was already perceived as creepy by most women and the back of my hand touching her because she backed into me couldn‚Äôt have possibly be an accident. 

She accused me of grabbing her to a teacher and it was a huge deal. I almost got expelled, I had earned a military scholarship and nearly lost it. Finally they listened to me and looked at one miracle camera that was able to get a view and saw that I did nothing. I still had to deal with that reputation for the rest of school and I chose not to walk at graduation because at graduation practice someone yelled that I was a rapist and I just didn‚Äôt want to have to deal with that at the real thing.

So now I‚Äôm 20 in college and I want to date and meet women but I have no idea how to do that. I‚Äôm terrified of being near women alone. I‚Äôve been actively avoiding it. I don‚Äôt know any women. If on the buses on campus I there‚Äôs any space near a woman I avoid it like that plague. 

I don‚Äôt like that I feel this way, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to be near a woman alone. I don‚Äôt want for my hand accidentally brush their leg and then for there not to be a camera to vindicate me.

How do I do this? How do I talk to women without creeping them out?

83,pssxm4,1632260736,Trying to get my life back together after my ex destroyed it,"So long story short my girlfriend (26F) of 3 years cheated on me (29M) about two months ago. We were supposed to move to a new state together and two days before moving she slept with her best friends husband. They are now seeing each other which hurts all that much more. I was totally blindsided and having a tough time dealing with it all. I‚Äôve tried dating someone else and I ruined it. I did exactly what I was afraid of and pushed all my issues onto this person who did not deserve it. 

I was honest with them about what had happened and I put on this show that I was okay and nothing was wrong. But inside, I‚Äôm destroyed. I‚Äôm not the same man I once was. I hate who I see when I look in the mirror and often think of hurting myself. It‚Äôs a bizarre feeling that I‚Äôm not sure what to do about. I‚Äôve tried therapy but it doesn‚Äôt seem to help. I know that it‚Äôs not worth doing but I can‚Äôt fight the fact that I have these feelings. I did nothing wrong to deserve what my ex did to me, and from an outside perspective I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs hard to see but I am a good guy and I treated her like every woman would want to be treated. 


We had our whole lives planned out, I already had bought her a ring and was planning on proposing last month after we moved. She doesn‚Äôt seem to have any empathy about this whole situation and it kills me that she can be so cold and honestly, evil. She has been treated like shit in every relationship she has ever been in, and always told me how this was the best thing to ever happen to her and that no one has ever treated her so good. This new guy is an absolute waste of life. He treated his wife like shit, he treats his children like shit, and everyone who knows him only has bad things to say. It‚Äôs incredibly confusing.

During that period however, not once ever did she reciprocate anything back to me. I didn‚Äôt do these things because I expected something back, but it kinda made me feel like crap knowing I wasn‚Äôt worth anything to her.

So I have been watching a lot of Jordan Peterson and Kevin Samuels to help me find a good woman. My friends directed me to watch their content.

It‚Äôs hard in this college age to find a woman who values and respects a real relationship. I went on a date with this girl and we took the bus home and we saw a family with a baby in a stroller. Now, Peterson says to pay attention to how women are around children because it says a lot about them. I waved to the child and she didn‚Äôt. 

This foretells of: daddy issues, disconnection to children (which goes against a females innate desire to reproduce offspring) and goes against her female nature. 

The fact that she didn‚Äôt wave at the baby is a major red flag. I asked her why she didn‚Äôt. She said it was because babies don‚Äôt seem to respond when we‚Äôre masked. Because they read our facial expressions through mask. So no point. 

I‚Äôm considering taking this into a reason to give her the benefit of the doubt. I was thinking of taking her to the park to see how she reacts to children outdoors who are unmasked. I‚Äôm asking myself ‚Äúwill she play with them? Will she acknowledge them? Will she say hi to them? Will she ask to hold a baby? Will she connect with other mothers?‚Äù 

I need to ensure a females desire for children is there and that her biological feminine characteristics are healthy and normal. Or else, this woman could be another toxic unhealthy partner.

I didn‚Äôt expect it to be a date but he kissed me and bought me dinner. It was a great date and he wasn‚Äôt expecting anything after the date if you know what I mean.

He was understanding that I wanted to wait and said that he would make me feel comfortable once I was there. But after a while, I continued to say no because I was terrified. Not only because of Covid but because our two best friends (Mike and Alana) aren‚Äôt dating anymore. I brought up to my friend that Eric reached out to me and she freaked! Saying that I shouldn‚Äôt date her ex boyfriends best friend. She also does not like him because he hooked up with Alanas friend many years ago, who at the time, was dating Eric‚Äôs friend. Eric felt really bad for what he did and acknowledged what he did was wrong. So now, Alana, alanas friend, and that boyfriend, does not like him. This puts me in an uncomfortable situation.

Someone in his family passed away and he came back up to my state for the services. He invited me to go but again, covid. He invited me to see his friends and family.

Anyways, Eric and I went our separate ways again and he got a girlfriend. They broke up a couple months ago and he reached out to me a few weeks ago. Since then we have been talking.

He grew distant and I confronted him about it &amp; he told me how it on purpose because he didn't want things to get serious since he was leaving for a month. (wanting to put a pause on us). 
I agreed/was on the same page.

but then he continue would talk to me everyday in such a non-engaging way that I started giving him the same energy back/pulling away/giving him space. 

It felt terrible, because things didn't go back to how they were. It wasn't like it even was approached to go at a slower pace. It was just like I was the only one putting effort in / my emotional needs were ignored. We saw each other on his terms/hes schedule.  It affected me negatively because I was ignoring my own emotions. 

So asked him if we should still continue to talk. I told him

 ‚ÄúI like talking to you and hanging out with u but things feel too distant to often.¬†I‚Äôve been doing my best to not be bugged by it but it‚Äôs at a point where i feel like I am and I‚Äôm in denial about it. 

I know you‚Äôve admitted that you purposely do that. So I just feel like if this isn‚Äôt really leading anywhere, I‚Äôm just hurting myself because I‚Äôm hopeful things will lead somewhere because of how things were the first time we were talking. 

Things change. You can‚Äôt control how you feel. So me saying this, isn‚Äôt me hating or angry or anything like that.‚Äù

He responded with how 
didn't want to hurt me/ lead me on and he talks to me however much he feels like (SUCH A A**Hole) but he didn't see anything special. 

Then proceeded to call me and said that he didn't mean for it to come off as harsh as it did. He just felt like we needed to hang out more because Hes unsure about how he feels about me. Proceeded to give a excuse about some shitty news/drama with his friends while fighting with his family too at that moment. 
He said how he felt better after talking to me (on the phone) and that he will make more of an effort to hang out even if it was just for a little bit.

Actions didn't match up since after that talk he didn't reach out for 2 days. Then when he did, the message was kinda rude saying ‚Äú he was so busy with shit he had to do so he wasn't sending snapchats‚Äù and the conversation just was so bitter after that I left him on read.

I didn't talk to him for 3 weeks. 
he didn't reach out, even though he was liking my photos/watching my every move. Maybe i am looking to deep into it but I ended up unfollowing/removing him because it continued to hurt seeing his name pop up.


Brief version:

Is it considered ghosting, if you expressed beforehand your issues with your relationship with them?

Even though they ‚Äúagree‚Äù to make changes/put effort into changing things, their actions didn't change. So you ignore their last message/ left the lines of communication open with no outreach for 3 weeks. 
Ultimately leading you to cut them off completely.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psugle/is_this_considered_ghosting/
