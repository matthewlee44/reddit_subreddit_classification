In this app, the basic setup will be the same. Based on answers assessing compatibility, you'll be shown the pictures of those that the algorithm has determined are your closest matches.

You'll then go through pictures of those matches and rate if you're attracted to them in a yes/no manner. You won't be alerted when someone has mutually clicked ""yes"" for you. There will be a reminder to keep in mind that attraction can change after an emotional connection is made so that people are hopefully rating based on attraction potential rather than direct aesthetic appeal from a 2D photo.

When you have been shown maybe 50 people who you've rated (and have maybe 10 - 15 mutually interested matches in the background), you'll commence in blind voice chats with them; you'll be able to hear each other's voices but not see one another. How much detail you want to disclose to each other is up to you.

She's doing her graduation (20) and I'm working (24). We met at the workplace.

Just like any other relationship, ours started off as a little shy, getting to know each other stage. Where we put out our best selves.

Over time, there's way more comfort but some disagreements and occasional arguments. We don't have a lot of fights but offlate, since the last 15 days, the fights have increased and are with way more intensity.

To give you a context, we occasionally slap each other lightly during truth or dares or general teasing (I'm aware it can come off as toxic)

Yesterday, we had a major fight. I went to her home. We were supposed go to out. We were arguing and I sort of refused to go out. She left her house. I was assuming she's gonna stand outside her house because she knows I'll come after her. But she actually started walking and went a bit ahead of her home. I ran after her. I was very angry and in a fit of rage I sort of pulled her arms and twisted it a bit (not painful maybe a mild inconvenience). 

As soon as I did that, I immediately regretted it and realized I had inherent behaviour traits which I might need to change. No matter, how angry, I can't let myself behave that way.

Surprisingly though, she was upset and angry before this. But after this incident happened, she became more happy and loving. I met her today and apologized and told her what I introspected.

She said something along the lines of ""Don't judge me but I loved it when you did it (the violence)"".

Now I've never been violent. It was this one incident which happened even for which, I regretted immediately and vowed to never do it again. But I'm curious why this girl actually loved it to the point of going from sad to being happy.

I understand it's toxic and usually our relationship is great. No fights, just happy and fun memories. But I'm wondering is there a way to change this toxicity?

Surprisingly when we argue and I try to be sweet and nice or sometimes show sadness, it doesn't impact her. But if I get angry and shout or like the violence incident happened, she rectifies her behaviour to go back to the happy stage which was ultimately what I wanted without the fights.

Then we chatted daily pretty extensively until our date the following Sunday. Really great first date. 5 hours. Dinner then a bar. Arms locked walking between them. Held hands at bar. Kissed at the end. 2nd date 4 days later. Stayed over at her house. We both repeatedly expressed we felt a connection for one another. Felt comfortable around one another. Our personalities meshed. Our humor meshed. Our affection meshed. Things eventually went downhill and ended after date 3.

But now I just get bored with other matches because there doesn't seem to be that immediate spark like there was with her.

I was reflecting on my dating experiences and just wanted to check in to see if my experience is normal or am the problems I’m experiencing just me? 

I’m a heterosexual male most of the girls I meet to date are from dating apps. I usually can get one or two dates a week but sometimes I’ll have none. Sometimes I’ll meet someone and we will go on one date then one of us (or mutually) will decide that nah, we don’t want to go on another. No big deal (even if they’re the one that doesn’t want to meet up again and I do - I understand that sometimes the feeling just isn’t mutual). Usually my go-to first date is coffee. 

Other times I’ll go on maybe three or four dates with someone and then they’ll usually decide they’re not interested. This happens the most to me to be honest. Sometimes I’ll even get ghosted after a few dates…is that normal? Other times they’ll just send a polite text saying they’re not interested. It failing after three or four dates is also the outcome that bothers me the most. Am I saying something or doing something wrong on the third or fourth date? 

Sometimes I’ll just get hook-ups or people who just want to fuck and that’s whatever. I don’t put any stock in those nor do I think about them too much on a “relationship” level. 

Occasionally, I’ll meet someone who wants to stick around for awhile. Sometimes it turns into something serious and sometimes it’s just a few-month-fling. 

Does all of this sound normal or what are the differences you notice in your own experience?

She replied with: „yeah… it was funny 🤗“

In the looks area they were far above me on the scale.

So things are going well and then I need a hug cause my card is getting declined at a place I’m at. I’m frustrated because neither card issuer or the business I’m at can give a answer other then pointing fingers at the other.

Finally got it fixed when a friend had me send the funds through a app where they then sent it in another app. Don’t know why or how that worked but it did. Took about a hour to figure it out.

Then I get a message that something serious came up and the person I was flirting with and offering kink level discussion on blocks me. Blocks me on not only the phone but also through here.

Like WTH, I need a hug cause I’m frustrated and that means blocking? I swear…can’t trust anyone who approaches me anymore.

The positives of doing this are that I am able to give one person my undivided attention and see how things work out. It also allows me to be more selective about the people I date.

The drawback is that each individual person then gets more attention from me, and I may come off as over invested if they're still dating around. If anything, my biggest pitfall in dating is that I get overinvested quicker than the girl.

So long story short, ive never really dated before. Every single person ive ever dated was a friend or classmate i knew fairly well, went ""you wanna be my partner?"" (Or vise versa), and we went from there. The only exception to this rule is one person i met on a dating app, who i was friends with for a while before we actually really went out or anything. Dunno how that happened but it did.

Despite my laundry list of relatively long term committed relationships considering most of them were during my teenage years, i dont feel like ive actually dated. None of these people i went on a lot of actual dates with for various reasons, whether they were LDR or the relationship had to be kept on the downlow or we were too poor to do things or a mixture of some sort. The only relationship ive been in after i became an adult was another LDR with a friend id been in love with for years, which wouldn't have caused that many problems considering I have a job and love to travel. But well, yknow. Covid. 

Hell, ive never even kissed anyone before. I dont know how to explain to the average person how im an adult thats dated so many people and have never been kissed. Im like terrified of making a fool of myself if I get to that point with anyone really.

Anyways, after a particularly bad breakup, i took a break from dating for a while and just let myself heal. But recently ive been thinking of putting myself out there, with never-before-seen casual dating. I mean despite me downloading dating apps here or there over the years ive never actually really broken my formula and went on a casual date with someone or anything, and i really wanted to. Surprisingly, after chatting with a lot of people i have like 2 people right now i actually want to go on dates with and kind of have a crush on. But i dont actually know how to approach any of this. I mean, at what point am i supposed to stop talking to and dating multiple people? How do am i supposed to know when it starts becoming inappropriate, how am i supposed to discuss these things, what do i do with the people who ""dont make the cut""? Also do people really kiss on the 1st to 3rd date? That seems wild to me.

Basically im just afraid im gonna stumble into a dating faux pas and seriously offend or hurt someone and my friends are no use because none of them have a lot of experience with this sort of stuff either. I seriously dont know how any of this stuff is supposed to work, and im 21 yrs old.

I am a 17 year old high-school student and I'd like to start with saying I'm not a pedo or any of the variations of pedophilia. Im attracted to guys my age and even older. I've found myself in a predicament though. In the beginning of the school year I noticed this cute brown boy but never gave him much thought after that. Up until last week he walks by me in the hallways and I had to look at him up and down because his outfit was just way too nice and he was looking way too good. I even broke my neck to look back at him again after he walked by. I've talked to him once in the beginning of the school year but it wasn't anything like that. It was about basketball.

Anyways, I'm on the phone with my friend who's an 11th grader we'll call her May, and she was talking about a friend of hers in the same grade that we'll call Priya. She starts talking about Pryia's brother and we have a small Asian population in our grade especially South Asian so I'm like ""waittt does he play basketball, curly hair, and dresses pretty well"". She says ""no he's not cute that's priya's little brother but he doesfit your descriptions"" and I was like ""no fucking way that I was right, thats her brother??"". I told her how I noticed him in the hallways and found him pretty cute to the point I broke my neck to look back at him and she was like ""he's 14...were breaking our necks for 14 year olds now?"". When I tell you I was mortified. I told her to forget I ever said that and ill forget about the kid but she's not letting that go and keeps making pedo jokes till this day. 

I geniuely forget about him until May told me she hung out with him because he left his phone at Starbucks so Priya took him to go get it with May. May starts talking to him and she tells him ""my friend thinks your cute, she's a senior"". She told me he got so happy and pretty confident about it so he asked who I was. May tells him I know his age and he gets upset at her for telling. He then proceeds to say ""tell her I turn 14 in September"". May told me he was texting her about me the whole weekend. I really hate May for this because she knows nothing could happen from this and yet did it anyways. 

I'm so torn. Me and him started texting on snapchat because I added him not with the intention of texting him. He sent me a streak and I sent him one back. He makes conversation and we talk innocently for about 2 hours until he asked what I looked like. I left him on open and then the next day sent a streak and said ""my bad, generally I don't have a problem showing face but in this case its not a good idea"". He asks me ""whats the case?"". I respond saying ""well I know your sister and you're freshmen"". I was going to tell him how I felt about him as well but I decided to leave it at that but it took me everything in me not to say it. Depending how close him and his sister are he can his sister and she would look at my snapchat and know its me. so I didn't feel like my high-school reputation was worth losing over a kid who can't even drive, parents buy him everything, can't get a job, doesn't graduate until 4 years, e.t.c.. I also didn't confess how I felt not only in caution of what he would do with that info but because if he was open to seeing where we go then it would be harder to walk away.

 Im glad I did the right thing. I just look at him everyday hating the fact that he's 14 and I'm a senior. If he was 15 and I was in the 11th grade (WHICH IM SUPPOSED TO BE IN) we wouldn't look as bad but still weird which I get but any senior dating a freshman is just frowned upon for all the right reasons that I understand. Im older than his sister which is also kind of weird. 

I know its predatory to wait till someone turns 18 since it seems like you waited to avoid legal problems and don't grasp the issue is more than the law which I wouldn't do since I find that creepy but if we met again after college would it be predatory, weird, or creepy to date him if there was a connection still?

Please, don't try to make this okay or say its only 3 years, its wrong not because of the age difference but the stage of life. Im not here for validation, just advice.

27F, been on and off the dating apps for years. I’ve complained to my mother enough and she has always reassured me that I just haven’t found the right one, been hearing this since I was 21. I feel like I could have been in a relationship or at least “dated” if I went for the guys that have pursued me. However, I got tired of the ones I didn’t like back approaching me and have decided to use bumble. I’ve met up with two guys and didn’t feel them either. It’s only been twice BUT like I said I tried the other apps for years. My life has always been the ones I want don’t want me back/aren’t serious and the ones that like me I don’t want back. My mom says that she really loved my dad and she’s been with her current boyfriend for years but I just don’t get the appeal of either of them (seeing them as if I don’t know them or aren’t related to them). She says she didn’t settle but I just don’t get how you aren’t settling if you aren’t physically attracted to the person. I do feel I will genuinely end up alone, rather be alone vs being taken and miserable. Not that this matters but I don’t really have an active sex drive, I don’t enjoy masturbating and haven’t had sex in years. I saw someone very briefly 3 years ago and while he had a decent personality, I wasn’t physically attracted to him.

He talks about her a lot, dropping her into conversation. They stayed friends and I saw she wrote him a card saying she missed him the other day and sent it to the uk from the USA. They talk a lot, over text and sometimes have a call (to FaceTime the dog too as they bought a dog together.) 

His Instagram is still full of photos of them both, with captions like ‘the love of my life’ and photos of them kissing. He never deleted them. 

He still likes all her photos.

He says they’re only friends now but it was difficult to become friends after the relationship.

He was showing me something on his Facebook the other day and I could see she was the last person he searched for in his recent searches.

Before the first one, I randomly added **the girl** on Facebook and asked her few things about the first exam - days later, she texted me cause she needed some info about our second exam. We never talked before and since we are using online meets - we never seen eachother.

   She texted me around 1 AM and after getting the info she needed, we started discussing our goals, what do we like/dislike etc. We texted till 4:30 AM when she wanted to go sleep cause the exam starts at 9 AM. Before going to bed, she gave me her number and asked if I can call her if she's not awake 10-15 min before the exam. **\[ I want to point out that she initiated the number thing\]**.

Also, after the exam, I went for a quick nap since I was tired a lot. I woke up and she had an Instagram story about that she's selling a ticket for a club event. The moment I saw the story - she messaged me how am I, do I wanna go with her on that event - I really want actually but I don't have money right now for it since the tickets are 100 euros + I need to get money for transport/food/place to stay for the night. I asked if she wants from me to ask someone who would be interested in it and she said ""nahhh whatever"" - **\[ which again I guess is a positive thing, since we never met and she already have no problem to go out with me on an event, and that she refuses to ask a friend who might want the ticket\].**

I've also pointed out that I have no problem to go with her on an event like that but I would prefer to buy tickets and plan the travel few days before that - on which she actually agreed and said sure.

Now, I don't know how I actually feel - I really like her vibe, good looking, polite, we have common interests but when we text she sometimes call me ""yeah bro true"" or something like that :D Does that already means that I'm into friendzone and she has no interest for even meeting or I'm overthinking it way too hard",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164495,public,self,"Started talking with a girl from university but she's calling me ""bro"" - is that drealbreaker if I want to ask her out?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/to9xtk/started_talking_with_a_girl_from_university_but/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,49223cde-abc9-11e9-b518-0ee41f1cd37e,dark

Been dating for over a year now and 7 months of it being long distance. (21F &amp; 20M).
I live in a third world country in SEA, been living with my family my whole life,I have barely gone through any financial struggles very luckily because of my family. He had to move to US for college because his family wants to settle in US and they sent him there first and he’s working and paying all of his expenses by working. 

Even though our relationship was shaky and stressful after it turning into ldrs, I love it a lot and I don’t think I can find someone as compatible as him. 

I’m stuck and scared to get out of my comfort zone and to close the distance. My family (except my brother ) doesn’t know I’m dating him because he comes from a religion my family is against of and since this is my first ever relationship, I honesty don’t know how to approach it to my family.( he is Muslim and family is brown Buddhist ). We have been stressed and struggling because I can’t close the distance because I’m scared to leave my family and work a lot to be with him and cover all of the expenses myself, and possibly getting abandoned by my family. 

I know I’m spoiled because I haven’t even worked in my whole life but I can’t help but get super anxious because going to him changes my life drastically. I don’t want to live in US because of how expensive everything is,plus crazy tax and shitty healthcare(expensive). He said he’d move to Austrialla after a few years for masters,but I overthink and get scared about everything going south. 

I can’t bring myself to tell my family about him because I feel like they’ll talk me into “you’re being dump ,don’t date Muslims .your life will be ruined” because that’s what they say every time I bring up something about them. I feel really bad for not being ready and strong enough to leave my comfort zone for him and not being able to talk to my parents about it. Bf knows all of it but won’t leave me because he hopes I’ll come to him one day but is also sad.

He’s not stable financially obviously and thinks we can struggle together and be there for each other because that’s all that matters to him.

I had a huge crush on her from the start and thought I fucked things up back then. I Reached out a couple times over the years with little response back. We finally started talking around the holidays last year and agreed to go on a date. 


We've been on several dates this month, first and most recent ended up with me staying a couple consecutive nights with her. She tells me she loves me in person/over text. It seemed as though she was trying to seduce me, but I resisted cause I didn't want to rush things. Later I joked about her putting the moves on me, that I wouldn't be able to resist. Her response was: ""I tried, you didn't seem to do much."" She encouraged me to touch/suck her nipples which I happily did. She is saying she isn't ready for a relationship which I'm not exactly either. She is also saying she doesn't want to have sex and is currently abstinent.

Planning to reach 230 lb by December, I think that'll be a healthy weight. I've been obese for a long time and it's a little difficult hard to see my penis because of the fat that surrounds it. Sometimes there isn't even any length when flaccid because that's how much fat I carry in my pubic area.

I made an effort to push all the fat down with a ruler as far as I could, like full force, when erect, and it was around 5.5 inches, maybe a little below. I'm used to only seeing it much smaller because of the fat pad covering it up (maybe 3 inches?) . I'm guessing that once I lose all the excess weight hopefully, I'll be able to fully normally see this length.

I read somewhere the average is 5.1 inches, but I'm not sure if that's true or accurate. But for a big guy like me, what would a partner expect? (don't plan on being in a relationship until marriage)

the last time I measured myself was 5 years ago when I was 17, and I weighed much less back then, albeit still overweight.
