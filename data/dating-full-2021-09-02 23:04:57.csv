We met two times.

The main problem was he didn’t know English and he would use translation to communicate. And in my life, I wasn’t up for putting so much effort right away (I’m not sorry for that). 

Long story short, the guy has been texting me ever since (finding new numbers and texting services, emailing me, LinkedIn, IG, FB). 
He’s been harassing me and bullying me.

He claimed he think I’m some spy sent by his home government to harm him. All of this talks were ridiculous and just a waste of time. 

Getting tired of this, I did try explaining to him multiple times that I am not interested. 
He’s said all sorts of offensive things to me, tried paying me to be with him.

How do I deal with this! He keeps saying he will keep texting me. I cannot change my number because I have a lot of things linked to my number.

Here is my little venting.

I spent my entire 20s chasing women(dating apps) and even in real life trying to spot signs a woman is interested in me. And 0 luck. In 10 years I haven't gone to a single date. Dating apps do not work for me. I had so many theories(you need to be a hot, extrovert, rich, famous, have a giant circle of friends, etc.).

And even one day, I approached a neighbor who was giving me a bunch of signs(smiling/starring at me whenever she would see me). I had a small chat with her one day while she was walking around and ... she was on her way to meet her boyfriend. I had numerous women show ""signs"" of interest during these 10 years. Like some women I've seen on dating apps, whenever we pass each other out of complete luck in real life, they start sending a bunch of signal(smiling at me, staring, look as if they really want to talk to me). It's as if they didn't thought I was real on dating apps. But yeah whenever I contacted them on there, they never ever replied to me. So obviously they were not interested right? Or were they only in real life?? So confusing. I had some ghost me after couple messages(and some even kindly telling me that they could sense after 2 message my personality and that we would not be good matches). Other women have even approached me at work(at least I think). Started opening with really awkward conversation and sending tips ... which I honestly completely missed if they were flirting with me hoping that I would ask them out. Or would they have just ask me out themselves? Either way, I will never EVER know.

Anyway the pandemic has been hitting me very hard. I don't even meet these women out of lottery luck anymore. I stay confined WFH and not meeting anyone. I guess I'm the only one with this problem with no friends with friends to date since I'm a hermit. I even cold approached women in the street and had long friendly conversation with some ... who only ghosted afterward. I approached quite a few who rejected me(banter not hot enough I guess). To me as an Aspie, it's mentally draining to try to hack my way into someone's brain to just get a slight interest. I work in IT and I see a bit like constantly trying to hack an extremely secure and well protected system ... so try to brute force my way in. Even if I get in one day, the next day I am sure to be kicked out. 

I definitely agree that the problem is me(I have ASD/Asperger) and since women's attraction is mostly social, they expect me to behave like a NT ... something that I will never be able to do well. So they seem to want to see what I cannot be.

&amp;#x200B;

So overall, I think I'm done seeing women as potential partners for a loving relationship. Because my entire prime years have proven me that they're just not interested/completely unreachable for reason xyz. I think from now on I'll just focus on keeping myself happy until I step in my grave lol. Even if that means playing video games in my room for the rest of my life. And even if that means becoming a monk and not have kids. There is 0 point in wasting my life salivating for something I will never ever get no matter how hard I try.

I don't know what a lot of the unspoken 'rules' are or how to interpret certain responses. This post isn't exactly about dating but it's within the same vain. So please bear with me.

I met this girl on Tinder almost a month ago and we were talking ever since. I felt that we had a genuine connection. We began supporting each other during difficult moments, made each other laugh a lot, and simply enjoy each other's company. We also had a lot in common. We texted every single day and would even send each other good morning and good night messages. I really cared for her and she seemed to really care for me. However, there was one thing that made things difficult and that was the fact that she had recently broke up with her boyfriend. She told me this and said that she can't really be in a relationship at the moment but we can be friends. I liked her enough to accept. It has been difficult for me to find such a great connection with someone that I simply couldn't refuse that offer. I wanted to continue to speak to her anyways.

We spoke for a while and she would even text me first a lot of the time. She asked me a lot of questions about myself and my life. She frequently asked me how my day was and wanted to talk to me about it. She would send me good luck texts before job interviews and asked me how they went afterwards. She would send me funny images and tiktoks just to start a conversation. I became really attached to her and wanted to talk to her more and more often.

One day, she asked me if I would like to meet up. I was obviously surprised and excited by that idea so we arranged to meet at a mall. She even made a list of things for us to do over time. During the week leading up to the meetup, however, I noticed that her texts became shorter and less frequent. It got to the point where I was always texting first. I shrugged it off and we met up on our arranged day. We walked around the mall and ate lunch together. We talked and talked for hours, it was great. I awkwardly asked for a hug at the end of the day but she accepted it. I texted her that I had a fun day and that we should do something else soon. She replied saying that she also had fun and that we it was a good plan! 

However, this was when things became different. The day after our meetup, I asked her how she was doing because she mentioned the day before that she was sad and having difficulties eating. She replied saying that she wasn't doing very well that day. I told her that I'm always here for her if she ever wants to talk about it and that I was sure she's going to feel much better soon. I said that after she takes a trip with her friend that they planned for this weekend, she'll be much happier. She agreed and said that she does have to stay positive.

The next morning, I texted ""good morning and remember to be kind to yourself!"" She replied ""good morning, you too!"" That was the last message she sent to me. She didn't reply when I sent her a text mid-day and she didn't reply when I sent her a goodnight text. Instead, she left the message on read an hour after I sent it. I sent her a good morning text and that I hoped she was feeling better. She didn't reply and instead left the message on read seven hours after I sent it.

I (24M) have been dating a pretty, caring and smart girl (24F) for 2 years (plus 3-4 years prior of “hanging out”). I really love her and want to eventually marry and make babies with her one day (probably several years after dental school at least. I’d feel bad if she worked so hard to graduate, just to get impregnated right after with no chance to work and actually enjoy being a dentist).

As a teenager, I was awkward and introverted and have never dated or even bothered to interact with many girls before meeting my current GF. I just chilled, hung out with friends and enjoyed life. No rush, right? I was young at heart. However, anyone with Asian parents knows they want you to have children ASAP.

Me and my GF got to know each other well from being lab partners which lead to countless studying sessions, and a discovery of shared interests - we both like watching shows, gardening, science, both wanted to go to dental school, etc.  This eventually (over quite a long period of time due my to shyness amplified by us both being inexperienced virgins) lead to me asking her out + cuddling/sex. This journey took YEARS.

This year, we both got into the same dental school and started making plans for packing and residence. By the end of dental school, we're both going to be ~300k USD in debt. This made me even more frugal than my previous already-frugal mindset.

I asked my GF to look for condos we could rent/share during dental school. I was thinking of a nice two bdrm unit close to campus.

Later, my gf presented me with a list of choices and I noticed they were all one bedroom. I outright said: ""that's smart, we can save even more money since I can sleep on the couch.""

Moral of the story:
I'm a fucking idiot where dating cues (or almost anything unrelated to science) flies over my head, I have no pickup lines, and my only natural interaction with a girl occured because I got randomly paired up BY THE TEACHER. I still got a gf. NEVER give up and believe me when I say that it's never too late. Just be yourself.

I kind of got into a bad funk over it and ignored him for a good while, but in the same week I stayed home one day bc I was feeling not the greatest mentally and he messaged me and asked me if I was feeling okay. At first this made me mad bc I feel like I don't know what he wants from me and honestly I don't know precisely what I want either. I don't know if he wants to JUST hook up or if he's trying to get into a relationship or what. I genuinely don't know.

I guess what I'm asking here is what should I do to be able to talk to him without feeling intimidated. bc I wanna be able to take his compliments and not feel embarrassed.
What can I do to build my confidence around him?
What can I do to make HIM feel just a littleeee bit of intimidation and if not that at least butterflies lmfao I dunno

I am looking to give dating apps another go. I am 25 year old working professional in a great stable industry (healthcare). The only dating apps I seriously tried before were tinder and coffee meets bagel. Both apps I paid for all the perks and stuff. In coffee meets bagel, I did not get many matches so I stopped my subscription after a few weeks. In tinder, I got a handful of likes but I never got a chance to converse with any women because they simply did not message me back despite the multiple different approaches I took. In tinder, I got about 30 matches in 1 month (which for me is through the roof) but again, no conversations despite many friends (mostly female friends thinking they could help me out) giving me advice in what to send as a first message. Both apps by the way, I would probably get 1-2 matches a month when I was not paying for extra perks. I have used other apps such as cupid, bumble, etc, but no matches. So my question is, whats the best app that seriously works? I am 25 and never had a girlfriend and to be honest, I am desperate for a partner. I only been on 1 date in my life (5 years ago) and that girl ghosted me after I told her that I did not want to have sex with her because we both recently just met at the time (looking back at it I should have slept with her because I am still a virgin even though I want sex). 

The reason why I am coming to you guys here on reddit is because I want unbias help. The other day I was with a group of friends (3 girls who are literally like family) and they spent about 20 minutes talking about my dating life and wondering why how a guy like me is single my whole life.

This is my first time ever asking a girl out which is why it’s taken a while to build up my confidence, and she’s also my first crash.

In the first week: 

Firstly we were in a group watching friends. The theme song comes on and she starts singing it and pointing at me. I’m so confused and then she saids this song has the potential to describe us. I couldn’t even response because I was so in shock plus I didn’t know the lyrics. I don’t even watch friends. Went home and I searched the lyrics and the lyrics seem very romantic it’s talking about always being there for each other etc. I don’t watch friends so at first I though she might have been trying to friendzone me but after reading the lyrics I think she was hinting at romantic future between us. 

In the same week I was in a room with the girl I like and 2 other people. I was talking to these two people and the girl was cleaning. I then tell a story about how this random girl approached me and complimented my hoodie and asked for my snap. This girl completely stops cleaning and I see her watching me as I’m telling this story and she frowns her face so he’s obviously infested in my other interactions with other girls otherwise she would have kept on cleaning as for the previous topics she never showed any interest and never stoped cleaning to listen once till I brought up another girl. 

She also told me we have never been on a date when I asked her a question about the date (day month) which she misunderstood for a Romantic date and she really seemed like she wanted me to ask her to one she didn’t even seem in disgust. I was expecting a disgusted face and her saying eww we have  never been on a date before but she said it  so soft and sweetly and really seemed like she wanted me to ask her out. Sorry I know it was a missed opportunity it happen too sudden and this is the first time I like a girl so I’m bound to make mistakes and I still didn’t have the confidence to ask her out but I promise I will next week. 

In the second week: 

But then in the next week there is such a contrast of behaviour. 
We are in a room full of people and she saids she could never date Mediterranean people and I’m from the Mediterranean she was obviously sneak dissing me. How do you go from hinting to a romantic relationship with me to then saying  I  can’t  date people from my area in the space of a week.  

Then she saids some crazy stuff like I don’t remember where I spelt last Tuesday but I know it wasn’t in my room sounds like she was implying she had sex. I’ve never in my life seen a girl admit to having sex in a group setting normally girls are very lowkey  about there sexual life’s since girls are judged more harshly for having sex etc. I truly believe she was bluffing and trying to get my reaction like how do you even forgot where you sleep in the first place. I even asked her where, how do you not remember and she give a cheeky smile and said I don’t know. 

Then she said she wants a boyfriend that has a black car which is obviously hinting at a specific guy in the collage that she occasionally hangs out with and he drives her in his black car. I hang out with this girl way more then this guy does. I literally hang out with her like 8+ hours a day. They have definitely starting to get closer though  which is another reason I have to ask her out next week before it’s too late.  This guy is Pakistan and she always looks at Pakistan models on Instagram so there could be some interest going on as he could be her type. 


Do you guys think she said all that stuff because she’s had enough of Waiting for me to ask her out and wants to create a sense of urgency? 

Could it be that due to the long wait she thinks I might not like her so has said those things to observe my reaction? 

Or worst case have I been friendzoned? 

I’m still ask her out and I will update you guys if you want.

Met a girl (7.5/10, smart, fit, active, early 30s, no kids, no ex husband). We went for:

- breakfast (I invited)
- then in few days to the cinema (I invited), and she suggested to have a walk after cinema to hangout longer
- then in few days she invited me to cinema (she paid) after which we ate supper in restaurant (i paid). At her place no kiss goodbye, only hug initiated by me, and she cheek kissed me
- after few days I asked via text if she's into hanging out with me anytime this week, she replied with positive and joyful ""yes""
- then next day she proposed to meet on Thursday, and I responded that it was my plan as well to met her that day, and I agreed (she wrote me bit faster that I planned to write to her)

... so far so good, now the bad part starts:

- she flaked 2hrs before Thursday's meeting (excuse was ""work over night to finish project""), I know it's BS and I answered one word ""ok"" and cut contact
- next day (Friday) she suggested to meet that day evening (Friday) but I already had plans so I sad ""let's meet on Saturday""
- she agreed on Saturday, and asked what we will do
- I answered that I plan to do activity ""A"" (it involved couple hours drive)
- she said that ""A"" is too intense and she asked to do sth else
- I answered that ""sure"" and I'm open for her proposals (to make her invest)
- she read my messages on the spot but replied after 4hrs she suggested to go to the nearby lake
- i read her message after 2hrs (i was busy with another friend) and said that lake is fine for me (with more joyful tone)
- she replied that unfortunately she already made another plans (I guess due to fact that I replied after 2hrs)
- I read her message and left it without any response (total silence from my side, not even ""ok"" this time)

So... It's not classic flake, because she invited me to cinema, she joyfully agreed to hangout, she proposed another term.

But... She flaked twice and I feel like her plan-B.


I know I should not react with anger/emotions. But I wonder what should I do on th 2nd flake? Is total silence always best? **Maybe telling that you find such flaking as lack of respect better?**

Should I had to:
- cut contact (as I did)?
- replied ""enjoy you Saturday""?
- tell ""we can meet Saturday or never""?
- tell truth that ""I don't like being your plan-B, take care""?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,985922,public,self,How to handle flakes - a specific non-standard situation.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ph0pcf/how_to_handle_flakes_a_specific_nonstandard/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

About 2 years ago I was in a pretty bad spot in life. Drugs were the main thing in mine and anything to do with them. And everything that they entail from giving and taking them. In my journeys I had been involved with this one girl that we will call “sam” for obvious reasons. Now sam had/has a pretty abusive boyfriend from what I had heard and well for one reason or another sam and I got together one day behind said dudes back in all honesty it wasn’t wahm bam thank you mam it was awkward and we were not in the best state. But it happened. Now is where it changes gears. About 2 -3 months ago sam hits me up saying “hey I’m coming back home ( or where I live around) for good and that I wanna hang out really bad with you” now currently I’ve been very solitary and introverted since I’ve been sober and I jumped at this thought and told her I’d love to. Times goes by we keep talking on and off until about 2 weeks ago when she gets back and during all this time period I’ve been trying to better myself in most ways. When she did finally get back we set everything up like where we’re going what we’re doing ect. Right. Well on the day we were supposed to. I get a text saying “ im dealing with some something rn I’ll text you when I’m out” with a picture of her. Now that was a week ago. Look idk what happened but all I know is that she’s liked my mutual friends pics since then because insta shows you and I was left on sent not even read lol but anyway I’m not really sad just kinda confused and I can’t talk to anyone about it rn and I just wanted to share it with someone on here. If you read all of this thank you. I appreciate it more than you know.

It used to be comments “oh i prefer no makeup” “oh i prefer your hair this way” “oh i prefer you in this hoodie”, maybe not too bad, but I’ve completely reformed to his “preferences”. 

We have been together about 3 years, started a few months before the pandemic. We’ve known each other longer. When beginning, he said he was getting a divorce and going through the process. I didn’t believe that because he wanted to keep things secret. I also began talking to others, due to not believing his answers and feeling like a mistress being hid. He has held that against me all of these years. 

Rewind to about January 2021, i found out he moved from one home with his WIFE AND CHILDREN, to ANOTHER. After confronting him, he says he’s afraid to lose me, that they are separated. I chose to believe him…flash forward to a couple months, she contracts COVID and for “some reason” is staying in the home due to being sick. I repeatedly asked HOW she thought it was ok to do so if they’re separated, and instead of staying separate then the children, he and his mother in law contracted COVID. —-side note, this mother in law repeatedly stays at the home to help him with “child care”, I’ve told him it’s inappropriate and he HAS to create boundaries. He says he has but they’re ignored. 

I am at a loss. I feel i have changed everything for him. I left a position at a job because he felt some of the interactions (talking to males is really what it came down to) were inappropriate. I no longer wear makeup, get my hair done, my nails done, go to the gym. He always has “advice” to give about all of it, or a “preference”. This current job i have, that he wanted me to take, is KILLING me. In every way. I am miserable. Absolutely miserable. But he says if i go back to the previous job, we won’t be together. 

We spend hardly any time together anymore, we are going on a trip in a couple weeks, i can’t tell you the last time we had dinner…

Am i crazy, or is all of this crazy? Am i an absolute fool blinded by believing he is sincere?
