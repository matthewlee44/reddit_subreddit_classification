Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird. 

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn’t... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest.

&amp;#x200B;

I\[25M\] met this girl \[25\] 3 weeks ago. We also had 3 Dates and at the end of the last Date I'd say I confessed her my feelings. I wrote that in that way, because I just told her, that I really like to be with her and that I like her very much. 

Because we both have almost no experiences in dating this moment was quite embarrassing. But I did it and she respond that she also likes to be with me and she also likes me very much.

Now we are planning our 4th date.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway the point, why I want to post this is the following.

I plan to open up to her a lot. I want to tell her what I feel and what I think. And in my head there is the idea to go a little further. She is a girl that doesn't write much (actually she hates chatting)

She is also quite busy at the moment. She works in the Kindergarden and this is closing in the next days, so she has much to think of and to do. Also her best friend marry this weekend and so she is on her wedding. And on top of that, her father has cancer, but in this case she doesn't seemed really bothered for now (she told me why, but for this post it is not really important).

So the last day I've heard from her was Wednesday. I asked her, when she has time for our next date and she told me that this week is full of other meetings (she is in clubs) and the next week she will go on holyday with his brother, but she don't know when exactly. she told me that she knows when we can see at weekend, but she really want to see me again. I don't doubt that, because the feeling I felt when I told her my feelings was real. I mean I felt that she also felt something. But this is not important for this at all.

I'm kind of an insecure person due to some events in the past. She knows that, and I already told her that I meet a therapist.

The reason why I tell you that is that I want you to know why I want to ask her how she feels and thinks about me between our dates. So I mean, I think very much of her. The whole day, I want to be with her, I want to speak with her, and so on. And I want to know if she also thinks that way. And if so, I want to know why she doesn't have the need to write with me.

But I'm afraid this could sound a bit creepy or so. So what do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

As I said I'm pretty inexperienced but I'm also very curious and want to know as much as possible. Therefor I also plan to ask her what was wrong with the dates before me (she had 2 or 3). I just want to know why it didn't work out for them. Is this a question for the 4th date, or would you wait with that?

Throughout all that time, I’ve tried my hardest to send first messages the way women’s prompts ask me to. It almost always ends with them ignoring me or giving me 1-3 word replies to the point where I can’t carry a conversation.

I’ve also been subject to male scammers attempting to scam money out of me by pretending to be girls. And then there’s been people who have just wanted to sell me nudes or get me to follow their insta.

This accumulating for years has made me really tired and honestly giving up on OLD and just dating in general. So I’ve just started messaging people with 1-3 word messages for the hell of it. Well, this woman (early 30s) responded to my hello and took control of the first part of the conversation. She started off by complimenting *me* which caught me completely off guard and started talking about things *i like* which also caught me really off guard in a good way.

Anyways after a few days of talking, we’ve been discussing when would be a good time to meet up between our schedules and it makes me happy about this meetup. She’s made it clear that she really only wants to hook up because she has no time for dating and honestly I’m fine with that. I’m just happy to have met someone like her.

So I guess the 3 reasons why I’m posting this to a bunch of strangers is this:

1) Shy girls or girls who don’t think they can do anything with some opening message, don’t be afraid to look over his profile and try to take over the beginning of the conversation there and see if he’s worth talking to. *Sometimes* guys start off with short first messages because they’re unsure if they’ll get a response and they’ve probably dealt with rejection for years and just have ran out of hope/energy to keep putting in the same effort at first.

2) Guys, if the aforementioned has happened to you, keep trying. I know you’re tired and hopeless but you might find someone who’s just as understanding. Also, don’t be rude or salty to women. You just have to pick yourself up and keep moving.

3) I’ve really got no one to talk about this to so I just wanted to get this off my chest that I’m feeling pretty happy right now.

We have gone on multiple dates since and they were all great. Our last date just gone was also good, but i sensed underlying tension of something on her mind.

I have since messaged her the day later restating my position on us, and that despite distance, I really like her and want to give things a shot.

But the main part is…

We got together just before COVID started and met through a friendship group when we were both 17/18. Due to lockdown restrictions we decided to stay together at her house with her family. Now that restrictions are easing, it has become apparent that she suffers from severe separation anxiety when I’m apart from her (which is very little). This also isn’t helped by the fact she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression early in the relationship.

I’ve been very patient and caring towards helping her go through this rough journey (I’ve been told by her parents that I’ve helped a lot) but after a year it gets overwhelming. There are times when she’s going through a panic attack where she says she wants to break up or doesn’t love me which really hurt me. As she goes through this I feel less of an equal in the relationship and just a helper so my feelings are pushed aside.

But when she’s not in that state she can be really kind, caring and I really do love her. It’s just hard to deal with, especially when you can barley get anytime to yourself (due to her separation anxiety)

The worst part about if I was to break up with her is that she’s said on multiple times “You’re the only thing I care about” or “she doesn’t know what she’d do without me” and stuff basically saying if we broke she’d kill herself (I’m 99% she would). This puts a lot of pressure on me and causes the relationship to become toxic.

So, I’m curious to see how you all dissect this recent interaction. Am I hopeless? Should I just give up and get used to being alone? 

So, there’s this really attractive girl who works at a store that I frequent every so often; we would often lock eyes and I can certainly feel the connection….Before you roast me, I’m not an absolute psychopath— I’m well aware that not every girl you lock eyes with wants to date you… lol but THIS… This was real! Lol I can feel the tension and I’m almost certain that my perception of this scenario was 100% valid. Either way, being lame and awkward, I never really built up the courage to continue conversation outside of her work. 

Anyway, today was the first time I’ve been to the store in about a year. When I went back in, I was coming down the aisle and bumped into her. She didn’t say anything and was giving me that same “vibe”. So, I said “hey”. She said “hello”, but didn’t give any indication that she remembered me…. I don’t believe that I’m a memorable guy and can safely assume that she’s seen thousands of men since the last time I saw her… 

So, my question is— based on what I described, do you believe that she just puts herself out there a lot? Or am I “special” and she remembers me? Lol the reason I ask is because if she casually “eye-bones” every dude who goes in the store, then I don’t want to pursue her. In the unlikely scenario that I’m special, then I want her to be my wife. 🤣

But fuck, man, it's just constant failure.

One girl I've had a pretty good thing going until she started calling me friend and basically ""friend zoning"" me, as much as I hate that word. I had been pretty clear about my attraction to her so this was just her nice way of rejecting me. No hard feelings

Then another girl I talked with and asked out. She said no because she was out of a relationship, but maybe she'd come back in a few months with a changed mind. She probably won't

Then there is another one that I matched with. I don't get a lot of matches, and I try to avoid putting too much stock into them, but this one in particular was a girl that is 100% my type, and a person I actually know (through mutual acquaintances) is very cool. Since the match was on Bumble, she had to message first. She didn't. She had her Instagram on her bio so I tried there. No response

Another one asked ME out after we had some very nice conversations and then just stopped responding. When I asked her what was up a week later she told me she was talking with her ex girlfriend again. Hasn't said anything since

This was just in the last 3 months

Another girl I matched with, we were both in the same place for a day, and conversation was going well. I asked her to go for a beach walk (middle of the day, very public beach) and she said she couldn't because her parents would mock her (???). She's 21 years old by the way

It's not really about the rejection. I've learned to handle the rejection part and don't hold it against them. But to just keep trying and failing is incredibly demoralizing. It's come to a point where I feel more dread than excitement when I meet someone new. I'm usually just waiting to see what bullshit is about to happen

The truth is, I have been rejecting myself this whole time. I have not taken any time to step back, look at myself and ask: ""Would I want to date me?"" 

I've never been told I'm horrible, but that's not my point. I guess I never asked myself how I come off to other people and it dawned on me recently. Right now I am probably one of the least confident people anyone would know. That has to change. 

The idea of a hookup has 0 interest to me and I will always maintain that. I don't judge the concept, it simply is just not for me. I am a very emotional man and that would not be suitable for me. 

I have hung onto the fact that I'm still a virgin and just want to have someone there, when you see your mates with partners around you, it really makes everything seem so lonely.

The items are in the order in which they came to my mind, so kinda in order of importance but not necessarily. Here is the list:

* Smart (ideally like me or more), not necessarily academically speaking but rather in a more general sense
* Not afraid to speak her mind
* Honest
* Trustworthy 
* Strong character, challenging at times
* Able to open up and share stuff
* Wanting to have a close relationship and work for it (e.g., making sacrifices, being there when needed), but also not clingy
* Idealist but realist at the same time (willing to follow her core beliefs while keeping her feet on the ground
* Capable and eager to get into deep conversations on a wide array of topics (news, existential issues, …)
* With common interests (e.g., snowboarding, mountains, music)
* Other interests to introduce to me and in part share
* Able to deal with my “dark” parts and help me become a better person, and stimulate me constantly
* Cute (duh)
* Similar view of the world but not exactly the same
* Able to handle arguments, misunderstandings or the like in a mature way
* Communicative
* No toxic behaviours
* Aligned values
* Kind other people and ready to help them, able to put herself in their shoes, but not a fool/naive 
* Willing to be physical 
* Funny and able to tease in a clever way, have great comebacks and so",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,903954,public,self,I made a checklist with the things I’d like in a partner,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omfwj0/i_made_a_checklist_with_the_things_id_like_in_a/,all_ads,6,,,

Not once. But i can whole heartedly say we have always felt an attraction between us. However, she did have a boyfriend that entire school year. And he was clearly not a good guy for her, it didn’t work out at all but they did manage to get 10 months out of the relationship before it was over. 

After their breakup, we talked and spent a lot of time getting to know each other. It turns out that we click. Completely. She ended up telling her family and friends about me, and it looked like maybe something might happen. I was extremely excited for this girl.

But then, it just stopped. She said we needed to slow down, it felt like TOO MUCH of a relationship to her. We never really did anything over the top. We kissed a few times and held hands. That was it. 

And then she said she wanted space. She didn’t know what she wanted. I said okay, and since then i have given her what she’s wanted. Since i didn’t know how she was feeling or what i should be doing, i just asked her… “are we still this thing for now?”

She replied, 

“If I’m just being honest, i think we should just be friends from here on out. We’re just not on the same level and i just realized i JUST got out of a relationship and I’m now realizing where my heads at with that. I just want us to be friends.”

Clearly this isn’t about me but she’s not over her ex. And i know for a fact they aren’t seeing each other. So what the hell should i be doing? I’d love to wait on her because she’s only been out of this relationship she had for only a couple of months. But she said friends from here on out? I don’t get it. She was really into me. But it seems she’s still more into her ex.

I ( a 20 y/o f ) have a s/o  ( a 25 y/o m ) we have been “talking” for four months. We met through a mutual friend ( not a close one ) I knew from high school. I was looking for place to live and he needed a roommate. My friend gave me his information and we begin texting. Right way we click but keep it friendly with some light flirting. So a couple weeks go by of hour long Face-times about nothing and everything. We decided after a week I’d move in after my job transfer went through. At the end of three weeks I pack up and move 2 hours from my friends and family. I was excited and ready to be on my own again. I had moved out when I was 18 I had a 2 year lease that I just gotten out of I know longer wanted to stay in that area, so I moved back in with my parents waiting to find a new one. So fast forward two weeks in we eat dinner together play video games go get dinner ect. I genuinely enjoy my time with him. At this point I could tell that I was starting to actually like this guy. So I told him I don’t know what to do because I actually think I kind of like you and I’m interested in you. He responded saying he felt the same way and wanted to talk. So we are now being more upfront and flirting constantly. A few kisses and hugs. Then a couple weeks after that we have seggs . I’m comfortable around him and with him. However, The first couple weeks we were talking before we did the do he still had tinder and had gotten a notification in front of me. Yes I looked over. sue me. When I asked why he still had tinder he said he just had forgotten to delete it and he didn’t touch it. I let that go but his behaviors on his phone are SUSPICIOUS.  If I walk up while he’s on it he will immediately turn off his screen. He does not open Snapchat Facebook messenger or Twitter in front of me. I’ve told him I think it looks weird when he does stuff like that, and he said it’s just to show me his full attention. And as for him not getting on those apps “I just don’t look when he’s on them. “ I feel like asking to go through his phone is a breach of privacy and I want to trust him it just makes me question I suppose. He doesn’t show affection I’m not talking PDA I’m talking behind closed doors. Aside from the first time we had sex he has yet to initiate it again. Every time we’ve had it after it’s been me. There’s been quite a few times that he said he doesn’t want to for various reasons and I can’t help but feel rejected. He doesn’t call me beautiful pretty or complement me really at all and it just makes me feel like he doesn’t really have physical interest in me as a person. I’m not trying to be conceited but I’m not exactly unattractive. Ive never had a partner so such little interest in me. Am I overthinking or is he just not into me ?

However i waited and waited and grew impatient. After our first passionate kiss, i stupidly asked him when he’s gonna ask me to be his gf. He then proceeded to ask me to be his gf and i said yes. As time flew by, i felt kinda off. I felt like i was forcing him into a relationship with me and was scared that he’d leave me (due to past traumas from my previous relationship). I told him maybe we should slow it down but ensured him my feeling for him has never changed. I told him to ask me when he’s ready in which he agreed. As more time went by we tried to communicate as much as possible. We fell asleep while on call. We both called and texted each other when we’re drunk. One day while on call, he asked me to be his gf again. This time since he initiated the question, i thought he’s ready to be in a relationship with me so i happily said yes. Strangely some more time went by, we texted and called each other less. I tried to spend as much time with him as possible but he’s busy with his friends and exams. I felt neglected but didn’t want to come off as clingy so I asked how much communication/how often should we contact each other is comfortable for him. But oh boi he had something else for me, he apologized to me and said we should become friends again. “The problem isnt you, it’s me.” “Im not in a right place to love you right now.” Those words he sent that made me paralyzed and numb. I wanted to cry but no tear was able to come out. He suggested to stay friends and we could see where it would go. This time i wasn’t ensured if there is even a future for us.

As a teenager till I was about 22 I had an extreme fear of people and touching, and steered well away from relationships. I met a girl who was here for a visiting my country for a few months and made friends with her and texted her afterwards when she left. I fell in love with her and she was always trying to get me to visit her but I let my anxiety control me and always found ways to avoid it, cause I was scared of sex, and the possibility of a relationship. Anyways she moved on from me and now has a boyfriend. 

I want to move past my anxiety and now a part of it is that I'm afraid of my inexperience without any good reason like being very religious or something. I managed to go on my first in person date this week set up via bumble but I think instinctually I steered it towards being more friendly and less flirty. 

I sortof feel like I need to get over my fear and lose my virginity and kiss someone but even with this girl I was in love with I basically sabatoged every opportunity for this. I have tinder and bumble downloaded and many have asked me on dates but idk if this is the best way. Maybe I should go to a club and use alcohol as a helper?

Women tend to be more emotional and romantically attached (even if we don’t want to admit it bluntly) especially after long conversations and flirting with that single person. And I’ve been the same before. 

But then I asked myself, why do I have to feel bad, or overthink when I am not even involved with the person, nor in love in the very first place? Sometimes, it’s just the attention and the ‘getting used to’ that we are afraid to lose, but not the person itself. For most part, (again, in my opinion), the feeling of being ‘not too beautiful enough’ or ‘am I not girlfriend material’ usually lingers in our head, resulting to self doubt and insecurities. 

So with that, I really think that girls should avoid focusing on one person alone. Continue to date and flirt even if you have that one constant person. Don’t box yourself, but rather look for other possibilities. If the time comes that both person finally decide to take it more seriously, then that’s the time to stop.

He’s been an extremely kind and considerate boyfriend. Very funny and responsible. Very simple and practical as well. He got notice of a promotion that would have required him to move across the country. Eventually, he asked me to move with him, and eventually, I said yes.

My reasoning: I have a full time job that i love. I love my state/area. But if someone as reliable as him wants me this much and is serious about me, then I’m willing to take the chance with them. I value relationships very much, and although I love my job, there are a lot more opportunities for another…and if it didn’t work out between us, at least I won’t be married and can move forward as I please.

So i resigned from my job and let my landlord know that I’ll be moving soon. (A very nice space for much less than everything else out here, in other words, in high demand). However, miscommunication got the best of us, and right now he’s finally admitting that it was because of his stubborness and pride. All this caused me to feel unsafe in our relationship (he ignored me alot due to his conflict avoidant nature). I became fearful of being dependent on him until i was able to get myself a solid job. 

Usually a reliable person, until he was ignoring me the day i needed to move out my place and move into his (at the end of the month, so that i didn’t have to pay another month of rent). We were upset with each other from the day before, and the way he handled it was far out of proportion to the situation: Me becoming insecure and triggered by some unfunny jokes he believed was funny, and me deciding to spend the rest of the evening alone in my place. Btw, i sent him a text an hour later explaining that i was sorry for how i handled it and left it at that cause i knew he wouldnt respond anyway.

So the day after the incident, i needed to move out the place, and he never picked up my calls or answered my messages. Blatantly ignoring me and this is someone who always has their phone in their hand. I refused to remind him or tell him via text that i need to move out now and to respond to me, because i refuse to believe that I’ll only get his attention if he knows im in a desparate situation. This is somebody im going to have to be dependent on for a while and i dont ever plan on begging or convincing them to put the shit aside for a minute and be present. In his defense, he didn’t know that I would have been moving out that exact day because of my landlord’s quick change of plans which i agreed to, but he would have known if he wasn’t ignoring me.

I called my landlord and begged to stay…(he was gonna collect the new tenant’s security deposit the same day). I don’t know how, but he agreed to let me continue my tenancy. A miracle to me in the moment. I ended up asking my boss if i can rescind my resignation but it was too late. But miraculously a week later, they opened up a new full time position in my department and a raise. The word blessing is an understatement.

I have these things back and i told him im not going with him anymore. I let him know what his neglect caused me to do. He’s terribly sorry and promises to work on his faults. Before all of this, he had bought me a ring without my knowledge until now. He always said he wanted to marry me. He told me today that doesn’t want me to pay rent and struggle with bills. He just got cold feet when he saw how aggressive I can become…(when I’m TRYINGGG to talk to him but he can’t stick to the issue or he’s clearly taking the issue or concern for a joke…i raise my voice, even slammed my phone on the table once). But i actively and intentionally minded my patience and tone after that, which is more than i can say for him who has never even acknowledged his faults til now.

After he came back, I broke up with him. He was quite upset. Later we lost connection. I never forgot about him because I really liked him. We were both very shy at that time though. Weeks ago, I got his number again and contacted him. We are both single, so we agreed to get back together, although he will be away again for almost four months in the fall and winter for his travelling and vacation stuff. We’ve seen each other twice so far and I stayed in his place for two nights and one day every time. Like before, he took care of me very well. He prepared foods, cooked, did all the cleaning up while I just sat down and relaxed, bought me snacks, washed fruits for me now and then, dressed me in his clothes when he thought that I was cold, and when we went shopping for groceries or walked in the neighbourhood or go shopping groceries, he often teases me or squeezes me off to the grass like a kid. One thing that surprised me is he very naturally picked some food I leftover on my plate and ate it (that food is buried in a bunch of bones). At that time, I felt that he is really comfortable with me. Not to mention, cuddling and sex were very good. He was very affectionate and passionate. Three years ago, we didn’t have so much time to be together, so in my impression, he wasn’t that relaxed before. But the same thing is that he is still a very reserved person. He doesn’t express that how he feels or how much he likes me. When I asked him how he thought about us, he said that he wanted to do it step by step. He showed me his younger photos but didn’t want to send them to me now. He told me that he would do it eventually at one point. Also, he told me that he would only share his early life experiences at some point and he never shared those things with anybody (I understand it could be a sensitive issue for someone, but I don’t expect he is so concerned with people’s judgement). He said because I spied on him so I knew it, but nobody else ever knew that except his boss; however, what I did was that I just googled him three years ago, which made him upset at me. Also, he told me that he has some friends but no best friends, no female friends because he doesn’t believe men and women can be real friends, also he doesn’t date anyone from work or his client.

Essentially my one guy friend sent me a text inviting me to go mini golfing one on one. Trying to be considerate I tried to let him down as easy as possible; emphasizing how I saw him as a great friend and brother but not in any other way. He says that it is fine but says he wants to call me and talk about it. I agreed, and he called me and during the call I asked him what kind of made him start to like me (I was just confused because I have always been incredibly clear with my feels, I’ve always said I don’t date within my friend group, I am not a flirt, like I was genuinely confused. We’ve never even hung out in person one on one before). And so he ends up referencing a time 9 months ago when I called him crying because I felt like an absolutely horrid friend because he had told me he liked my sister and I had told my other younger sister who told my whole friend group. During that call I was crying and apologizing and emphasizing how much I felt like a horrible friend and how I felt awful about breaking his trust. And apparently during this call is when he said he started liking me. To reference he had told me he liked my sister three days before this. Frankly I find this incredibly creepy and am put off by it. I have lost a lot of respect for him. Not only that but all the other guys friends have started messaging me mean comments about how I am not going to get a first kiss and want to increase a bet saying I won’t get a first kiss by the end of high school. They also all snap chatted me a message mocking me for accidentally scraping the side of another care when parking one time (which happened months ago and I left a note and every thing and still feel awful about). I’m just really hurt by my guy friends because I spend a lot of time with them and I really didn’t see this coming. Like they are putting me down to make my other friend feel better.
