I (23F) met him (25M) on Tinder and have been talking since then almost daily. It's the first person I'll ever meet IRL from tinder and I'm honestly a bit nervous. I'm very introverted, and tried tinder to get out of my comfort zone. 

I've had my doubts about he being interested (made another post) because he would answer with 1 word texts and stuff like that, but I guess it's normal after talking for a month without seeing each other, but that's going to change next week and I'm freaking out a little bit. 

I enjoy talking to him a lot, we share many things in common, we have played video games together and it has been pretty fun. I try to have no expectations, and I'll be more than happy if this leads to just a friendship.

But I want this first meeting to go well, he'll drive for 40 min just to see me and I was planning a kind of visiting around the city and some museums, and we'd go to eat something. Is that a good idea? Or is it too much? I mean, it would be cool to just sit and talk, but at the same time I want to have a backup plan in case we run out of things to say. I don't know, we haven't really talk about anything related to relationships, but it would be weird to talk about that to someone i haven't even seen in person, right?

We both decided early on not to see other people but we're not in a relationship (yes, that issue). Anyway, we've basically spent every day and night together since. Being with him feels so amazing but everything tends to revolve around him. He's getting the boyfriend treatment - helping him watch his dog while he's out of town, look at cars he wants to buy, we're literally always at his house, etc. So I invited him to my place and cooked him a romantic dinner and bought him a dozen roses, etc. only to hear him take a call to plan his boss's bachelorette party in the other room and say he's ""just on a date with some guy, no big deal"". It hurt my feelings because I thought I was more than just some rando as I'm making this $150 dinner from scratch. Then his boss invited him on a boat and said I could come too so I said I'd love to meet his friends/coworkers and that sounds fun. Well, fast forward a month and I literally plan **MY** entire vacation to come home a day early to make this boating trip (excited to meet his friends) only to find out he never told them I said I'd go and there wasn't a spot for me. When I brought that up he gaslit me instead of apologizing or admitting he's not ready for me to meet his friends, which was a huge red flag. Then when I  was on vacation he always had to go when I called and never asked how my day was it what I did, etc. When I got mad, he accused me if being 'negative' because I was mad he didn't ask me about my day. One time I called, he literally told me he had to go to watch American Idol on DVR? LOL Like, what? When he was on vacation, and I was house sitting and watching his dog, he called me three times a day to talk and facetimed because ""he misses me"" which I thought was cute until now it seems more controlling than anything. The final straw was his best friend/trainer/hair stylist came over the other morning for a workout and thought I was someone else completely... so again I realized I've spent every day and night of the last two months with this guy and literally nobody in his life even knows who I am. He never talks about me, mentions my name, shows pictures to his friends? I don't expect to be everything but I didn't expect to be nothing and it's been a tough pill to swallow. He tells me he's terrified of merging lives and doesn't want to label things. I told him I don't care about labels but I expected someone who thinks I'm so great to mention me to friends occasionally. When I finally brought up my feelings after I got home from vacation, he was completely unable to discuss them. In his mind everything was going to be ruined because a problem came up. He tried to gaslight me into thinking I had the wrong dates, etc. We sat in the car and I said I think I'm gonna go home and he said it'd be the end if I go home and started to cry so I went upstairs but he refused to talk more. Just wanted to move on like nothing happened.  I finally snapped by accident and told him yesterday I'm not continuing to give him the boyfriend experience when he's made it clear we're not together and I'm a nobody in his life still. Every time I try to bring up issues he tells me I'm ""causing drama"" or ""precipitating chaos"" when he's just trying to have a nice time.

TL;DR I just feel like I've spent two months supporting this person, talking to my friends and family about him,  introducing them, integrating them into my daily life ... and then I realized nobody in his life even knows about me. Between that and the way he reacts to these discussions, I'm about over it.

I just can't seem to get over this girl i met a few months ago. I really don't know what to think anymore.

The story:  
22M, NW-EU, Master student in I/O psychology. Broad interest profile etc etc. 

I hate tinder. My matches are also usually nothing like who i would approach at parties in terms of type. It seems my type never likes me back on tinder but at parties and stuff i have no problems. I'm not very picky. But this is not a rant about tinder.

I matched with someone who liked me first mid december 2020, Russian girl, gorgeous eyes, gorgeous everything. She studies the same as me, can hold a conversation excellently, is interested in my interests and me in hers, i started learning russian etc. We seemed a perfect match.

We met up irl end of december, she stayed over, we cuddled and ""cuddled"". She said i was good at cuddling etc, and it was likewise. We also both confessed to liking each other personally and wanting to see where this would lead. She was everything i looked for in a partner and from how she described what was wrong in her dating life, i was what she looked for too. She was the first one that was better than my previous ex was (better in a very broad sense, i'm not comparing specifically, that would be bad of me).

Suddenly, beginning of January 2021 she started talking less and less due to family problems, which i understand. But not everything was alright. She still met with others, also other guys, but could never meet with me. She started talking less and less to me, not texting for days. I got obsessed, sadly, and this pushed her away more. Mid march we talked about it over text also, she had already kissed another guy and also said she didn't feel that comfortable about me anymore and was also just emotionally unavailable still. I understood and said i would work on it and not contact her for a while anymore. I proposed maybe we could try again when i was better and she was available again. She agreed but i'm also trying not to make illusions that this means anything..

While i am not thinking about her each second anymore, I still think about her about every day. I'm quite often in a melancholic state just carrying on. Not in a dip but also not happy. I'm honestly tired of it. I want to get rid of my feelings for her and the desire for getting to know her more and ""seeing where it would lead"". It feels like the one that got away and i'm always wondering what could have been (because as it was going it was sooo good).

What can i do? How do i stop thinking about her with every romantic cue? Why can't i forget for months what only lasted weeks ? My new matches on tinder, even if we get along, just make me think ""if only this was her"".

Within 24 hours they had shown me *everyone* available in my area that fits my requirements. Those requirements are: ages 26-36, do not want children, are not conservative.

This got me thinking. How many women who fit my requirements are actually available in my area? So I did some quick and dirty math:

&gt;Pinellas County: 975,000  
&gt;  
&gt;Women (50%): 487,500  
&gt;  
&gt;Ages 26-36, extrapolated from demographic data for 25-44 (11.5%): 56,062  
&gt;  
&gt;Percentage of women who do not want kids (7%)\*: 3,924  
&gt;  
&gt;Percentage who are single (51%): 2,001  
&gt;  
&gt;Percentage who are not Republican (68%): 1,360  
&gt;  
&gt;\*This is difficult to quantify. This number comes from Wikipedia and could be inaccurate.

This means that there are only **1,360** possible women who I could potentially date. This is, of course, before even taking everything else into account. Do we get along? Do I find them attractive? Do they find me attractive? Do we have similar values? Do they even want a relationship? Are they even interested in men?

So obviously the actual number is far lower—likely just a couple hundred.

This is interesting to me. I live in a heavily-populated area, but once you break down the numbers it paints a different picture. Obviously there are several flaws in how I've calculated this. For instance, there could be correlations between women who don't want kids and women who are liberal. But, overall, I think this is a fairly accurate rough estimate.

Hi everyone, I am just wanting to hear people’s experiences because asking around my friends, I seem to be the odd one out. When going on dates or swiping around dating apps or even meeting people randomly in life, does anyone else find it exceedingly rare that they feel tangible sexual attraction to people? 

It has happened to me a few times where I’ll just see a person and go “oh yeah for sure wow absolutely smokin” instinctually and be down to clown, or where I will feel this intensify after a few interactions with someone, but I feel like it is extremely rare compared to others!

Going on dates, I find I have a hard time feeling sexually attracted to people even when we get along great or they are beautiful or whatever, if that instinctual first spark of like, primal physical attraction is not there from the beginning, I can’t make it work! Other friends say “it comes over time” or that you just need to date around more, but I havent really found it to be so.

I know for sure I’m not asexual, but I’m just wondering if there’s something different in me because I feel sexual attraction (or honestly even horniness) so rarely!

I was too much of a nice guy (I flirted and complimented her a lot but never sexually escalated things because I thought she was a good Christian girl but found out that she likes sexualized ASMR by finding things about them online), 2.) I expected her to pay on the 2nd date which I was told by others it adds pressure on a girl and can be a turn off, and 3.) I gave mixed signals and hinted at dating other women on social media and started to go from ""My Beautiful"" and other cute nicknames that she loved to ""Hey buddy/Friend"" which has killed any and all contact and she's been distant.

What I plan on doing is reaching out again, and build up the sexual tension (I don't plan on sending explicit pics until it reaches that point where we're actually dating but I want to let her know that I think about cuddling, kissing, holding hands etc stuff that I wasn't doing before). I also found out that she's got a lot of self image issues due to growing up being an ugly duckling for most of her life (saw pics of her when she was young and nothing stood out until her early 20s), she's not skilled at her passions such as art (was also told to avoid describing a woman's art as ""cute""), and I've noticed she gives up easily on things from various observations of what I can find on her social media/behavior. So it makes perfect sense that she is not going to try to compete with other girls. Lastly if I get her to open up again, I plan on doing a date where there's no spending involved. 

The thing is, I REALLY like her. I have options, yes.. which I have been going for, but it doesn't matter who I'm with, I'm secretly wishing these dates and hook ups were with her. It's gotten so bad that last month and early parts of this month I've had a lot of romantically themed dreams about her.

I want him to lose it for himself, to add more years to his life and to enhance his quality of life.

He’s always checking up on me, always wants to talk to me, and he makes me incredibly happy. But I worry about a possible future with a man his size. He *does* want to lose the weight, and I do too, so part of me is thinking, “okay, this is good! We could lose the weight together and become healthier as a team!” but then another part of me worries that if the weight doesn’t come off, his quality of life will continue to deteriorate and the family and future that I want will never happen.

I’ve had guys been interested in me or like me and we will begin to talk but I will become very observant and find something I don’t like about them and just stop talking to them. I find it really hard to be romantically interested in someone as the last person I completely liked was almost 3 years ago and even before than that person it was almost 3 years beforehand again. 

This may sound strange but I can get quite defensive when a guy says something to me specific, I can’t think of a good example but if a guy asked me why I wasn’t asleep yet I’d get really annoyed and tell them that they aren’t my dad and don’t tell me what to do.

This may not be the typical i need advice post that starts like this. Because I am the definition of an alpha: power, success, looks, great body, charisma, money, hardwork, ambition, self-made, you name it. From an entirely unbiased point of view, most girls would like to get involved with me and I should be able to get any of them. In fact I am constantly recieving lots of attention and here comes the issue: every single time I have to politely refuse them. It's like my brain freezes and tells me to decline immediatelly. The main reasons for this are in my opinion: the very high standards I have set for a potential life partner and my selfishness (for example, I am almost disgusted by the thought of sharing half my bed with anyone), fear of letting someone get so close to my true self and eventually disappointing them. Yet I want a life partner to love, treat like a queen, and support each other. I know it sounds conflicting and it is frustrating not allowing myself to do anything romantic. It's literally just a mindset issue and I don't understand why this is happening.

I have been more sexually active with guys - still rarely, just nsa stuff. I consider myself bisexual, even though at this point I questioned it a lot because of my lack of experiences with girls. However I still find females generally attractive, I desperately want many children and a family; the fun dates with the guys are happening just for sexual release of my needs. I am less selective with them because I know it's not going to be anything serious.

I guess you really can't have it all. Remember to be grateful for your dear ones.

We messaged for a few days, then she just disappeared abruptly. No worries, it comes with the territory of online dating I thought and continued to match with others.

A week later she re-appeared out of the blue, apologising that she'd been super swamped at work, and asked if I'd be up for an impromptu date the next night as her friend couldn't make a booking she had. I had nothing on so decided to go with it and we hit it off immediately. The chemistry was off the charts, sparks were flying and we kissed at the end of the night.

We had a second date a week later which, again, went extremely well. We spent hours walking through the city and getting to know each other. We were laughing, having deep conversations and kissed a few times. The only awkward part came near the end when she asked how I was finding the dating apps as she's new to them and if I was talking to others. The question took me by surprise, especially on a second date, and I ran off with my answer mentioning that I'm looking for a relationship and how I tend to narrow my focus on those I connect with.  I sensed some awkwardness on her side, but chalked it up to tiredness as we've been walking for almost 4 hours at this point. I walked her to the train station where we kissed goodnight and she texted me when she got home thanking me for a fun night.  I asked her if she wanted to do something the following weekend and she left me on read.

I didn't get an answer until late afternoon the next day. She let me know that she had a lot of fun and a fantastic evening, but wanted to be upfront that she had a date planned with someone over this weekend. She wanted to be clear as to not mess me around and understands if I wanted to leave it here since she wanted to be honest and straightforward.

I let her know that it's totally fine and a normal part of dating, you're trying to figure out who you connect with the best at the end of the day. I let her know I'm also seeing other people as well, but I also like hanging out with her and getting to know her. After some banter, we planned a third date.

I can't help but feel it was such a strange text to receive after a second date. I understand that generally everyone dates around, especially at the start, but the text just makes me feel like I'm competing now with other people and not sure how to gauge the third date and beyond this?

For the first day, we had dinner and then went for a walk. For our second date we went to a movie.

This girl and I are both divorced and we both have kids. We have really connected over how some strong parallels of both of our divorces and it also just so happens that they both occurred around the same time last year.

After our first date, she told me that the kissing wasn’t great. She likes the more gentle soft kisses, where I as I was giving her some tongue. She called me a couple days after our second date and told me there was no romantic spark between us. Other than the kissing, we clicked during our dates and the conversation was great and we stayed out late.

I know she is into me, or she wouldn’t have told me some of the things she did about her prior relationship. And the fact that she wouldn’t have told me that I would need to meet her ex before I could meet her kid. Or talk with me about meeting her dog.

I didn’t know how to respond after she told me she wanted to end things over the phone, so we basically just wished each other the best of luck. She basically told me there was no romantic spark between us, and I am almost 100% sure that it was due to the kissing. The next day I sent her a text telling her she didn’t need to reply but that I still thought she was a really great person and thanked her for going out with me.

I have a couple questions:

The first being how do you make a kiss more passionate and ignite that romantic spark? Is it just one of those things where you have to learn each other’s preferences? Or are there other things I can try?

My second question is would it be appropriate to give her space for a few weeks send her and let her with how I feel and Tell her dad I know I need to work on more passionate kissing and ask if she would give me another chance to do that. Her birthday is coming up in a few weeks, so I thought I’d send her a card and then leave a letter with how I feel inside of a card. Are there things I should say or things I should not say?

I have noticed him checking me out at the gym and I think were both masculine but shy types. Finally, I decided to drop a major signal. As I finished lifting and while he was on the treadmill directly left to me I instinctively gave him a come hither look and lo and behold he was looking directly at me. 

It worked. He approached me and asked to use the equipment next to me. I said it was okay but because KNOWS it is usually part of my workout asked if I was sure. I flirtingly assured him that I was and I can just use the one next to it. We kind of looked at each other deeply in the eyes. And then he said he can just use that one instead and we smiled. (He never actually used the equipment, by the way)

Before he left, he said ""goodnight, man"" and I said have a good one and smiled. I thought it was a great ice breaker after weeks of just eye contact. I couldn't wait to see him again. And then poof.... he totally disappeared. It had almost been two months. I figured perhaps he might have been in a relationship already, or was confused, or scared, or didn't like our interaction. Who knows. But I had let him go even though I  was saddened by it all.

Until yesterday... there he was across from me in the lockers. I thought I had moved on and I have been talking to other guys. I didn't realize how hurt I was by him... ghosting me after what seemed like a promising encounter? We don't even know each others names! Yet, there he was and I simply ignored and turned my back on him. I didn't know how to react but my feelings were resurfacing and I haven't been able to stop thinking about him.

Kissed on 5th, told her I was interested in her on a non-friend basis already, she felt the same way but has stagnated since then.  Attempted further advances but she doesn't seem too into kissing me or being intimate. Accepted the slower dating pace because I am into her personality and have fun hanging out, she is cool, but feel like an orbiter at this point.  


She said she didn't use tinder, but saw her on there tonight - that's not a problem of course, I am on there too and was browsing out of boredom. But if we are both on there at this point, probably a bad sign right? It's a shame, because we have phenomenal chemistry, not one awkward silence on 8 dates!  


Seeing her tomorrow. My plan is just to see how it goes, and make my intentions clear that I want to take it up a notch (which obviously means sex, intimacy with a view of moving into something serious). Asked her if she is interested in that straight up or not, if she isn't I will say it is has been fun but it's time to call it a day.  


I take responsibility for this though. Haven't dated/kissed in 3 years after focusing on getting my life together. She is the first girl I have dated since then so my game is very rusty, and she is gorgeous so I have certainly been playing too safe not to screw it up.  


Wouldn't want to cancel it by text, that's not me. I know we will have fun on the date tomorrow but want to move things forward. Does this seem like the right way to go?

Since my last relationship ended mutually over a year ago, I feel like I’m finally ready to look for something more serious. I’ve had a few successful casual flings that were mutually positive and I keep in contact, but I cannot find anyone that I meets my standards. No matter who I date, I always find fundamental flaws that hold me back from taking things to the next level. I’m always the person to end things, or feelings fade as quick as they rise. 

I’m wondering if anyone else is feeling this, especially in the pandemic when we’ve been forced to reflect on ourselves and what we are really looking for. Am I just unsocialized due to the pandemic? Used to being alone and comfortable staying this way? Or maybe this is a reflection of a deeper emotion?

Today I messaged the other person asking if it's still on, and she confirmed. We set a date, time, and place. I made reservations, and it was all looking good. Just now (a couple hours later) she texted me saying she just got out of a LTR and she's not ready to go out. To which I replied that I understand and the door will remain open for when she IS ready.   


I live in a place where people are notoriously flaky, so I'm not ***totally*** blindsided by this happening, but I am extremely disappointed. I have the best luck and worst dates with people who are opposite of me, but can never get it to work when I find someone that has similar qualities.   


Anyways, sorry for the waste of space post but I'm just sad and needed to type this out. Thanks for reading.

I've pretty much reached the end of my emotional line with dating. Online dating is my only option during the pandemic I find it soul destroying for all the typical reasons. Two people ghosting me recently has particularly struck a nerve with me, now I just want to throw it to the wind for the time being. I am craving intimacy and sex, but really don't want to hookup with strangers.

Last year I got into a situationship that lasted a few months. It ended with her developing feelings for something one else and needing the emotional headspace to deal with it. It was pretty abrupt. I had been trying to get some clarity on where we were heading prior to that to which she was vague but insisted she liked me. I was kind of stung by it, but it wasn't devastating by any means.

I want to ask this girl if she would be down for trying something casual, with no expectations of it going anywhere. I would honestly not be going into it with any sort of hope of it developing into anything more. I find her really attractive and I enjoyed the sex, plus we click on a lot of things personality wise.

There's a small voice in the back of my head wondering if this is a good idea. I am fairly confident she'd say yes, but the way I was 'broken up' with wasn't super respectful. That was well over half a year ago, though. Since then we chat fairly reguarly in small doses, maybe once a week or so.

tl;dr - Looking for peoples' thoughts on if I should try intiating a FWB with someone I sort-of-dated, but I'm on good grounds with. I would like some insight on the type of message that I should send too please?

We are in the same course and have been friends for a month. We don’t text but we Snapchat a lot. I slowly became attracted to her, but I thought she only saw me as a friend. The snap convo was kinda dry as I had no idea how to flirt. I didn’t have the courage to ask her out Cus I’ve been coming up with stupid excuses in my mind. E.g. I’m Asian and she’s Caucasian so she might not be interested in me, we have similar height so I’m too short for her, I’m too skinny, I might ruin our friendship. Also, I’ve never been in a relationship and have only been rejected multiple times, I don’t wanna be rejected again.

3 days ago I built up the courage to try asking her out but before I could do that I got a snap from her. She’s in bed and covered herself up to the collar, showing naked shoulders. She said she’s staying overnight at a guy friend’s dorm room. I asked her the next morning what did she do with this “guy friend” and she said it’s none of my business (shit, I was nosy).

It’s all my fault. I’m stupid to fall for her. I’m stupid to not know how to flirt (I was raised in a conservative country before moving away. My strict parents want me to be as “well behaved as possible”). I should’ve asked her out earlier. I shouldn’t ask about her “fun night” as it’s none of my business. My logical mind is telling me to move on but my heart and emotions are still attached to her. As a person that has never been in a relationship before and kept on being rejected, I feel like I’m doomed to be single forever. I can’t focus on doing anything these days. I’m falling apart.

TLDR: I fell for a girl but I didn’t have the courage to ask her out. She hooked up with someone and I’m shattered. It’s all my fault.

I put on there I was looking for something casual because reconciliation with my husband is not 100% off the table. 

I met a couple guys on there but I felt nervous to take the plunge but then there is this one super [extremely] hot guy who lived really close to me and wanted to go for a walk which sounded super casual and unintimidating so I took him up on the offer. 

I have a 18 month old child so my time is very limited. We hit it off and had an amazing walk and we talked for like three or four hours while I had my babysitter watching my daughter. 

We got comfortable over the next while to the point where I felt like I trusted him enough so I invited him over to my house once my daughter was asleep. 

We had amazing sex and long story short we started having sex every other day basically since then. We can’t really do anything else because number one I’m nervous about going out in public with him and being seen because me and my husband aren’t officially separated, and number two I don’t want him to meet my daughter so I could only see him if I had a babysitter which I don’t have very often, that’s why it works for him to come over after she goes to sleep. We usually have sex then talk and cuddle for like 3-4 hours. 

At one point earlier I thought me and my husband were going to get back together so I cut him off, but then about a week later it was clear my husband was still with the other woman so I connected with him again. 

I could tell he was super into me physically and emotionally. One night late at night after we had sex he told me how much he liked me and respected me, How he hasn’t  met any woman like me before ( even though he’s told me he’s had sex with over 100 woman :/ ) and he was saying things like we should runoff together, he said I wanna be with you but I understand why you’re leaving things open to be with your husband. He told me he wanted to get me pregnant, he told me he really liked me all sorts of things. At this point we text pretty much every day all day and after we hook up we talk for hours. I sort of just listened and cuddled him but I was nervous to really say anything. 

One night in the moment of passion I told him I wanted to have sex without a condom, he told me he didn’t want to do that if he thought I was going to get back with my husband soon, he said he would only want to do that if we were going to be talking more frequently etc... 

I told him I wasn’t sure if I was going to get back with my husband or not and I didn’t wanna lead him on so that we would leave it there. 

The next time we hooked up he was telling me casually about this girl from bumble, I got a little jealous but I didn’t say anything because I knew that I had kind of turned him down the last time. At this point I’m assuming he still on bumble and having sex with other woman. 

Another night we both said we really liked one another. I even told him I felt like I loved him I thought I wasn’t sure if it was just infatuation. He told me that he felt the same. Lately we’ve been hanging out like going for walks at the park we’re just hanging out around the city when I have my babysitter and or watching movies etc.

Recently I’ve told him that me and my husband are not speaking at all anymore unless it’s about our daughter, but he knows that it’s still open for reconciliation with him.


He told me he got a STD test randomly, then one night he randomly asked me if I wanted to have sex without a condom. I told him I would as long as if he was to have sex with someone else he used a condom, he then told me that he wasn’t having sex with anyone else and he didn’t plan too, So I told him cool me neither. 

No I’m 31 I haven’t dated since I was 18, what is this all mean. Are we even thinking rationally are we just and lust, are we friends with benefits? 

I don’t know if this is like oh yeah he’s really into you, If there’s any future here or if this is just a hook up.

I sincerely hate when you tell me something that I scoff at and it ends up being right. Okay, so congrats you were right ,fuck you. 

That being said, would you find it in your kind hearts to help a poor fool out who has been fucking up for oh... Ten years? 

So the most recent event first. I've been aimlessly looking to date. I've been alone after a horrible relationship ended at the tail end of 2019. And since I got back into the dating game, things have been shitty. After months of failure. Months of low self esteem. Months of pure self hatred for not being good enough. I was done. I couldn't do it anymore. It was turning me grey. I heard that fucking stupid sounding advice of ""stop looking and you'll find someone"" and I mean, are they supposed to fall out of the sky? That's dumb as fuck
 But oh well, it was my best option. 

I deleted all of my dating apps, cancelled all of the subscriptions. I was just done with it. I honestly felt way better not ten minutes after. 

Lately I've been on a kick of finding old friends from high school. Seeing how they're doing, what's new in their lives, whatever. I went through everyone before I came to...her. We'll call her Anna. This was the girl, woman now, that I never got over. The one who secretly held my heart, the one I still thought about years later late at night when I wondered where I went wrong in life. 

 I've held my heart out for Anna for the last ten years since high school, I couldn't help it. And the stupid thing is that I rejected her. (TL;DR: by the time she asked me out, her ex filled my head with bullshit about her, and also, she tells me I was still hung up on this other girl, but I don't recall, but maybe🤷‍♂️, so I said no) 

But over the years we'd see each other off and on. We hooked up two or three times. We hung out a bunch. And all that but the timing was never right. She was either pregnant or wanting to make it work with some other guy or I was moving across the country or just visiting home. (She's in MN and I live in Vegas)

It seemed as though our only chance was back in high school years ago. 
Until this last week. I messaged Anna the very day I deleted all of my OLD, now, you may say those two events are related, but I assure you they're not. 

When I say hi, she messages me immediately. It's been like two years since we've spoken, but it was like no time at all had past. We were back in the swing of things. And almost as immediately as I heard her voice my heart throbbed. 

She's single now, we're older now, still young, but older. 

And this is partially where I fucked up, after a few days of talking back and forth, I can't take it anymore. I sort of slide into telling her how I've felt. Now mind you she reciprocates the feelings, she says so. But in a passive, not wanting to get hurt sort of way.

Now partially I went nuts because she said she didn't like smokers (now I've known I needed to quit and it's bad for you and blah blah blah, I just never felt the motivation to) so, on impulse, I quit. 

So going through withdrawals and ten years of repressed feelings. I blew a gasket, and just unloaded on her. Ten years of love and self hurt as self loathing and keeping my heart to myself or dangling it in front of other random women only to withdraw it because, well, I wasn't as happy as I could be, I felt like I was faking it. 

Now, she's told me she wants to be with me. She lamented about wanting me there with her. She tells me she cares for me. She got drunk and was crying to me about being afraid of dying alone. And she made a comment (she got into witch craft... we're weird people) that it was funny how earlier that day she casted a ""love spell"" and I ended up getting in touch with her that night. (I should explain, I don't believe in mysticism, bit she loves that I'm a magician for entertainment and she's into magick ""for real"" lol) 

So, like, I have no doubt that the feelings for me are there. 

But she lives half a country away. I won't lie, to a degree we're both toxic people, we both have some really fucked up issues, but our weirds always matched. She ended up foreclosing on a house and due to Covid, she gets to live in her house another year. But at the end of the year she was going to move to AZ or UT, which is close to my neck of the woods....
I told her I wanted to be with her, but she says that LDRs never last, but to me, it's temporary. No matter what she does, to me, it'll be temporary, in my mind. 

She's afraid I'll find someone else, she's afraid she'll cheat on me (giant red flag, I know, but, I'm not dropping her again) 

She's afraid we won't click. Like we always, always, and even now do! 

How can we make this work? How can I make her feel secure, how can I try to ensure she won't cheat, I think she got scared because I overloaded on her. How do I fix that? 

I want her and I know she wants me, but we're both broken people, we're both afraid of getting hurt. We're both afraid to give our hearts away to each other. Because I think we don't ever want to think that this idea of ""us"" we've both had might not come true. 

But this feels like it's our only chance. And I don't want to miss it again. I don't want to fuck it up. She's the woman I've compared my other relationships to, she's the only person, not just woman, but person, to ever get me, she's the woman I've held myself out for, she's the woman I dreamt about for so many years, she's the only woman that has ever made me really belly laugh, she's the woman that made the love songs make sense, and honestly, if we got together soon and we spent the next year happy, getting to trust each other, start putting our lives together, making plans to get things to work. After the end of that year, she's the woman I'd ask to marry me, after ten years of flirting with the idea of ""us"" I feel it's about damn time we do it. 

So here's where I need help? Most immediately, I overwhelmed her today with all of my feelings. She didn't tell me no, she just expressed she's scared that it'll turn out bad. 

How do I come back from overwhelming her?  

How can I make her feel secure? 

How can I ensure she stays faithful? She says she does it when she thinks her boyfriends are cheating on her. It seems like an excuse but I don't know. I'm not dropping her. 

How could we make a long distance thing work? I'm planning to go up there in about a month. But besides that, we have a year til she moves out my way. How can we make that year work?

I don't know, there are probably some glaring issues that need to be addressed that I'm missing. So enlighten me. Help.

I've ""beat around the bush"" a few times with a handful of gals when I was shitfaced at parties or in clubs but that's it.

I've been talking to gal who is super cute, funny, and educated. I've never put much effort into finding relationships due to stress with school and work. I also used to be religious and didn't want to engage in pre-marital sex. When I do have free time I hang with the bros. My standards are also high as far as personality and I have yet to find someone who met them, but this gal exceeds them. I could probably get laid at a bar or make a tinder, but hit it and quit it ain't my style. I prefer to hit and commit.

So how do I bring this up if we get into a relationship or if the conversation turns to it? Should I not bring it up? And how do I not feel self conscious about my lack of experience when she has had experience before? She says she's only had two boyfriends, but she's a lawyer and works a lot, is under a lot of stress, and travels often so no doubt she's had a lot of flings. I just worry that I won't be good enough and she'll be unsatisfied. I can't help but worry about the guys she's been with who were more experienced and endowed. I've done some research (no not porn) of r/sex about what women like and have a solid game plan. I know confidence is important but it's hard when you're such a late bloomer like me.

When I was younger like most young boys I tried to max out everything I thought would attract women which included working out like crazy and maximizing my studies and trying to tweak my personality wherever I found flaws.

But I kid you not just simply allowing my body to grow has done more for my dating success than any of that.

Now that is not to say that people shouldn't self improve or work on things but physical attraction is very powerful.

Whenever I hear someone call me handsome or that I'll find a wife one day I kind of cringe because I'm still not used to it but also it kind of feels like all my other hard work did not matter.

A lot of girls say that they hate when they're guys tell them that they look good in anything or don't need to wear makeup, and to be fair it does come from an honest and loving place but to said girl she probably doesn't want to hear it because she spent so much time and effort trying to look good.

I feel like I'm going through something similar right now just the opposite to where I maxed out everything except my good looks.
