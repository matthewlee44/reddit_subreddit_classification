This is not for the guy who has trouble starting conversations and managing social anxiety.

Rather, this is for the guy who is intermediate and has conversations with girls, but not the conversations that he wants.

If you find that you struggle to keep conversations going and girls don’t invest easily, or that getting a girl’s number or a girl to go on a date with you is an uphill battle, this is for you.

Having girls want to interact and hang with you should be as easy as gravity is certain.

To achieve this, you will need to drop the good, to go for the amazing.

What do I mean by that?

Sometimes it’s easy to lose track and instead of approaching girls to get to know them, we get lost in our thoughts, and before you know it, we’re approaching a girl to impress our friend.

We can then later tell them that we’re chatting with her on Instagram and show them her pictures to see how hot she is.

But that’s not what we really signed up for.

What you need to know is that your value proposition is wrong from the start.

You are funny or cool or something that offers value upfront, and as an exchange for that, you ask for the number, and it’s only fair that you get it, since you offered something. 

But that doesn’t mean this number will translate and you’re not even set up to start the interaction from the most ideal place.

Here’s how you cure this: (video version here: youtube - watch?v=GU9SSD7Xsfo )

For a long time, maybe a month or two, you’re not allowed to close. You’re not allowed to move things forward. Can’t take a number, IG, can’t escalate on a girl, can’t try to have sex with her, nothing.

No agenda.

This means you will have to “burn” some interactions that otherwise would yield a number. Understand that unfortunately, you will never see this girl again. Be ok with that. You’re paving the way to the quality of interactions you want to be having with these “sacrificed” girls.

You also need to stop talking to the girls where you know they’re not investing as much as you.

The ones that only talk to you for validation but have no intention of actually making plans with you.

Yes, I know it’s hard going back to square one but this is how you will make room for the interactions you really want to be having.

You are still allowed to go up to girls, and have fun etc. In fact this is encouraged.

Your mission is not to give up. But to slowly turn things around and have girls ask for your number.

The first step is, like I said, not being allowed to ask for it yourself.

The second step is realizing you have nothing to chase for. Since you can’t get the number, there’s no chance for the interaction to go anywhere. So you must give up from the start.

And instead be there. Be present. Once all your cool strategies for eliciting compliance are not allowed anymore, and you give up, you will realize that the only thing you have is the interaction itself. You won’t be funny for the number’s sake. If you are funny, it’ll be because it’s genuine.

And once you start accessing that place of authenticity inside you, everyone will be on you like you have a magnet.

Authenticity is so rare that people can’t help but be magnetized to it.

Once you are in that position, you will be the guy the girl is trying to get to invest. And it will be your choice, whether or not you will do it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,838160,public,self,Exercise to get girls and people to invest,0,[],0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzq0ed/exercise_to_get_girls_and_people_to_invest/,all_ads,6,,,,,

This is just a thought I had on why some people do not get matches at all, and why others are finding dates all the time. My personal view on online dating, well dating in general, is that looks and physical attraction trumps all **(initially!!!).** My thinking stems from physical attraction, while ignoring personality and personal interests etc. I am not saying these are not important, but the truth is that physical attraction is what starts it. Keep in mind my entire post is about initial attraction and finding mates at the beginning.

Ok so:

Basically online dating just amplifies real life dating. In real life you have:  
A) A majority of people who are average looking  
B) Some people who are very good looking  
C) Some people who are below average looking

Think of the above as a bell curve. C is the left of the curve (ugly people), A is the middle (mostly people who are average) and the right side of the curve is B (attractive people).

The people who have the easiest time in real life finding mates are those in B. Those in C obviously have a harder time. I don't think it is controversial to say that some people just do not find many (if any) dating partners at all in real life. I know some guys in their late 20s who can count the number on dates they have went on with one hand. On the other hand, there are people who are going on multiple dates/week. I know guys who go shopping to find new boxers and come back home with a new number. It is what it is. Then there is everyone else in between.

Another thing to keep in mind is that men and women who are not getting dates in real life due to their below average looks are still attracted to other better looking people. I hate to use the number system but just to get my point across a 3/10 male is going to be attracted to the 7/10 girl, not a 3/10 girl (assuming he is hetero). Conversely, that 7/10 girl is going to be attracted to a 7/10 guy, not the 3/10 guy (again assuming she is hetero).

Now, why should online dating change any of this? Why would people who are not getting dates or attention in real life (due to looks) suddenly get matches and dates from online dating platforms? These online dating platforms are just amplifying the effects of the bell curve I described above. The real answer to why many people do not have any luck with online dating is because they are below average looks. It is that simple. The common complaints that I read above dating apps is stuff like: you cant filter well enough, I dont get matches, girls ghost after a match, etc. Some of these apps definitely have flaws and can be improved, **but for many these apps work.** I know plenty of men and women who get plenty of dates off Tinder. They are getting matches and going out and meeting these people.

When you are at a bar and see a girl you think is attractive, do you think ""gee I wish I knew if she liked football and jazz music"" or do you think ""I want to go talk to her and get her number"". Probably the second one. If successful, from there you would converse a bit over text and then go on a DATE to get to know her better. So why are we not seeing these apps like being at the bar? We don't expect the bar to filter out people for us... at the bar we just find/scan for matches and then do the rest ourselves.

So for those of you having issues with online dating, maybe you have to ask yourself: ""is it the app, or is it me?"" - I dunno, is that the harsh reality?

For a little background of who we are it goes as the following:

We will call the girl Jane (fake name): Jane has a very free spirit and has a wide range of sense of humour and she is very joke-y. She is in some sort of orchestra and travels through Europe and has lived lots of cool experiences. Pretty athletic and just a person full of the kind of joy that is very contagious.

Me: I don't know how to describe myself but here it goes: I am not the greatest conversationalist but I try to be a good listener and ask good questions. I'm a pretty serious person though I do try my best at teasing when I'm on a date. I'm studying at uni but I don't really know what I'm doing with my life and I like writing songs on my free time.

Anyways, the date went pretty fine but she told me she had gone to sleep at 6 am the night before so she was super tired but she just appeared to be bored all the time. On our first date she did most the talking but in this one she answered my questions and intentions to start conversation but there was kind of a lack of connection going on. I am going to be completely honest here: I kissed her on the first date and took it easy on our second date (only kissed her at the end) but she was kind of a shy kisser, like there wasn't much tongue, just the tip, and although she told me I was a good kisser in the middle of it, right after we kept going at it she stopped to tell me she doesn't really like long kisses. Her friend was on her way so maybe she just didn't want to be seen making out or she wasn't feeling it or she was just telling the truth.

Weird signals: At one point while laying together on the beach side by side she had her dresse's lower part uncovered so you could see her butt (she was wearing panties) and she bought it up. I didn't know what to say I just said something like Wow you really have all my attention now or something stupid like that. At another moment we were joking about something and she told me that she wasn't a good girl anymore because she wasn't a virgin. I had no idea how to respond to that, it kind of came out of the blue. And last, at the end of the date I noticed she wasn't wearing a bra. I don't know what all of those things mean considering she wasn't paying me much attention and left early, the date was supposed to end at 6 pm but she called her friend and they decided to meet at 5 pm (we met at 2pm).

Where I fucked up or things didn't go well:

I live in another city and I didn't get the chance to buy a bus ticket for my ride back because I made a friend on the bus and didn't know how to break off the convo to go buy a ticket so I didn't get any so when she asked me at what time I was going back I told her I didn't get a ticket but didn't explain why or anything. This might have led to her thinking that I wanted to spend the night or something. At one point she showed me a tattoo she has on a finger so I challenged her to a thumb war but she turned me down (and said that I already knew her trick so she wouldn't win). While laying on the beach a wave was going to get to us so we got up and grabbed our things but instead of going to another spot we went to the street. She didn't want to go get a drink. At one point she asked me what I wanted to do and I don't know why but I didn't think at all and just said half jokingly ""you know what I want to do"" and she said ""go for a drink"" and I said ""no"" and that was the end of it. Really fucking stupid on my part. At the end of the date her friend asked if I would come with but since my date didn't ask me I said no (instead of saying the better answer: ""it's up to her \*and look at Jane\*"" but i wasn't thinking straight.

Where I really really really fucked up (its the second call not the first). I called her one hour later to say goodbye because our goodbye was kind of lame and short it was like this super short hug with little to no affection. So I say goodbye and stuff and I ask how to hitchike because I missed all my buses. An hour later I text her if I can ask a serious question and she says tell me. I call her and say it's going to be kind of a speech and say the dumbest, most desperate, intense shit a guy could say on his second date, something along the following ""hey so I'm trying to not overthink things here but I can't help but feel that something was off today so I was just wondering if you could tell me if you had a good time, things you liked things you didn't. And just be honest about it even if you have to be mean."" I think it was even longer but luckily my memory is garbage. She said something like ""I think you are overthinking and have too many expectations. I had a really great time and hope you did too, you should just be happy for what it was"" and some other stuff I don't remember but you get the picture.

Anyways, I'm feeling super shitty and depressed right now. I know that makes me look emotionally immature, needy, desperate and what not but it's the truth. I really really liked this girl and would love to see her again. She left yesterday to another city (our date was the day before that) and she comes back in august.

She responded with an abrupt ""have fun"" and I checked my WhatsApp this morning and she had blocked me.

Wtf?

Update:
I ended up texting her as I had her number and found out the reason she blocked me on whatsapp. It was something that I didn't expect and didn't mention above.

*What are the expectations in establishing that I'm looking to be casual and non-exclusive?*

*Additionally, I'm awkward and anxious so idk how to make moves and to end things with tact, so any help there would be appreciated, but that's technically something else.*

\-------

&lt;rant&gt; I (27M) am very much new to dating in general, having only really tried giving it a go last year. First person I spoke to and tried being serious with was actually kinda crazy, so that ended. Second person and I were talking but not yet in a relationship, but we just didn't work out. Now I'm kinda trying to figure out stuff like my sex drive/comfort, how long I may reasonably be interested in someone as I feel like it quickly wanes -- mostly like ""fuck it, things are confusing and I don't really know if I want to seriously date atm, so I'll be casual.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Main stuff**

*On stating that a given relationship is casual:*

Firstly, on the handful of apps I'm using, I outright say on my profiles/bio that I'm not looking for anything serious. Be forthright with it because why not? That way, if someone's interested in me then they should know my intentions from the get-go. How do I best deliver that if it's someone I meet in person? I get anxious at the idea of keeping it ""hidden"" for so long, so I feel compelled to just say it ASAP, but then that becomes potentially 2much2soon and isn't that appealing, and it's kinda presumptuous of her intentions. However, I just feel like getting to know someone for X dates to then find out that we're looking for different things is just time wasted and unnecessary potential sadness (which is presumptuous of her feelings, but is the safer route, imo).

&amp;#x200B;

*On letting it known that there may be many relationships with others:*

I had matched with a woman and we had met up. I said again in person that I'm not looking for anything serious because reasons, and we ended hooking up a few times. We had both said toward the beginning that we're not seeing anyone else because \_there's a pandemic, y'all\_. Eventually I asked her whether she would prefer that I continue not see anyone else during this time as to not put her at risk, as this was before we were vaccinated. She said she's not hooking up with anyone else at the moment because of pandemic, but if she were going to she'd let me know. *Do I then extend this same* ***exact*** *courtesy?* I'd assume so (reinforced by the fact that it's a pandemic), but I'm also wondering why not just start assuming that we're seeing other people?

What about in general? How do I establish that we're actively non-exclusive? I'm being told by many of my friends that ""nobody is exclusive until you talk about it"", but one of my friends and I both think that we should be open about it and let them decide what they're comfortable with. If I'm going with the latter, then when do I bring that up? Again, can't be 2much2soon.

Additionally, what if she says something like the above, where she would *tell me* if she's hooking up with someone else? Assuming she doesn't specify what she would like to *hear*, do I still extend the same **exact** courtesy? *I would assume so*, but a friend told me that she might be comfortable with saying that, but not with hearing it. I feel like assuming reciprocity here is the fairest and safest route though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional stuff**

&amp;#x200B;

*On making moves:*

I would assume that I should be smooth with it, although I was very much awkward af with the above woman, but do I initiate? If so, when? I've had some female friends tell me that I should just wait for the woman to make the move because otherwise she could feel pressured into something she's not comfortable with, but I've other female friends tell me that that just takes the allure out of it and that I should just make the move.

&amp;#x200B;

*On the next day:*

Let's say I spend the night and I wake up before she and want to leave because reasons. Do I wait until she's up and chat with her before leaving? Do I just leave and let her know that ""I had fun"" via a text or note or whatever? Do I stay to make breakfast? lol. If she spends the night, do I still make breakfast?

&amp;#x200B;

*On everything else (initiating, maintaining, ending, etc.):*

I assume it's all ""just go with the flow"", and that may very well be the answers to the above.

However, the first time I was with someone in an attempt at being casual, I had stressed that I didn't even think we should be hooking up because I was moving to another continent in a month and she just said to go with the flow. She ended up getting attached and getting hurt when I wasn't reciprocating. Confusingly enough for her, we were still chatting even when I was gone because we were long-lost childhood friends. Eventually, I *anxiously* asked whether she still had feelings for me, and when she sad she did still have some, I reiterated that I don't, and may have additionally *anxiously* added that I'm looking to go to lunch with someone I had just met (didn't want to keep anything secret/hidden). Yes, we're not in touch anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to cut it short as I have to actually get some work done today. Thank you in advance for any advice given.

I'll admit, right off the bat she didn't look so attractive physically. Started talking and I liked how receptive and responsive she is (which most women weren't in my experience on Tinder). 

It's been 3 months now we ended up texting for hours and calls every weekend. We aren't able to meet because they enforced lockdowns here in India. Anyways, this one day she just tells me she wanted to kiss me and then she admitted she wants to go all the way with me and she's never felt this way with anyone. Though we talk so much we never bore each other out. I can see good compatibility between us. We like/dislike and value similar things in life. 

We've both never had sex with anyone before but I kind of freaked out when I heard. But eventually I grew to like her and she, even more. We both want to lose our virginity to each other. 

I asked if she's okay with meeting me in a room for our first date and she didn't refuse. We trust each other and openly communate about literally everything and are vulnerable to each other emotionally. We ask each other if we've had our meals, ask how our day went and it's a little bit platonic too. 

She does know that I'm not ready for a committed relationship yet cause I told her I need to get my affairs in order and focus on my career amongst other things so though she doesn't admit it, she's afraid to push me and lose me like that (which obviously won't happen). Right now we're exclusive. She doesn't talk to any guy from dating apps or otherwise (mostly because she's too shy and doesn't open up to a lot of people). So we've agreed to keep things casual and let the relationship take whatever pace it wants to and see where it lands us. 

I don't even know if I should be putting a label on our relationship but how would you describe it ? We're obviously not FWBs or are we ?

Hoping to get some more insight!

Hi all, I \[24F\] recently started seeing a guy \[26M\] I met on tinder and I'm fairly certain he has lost interest/is ghosting me, but I'd like some perspective that isn't coming from my friends. I'll try to keep the context brief!

So I was using tinder with no clear end goal, just looking to meet someone and have fun and see what happens. I matched with this guy and he asked me out pretty much immediately. We went on our first date to a bar about 6 weeks ago. It went super well, way better than I expected and I ended up going back to his place. We slept together and I spent the night. The next day he texted me and asked if I wanted to hang out after he got back from a trip and I said of course! We planned to go out to dinner exactly 2 weeks after the first date, but the night before we were going to go, he replied to my instagram story around 11pm while I was hanging out with friends. We got to talking and he ended up picking me up and we went back to his, hung out, and then had sex again. Like I said, I had no end goal here so I didn't really mind if this turned into more of a hookup than a long term relationship. I spent the night there again, of course. The next day (the original day of our planned 2nd date), he asked if I wanted to reschedule to the next day. I was exhausted anyway so I said no problem. We went out to casual dinner at a bar and then (as usual) I slept over at his. He had done basically all of the initiating at that point, so I figured the next one was on me. So a few days later, I asked if he wanted to get dinner with me and he said yes. This time we went to a real restaurant and, again, it was really great. This time I paid and he seemed grateful. He came back to my apartment after but I had plans early the next morning so he didn't stay over (although we did have sex). After that, I was out of town for a few days so I figured I should let him know when I got back and see if he wanted to go out again. This is where I started to notice some changes. When I texted him to hang out, he didn't reply until the next day but said yes and offered a day for the date. I suggested we watch a movie (I wanted it to be clear that I don't expect us to drop $$$ every time we hang out) , but to my surprise he suggested another nice restaurant that we had talked about before. I thought this was a good sign that he wanted to continue taking me out etc. But after he said that, he didn't reply until the day we were supposed to go out (2 days later). He said something like ""whoops my bad..."" but then established the time for dinner. It was kind of off putting but by no means a deal breaker, and we still ended up having a good time. I went to his apartment after, we did watch a movie, had sex, and then I went home. As I was leaving, he kissed me goodbye as he always does, and said ""see you soon?"" I replied, ""yes definitely! Let me know,"" he affirmed and I went home.

That brings us to the present. That last date was 10 days ago and I have not heard from him since. We never really texted between dates so it wasn't weird at first, but I feel like since so much time has gone by and he hasn't reached out, he's probably over it. I totally get it that feelings can change but I don't get what happened or why. We had a lot in common, made each other laugh, had some deeper conversations, and seemed to enjoy each other's company. I feel like I'm being ghosted and should just forget it, but my friends think I can send one last text as sort of a hail mary to see what happens. I kind of disagree since I initiated the last 2 times, he specifically said he'd let me know, and if he wanted to see me he would. What do you think is going on and what should I do about it?

We were dating for about a month and a half and things were going well. He asked me to be his girlfriend a few weeks in and I said yes because we had both been up front about the fact that we had wanted a relationship. At that point we both deleted all of our dating apps and mutually decided to official and exclusive. We had a really great connection, I met his friends and got along with them great (he said they loved me), he had invited me to plans a few months away. He would tell me about how he started to tell his friends and coworkers about me and would introduce me as his girlfriend. We were laughing together about the fact that when he told his coworkers about me they said ""don't f\*\*\* it up"". He would talk to me about plans years down the line involving me and what he wanted out of marriage and kids and referred to me when talking about those things.

This scared me a little since I have a history of 'fleeing' relationships when they get serious, but I made a promise to myself that I would not be the one to flee this relationship. Overall, I'm not one to date a lot and have plenty of personal problems that hold me back in term of intimacy (as did he) and we were able to discuss that candidly. I was feeling increasingly secure in the relationship. Last week we went out to dinner and we were talking about past relationships and he admitted that he has never been broken up with because if he feels it coming he always does it first. This scared me a little, but reminded me of how I am/was in relationships (I took a lot of time to work through those things, thanks therapy). When he told me that, I thought to myself ""ok, when/if we break up I am ok with being the one broken up with because I will be able to emotionally handle it"". Not that I was necessarily thinking about ending it, I just was acknowledging what clearly were some deep rejection issues on his end and measuring how I could handle those against my own rejection issues. He would also often talk about how he had ""been through a lot"" and struggled with relationships in the past so I figured whatever was clearly emotionally hurting him would be expressed to me down the line when he felt comfortable.

He talked about how he was very mature for his age and how he thought his exes were intimidated by him. This was a weird part of the conversation, but I didn't say anything in response, as I was just taking what he said in without feeling the need to respond or argue. My thoughts were that 1) If someone is mature for their age, the don't really need to repeatedly say it, its just a fact that those around them will figure out if that is truly the case and 2) I doubted that his exes were intimidated by him, as I was not at all intimidated by him (I respected him as I thought he respected me, but there was no sense of intimidation).

I was supposed to go over his place this past Friday but he texted me and said ""I'm so sorry, I have a family issue and I'm still at their house and I don't know when I'm going to get back so would it be okay if we postponed to sunday?"" I was understanding and gave him his space. I tried to set up a call that Saturday, but he said he was out at a friends party and would be out all night. At this point I was thinking this was all a little weird and just figured I would discuss my concerns with him when we met up on Sunday. Sunday comes, we text in the morning and I send him a message saying what time I can come over and he responded ""Im sorry. I cant do this relationship anymore. It's due to some things I have to work through on my end. I truly wish you the best"". I was obviously caught off guard, but I didn't even dignify that with a response and I wont ever respond, because he didn't respect me enough to tell me in person.

Immediately after I saw the text I went to instagram to unfollow him/unfollow his account from mine, but he had already beat me to it. It was at that point that I thought to myself ""we are so similar"" and just chuckled to myself a little. Several hours later I re-downloaded the dating app we met on and the next day I saw his profile come up. I was obviously disappointed to see it, but we are broken up and he doesn't owe me anything at this point. Overall, Im disappointed but not devastated (it was a month and a half long relationship, after all), I know that I deserve so much better and at the very least I was able to fulfill my commitment to myself and not flee. I'm not going to waste time trying to understand why, because all that matters is we're done. I learned a lot about myself and how I am in relationships and hope that he is able to overcome his pain.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,838379,public,self,Dating is Rough,0,[],0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzt6wo/dating_is_rough/,all_ads,6,,,,1623695174.0,

I've been noticing that the dates i go normally fall into a kind of boredom after the first or second date. It's like, the first date is easy to go because there are so many things to talk about and you are genuinely curious about the other person. But on the second or third dates, its like you trying to find things to say, or just a monotonous time passing with a person. In these times where COVID is still a danger, going to parties is not a thing we can do, so it is kind of harder not to fall in these boring dates.

Maybe i should just do more exciting things like going into the wild, or any activity together that is not just walk and talk, or drink and talk, or eat and talk. Ok, i get that. But im starting to think if this is not due to Tinder/Apps kind of relationship.

It's different when you date a girl you know at college, or who is friend of a friend. You have other stuff to do that dont involve only the two of you, or you have a lot of subjects in common to talk about. But when you meet someone in-app you need dates to know the person, and you need to talk for that. Also, you dont know their friends, and it is kind of a step to introduce someone to friends, not ideal to be on a second or third date for sure!

Is this why the relationship through apps seem to fail more than thrive? How to overcome that?

I dont feel like i am a boring person, i actually have a lot going on in my personal life, but as 30yrs old person i dont have this really really exciting social life, and events, its normal, its a routine, i have to work a lot, and i have to pay bills, i see friends ocasionally and is nothing close to crazy as it was in my 20s.

Is this a normal drama, or is it just me?  


Edit: I would like to point that life is kind of boring, at least thats how i see it. So its normal to do boring things, we cant go into a trip every weekend, or go to cool parties every weekend... but maybe dates should be a way to do more exciting things with someone.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,838500,public,self,How not to fall into boredom in second/third dates?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzuocc/how_not_to_fall_into_boredom_in_secondthird_dates/,all_ads,6,,,,1623699504.0,

I have a question about something. One of my friends and her husband who live in Texas asked if I was open to meeting a guy whom her husband goes to PT school with. I said yes. Btw, I live in California. We have been chatting for over a month by texting and FaceTime. We have a lot of similar values, are both Christians, and have had great conversation. There are some things about him though that are kinda bothering me. For instance he asked if I was opening to meeting in a few months. I said yes and he said his friend told him that there were some men at my church who may let him stay with them while he visits. I kinda felt weird about it cause I have never actually met him in person. It would be one thing if we were actually in a committed relationship for him to ask this but we have not even met each other! After a week, I posted on the FB page of my church asking if someone could host him. In the span of two weeks, he has asked him if I have found him a place to stay four times. I understand he wants to find a place so he doesn’t have to pay for a hotel but I feel like he is being really pushy. Also, he is planning to come on a Thursday evening and leave on a Sunday morning. He asked me if I like dancing and I said yes and we could do that one evening. I also told him we could get California burritos and that we could also go to Balboa Park and Coronado while he is here. After I told him this he asked if we were gonna do anything else. To me it kinda came off rude to do this cause I am the one showing him my city and if he didn’t think we had enough to do he could have offered more suggestions. I don’t know- maybe I am just getting really in my head and overly picky.

Got my shit together and finished my degree in chemistry, got a great job, make good money, own my own place and I don’t touch any drugs anymore aside from alcohol and weed.

Now? Now it’s like women want nothing to do with me. I’m too boring or too safe. Now women lose interest in me after a couple of dates.. like seriously? So the only reason women liked me before was cause i was a criminal who had drugs and stole shit? 

And it’s not like these women were awful. No they were smart and well to do. Doctors, lawyers, med students, and even once a 40 year old ceo of her own company. 

I’m very fortunate that the only thing I have on my record is a dui but I’m just shocked at how much my dating and sex life tanked ever since I cleaned up my act. So I guess it’s true, women really do prefer the bad boys ha.

Had a promising fling last summer that ultimately fell through and have just been dreading trying again but alas, I'm a glutton for punishment I guess.

I (M27) matched with a woman (29F) on Bumble and we hit it off fairly quickly. She's in the same career as me, cute, smart, etc. Promising, you know. She did mention to me that she can seem ""cold and distant at first but then warms up slowly"" which, hey I get it, plus I'm not very aggressive dating wise at all, so it's fine.  She also has a MAJOR travel bug which she can afford since she lives in an efficiency her parents built her behind their house (meanwhile she half jokingly suggests I should upgrade after showing her pics of my apartment that I actually pay for) After I believe 3 or 4 days of talking she suggests meeting up for breakfast and I accept. We're about 20 miles apart and I agree to meet somewhere that's closer to her. Breakfast is nice and we had a couple drinks and afterwards, I take out my card to pay the $65 bill (it was a trendy little spot, I guess). I did find it a little odd that she didn't even acknowledge me paying or at least spot me a ""lol thanks :)"" but, I guess some women just have that expectation. 

Next day, she wants to meet again for drinks and a movie, again, in her neck of the woods. We agree to meet at 6pm but she texts me 20 minutes after that saying she still hasn't left yet because ""my best friend called me and she just had to vent to me about how hard her graduate school program is lol"" ... Really? lol. She shows up at 6:50, after I've been twirling my thumbs for nearly an hour at the bar.  We have a drink at a bar then hit the movie. Throughout both dates she's laughing a lot, having a seemingly good time. I notice she doesn't respond to even mild compliments or flirtation, but I chalk it up to what she told me earlier about being cold and distant at first (but man, she wasn't lying lol). Of course, I pay for everything again and again, no sort of acknowledgement at all. 

I text her when I got home that I had a good time and that I hope she did too. No response till the morning when she says that she thinks I'm hilarious and sweet, but that she's getting a friendship vibe. I respond saying I kind of felt that way too but wasn't sure if that was just you not warming up to me yet. She never responded.

i’ve laid my intent off the bat that i’m not having sex with him until im comfortable. there’s an instance that i had to bring up the ex bec i have to give context why i am the way i an currently. ie ex was alcoholic, i was emotionally abused and im sexually repressed. i’ve also mentioned that i’m talking to other people but nothing serious and i’m not in a rush. i was in a 7.5yr relationship. he just re-sign with tinder and i was the first person he talked to and met. i told him he should talk and meet more people or else how would he know. he also he doesn’t like texting and girls asking for constant validation and he ghosts. 

i asked him if he felt a spark, and he said he did and that it was easy and felt connected. i truly felt that meeting was organic. even the way he kissed me.

i texted him 24 hrs after that i had a great time and would like to do it again soon. i didn’t hear from him after 4 days 🤷‍♀️.  i thought i was being ghosted..

The general concensus seemed to be that it's okay to keep dating everyone until the exclusivity talk.

One thing that does bother me though is the prospect of sex on these dates, for a few reasons:

- Some people view sex as quite important or indicative of a deeper connection and if things don't pan out, I don't want to lead them on

- Even though exclusivity is not on the table, part of me feels it would be dishonest to sleep with people without all my dates being aware. Not even necessarily from an STD standpoint, just good manners. 

On the other hand, I don't know where life will lead. Maybe some of the dates I'm pursuing won't work out and then I've missed out on a lot of stuff. Maybe some of them do regard sex as a bit of fun and it would be nice to have it were that the case.

What's important to me is not hurting anyone's feelings.

Long post but I added details to make things clear.

I am not used to people being very friendly so it can be confusing, also I haven’t socialized properly in a long time before moving.

There’s this guy but I cannot tell 100%. if he is attracted to me or not. He is Japanese and speaks some English but he tends to be nice. He actually more outspoken with other people and he is shyer with me, not sure if it is because I speak more and he has said he is not confident about his english.

When we met he asked me for my name and offered some food at the school party while he was serving tables (language school, he had a party with food), when we met after a while I got near him and another girl, they let me choose a song etc

We had a long convo about a cultural thing and Japan and he seemed attentive, smiled and he was mirroring my body language too, eye contact etc

After that he walked me outside and asked me for my Ig and number, then he said bye. The conversation lasted a lot and we talked 2 hours or so, we were some of the few people who didn't go to bed lol it was 1 am

All students from language school went to a bar last Tuesday and he ran after me and stopped me to say, asked me if I was going scuba diving etc

I said maybe but today I realized I couldn’t go (period came randomly lol) so I told him but he loves swimming so he decided to go anyway before he told me.

The same night he invited me to go to the beach and there was also another guy he met there. He asked me about what tv shows I liked and I said South Park so he googled it and checked it out.

We had a barbecue at the school and initially, he only said hi etc, he talked with other people then he sat close to me and we talked and seemed cool. He made me choose a song and asked me about my music taste. He also patted me on the shoulder randomly but idk what it means, it can't be anything

I noticed sometimes he is hesitant and I asked him if he wanted to sit outside and he said no because it was cold (lol wut) then he saw me getting a cup of ice cream and he picked the spoon for me because I forgot, told me about he saw when he visited Italy (I am Italian but I am living abroad atm).

I stood very close and felt the urge to put my arm around him but I didn’t because I didn’t want to seem weird, then he went to talk with other people.

I see sometimes he stands around me and generally he is friendly but I have seen that he is less shy when he speaks Japanese and more confident but quieter when speaking in English.

I remember the first time we met he asked me if I did sport because I am fit and when the topic of relationships came up he said he is single etc and asked me If I have ever been in love. The topic came up because we overheard it while two people were talking about Japanese culture, I was quite surprised when he said people have to be in an official relationship to kiss, etc

He mentioned he had a girlfriend in the past but I misunderstood and he cleared it up by saying he did but now he doesn't have one, I said I never had a boyfriend too. He asked me if I have been in love and we talked a bit about the topic.

Some things make me think he likes me in general but some are confusing lol

Also recently I was supposed to go for dinner with one girl and her other 3 guys joined and I sat at the same table as him. He talked a lot and I pushed him on the arm and he did it back, he liked my earrings and touched my backpack before asking if the brand was popular in Italy.

Yesterday I noticed he saw around me without speaking or saying much but he smiled at me often. Sometimes if I looked at him he looked away quickly, I couldn't tell if he was looking at me or another girl. He is nice to everyone but idk, I even suspected he liked her instead because everytime I looked at him he looked away or behind me where the girl was. This happened a few times.

He is helpful and sends me random messages to tell me random stuff like do you know that supermarket, he also told me he goes to the gym at the residence where I am now

Yesterday we were at a party but I was not feeling it because I was tired and I was busy all week. I gave him some glances, sometimes he smiled or sometimes he looked away or we talked a little.

I said bye and left early but when I got outside he followed me and asked me why. I jokingly asked if he missed me and he said yeah and smiled so I told him to come to visit me here where I am.

In general, I noticed he has trouble looking at me and he is always looking around the room, glances at me quickly then looks away. Also I noticed sometimes he just leave without saying anything but he asks if I am coming to events (schools activities etc)

I flirted on a text by asking if he missed me with the tongue and wink emoji and respond by asking back if I missed him, more emoji or also when I said he come to see me more clothes on (we were discussing shopping).

He has texted me first mostly every 2-3 days but the last few times I did first to ask if someone else was coming to an activity etc

I decided to bite the bullet and I asked him if we wanted to hang out because I wanted to get to know him. Initially, he responded in 30 minutes - 1 hr but after that, it became 12-24 hrs, sometimes a few hrs.

He said yes and when but he wasn't particularly enthusiastic (slow short responses), he let me decide if I wanted to dinner or walking around etc but his response was so slow it turned me off.

I just said I couldn't make it, I canceled and said see you soon but neither tried to reschedule.

Is it possible I misunderstood and he was just friendly? I know dating is seen as serious in Japan and they don't kiss until it is official, you have to confess bla bla but

TLDR: Guy acts weird around me and sometimes acts like he likes me but sometimes he avoids eye contact, acts weird, asked him out and didn't seem too excited, I felt turned off",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,838651,public,self,did I get my hopes up for nothing?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nzxri7/did_i_get_my_hopes_up_for_nothing/,all_ads,6,,,,,

So, I changed tactics lately, and decided I wouldn't limit myself to one girl, and talk to a few and see who I got the furthest with. I met this girl online, and she was gorgeous. Probably the most attractive girl who'se ever given me the time of day. She was very flirty, our messages were pretty sexual, but she was more than a sex object in case thats what you're thinking. Anyway, she lives a while away and has been busy, so I said we should meet later on in the summer. In the meantime, I also happen to notice this other girl who is mnuch closer to me comments on my picture, we arrange a date. Aftre rit, despite texting to say she'd let me know when she was free, she ignored my texts, and I felt a bit down. For whatever reason, when I told the previous girl I was feeling down and she asked why, I decided to be honest. She acted cool about it, the day after howver, she spontaneously asked me to delete the nudes she sent (fair enough) and said she wanted to be friends and felt like she didn't just want to be an ""option"" for me. Am I in the wrong here, or is shse just being picky? As far as I'm concerned, its not as if I actually ever committed to a relationship with either, it's pretty casual, and I did tell the previous girl (the one who now just wants to be friends) that I liked her more, its just I wanted to experiment before hand and I couldn't turn down the opportunnity to get out an dsee this other girl. (i've been depressd for a long time, and i don't really have anyone to do anything with). So it kind fo feels I'm back to square one now, I lost two girls in the space of a short time, there'\[s a third girl who I actually met today, but she lives further away, and is quite unpredictable, like she's cancelled on me 3-4 times before this, albeit she had somewhat good reason.

Sorry if this is a little long, and I made this new account so this isn’t linked to my main. 

I recently got back into the dating scene since rona is dying down a bit and I’m vaccinated. I met a guy (34m) and it is such a relief to finally find someone I’m interested in getting to know and date. We’ve been going on dates and spending time with each other for about 2 months. 

I’m naturally a very sexual person, especially when I like someone, so after the third date is was ready to get it in. I suggested Netflix and chill and he was down for it. I get there and we’re just cuddling watching the movie and he’s not making a move. I got tired of waiting and tried to initiate like a make out session twice and both times he stops and goes back to watching the movie. I leave his house that night super confused and feeling so rejected like he’s not attracted to me. 

Over text I’ll suggest sexual things and what I want to do to him and for him to do to me and he’s all for it over text. We’ll even go out to dinner and talk about like past hooks ups or embarrassing stories and talk about what we like sexually so it’s not like we haven’t talked about it or he’s like secretly a virgin or something. 

This past weekend we planned to go out and for me to spend the night at his house. Like I knew it was going down and he did too. We go out, have some drinks, kissing all night and just having a good time. We get back to his house, I’m still a little tipsy and he puts on a movie. I was READY to fuck this guy, so I wait like 10 minutes into the movie and make my move. 

We’re making out and I go down on him, we even started to have sex on the couch and I’m loving it. It only lasted for about 5 minutes, but we didn’t have a condom since it was a little spontaneous so I suggested we go up stairs. 

**a little nsfw** 

I’m literally riding him telling him all this and talking about I want to taste him, I want his cum on my face, I want him to fuck me in his bed and he’s saying yes to everything. So I hop off and practically run up the stairs to get in position on his bed. He comes up and says he’s gonna find the condoms in his bathroom and will be right back. 

He comes back and says I have something I want to tell you. At this point I’m confused and literally just want this man to rearrange my organs. He says I’m sorry I don’t know if I can continue because I’m so nervous. I don’t want to disappoint you and then you tell all your friends I can’t perform(which I would not do, literally why I’m posting here so my friends don’t know). I’m confused, horny, but I also know I need to be understanding because this is still so new I still have things I need to learn about this man. I say ok and am left feeling undesired. 

I’ll be honest that I think I know what it is, I’m a little out of his league. It’s something he’s mentioned and I know it because I’m not dumb, I have eyes. But I don’t care about that, I like this guy, I’m attracted to him, and I’m horny as fuck. 

I’m not used to this kind of experience, I get a lot of male attention so if I wanted sex I could go out and get it. It’s like the one guy I want to fuck doesn’t want to fuck me and it’s ruining my self esteem.

I have only been in one serious relationship so far in my life and that only lasted for about five months.

Let me give you a sense of my dating habits: 

I met a guy during March of last year. Let’s call him Mike. Mike and I we were declaring ourselves a couple in April even though the only interaction we had were text messages and Factime dates. When we finally had our first in-person date, we said “I love you” and by Memorial Day weekend, we were having sex. By July, I even offered to move in with him because I was trying to overcompensate from not being able to see him on a regular basis while he was stationed in the national guard. Things then fizzled out by August for various reasons and then a week after that breakup, I met a recovering alcoholic named Luke. I became fast friends with Luke and thought I was in love with him and still think I am in love with him. Luke tells me that he is not ready for a serious relationship right now and I willing to respect his boundaries. But as soon as he told me that, I contacted Mike to get back together but that only lasted a week because I was reminded of the reasons we broke up and I realized that I was still not over Luke so I thought that would be unfair to date Mike when  I wasn’t.

Things were going great, there was nothing we didn't share with each other. We even confessed super strong feelings for each other, FaceTime sex a bunch, the whole nine yards. We both ""could not wait to be together"". In my eyes it's definitely happening. 

Then, about a couple weeks before we were to meet, I noticed her acting differently. No more words of affirmation, took longer for her to text back. Phone calls were super quiet. I called her out on it but she just assured me ""she was going through an introvert spell"" and ""nervous about meeting but still wants to be with me and I make her so happy"". Well, the day finally comes. The entire time she looked uncomfortable. She was on her phone a lot. Demeanor was a little cold. And I was clearly upset. That was a few days ago. 

Now she tells me ""I want to get to know you better and I think I want to start off as friends and go from there. I was drunk when I said I love you. You can't tell me you really thought it wouldn't be different from FaceTime to meeting IRL. Basically we should be starting over"". 

And no, she did not indicate having that opinion before we met so I had no warning. Even though I guess there is always that chance that you won't click regardless of what you say. I'm pretty bummed.

TLDR: I met up with a guy who made me feel like we would be a thing. We had sex and he ghosted. I feel worthless now. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. A pretty popular athlete DM'd me a few months ago asking me to help him with a side business he was working on (my instagram is a mixture of my work in branding and my personal pics)
2. As the months went on we were texting everyday and he told me he wanted to date me, and that we would be a great couple, and how beautiful I am, and how he can't wait to see me. We never ended up talking business it was definitely like a talking/texting stage. 
3. We tried to meet up a few times but he either ghosted the day of or plans fell through. ie I was supposed to fly see him (he got me a ticket) and then the day of he just ghosted. 
4. After he would ghost I would get mad, kinda blow up his phone on how rude it is, he would apologize and say he would make it up to me. We went through this cycle 3-4 times. 
5. Finally I was fed up of the ghosting and told him it was draining to me. He promised me he'd make it up to me and to come see him and he'd personally pick me up from the airport. 
6. Last Friday, I flew to his city, he picked me up from the airport, checked me into a swanky hotel. On the way from the airport he kept saying how I would be ""his girl"", how I should learn how to cook his favorite dishes if we are going to be together, he kissed me in the car etc etc. He is a pretty big name and he just walked into the hotel with me, people were staring at us etc. I felt wanted and excited.
7. We had a night filled with sex and I think we both had a great time. He kept saying how great of a time he had. Note: He didn't ask me any questions about myself, pretty much spoke about himself only. 
8. He slept over and the next morning he said he had a workout and he'd be back. 
9. He never came back, he just left me at the hotel. I texted him a bunch of times and he said he was coming, but then after noon he just stopped responding. Total GHOST. But he was posting to social media. 
10. My flight was that evening and I just ubered to the airport and left, he totally didn't say bye or a word to me. I got pretty upset and told him how hurtful it was that he wouldnt say bye. 
11. The next day he responded ""sorry I had a great time, sorry my workout ran late and I got busy"" 
12. Later that day he unfollowed me on social media
13. I texted him what was wrong and he hasn't responded. 

Was this all just for that one night? Did he see me and wasn't interested. I feel like so hurt, I feel insecure, I feel like I wasn't pretty enough to his liking. I just feel super ashamed that I got swept up in the fantasy. 

For context: this guy has many children with many different women. he is single.

I kinda developed a fantasy version of her, but over the months have been able to dispell the fantasy and focus on the real her. I made some mistakes in the past such as asking for the 2nd date that she pay for us since I paid the 1st which got her to be flakey. Over the months our communication with one another (we work remotely for the same company) was on and off. During this last weekend we spoke on the phone and she opened up more apologizing being flakey, admitting she is super family oriented and is obligated to do stuff with extended family and family, and they do things often and to give her a heads up for a date/hang out at least a couple of weeks in advance so she could ""try"" to free up her schedule and not blow off her family members. So I told her I'd hit her up soon which I did and she told me she'd let me know sometime this week.

She has also opened up about her dating past and has mentioned that when she starts to fall for a guy who treats her with respect, surprise surprise, he's gay, has a gf etc. So she's been burned before. I notice she's NEVER complimented me this entire time but is super receptive of my attention and compliments. Is she worried about being flirty and not working out? I'm just curious. 

Lastly the biggest reason why I like her is she is totally different. On past posts I've pointed out that she hardly post stuff about herself on social media, she doesn't seek male validation. She may not be the hottest girl and lack curves but her smile, her kind nature, being raised in a 2 parent home growing up, being close to her dad, has me gaga over her, I'd rather go for this goofy, kind, short version of Olive Oyl (think Popeye the Sailor's girl) over a smoke show with a Jessica Rabbit build who constantly seeks out attention and cat calling I see so prevalent in today's dating market.

I've thought a lot that the best way a relationship to start would be to have a face to face interaction in an environment thats naturally occurring like at the gym or school or something.

I feel like starting something over your phone has less likelihood of working idk im not an experienced relationship person as in I haven't been in many of them. But I can say the ones I was in, started from personal interaction, not the internet.
