Let me tell you a lot of people have been in this position, myself included and I'm going to tell you what you need to do to change the way you think about yourself.

What makes me qualified to tell you what to do you ask? Absolutely Nothing, but that still doesn't mean that there are not people out there who want to help you become the best version of yourself.

Now there are inevitably some people out there who unfortunately are not blessed with ""Good Looks"" and if this is you then this is just unfortunate on you behalf, but this does not mean you cannot find someone to Love, you just need to use other means to do so and while we are on that note... NO (Guys Especially) this does not mean your Wallet.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things that you need to focus on and work on to become a more 'Attractive Individual'

\* Groom Well -&gt; This Means find a hairstyle that suits your body and facial features and keep it well Groomed and Tidy, If you are a guy, make sure you maintain your beard and keep it sharp, not messy. For Women it is much the same... Just ignore the beard...

\* Dress Sharp -&gt; This Means Buy Clothes and Find a style that suits you but most importantly, especially for guys, buy clothes that FIT, DO NOT buy clothes that are 1 or 2 sizes to big. For Women, Make sure you clothes are stylish and suit what is Popular in the current time.

\* Accessories -&gt; This can put a fine point on your style, Men mainly need to be looking for Chains and Watches but careful not not to add too much Blind. Women mainly need to focus on Necklaces and Bracelets.

\* Workout and Keep Fit - This is the #1 Thing that will make you physically more attractive, For Guys naturally focusing on getting bigger, now you dont need to Bulk up like the Rock, but filling out and getting a little bigger, especially your shoulders, is a must. Women, obviously focusing on toning your Legs and Growing and Toning your Booty obviously should be your main focus.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So those are things that you CAN and NEED to do if you want to come across as more attractive, now when it comes to you as a person, there are many things that you NEED to do to become a more ""Attractive Individual"".

\*  Build an Interesting Life -&gt; Simply put, if your Life is boring and you have had no life experiences, no interesting hobbies or stories to tell, NOBODY is going to find you an interesting Prospect to date. So you need to Build yourself an interesting Life by finding hobbies you are passionate about and having experiences to be able to share those stories on dates in the future.

\* Body Language -&gt; Your body language is the most important NON VERBAL Commutator there is, Simply put if you are shy and constantly looking at the floor or darting round the room, people will stay away from you. Make sure you walk with your head up, shoulders back and exude confidence, other will see this and be instantly intrigued by your persona, Try to also make eye contact with people, dont shy away from that, another key this you need to improve on.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of these points listed are things that you can do to make yourself a more attractive individual, all of this is irrespective of your looks, these are things that will make you the most attractive as a you can be all before even opening your mouth, that will take a whole other post.

I by no means am not perfect and also are implementing some of these things especially the body language, and already after a few weeks am noticing an improvement in myself as an individual. Love will eventually bloom for us all but not if you are not giving yourself the best chance and presenting yourself in the best way possible.

We began talking again and he asked me to pick a day and time for us to meet. He seemed even more eager than before and our conversations flowed so nicely. We set a time and date. We spoke everyday leading up to it, with him saying he was looking forward to it the night before. 

Then on the day (6 hours before the date) he texts me saying he‚Äôs feeling unwell and sorry he has to bail. I said that‚Äôs fine and i hope he feels better. He then texted me later that night continuing the conversation as normal, telling me he‚Äôs still feeling unwell, thanking me for being cool with it, and then asking me how my day was.

So we are both in our 30's and I still can't understand why a man on his 30s can't simply answer a question and just blocked me instead.

So I'm casually seeing this guy and we agreed to hangout on the day that suits me which was the next day he originally planned. On that day i asked what time we will hangout and he replied quickly. Few hours later, he asked to reschedule 2 hours later so i agreed. When the time comes i didn't get any text from him so i shoot him a text amd asked. I didn't get a reply so i rang him and he declined the call righ away, i shoot him a text again to tell me if he can't do it, no reply, so i rang him again the 2nd time, he declined the call again and blocked me. I was shocked by his behaviour even though it's not new to me that he doesn't follow through sometimes but blocking me instead of answering a simple yes or no is just really unacceptably rude and immature.

There is no way of knowing why now that he blocked me. Even though i don't plan on asking him anymore as the answer is clear and i just move on from this it is still mind boggling to me that a 30y.o would act like this. I expect more maturity.

Any thoughts?

Edit: whe he asked to reschedule 2 hours later, i find the text oddly polite, not his usual way of asking.

We have been friends/known each  other for 4 years. I've not really officially dated someone before, but  I've casually dated before(Ended before we became official).  She has  never dated or done anything with a guy. We're both seniors in high  school.

So the interesting thing  about this relationship is that she asked me out. She called me one  night and asked if I wanted to go on a date with her. I said yes and our  relationship developed from there. I asked her to be my girlfriend  about two months later. I was planning on asking her but I did feel a  little pressured. Her friends would come up to me and say ""you should  ask her to be your GF"" etc. The day before I asked her to be my  girlfriend, she directly said to me ""When are you planning to ask me?""  So I asked her and we made it official. It was really good for a while.  She would ask me on dates and I would ask her.

Fast  forward a month and valentines day is coming up. She does her  pressuring stuff again. She goes up to my friends this time and  complains that I haven't asked her to be my valentine. This annoyed me a  little, but I understood that she wanted to be asked. So I asked her,  gave her some flowers, and we went on an expensive date that I paid for.  We then went to a party afterward.  It was fun and an enjoyable night.  She didn't get me anything though. She then tells me a week later that  she bought me chocolates but forgot to give them to me. This upset me.  How are you going to complain but not do anything for me on valentines  day?

Fast forward a month, I  notice more things that annoy me. She never got her license because of  COVID, so I drive her around for all our dates. She lives 20 minutes  away. She also lives in the middle of nowhere, so everything fun like  bowling or roller skating is also 20 mins away. Oftentimes, I drive to  her place for 25 mins, then we drive to our date location for 20-30  mins, then we drive back to her house for 20-30 mins, then I drive back  home for 25 mins. This means I am driving for 1 hour and a half. Gas is  expensive. I also hate driving, it stresses me out.

Her  parents are also very traditional. They do not like that their daughter  is dating. I have never been invited inside. She doesn't even push for  them to talk to me.

She no longer  asks me on dates or plans them. She told me that I should ask her out  just to make it easy. The last time she asked me on a date was because  she needed a ride after school. I heard her ask her friend ""can you  drive me home."" Her friend said no. She then proceeds to ask me ""do you  want to hang out."" I said ""yes."" She then asks if I can drive her home  after. I say yes. I then question her and ask if that was the only she  asked to hangout. She then says no. I know she likes hanging out, but  the only time she asks me is when she needed a ride. That hurt.

I've  noticed that whenever I am upset in the relationship, she never seems  to check on me. I was upset and she decided it was better to not say  anything and ignore it. She then said,"" I didn't know if you were the  type who liked being left alone when upset."" She couldn't even take the  time to ask, Are you okay. This has happened at least one other time.

She  takes forever to text back. I would never have a problem with this  normally. But since there are so many other problems, I feel that this  one just annoys me extra.

This one  is maybe in my head, but I heard her once complain about the gifts I  gave her on valentines day. My GF's friend, Elli , showed my GF a  picture of the gifts Elli's boyfriend got Elli. My gf friend then said  in a tone that sounded so repulsive to my ears ""Look what your boyfriend  got you."" She might of well just said, ""my boyfriend gave me dirt"" IDK  maybe I made this one up and she didn't mean it like that, but that one  upset me . I get her flowers and pay 200 dollars for dinner. She gets me  nothing and then complains.

I bet  after reading all that you think she must not like me at all. No. I  know she adores me. She loves when we hang out and cuddle etc. I don't  feel like she likes me tho.

I hold  my tongue a lot. All this stuff,  I never mention, and If I do it's in a  jokey way. I think she is a bad girlfriend, but I really like her. I  never get upset, but she makes me upset all the time. I also feel like  if I tell her then it ruins the relationship. She should want to be a  good GF, not asked to be a good GF.

TL;DR  - My girlfriend doesn't outwardly show she likes me. I know she does,  but she barely puts effort into our relationship. I think she is a bad  GF.

Long time reader, first time poster.

I (23F) matched with this guy (21M) on Hinge back in November of last year. I‚Äôd honestly sworn off dating after a really bad dating history but I thought I‚Äôd take a chance on this bloke.

We were talking for about a week and he asked me out on a date and honestly it was the BEST first date I‚Äôve ever been on. We went on a few more dates after that and the vibes were really good.

We slept together after our 4th date and I‚Äôd told him my track record was pretty shit because everyone I slept with would just end up ghosting me and I didn‚Äôt want that to happen again. I was pretty anxious about sleeping with him the first time and I told him to stop a couple of times just before we were about to do the deed. He was really understanding and didn‚Äôt push me to do anything I didn‚Äôt want to do and we talked for over an hour after I told him to stop and explained why I was so hesitant about sleeping with him and he was so understanding and also opened up to me as well.

Fast forward about a month after about 4/5 dates whilst talking every day and sleeping together he tells me he doesn‚Äôt see me as more than a friend and I said yeah that‚Äôs fine and proposed an FWB situation because I really liked his friendship and the sex was really good.

Now it‚Äôs been almost 6 months and we still talk every day and he came to my birthday party last night and got me a present, met all my friends and was talking to them and I found out when one of them was leaving she asked him if he sees us dating and he flat out said no.

Tbh I didn‚Äôt think he would but it was a sucker punch to the gut because we hang out every weekend, I‚Äôve met his mates and now he‚Äôs met mine. But to tell one of my best friends he doesn‚Äôt see this going anywhere just really sucks.

Idk if I‚Äôve put too much expectation on him but we‚Äôve been exclusive this whole time(we discussed if we were sleeping with anyone else/talking to anyone else and since our 3rd date we decided we would be exclusive) and when we‚Äôre alone he‚Äôs super affectionate towards me, it‚Äôs just a bit of a mind-fuck tbh because he‚Äôs doing boyfriend things but also at any sign of commitment is a hard pass on his behalf.

He also helped me move into my new apartment and went to IKEA with me to buy stuff for it (not sure if this is relevant but just thought I‚Äôd add it for context) and we still see each other every weekend and talk every day.

Also I am seeing a pattern of guys not telling me things such as having children and being married in the past until we meet and go on a date. Their dating profiles say they have no kids and never married. So I don‚Äôt think to ask or confirm. 
I talked to both for a week or more and finally went on dates with them. They told me they have been divorced for 2-3 years. One had 2 kids‚Ä¶..

I enjoyed the food lol. And just texted him after saying this is not going to work because I don‚Äôt have children and I do not have to do anyone with children.

Maybe it's because online dating has rotted my brain and trust in people enough to know the tricks of the game, but if you've got plans on Saturday night, and someone messages you in the early afternoon already flaking due to a so-called headache, I'm going to assume they've found themselves other plans and are using the convenient excuse that had a headache is gong to prevent them from doing anything all day -- on a Saturday evening albeit -- to get out of them. 

She offered to postpone, but man... Don't make me feel like an option.

The unfortunate part is that I had someone else ask me to do something, and I declined due to these plans, so now I not only have no plans tonight but probably lost the interest of the other person.

However, he tried to have sex and I wasn't ready so I didn't do it. After this he stopped talking to me and treated me like a nobody. He also started having a blonde girl over and I checked on social media and find out that she had been his GF for 2 years!!

She doesn't know about me and when I contronted him he just said ""Cuddling's not a big deal, we're roommates. And I wouldn't tell her"".

Anyway at this point I stopped cuddling with him and he completely ignored me. Even when I tried to make small talk with him in the kitchen he would literally call up his girlfriend and invite her over and I would get ignored. She got to go to parties, wedding, and he even took her on a tropical vacation.

He never took me out or even let me go in his truck once. I told my mom and originally thought he only liked the other girl better because she was having sex with him, but my mom said he also takes her out so he must prefer her and he doesn't care about me.

I've since moved out and I miss this guy SOO much. I just want to go back to how things were before I knew he had a girlfriend. Even though he lived next door I didn't get to know him as well as

I am undoubtedly 100% straight. I always loved women and every part of them. Having butterflies for countless times, and having multiple girl friends really made me very sure I am in no way bisexual/bicurious/gay. I had my first relationship at 16. It lasted for a year and a couple of months and was a great period. We broke up almost a year ago and I am definetely over her. In no way, shape or form would I ever get back together with her. She was also my first sexual partner. I never had any sexual problems except the fact I never could orgasm from blowjobs, and could last a long time. The sex was always good. I am in the above average penis spectrum (around 7 inches), so that is definetely not a mental barrier. Usually, I am always able to get the girl I want and am always called good looking (solid 8-9). Since I am an athlete I never had physical issues with libido or anything. So all the boasting aside, I am not filled with mentaln blocks and anxiety related to women. However after we broke up many girls tried getting with me, but most are too shallow and only want sex or are incredibly boring. I am quite busy, so I don‚Äôt have time for small talk with girls I do not find attractice. I was never similar to other men since I was always incredibly picky, and every girl I ever hooked up with thought I was incredibly experienced. I haven‚Äôt kissed a girl since we broke up, but that changed a couple of hours ago. I had my first hook up with an extremely attractive female. It was fun and playful, however a very weird experience. Every time she got closed to me my stomach rolled, but when we started kissing the spark died. She was very in to it, however I was not. It did not feel like making out when I was 15,16 and 17. I do not usually watch porn often since I am aware of the psychological drawbacks, so I don‚Äôt know what that is. All in all, the scary part for me is that I just made out with a 10/10 girl that was urging me to get more physical with her (with whom I clicked very very good) and I did not even feel a spark. I am again 100% sure that I like women, and since I do not have physical or mental barriers (extroverted and outgoing) I just want to know: wtf is wrong with me? I sort of feel depressed very often, and I think a lot. However, I didnt overthink this at all. So now, im asking Reddit: what is your opinion? What do I do? Am I messed up in the head?

He added me back and messaged me telling me he thought I was attractive and was VERY responsive. We chatted for weeks and tbh after chatting I kind of got the ick from him a couple times because he kept responding so quickly constantly double texted me to want to link up with me‚Ä¶ so I ignored him a few times initially. After more talking and a FaceTime call (that I originally didn‚Äôt even want to do), I completely changed my opinion and actually liked him a lot after conversing. Fast forward now and I REALLY like him now but he barely hits me up anymore. He lives 1 hour away. He always asked me to link up initially but I always said no due to an exam I needed to study for.

I personally don't like someone sharing this with me and if I see it on someone's bio I won't swipe on them, it gives me the impression they're only looking for sex and puts me off as im looking for a relationship. 

Don't get me wrong I don't think there is anything wrong with this relationship style/ style of sex and intimacy if both parties agree.. having done some research in the past there is aspects I also practice myself however.. I don't feel the need to explain this during the extremely early talking stages with someone and I don't understand why so many men.. (maybe women?) Do.. 

I find it incredibly disrespectful and creepy someone is asking so soon if I'm willing to submit to them before they have even learned about if we share similar hobbies, interests, values they want to know what I'm willing to do in the bedroom. I'd prefer at a minimum to meet someone in person and see what emotional connection is formed before a sexual one at which point I'm more than willing to discuss and be open..  this is of course putting aside those who are just looking for a casual/fwb situation where the sex is obviously one of the most important.

Sexual compatibility is of course important, I would want to know someone I was dating could meet my needs but I don't think it's appropriate when someone asks what I'm looking for to write back stating how often I expect them to go down on me etc. 

So I ask why are so many men doing this, is it really so important to state this in the early talking stages and I'd like to know if I'm unfortunately matching with a lot of horny desperate people trying to steer the conversation towards sex early on or if others feel this is genuinely an important thing to put across and if you do think it's really important could I have some reasons why so I can reflect on this?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164026,public,nsfw,Dom/Sub I feel men are over sharing too early on?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ti9ttd/domsub_i_feel_men_are_over_sharing_too_early_on/,no_ads,0,,,,

I met this guy back in January, we got to chatting one time and swapped numbers, went on a few dates from there (both in uni, I‚Äôm an undergrad and he‚Äôs a prospective grad student). It was pretty casual - we met up around once a week since it was a busy time but usually spent a lot of time together on a given day. I like his company a lot and the feeling seemed mutual.

So things were going pretty well for a while, and then on a couple instances he cancels the day of when we plan to go out‚Äî first it‚Äôs that he slept through his alarm and didn‚Äôt feel up to it, then when we tried to reschedule it‚Äôs that he had some other stuff already scheduled for the same afternoon. It was just going to be a study-date type of thing, nothing requiring a whole lot of investment ahead of time, so in my mind it just seems like he has a lot going on and isn‚Äôt deliberately trying to push me off. He even said as much and apologized in a text unprompted. At this point we still exchange texts a bit but the replies kind of taper off. 

After hearing nothing for upwards of a week, I sent a text asking if he was still interested at all- admittedly, I was acting out of insecurity more than anything, and my text was pretty passive aggressive. He responded really quickly, said he understands why I would ask and that he has been feeling overwhelmed socially and has always been a bit rough with communication, but he would like to go out and talk more eventually. I immediately felt guilty for confronting him the way I did and sent some really long-winded reply‚Äî I guess I was trying to say that I understood and I‚Äôve had issues with communication too so I get it and if he wants to talk I‚Äôm around‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt think I said it very well, was kind of rushing to say something. And I haven‚Äôt heard anything from him since.

I don‚Äôt doubt that he is going through what he says he‚Äôs going through, but at the same time I feel like there might be more to it than he told me. which I get, we haven‚Äôt known each other that long. I just don‚Äôt know whether I should expect to hear from him again, or if I should try reaching out, and if so I don‚Äôt know what to say. I kind of still want to apologize for the way I confronted him before. It‚Äôs hard to simply let go when I feel we really clicked in the beginning, and also because it seems like he‚Äôs genuinely going through some rough times and I don‚Äôt like to fault people too much for that. If it all turns out to be an excuse to ditch me, I can live with that, but on the off chance it‚Äôs not, I‚Äôd rather keep the bridge afloat.

We talked on the phone for an hour and she apologized and told me that she basically was only looking for casual dating, which is fine. She said that she works alot and doesnt want me to wait around for her. She also said she would still like to talk and go to dinner with me. But here is the way i see this going, we are gonna go to dinner, it will be a great date and that will be it. I probably wont ever see her again. And after this im done.

I'm a guy who lives in the suburbs near...uh...let's call it City X.  I've always been super reclusive, and never got to properly interact with the opposite gender beyond awkward interactions until maybe a year ago.  Then it was like:

*Training Arc (Insert Music Here):* Since I didn't really have the ability to interact with people irl (or more like didn't have the courage to) I spent a lot of time playing around with OLD, less in the ""Dating App"" way, and more in the Reddit kind of way.  I had the opportunity to interact with a lot of different women and learn a lot about myself and the faults that I had in how I conducted myself with others.  Later, I took sales job for a period that required me to talk to large numbers of people, and all of these experiences instilled in me the mindset that *success can depend on time, place, and occasion, but it still always is a chance, and that chance might come now, or it might come a long time from now.*  I never really believed that success could find me before that.  I was an anxious, insecure mess, and probably very unattractive because of it.  But because people saw potential in me, I was finally able to see potential in myself.  As time went on, I first started by calling myself beautiful or handsome, even though I didn't believe it, until finally, one day, I believed I was beautiful.

Well anyway, yesterday was my first time going to a bar, in the city at that.  I actually went there for one of those Meetup things, and I did see a post about them being shady or something, so I guess I'll give my take:  The organizer definitely seemed like an awkward guy, but certainly not bad.  I guess it depends on who's doing it.  I had a great time, and really hit it off with woman who was there.  We had a lot in common and they even live near me, and before I left for the night (it got unbearably loud) I actually got their number.  So I saw the post about giving a woman your number instead of asking for their number.  I guess I'm actually sort of divided on it, so here's my choice: I asked to exchange numbers.  Well that seemed to do the trick, so I texted them to ask if they got home ok this morning and I'm going from there!

I recently joined some Facebook groups to try and meet new people as well as a couple dating apps to perhaps meet someone. Unfortunately, I'm at a point in my life where I'm only doing these things because it would probably better for me if I socialized even if I don't really care to do it. I've setup my profiles to be representative of me and my first line reads ""I'm here to meet someone who has a good sense of humor but can also hold meaningful conversations"".

My question is: is online dating / dating in general something I should be pursuing given the little interest I have in actually meeting someone? A big part of it comes from trying to solve my own internal struggles and I understand that no one is perfect and we all have our own issues. However, I'm hesitant to pursue these kinds of things because I feel I owe it to whoever I'm meeting to really be myself, and I haven't felt that way for quite some time. I've already started working on myself albeit not as consistent as I'd like to be and am thinking that I may want to wait a bit until I'm in a routine to get out there.
