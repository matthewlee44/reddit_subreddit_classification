I grew up in a small town where I was laughed / winced at by every girl I expressed my feelings for except one who just said no without the laughing part. 

I guess I look better now than what I did in hs because all the girls who made fun of me started expressing interest in me after my first year in college. Although it made me very uneasy and nervous I had a girl who said to me at a party that she wanted to kiss me but when I went up to her she wouldnt look at me and all of her friends seemingly came out of no where and then I had like 8 girls laughing at while whispering other comments to each other while laughing. it feels like pieces of my heart falls off when i think of that moment still. 

'I had a girl express interest in me my sophomore year of college and we hung out and even made out in my dorm room. She said she was ready for sex but I wasn't since i only had gone out with her twice. We met up one more time but she said ""she had been trying to be patient"" and then asked ""what is wrong with you(me)"" This triggered me very hard since she sat next to me in one of my classes and I was worried that because she had other friends sitting with her in that class. that this was gonna turn into another shitfest of getting laughed at and being exposed for not being ""manly"" enough, or doing the right things when I'm  with a girl so I just ended it with her. This was only the third time we had hung out together!!!

My mom also religiously told me because Im into technology, play video games and study statistics in college that a lot of girls would not want to go out with me and it makes me selective to who I open with about sometimes even the smallest details of my life.  

and the last girl that accepted a date with me spent the whole time on her phone which when i peeped a glance she was snapping her ex so i guess she decided she could leech some attention from me while she tried to get the attention back from her toxic ex. But this has been basically the entire history of my dating life so far. 

I don't feel excitement anymore but more just dread the idea that I keep having to open myself up to this kind of environment  to find a gf. Im afraid of going on dates with people that i interact with at school because I would have to continuously see them if things don't go good. I just don't want to brush a girl the wrong way and she labels me as a creep or some kind of bad guy and have that kind of reputation spread. 

I dont want to do casual hookups, I tried online dating for 6 months i got about three matches but only one responded to a couple messages but nothing ever material.

But then i start over thinking. I know this probably makes me sound like a jerk, but i like to hype myself up for things like this by doing a quick gym sess, clears the mind and helps.

First Reddit post, I just really need advice to put it bluntly.

So I’ve been into this girl for a while now, maybe a couple of months. We first started hanging out 4 months ago (we live in the same dorm) and I got to know her pretty well. Safe to say, she was into me before I was into her. In the beginning she’d talk about being single and she’d get pretty close to me. I’m more of the type guy who needs to get to know someone before catching feelings, so it took awhile for me.

Started getting interested at around her birthday, so I bought tickets to an event. However, she was talking about some other guy she met and I got turned off from pursuing anything as I’m not willing to compete if in the end she wants someone else. Still, I gave her the gift and we both had a really good time, thought it’d still be fun going as friends.

Then I heard lately that she expected me to make a move on her birthday, which has me confused because she was still talking about that other dude.

Decided to officially ask her out for Valentine’s Day because the signs are still somewhat there that she’s interested, plus she stopped talking to  the guy.

Now, her answer had me a little confused. She really liked the little gift I got her, but she later said “but we’re dormmates, what if it doesn’t work out.” Then she looked down and said “what’s one date.” The only thing is she’s busy over the next few days so I said that she should think about it and let me know. Didn’t want to pressure her as she seemed flustered at trying to figure out a good day. 

Should I take this as a maybe not after all?

It's stressful in ways that I can't really put my finger on or figure out on my own, and ""exposure therapy"" via dating apps has not helped, nor has trying to figure it out by reading about dating/attachment/etc on the internet. So I thought, isn't this what people go to therapy for? When you have mysterious mental blocks?

Unfortunately after trying 8 different therapists I haven't found even one who was helpful with this. It seems like pretty much all of them jumped to either pushing me to spend more time on dating apps, or pushing me to get off dating apps and forget about dating (or get even more hobbies). Literally none of them were interested in trying to understand *why* dating is so hard for me, even when I tried really hard to communicate that that is what I need. They just want to tell me what they think I should *do*.

I feel really bad and worried that I'm just doomed because no one seems to be able to help me.

I'll try to keep this as short as possible, still gonna be long tho. Maybe the answer is clear, but I still wanna hear some opinions. If there are any further questions, ask right away. And sorry for my grammar, no native english speaker.

Okay, so last year in October/November I met this guy. We met because we both went to a club and we both had some friends there and we got introduced to each other. We immediately clicked, I had a little hyper crush. Didn't seem toxic in his dating beliefs, a lot of the same interests, instant attraction. My best friend kept his distance the whole evening, flirting. When we went home he came with us until we had to go different ways. My friend was like ""he was your Highlight tonight am I right? Never seen you like this before!"". I was quite unsure if it was being drunk and both being horny gays. But I was questioning if I should text him. But I did a few days after. We met the same week, he invited me to a club with his best friend. We made out this evening, he invited me to his place. We didn't have Sex, but we cuddled. The next day we went to eat and go see a movie. The weeks after he invited me to his closest friends. Some of them started following me on Instagram. There are pictures of me holding him on my arms like a couple. He posted a Story on his Instagram of me putting my head on his shoulder. Even though he said he was dating someone when we met. So I thought ""okay, he's comfortable with showing his interest openly"", this is probably a thing of the past (and it was). There were some other things he said that didn't really sit right with me, but those were past things and he was just being honest. So everything was looking good. But we both knew that we've gone through some shit in the past, so we both knew that it would take some time. Anyway we had sex for the first time after 1.5 months. After that he was acting kinda weird. Was being distant. We still texted every day. On New Years Eve he originally said that he wanted to invite me to something, but he didn't. Same thing with some other stuff. But in January it kinda settled and we were doing more together. He was sick, I brought him food, gave him company and we cuddled while watching movies. I was happy, because we were doing more of this again after it seemed like the flame was dying. One night I was at a bar and he offered me to sleep at his place after. I did. We cuddled, had sex. But since then he's acting distant again. But even more than the last time. He's not sending me stuff he's interested in on Instagram, there's no effort by him to meet, when I ask him he's hesistant. At the moment we aren't really texting which is weird because we were texting everyday since we met. He didnt even invite me to his birthday. Last week I wanted to talk to him, but on this evening I noticed that he didn't really look at me. He started talking about his ""work crush"" out of nowhere. That he installed Tinder (looking for platonic stuff tho). That he found his ex and that he still doesn't look good. That his last relationship was ended by himself, because he didn't want a relationship anymore. This was 2 years ago tho. I asked him if we could talk two days after this, but he's just avoiding it. I don't know how to act. I really like him. It's the first time in 2 years that I've liked someone that much. It was so promising in the beginning And I'm afraid I took to long and I'm being replaced.

He gave me a lot of mixed signals I've seen as ""just give me time"". Time I needed as well, I was fine with it. I guess we both gave each other a hard time with mixed signals and trying to get jealous reactions out of each other with little remarks. But I'm not sure if some of them we're honest. But that would be alright, because I think that unless both agree on being exclusive you can't expect the other one to be, sooo... yeah. But still a little jealousy on my side to be honest. But he had it as well. When I met new people he wanted to know who and was like ""uhhh 😏"". Even wanted pictures. But I assured him that there's no romantic or sexual interest.

Last weekend he agreed to meet in a bar. I was going with friends and I wanted him to come. I had a bit too much and was in the bathroom just in case. He brought me water and took me home with him, made food and prepared his sofa for me, because I feel asleep on it. My friend told me that they talked and he asked him about us. He looked kinda thoughtful, was avoiding the topic, but said that we get along really well and that there's barely anything he could complain about our relation. That it was almost too perfect at times. He even agreed that we need to talk. Also my friend said that we really fit together and harmonize very well. Not the first time I was hearing this.

I don't know if I should just ask him again how he's doing, even though he will just answer ""Yeah I'm doing good"". But I wanna ask him out for valentines day. But I'm afraid that he would say he won't have time on this day, because he might have a date.

Sorry for this long ass text and thank you very much to whoever actually reads this. What would you do? What do you think could be the reason for him acting like this? I'm not a Fan of playing the waiting game honestly. I want closure. But I also don't wanna be the one begging or pushing him away, because of whatever the problem might be.

I am a 21M who didn't start dating until after high school when I was 18 due to low self confidence and self esteem. None of my attempts at dating or a relationship have gone anywhere and I'll explain more in this post. The first relationship I was in we talked for about a month, I stayed the night with her a couple times, we kissed and cuddled but no sex because I wasn't sure how to initiate it. We ended up breaking up due to my inexperience because I was still trying to figure things out which really took a toll on my self confidence. About 6 months later I met another girl and we really hit it off and started seeing eachother but she was really quiet and shy so it was kind of hard to talk to her sometimes. She also just got out of a 5 year long relationship so she wanted to take things slow but she did like me. She ended up coming over to cuddle and watch TV and we kissed multiple times. She was giving me signs that she wanted to have sex but I knew that wasn't taking things slow and I was too stupid not to act on them. Things ended up dying out cause we were going pretty fast to really slow and then she started talking to another guy at work and got into a committed relationship with him, turns out they were seeing eachother at the same time me and her were seeing eachother. That was another hit to my self confidence.

 I didn't see anyone for almost a year and a half after that despite trying to put myself put there, however I had really bad social anxiety, was battling depression, and just didn't have the self confidence. I didn't go out much because of that and I wasn't really sure where to go to meet people other than parties at my college which really wasn't a good environment for me, I just felt so uncomfortable at party's going by myself. Then COVID hit which did not make anything easier, I was 19 at the time. When I was 20 I went to a new college which felt really exciting and I felt like I could have a fresh start, however with covid everything was locked down, and it was just really hard to get to know people when you just go to class and go home so I joined a fraternity to get to know more people and those are the people I hung out with the most but no events were happening due to covid.

 I live on a country club and there's this resturant close to where I live that I went to a lot. There was a girl that worked there that was almost always my waiter and she knew what I wanted to order everytime I came. I ended up working up the courage to ask for her number and she gave it to me. We ended up going on multiple dates and hung out a lot, she even invited me over for dinner with the people she lived with. We both really liked eachother and texted a lot but she just got out of an abusive relationship and wasn't ready to commit just yet. So I was patient with her. We did things like hold hands, cuddle and hug but I never tried to kiss her because I respected her boundaries and she was kinda iffy on the cuddling at times so the time never felt right. Things were moving really slow so I decided to give her some space and kinda moved on from her. 

I met another girl at a fraternity and sorority event on campus and we really hit it off. She had a dog so I approached her to pet her dog and that's what got us talking. We played some games together st the event and I ended up walking her back to her dorm where she gave me her number and gave me a hug before I left. We ended up going on several dates, I hung out with her at her dorm and she came to my house a few times where we just cuddled and watched TV. I never tried to kiss hercause at the time I haven't known her for very long but I probably could have looking back on it. We talked about being in a relationship, however we the time school was almost over and she was going back home to another state and neither of us wanted to do long distance so we decided to wait until next year if we were both feeling it. The last two weeks of school I was super busy and I didn't have much time to hangout with her and we both just became distant during that time. Found out she started talking to smother guy and they got into a relationship over the summer.

During summer the girl from the country club texted me back after 2 months of and said she regretted waiting, she missed me and she was ready for a relationship. At that point however I kinda just had enough of dating and I had moved on but I gave it a try because I really liked her before. We went to the bar one night, went on a date and I knee she was down for me but it was just kinda awkward and didn't feel right anymore so I told her that now I wasnt ready but I still wanted to be friends. She understood but we really haven't talked much since then and she found someone else. I turned 21 and started the next year of school (this year currently) qnd like before its just really hard to meet new people. I tried tinder but had very little success, I got one date but no follow up, tried to talk to a couple girls but they weren't interested, I dated one girl for a couple weeks but I knew I didn't want a relationship with her so I ended it, she was a cool person tho. Went several months without talking to anyone when I started texting one girl from my college the entirety of break and we hit it off really well. Went on one date after we got back on campus, haven't heard from her since. 

There was another girl I started texting off and on that was in the same major as me near the end of break and we seemed to hit it off so I asked if she would want to study sometime or get dinner one night and she said she would be down. I sat next to her in class and we went out for ice cream after class where we talked for almost 2 hours and we seemed to vibe well together. We ended up hanging out in her dorm a few times, and she seemed happy when I came over and says she had fun when it's time for me to go. I didn't make a move the first few times when I went out with her and hung out with her because I was just trying to get to know her and I wanted her to be comfortable. We really seemed to vibe and I really liked her. Finally the third time I came over I asked her if it was cool if I could put my arm around her which is when she told me she was already talking to someone. I was really dissapointed but kept it cool and I told her I really liked her. Genuinely enjoyed spending time with her, and I thought was really pretty. It made her happy and we still hangout and talk to eachother as friends however it was hard because I had to get over my feelings for her. 

Now here I am, 21 years old with some minimal success in dating but no luck in getting a relationship. I am still a virgin and I have a really high libito so I find myself watching porn more and more often when I have time and it just feels so empty. Granted I want me and my partner to be emotionally involved or be in a relationship before I start having sex but I just find myself really just wanting that physical and emotional connection with somebody and I'm afraid the older I get the harder it'd gonna be. I feel like most people my age have it figured out and have hit that milestone and there's me who is behind. I am afraid if things keep going the way they are going I'm never going to find love or ill just keep ruining my chances for a relationship. I have been trying to get out more, reaching out to more people, and going places where there is people but there's not a whole lot going on right now.

I am a 21M who didn't start dating until after high school when I was 18 due to low self confidence and self esteem. None of my attempts at dating or a relationship have gone anywhere and I'll explain more in this post. The first relationship I was in we talked for about a month, I stayed the night with her a couple times, we kissed and cuddled but no sex because I wasn't sure how to initiate it. We ended up breaking up due to my inexperience because I was still trying to figure things out which really took a toll on my self confidence. About 6 months later I met another girl and we really hit it off and started seeing eachother but she was really quiet and shy so it was kind of hard to talk to her sometimes. She also just got out of a 5 year long relationship so she wanted to take things slow but she did like me. She ended up coming over to cuddle and watch TV and we kissed multiple times. She was giving me signs that she wanted to have sex but I knew that wasn't taking things slow and I was too stupid not to act on them. Things ended up dying out cause we were going pretty fast to really slow and then she started talking to another guy at work and got into a committed relationship with him, turns out they were seeing eachother at the same time me and her were seeing eachother. That was another hit to my self confidence.

 I didn't see anyone for almost a year and a half after that despite trying to put myself put there, however I had really bad social anxiety, was battling depression, and just didn't have the self confidence. I didn't go out much because of that and I wasn't really sure where to go to meet people other than parties at my college which really wasn't a good environment for me, I just felt so uncomfortable at party's going by myself. Then COVID hit which did not make anything easier, I was 19 at the time. When I was 20 I went to a new college which felt really exciting and I felt like I could have a fresh start, however with covid everything was locked down, and it was just really hard to get to know people when you just go to class and go home so I joined a fraternity to get to know more people and those are the people I hung out with the most but no events were happening due to covid.

 I live on a country club and there's this resturant close to where I live that I went to a lot. There was a girl that worked there that was almost always my waiter and she knew what I wanted to order everytime I came. I ended up working up the courage to ask for her number and she gave it to me. We ended up going on multiple dates and hung out a lot, she even invited me over for dinner with the people she lived with. We both really liked eachother and texted a lot but she just got out of an abusive relationship and wasn't ready to commit just yet. So I was patient with her. We did things like hold hands, cuddle and hug but I never tried to kiss her because I respected her boundaries and she was kinda iffy on the cuddling at times so the time never felt right. Things were moving really slow so I decided to give her some space and kinda moved on from her. 

I met another girl at a fraternity and sorority event on campus and we really hit it off. She had a dog so I approached her to pet her dog and that's what got us talking. We played some games together st the event and I ended up walking her back to her dorm where she gave me her number and gave me a hug before I left. We ended up going on several dates, I hung out with her at her dorm and she came to my house a few times where we just cuddled and watched TV. I never tried to kiss hercause at the time I haven't known her for very long but I probably could have looking back on it. We talked about being in a relationship, however we the time school was almost over and she was going back home to another state and neither of us wanted to do long distance so we decided to wait until next year if we were both feeling it. The last two weeks of school I was super busy and I didn't have much time to hangout with her and we both just became distant during that time. Found out she started talking to smother guy and they got into a relationship over the summer.

During summer the girl from the country club texted me back after 2 months of and said she regretted waiting, she missed me and she was ready for a relationship.

Bro code. Hear me out. 

Me and this guy have been friends since early highschool (~6 years) and lived together for some time after highschool. He had a girlfriend and I had a girlfriend at the time. My ex and i broke up awhile ago and I found out that not too long ago, they broke up as well. 

Him and I stopped being friends because I found out he was screwing me out of utilities/move out fees. Every month he charged me an extra $30 so a portion of his was paid and then charged me ~$400 on move out, which covered his portion of fees. He got mad when I didn’t help him move his stuff out and I just said fuck off. He is currently moving across the country from what I understand and him and his ex (who I basically lived with) broke up.

Her and I are already pretty close, not as close as we used to be. Same interests, always got along really well, want to live in the same area upon graduation, and the same general career path. She did hint in the past (before they started dating) that she was interested in me. Even throughout their relationship I felt like she’d eye me a bit when I was with my ex and she’d send me suggestive tiktoks. She recently slid up on one of my Snapchat stories and we’ve been snap chatting back and forth, but I haven’t initiated conversation a whole lot because I’m unsure if I should go about this much less how I would.

I know it’s a dangerous game, but honestly the guy screwed me a bit. I forgave him, but don’t consider him a friend. He’s leaving, she’s around.

We made definite plans to meet again last Sunday but said maybe last Friday if she doesn't have too much work to do. That Wednesday night we spoke on the phone and talked about what we can do on the Friday. We didn't speak on Thursday. The Friday morning I texted her about getting food for that night. She sent back a break up message. Saying she knew that I wanted something serious and she was not ready for that. I asked her when did she realize that this wasn't going to work out, she said she realized that Thursday night. She said she'll like to still hang out as friends. I wished her well and we haven't spoken again since. It really sucks because I was going to ask her to me my girlfriend that night and this came out of the blue. I'm not mad or upset with her. She was kind and always honest. I'm just angry because I don't want to start over again getting to know someone only to hit a dead end.

This is a bit long post so I'm thanking you in advance for taking your time to read it. 
Recently I(24m) started talking to my ex gf(23f) a lot and after 2 months of talking we again decided to be in a long distanced relationship. As soon as we got into a relationship we decided to move in since we knew each other from past.  I thought it was too fast a move  and she was too serious about this relationship but I also got excited since I have  feelings for her so thought of moving in.  Upon getting serious, I started to invest a lot of time into the relationship and used to give her a lot of attention to her. She used to spam me with other every now and then during the day with each and every detail and being a nice boyfriend i used to listen to her for hours.  After few days I got attached and started missing her when she doesn't used to call me on the usual timings we used to talk. TBH I became a little clingy . I got too serious into this relationship and often used to talk about the near future(not about marriage and stuff ) and she also used to reply enthusiastically. After talking a lot about this maybe she got a hint that I was getting way too serious and freaked out a little and asked for a break. To which I panicked because I thought she was breaking up with me since it has only been a month . Hearing about the break made me upset and she  said she doesnt mean to break up and only meant a break and also  canceled the break seeing me this hurt. but said she is not too much serious about this relationship as I am rn  and only looking for a casual relationship where we can have fun together. I was a liitle shocked to hear this because she always used to say that she is  looking for ""the one  boyfriend ""and i thought being in a relationship with she saw that with me. On the other hand I also thought that even though I love her  I'm also not looking for something serious rn (serious as in serious commitment about marriage and all) and I was okay if we take things slow and  casual. But we were firm on moving in. 
After hitting this minor rough patch we started talking well again like before and again I started giving her a lot of attention . I  was addicted to her and whenever she used to call i couldn't resist myself picking up the phone. It lasted for a week when she got a little mad about some thing i said to her. We were talking about her job , and some things led to another and i ended up saying ""be careful, they better not remove from your job"". To which she got a little anxious but she overlooked this. We were again on the call the next day and she did she is feeling a lump in her face to which i panicked and said "" it might be a tumor"" .( I don't know why i said, maybe out of concern) but she got so panicked that she disconnected the call. She stopped talking to me altogether for 2 3 days. I apologized to her stating that i didn't mean those two statements. She said that she overreacted  too to the second statement but was kind of not okay with me making her anxious. I promised to never say such a thing .
We moved past this and started talking again. (I forgot to mention but she has an unusual schedule for her job to which she gets very little time for herself during the night). But this time we stopped talking like earlier. We used to talk but she used to seem disinterested in talking and used to get irritated whenever i used call her late. I started overthinking things that she is losing interest in me and doesn't wants to be with me anymore after those incidents. I felt a little insecure with the distance. 

After 2 3 days of not talking too much we talked today. 
Present day: I just got off with a call to her. She said that it does not seem feasible to move in rn since she is not ready to open and this is the practical thing to do . I agree to her completely that living together is a fast decision for us but i got hurt because i was looking forward to move in with her and got to thinking that she might be losing interest in me. I got afraid that this relationship is only going  downhill and i might be over soon. and i said the things that i was feeling a little distant lately to which she responds that things are a little tight at her job and she is unable to make time for me. She will call me whenever she finds free time. I said okay since we are not able to talk whenever i call her. 

It feels that I'm overthinking a lot in this relationship and it's making me a little immature in this relationship
From the starting I am getting proven wrong with all my intentions . Maybe I did something in the last 40 days that she is having second thoughts about me. Maybe she wants to be together and go a little slow or maybe she has genuinely lost interest in me and doesn't wants to be together.
I really don't know what to do.  I want to be with her . I am not only attached to her but also in love with her for many years. I don't want to lose her this time due to my stupidity of being too immature or something like that.  I will regret this all my life.  I am ready to give her the time and space that she requires. But i am again afraid that she will ghost me and will  never try to talk to me again. But then again i again feel if she is interested she will definitely come back. 

These are the thoughts in my mind.  These thoughts are not letting me sleep during the night. I want to attract her but instead I'm getting insecure and pushing her away.. I'm getting underconfident day by day.I am getting nervous around her day by day as what to say to her and the conversations are getting one sided. I need your advice as to how to react to this situation. Maybe i know the answers but i need to hear it from someone else.

I’ve gone through the 5 Stages, I’ve had my abandonment anxiety breakdown and have spent a lot of time simply just in shock. 

We met off Reddit. Hot and heavy super fast. Instant chemistry, similar pasts, similar interests and overall just got along super super well. She was my first partner, first lover, first everything and looking back that probably led to a lot of my vision being clouded on who she really is. 

I’m a relatively late bloomer at 24 years old. Nothing inherently wrong with me outside some anxiety but I do have some trauma with me in my past. Childhood neglect, 6+ years of grooming/abuse (teens) and a incident in which I was raped. She was the first one to validate my experiences, accept me anyways and show me what love and intimacy was like. While INCREDIBLY thankful for this, this again clouded my vision. I was love bombed HARD. 

My ex has her own traumatic past, abusive relationship history, commitment phobic (“I’m not good at conventional relationships) and a few other things (communication, stonewalling, lack of effort) that were huge red flags looking back. 

She was very avoidant/emotionally unavailable  and her Hot/Cold attitude often times left me feeling like I was fighting for scraps. She’d open up or have a lengthy conversation and then shut down for 3+ days. She very rarely let me in her inner world, almost never initiated/invited to hangouts, stonewalled/silent treated me often, didn’t communicate when she was busy/needed space and often kept me at arms length. 

I tolerated all of this because during our relationship she was constantly telling me how attentive of a partner I was, how listening and good of a lover I was, how I bought her flowers when she was stressed and how she enjoyed every hangout/intimate encounter we had. She said all these things and hit all the right buttons, but my efforts were never reciprocated and I often felt like I wasn’t doing enough. 

I’m starting to think she devalued me in the process, especially after our first “boundary crossing” talk in our entire 6+ months of dating. I caught her posting a nude to an NSFW sub and was taken completely back/uncomfortable. 

I brought it up cordially later while saying that the nude wasn’t the issue, but not discussing it with me beforehand and posting behind my back in an exclusive relationship was. She apologized, removed it without me asking and said she did it “Just because she felt like it. Wasn’t anything tied to the relationship or being in it. Didn’t reply to any messages or comments because that wasn’t the point. I’m sorry if you don’t understand” (paraphrasing) 

We reconciled, or so I thought, and went our separate ways afterwards. In the week that followed her replies became shorter, my affection/Verbal affirmation and love wasn’t reciprocated and things seemed to become tense. 

I eventually could feel something simmering (this is over text mind you) so a week later asked if there was anything on her mind she needed to address and anything I could fix. 

Blindsided with a breakup soon after. The breakup occurred over text, the day after the funeral of a family friend, on the day a personal friend died and 2 days before my first ever apartment move which she knew I was stressed about. 

Her reasoning  was that she felt “extremely under equipped to handle to emotional needs of a relationship”, that she just wanted to be alone and didn’t desire any romantic relationship with anyone at all. She also noted “I did nothing wrong” and that she still wanted to be friends because she “cared about me, had fun with me and because I was a good person”. Oh and because she couldn’t meet my wants/needs. 

All I wanted was my time to be treated with respect, some of my efforts to be reciprocated and not to be abandoned at the first sign of conflict. The bare minimum basically. Every hangout/intimate need was met and we had GREAT times when hanging out.

No communication, no fixing simple things, nothing. 

Yea well, in the 3 weeks that have followed I’ve gotten a friendly reply maybe twice, have been stonewalled again and my friend says he caught her now on Tinder/Bumble (waiting on screenshots) after she said the breakup wasn’t because she needed or wanted anyone else. Guess that feels safer vs deepening emotional intimacy. 

I’m starting to see how she devalued me in the time leading up to the BU. She decided I wasn’t right for her without even giving me a chance to do right. This is from someone who in the weeks before was describing me as “Amazing, worthy, attentive, great in bed, very attractive and that I love you so much” etc etc. Also someone who knows I’d done everything to fix an issue we may have been having. 

I just feel very sad I loved someone so much and gave gave gave EVERYTHING , through all the lovebombing and red flags, and she in the end didn’t even value me and may be doing the one thing she promised never to do, replace me.

I never tore her down for a schedule change (multiple times), needing space, being busy with school, her multiple chronic conditions or if she wasn’t feeling up for intimacy. She never took up my offers of support/help, very rarely complimented me unless asked, hardly went out of her way to initiate and often times just left me confused. 

I’m starting to feel that despite all of her affirming words, I was simply a 6 month rebound for healthy intimacy (she said I was once of the first to give her that), companionship and validation. 

I feel used, devalued and confused as fuck. 
I feel like I was love bombed, idealized, devalued, compartmentalized and now discarded without a second thought. 

In the 3 weeks that have followed the breakup I’ve gotten 3 interactions with her. One 2 weeks ago in which she said she was going through some anxiety and family problems (didn’t reply to my reply)

Another a week ago in which she asked about my new apartment move (didn’t reply to my reply) 

And one a few days ago in which she left me on read after a message I sent. 

All of this happening, plus the events surrounding the breakup, brought out a big emotional/trauma relapse from me which I’m very much ashamed of. If anyone knows Snapchat messages you’d know that when you delete a message it’ll say “You deleted X chats”. I’ve been such a anxious wreck at being blind sided/ghosted/breadcrumbed/possibly cheated on that I have a bunch of those over the last two weeks as I’ve reached out and tried to articulate my thoughts. I never thought I’d be that devastated again. 

Her indifference, switch flipping and then finding out she maybe doing what she said she would never (monkey branch off me) broke me. 

Today I reached out, told her how I was feeling and how I couldn’t be the  friend she wanted and support her if all I was going to get was breadcrumbs and feeling like I hardly existed. 

I was honest and stood up for myself for the first time in 6months. I didn’t invalidate her past experiences, chronic conditions, depression/anxiety, sudden aromantic orientation or anything. 

Still, I don’t think I deserve to be treated like an option. Especially after she broke every promise she made to me and made me feel like I wasn’t important enough to fight for. All I ever wanted was the bare minimum. All I wanted was for my time to be valued, not to be stonewalled and strung along and for some appreciation. 

I have a lot to work on with my anxiety, setting firmer/more boundaries, recognizing a need for space more (hard if it isn’t communicated!!) and taking it a lil slower. But I’m so conflicted, I can’t help feel like I was used. 

When we were in the person and it was high it was HIGH. But the lows were so fucking low and I’m so confused, especially by the lack of communication. She said she loved me and said the words, but it eventually felt so forced.. no matter how much reassurance, affection, patience and inquiring into her needs (which she never could tell me!) I gave.

I need help understanding.

We knew immediately it was there. After the 3rd date I asked her to be my girlfriend. She was so happy.

 Fast forward 4 weeks and she told me she was falling in love with me. I told her i have those strong feelings too. (It just felt a little early using that word and I wanted to save it for the future when the meaning would be more powerful.)

We text every day, see each other after work everyday, we can't go home at night (at a decent) hour because nobody wants to leave. The sex is amazing. Intimacy is amazing. We don't leave the bed unless we are desperate for food or water. She said she has never felt like this before. (I have, I recognized what was happening, and I was happy and ready for this in my life)

It was eye to eye, there wasn't any cat and mouse games. We felt the same. We took steps together with talking about how we feel. It's so rare to find this. 

She not only accepts my faults but finds the beauty in them. She goes out of her way for me as I do for her. All the right stuff is there.

She works in a doctors office as a manager, this girl is a ray of sunshine even on her worst days. She's a positive pleasure to be around. She's an absolute gift to this world and anyone she comes in contact with. Everyone loves her.

She's quality, and I gave her my very best and it was effortless. I deleted all the apps, I stopped replying dm's from other girls. I cleared everything for her. I valued this and nothing was going to ruin it from my past. 


Since this is so new, she had a trip planned for her birthday last weekend to see family in another state. This was no problem for me. I couldn't go.

When she came back the moment we got off work we spent the whole night together. I leaned into her and said, ""Is it really okay for me to trust you with my feelings?"" It was a very romantic moment where I was planning to tell her how i felt. Well, until she pulled her head back and said, ""I need to tell you something."" 

This is when she told me that on her birthday trip her ex she dated for 10 years who lives in Milan or Malaysia (can't remember) gave her a paid trip to spend a week together in 30 days. (Was he there? Idk) She said yes. She thinks it's a trip of a lifetime and doesn't want to miss it. Apparently, he lives there.

I was stunned. She said she hasn't had sex with him in the last 3 years of the 10-year relationship and that she made sure they weren't going to sleep in the same bed together. (Was this a white lie? Not sure)

(What I know is that's all the bullshit I'd try if I wanted to bang an ex. I'd let my words and eyes do the leg work in that setting, and I'd wager I'd be highly successful.)

But come on, romantic vacation, multiple days together, drinking late into the night with someone in paradise? This guy isn't seeing anyone who would care? Why is he spending all this money on her? Why does he want to spend all this time with her? If your done your done and you don't do this. He's probably fucking lonely and flexed his wallet and destroyed our new relationship. She's probably too naive to see that. 


So I questioned her will power and sex drive with alcohol on a paradise vacation, and I think I got a shoulder shrug before the topic was changed. She said her friends told her to lie about who invited her on the trip and that she felt honesty would be best. (Great friends)

I told her immediately that this is a poison pill. It'll affect me every time I think about her. Every positive thought was now being overshadowed by this situation. I already have trauma from an ex that left me for a rich guy after 5 years and a proposal. 

She didn't budge or back off on the trip. She cried on my shoulder while talking in the car with me explaining how I perceive the situation. I can still feel those tears. Not once did she attempt to compromise.


We met again the next day, I tried my best and we just ignored it and didn't talk about it. Who am I to tell her she can't go on this trip? What right do I have?


Well, after 2 days, I think I have the right to not feel a pit in my stomach, which is causing me a lot of emotional anxiety and distrust. 

So today while we were at work, the following texts were sent. 

My Text:
""I want you to know that your trip is dominating my thoughts about you. I can't enjoy the feeling of new sparks because that trip is in the room like a 800lb gorilla. It was even in my dreams last night. This is a poison pill.""

Her reply: 
""I'm really sorry. It wouldn't be fair of me to ask you to be ok with it. What would you like to do?""

My Text:
""I think that if you aren't done spending time and creating memories with your ex then we should stop seeing each other. ""

Her reply: 
""I completely understand. I've really enjoyed getting to know you, our time together has been really wonderful and I'm sad to see you go. I'm truly sorry that our timing didn't work out. Maybe at some point in the future we'll be able to reconnect.""

(A corporate response if I ever saw one, might as well of been a letter from human resources)

My final reply:
""I hope the trip brings you more happiness than what you gave up.""


Yeah, I'm hurt. But something isn't right here. Clearly, I'm not getting all the details. I'm not going to give her my heart if this is in her wheelhouse of capabilities. I feel like I need to protect myself and that letting her into my heart now is wreckless. 


I can't believe this just happened. I'm just moving back and forth between anger and sadness. I can't eat. I can't even work right now. All I could do is write this. How could a trip like that be more important than falling in love? That's a red flag you can see from space. I'm not going to ignore it. Whatever I feel now would be 100x worse in the future.

My issue was that the consistent effort only lasted the first couple of weeks. Then he became very inconsistent. He would shower me with attention one day then breadcrumb me for days. I told him I have anxiety and an anxious attachment style and that I need consistency and more than bare minimum. He told me he’s really busy. He didn’t apologize. He didn’t show me empathy. I felt like I was bothering him my expressing my needs. It seemed like he wanted me to be patient and understanding about his schedule and bend to him, but I did not get the same in return from him regarding my needs and wants. It didn’t seem like he was really trying anymore for the most part. And I felt like I had whiplash. 

Yesterday I saw something on IG that triggered me and I got really upset and fired off a strong text. I acted out of pure emotion. It was irrational. I shouldn’t have done it. But because I was sitting on my concerns out of fear of “bothering him,” all of my concerns basically had bubbled up to the top. I didn’t curse or call him names, but it was clear I was upset. I said there had been no improvement and I felt like my needs weren’t being taken seriously. And that I was going to take a step back. 
He basically said he thought that was a good idea and that I had pushed him away by questioning his interest levels. He said he had “grown tired” of trying to convince me of his interest. Despite being very inconsistent and therefore confusing me. I had only questioned his interest twice. 

So it’s done now but I’m dealing with a lot of shame, guilt and I’m beating myself up big time. I feel like I really ruined this. I know he wasn’t really meeting me halfway but I just keep feeling like this is all my fault and I should’ve just ridden it out until I got down there permanently. 

How do you all deal with guilt after a breakup?

I met him at university, and I've known him for half a year now. He's flirted with me in the past, and I'm pretty sure he likes me. Even if he doesn't see me in a romantic light, he at the very least finds me attractive. He's a nerdy guy, and likes a lot of anime/video game characters. He has little crushes on them.

In high school, he was in a three year long relationship with a Korean girl. He and I grew up in the same hometown, where the population is predominantly Hispanic. Asians only make up about 3% of the population. On Instagram, he follows several Asian pride accounts, and when he posts stories of political awareness, 95% of the time, it's regarding Asian pride/rights, even though he himself is Hispanic. There's a girl at our school who I know for a fact he doesn't like, but finds her really pretty. She's half Filipino half white.

The reason why this concerns me is because I'm part Asian. My great grandfather was Chinese, so I'm barely even Asian, but I've had several people tell me that I look Asian. Even people that are Asian themselves tell me that I look like I can be half Asian. People are surprised when I tell them I'm only 1/8th. My friend even told me the other day that the way I do my makeup makes me look even more Asian (I regret not asking her what she meant by that, but I'll ask her the next time I see her). I asked my brother later if I look more Asian the way I do my makeup, and he said yes. So in all likelihood, my crush probably thinks I look Asian.

Overall just seems like a really great person and a true gentleman. He lives alone, and I’ve been spending a lot of time at his place since I have a roommate. He offers to come to my place but I feel bad imposing on my roommate, and appreciate the privacy and comfort of his cozy apartment, so I usually just insist on going there. Unfortunately he lives on the other side of the city and it takes me almost an hour to get to and from my place to his. Since I sleep over there some weeknights, and he knows I don’t love working from home in my bedroom, he offered to let me stay after our sleepovers and work out of his place. He left me a key to get in and out of the building when I need to and said I can hold onto it since he has a second set. I know this isn’t normal that he trusts me this much so early into the relationship, but is it possible he really is just being kind and generous in letting me stay? Am I naive to believe he really just wants to take our relationship seriously (we’ve had many conversations about how we feel about each other and want to be in each other’s lives for a long while) or is this something that should concern me, because it feels like we’re moving really fast? One detail that may help explain his trust for me is that he came to stay with me a couple of weeks ago at my parent’s vacation home and I did something similar - left him alone with a set of keys so he could work while I ran errands.

I’ve been single for 3 years. My son is 3 years old which I have 95 percent of the time. He only sees his father every other weekend and sometimes he misses visits. Well I am currently going through those “Terrible Twos” that has moved on to the threes. Lol. I have a boyfriend who I have been seeing for a while (he was a friend before a boyfriend) we have gotten serious, talked about our future plans together. He always talks about his plans as a family including my son in them. Well there is times that my son throws “tantrums” or he screams and my boyfriend redirects him and tells him to stop, or that he shouldn’t be crying. He usually wants him to sit still when we go places. He is not used to being with kids. He is always working, so he only sees my son one day out of the weekend, if he is not with dad. So I really think he is just not used to being around small kids, specially at the age where kids want to do what they want. I know my son is at a hard stage right now, I get tired too. I don’t know if I am wrong but I get bothered when he tells my son things, he isn’t mean to him but he does tell him to stop, or he does try to be firm with him in situations. Last time my son was so mad because he didn’t get a toy at the store that he carried him out the store crying. My son was crying more because he wanted to come to me for comfort, but he kept saying no. I got in it and said just put him down, he can walk you don’t need to be carrying him if he doesn’t want too. Well he put him down, and walked to the car upset. He said “I was only trying to help you, and you get upset I really don’t know how to help you. I try but you get mad” Another time, we were at a store again and my son was crying on the floor because he wanted a lollipop, when my boyfriend walked by me and seen him on the floor crying, he walked to him, picked him up out of the nowhere without even asking and just took him outside the store. I don’t know if I am just being an over protective mom or if he is crossing boundaries. I know he is trying to help, but sometimes I feel like he is doing too much.

I’m a 24F and I’ve never been in a relationship. I try to be honest and communicate what I was but honestly I have trouble and am a people pleaser so I end up getting fucked over pretty often by people who manipulate and mislead me. 

I was recently seeing this guy that had put he was interested in a relationship on his profile. We went on a date, I felt like the vibes were fun and flirty and I ended up going back to his place. 

It’s my boundary to not do anything without proper protection but i got caught up in the moment and let it slide. He never asked, but I also should have communicated rather than going along with it enthusiastically. It wasn’t until afterwards I realized I might have been ovulating and I could get pregnant. That caused me a great deal of stress and I felt not only upset with myself but upset that he never asked if that was ok. 

When I saw him again I ended up having a panic attack about possibly having to get an abortion and his response to my vulnerability was that I cried too much and ruined the vibe. I had told him that I was interested in more than a sexual relationship and he said that he did too, but his actions didn’t match that all.  When I asked him if he ever saw anything serious with me after our first date he said mostly no. Which bothers me because he still brought me back to his place knowing our intentions didn’t align. 

I feel like I just keep getting screwed over and I seriously was sitting in my roomates car contemplating suicide.

We didn’t date at the time as A. I didn’t have the confidence to pursue her and B. She was adamant about moving away for college. However, we stayed close friends and visited eachother a few times per year. Once she graduated with her Master’s she decided to move back to our hometown town to be together.

Our friend group is still similar (for those that didn’t move away). So we often still all get together from time to time. There’s 3 main people that I will be talking about in my scenario . We will call them Andy, Andy’s twin brother Tyler, and then a mutual friend named Luke (Luke went to a different school). Andy was known for being pretty immature and for having some anger problems (especially when it came to women he had dated).

So, current day, Andy recently came by to help his brother Tyler move out of my house (Tyler and I are close and I’ve been renting him a room for a few years). When he came by, he saw my gf and they casually said hi, hugged, and said “long time no see, how have things been”. No biggie it seemed. Well this interaction triggered a past thought of what took place senior year of High school. 


Here’s the story:
My girlfriend and Andy “talked” and hung out a few times over the course of a week or so, during senior year and one day she told him that she didn’t want to pursue anything further than that. 

Andy comes to school and tells our friend group that she and him had drank over the weekend at our mutual friend Luke’s house and that they had sex. He also walked behind her calling her rude / vulgar names in the hallway in front of some of the guys. All of these years, I never really put much thought into it. I didn’t see why he would lie and she never really gave him any attention (she was quite reserved and to herself)

So fast forward to current day, my gf and I start talking about our “pasts”. At one point, I ask her, “didn’t you sleep with Andy”? She looked puzzled and then let out a laugh and asked if I was referring to the rumor he started in highschool. 

I said yes, that’s what I’m referring to. She says, “we literally hung out for a week and we  didn’t do anything physical at all, not even a kiss”. So I remind her of the story - that he claimed they went to Luke’s house to drink and then had sex there. 

She responded with “you know I didn’t drink in highschool and I don’t have any idea who that Luke guy even is. I can promise you that I never drank with them, never went to that house, and never did anything physical with Andy. If it would make you feel better, I’m happy to sit down with everyone and clear the air”.

Her story is the following:
“He drove me home one day and when we arrived, I told him I didn’t want to continue hanging out. He stared at me silently for a moment, reached across me, opened my door and said “get the f out” (which I could happening with the anger issues he had). Then the next day is when you saw him at school telling everyone he slept with me. I assume his ego was hurt and he was just trying to impress everyone.”

His story back then was: “We went to Luke’s house to drink and we had sex twice that night. Then she came to my parents house with her ex bf to tell me she was getting back with him, that’s how things ended with us”.

So back to current day, I want to clear the air up. So I bring it up to Andy’s twin brother Tyler (the closer of the brothers to me and the one who rented a room from me). He says  “I always assumed they did as we were all at Kyle’s house drinking that night and they went into a room together”.

I tell my gf this and she calmly says “he has to be mistaking me for someone else, as once again - I didn’t drink, I don’t know Kyle, and I didn’t have sex with Andy.”

So one day I bring it up to Kyle (the house it supposedly happened at). He looks puzzled and said “I don’t even know her. She hasn’t been to my house and I’ve never drank with her”

My gf has been extremely patient with me, offered to sit with them and clear the air (years later) and even attended a therapy session I go to weekly, where the counselor talked about it openly with her. When she left my counselor said “I’ve been doing this for 40 years and am trained to look for lies in body motion, eye movement, voice tone, and much more. I 100% believe she’s telling you the truth.”

Yet the fact that Tyler (my close friend) said she was there, has really got my mind turning. I have OCD and any “unknown” triggers the crap out of me. 

After 15 years of friendship and confining in eachother, I don’t see why she would lie. Lets say hypothetically she lied about sex with him, but I wouldn’t imagine she would lie about petty stuff such as that they never even kissed or about how it ended.

Yes, online dating is difficult. But it usually does not work out for people, realistically, unless they are within an easy commute (max 45 minutes apart, really). Your goal in online dating is to meet someone, see if they fit, and start to date them, ideally within about two weeks of ""meeting"" online. 

Next to no one should be talking online or texting for one, two, or three months before meeting up. There's no real way to judge who the person is or whether they are a match for you. It's a potential recipe for heartache, expensive travel costs, safety issues, scamming, and disappointment.

I think that problem mainly comes down to my sexuality. I have a high sex drive so it’s hard for me to be alone as it’s boring just masturbating or using toys.

So I keep having sex and hooking up with shitty men as in the back of my head if they were gone from my life then I wouldn’t miss them either way.

Whereas with the patient men that wait for me I tend to push them away as I feel like I’m not good enough for them.

We met via a dating app in September and became exclusive in October. She was my first girlfriend. First kiss... first everything really. For the most part, our relationship was great. We had fun, stimulating conversations. We confided in each other about personal things. We never fought and it always felt easy to talk to each other. 

But then, in mid-January, she revealed to me that she had been having doubts about our relationship. She said that "" there's the logical part of my brain that says no issue but my gut sings a different tune"".  

A week later, she broke up with me. She kept saying that ""on paper, you have all the things I would want in someone"" and ""I wanted to like you as much as you like me. I really wanted to. But four to five months later, I felt the same as in the beginning"". 

I'm still new to the whole dating scene. It's just so perplexing. I understand that sometimes, relationships just lose traction. But I still feel like I did someone wrong. I tried to be as caring and attentive as much as I could. I really liked her and I always tried to let her know how special she was to me. 

I feel like I failed. I feel like I disappointed her. And being on the receiving end of a breakup definitely sucks. I feel undesirable and worthless. 

Throughout my teens and twenties, I had a number of very close female friends. But I never even thought about dating until 28. I thought I didn't have what it took to make a long-term relationship work. I thought I didn't have the emotional bandwidth for the emotional stakes involved in a romantic relationship. I finally took a chance a few months ago....and now I feel like my suspicions of myself were true. And no matter how hard I try, I'll never be able to reach the mark.

We met off Reddit. Hot and heavy super fast. Instant chemistry, similar pasts, similar interests and overall just got along super super well. She was my first partner, first lover, first everything and looking back that probably led to a lot of my vision being clouded on who she really is. 

I’m a relatively late bloomer at 24 years old. Nothing inherently wrong with me outside some anxiety but I do have some trauma with me in my past. Childhood neglect, 6+ years of grooming/abuse (teens) and a incident in which I was raped. I mention this because she was the first one to validate my experiences, accept me anyways and show me what love and intimacy was like. While INCREDIBLY thankful for this, this again clouded my vision. Here’s the red flags I missed and things I put up with in our time together. 

- “I’m a dysfunctional person in a lot of ways and am scared because I know I’m not good at conventional relationships which are difficult for me.” Should’ve ran right there. 

- Never accepted my offers of support/listening ear/etc. Rarely reciprocated my efforts and often left me confused on what she really felt. Said thank you only when I was leaving her place or if I got her flowers when she was stressed. 

- Very hot/cold treatment. Would open up for a day or two and have a conversation and then shut down or be very distant for 3 days after. NEVER told me when she needed space, even when I asked her to do so. 

- Kept conversations often at a surface level. Very rarely let me into her inner world and again when she did, she’d shut down for some time after.

- Rarely invited/initiated anything. I always the one asking to hangout, always the one suggesting places to go to, always the one asking about her day and interests.

- Never prioritized me at all. Said all the right things to keep me drawn in. Talked about how I was such an attentive partner, good listener, good lover, etc but I constantly felt like one foot was out the door the entire time.

- Actions didn’t match with words. I’d ask her for some reassurance or to check in on me or anything and she’d do it once then never again or not until asked again. 

-Silent treated me often/Could not communicate her feelings even when I gave her all the space in the world and was as patient as could be. 

- Caught her posting a nude to Reddit a week before the blindsided breakup. When I brought it up cautiously she gave me the “It’s not about being in a relationship or anything tied to at all. I just like doing it and wasn’t responding to any comments or messages because that wasn’t the point.” This is the SAME nude I complimented her on extensively a few days before after it got sent to me. 

- Blindsided me over text after saying she’d been thinking about it and leading me on for a month. No communication, no fixing anything, no anything. This is after she spent the entire month calling me “Worthy, amazing, a great partner, lover, thanks for coming over etc” 

- Said she didn’t want a relationship with anyone, that it wasn’t about wanting or needing anyone else, and that I did nothing wrong BUT is on Tinder days later after saying I wasn’t replaceable.

- Said she wanted to remain friends but has breadcrumbed me twice and ghosted me on read the last time (which she knows sets off my anxiety HARD) . How can I be friends with someone who flipped the switch and now treats me like I barely exist at all? 

There’s a few more I’ll post likely think about. If the app allows me to edit I’ll add it in. 

- I deserve so much better than breadcrumbs
- I deserve so much better than Hot/Cold
- I deserve so much better than feeling like a option/hookup
- I deserve so much better than someone who easily replaces me. 
- I deserve so much better than someone who makes promises and breaks every single one
- I deserve so much better than someone who bails at the first confrontation 
- I deserve so much better and someone who shows me I’m enough, not just says it. 
- I deserve so much better than feeling like I was a 6 month rebound. 

I deserve better. You do too.

I met a guy online 10 years ago. We were always friends and sometime in April 2021, we started dating and we met for the first time in December 2021. The first day meeting went really well. We clicked immediately and it felt natural. However, months before we met, I made it very clear I would not be comfortable with him staying at my house as it was our first time meeting and for all I knew, it could’ve went wrongly however the entire trip, he kept asking could he come over and could he stay at mine. 

A few days into the trip, we were being intimate. I don’t want to go into graphic detail, but he had went down on me and then right after, he asked if I could go down on him. It’s not something I enjoy doing and it was quite obvious that I wasn’t up for it. But he kept asking and said that because he went down on me, that I could “return the favour.” First of all, is this normal? Is it normal for someone to say that kind of thing?

Another couple days pass. I suffer from a chronic illness that can cause pain during sex when I’m having a flare up. A flare up had started that morning and when I got to the hotel, I told him I didn’t want to have sex as I was in too much pain. His response was “well do you think you could help me get off?” It was like he had no concern for me at all. And then when I said no to that, he turned away from me. He wouldn’t cuddle me or anything. I asked why he wouldn’t cuddle me and he said “I can’t cuddle you when I’m horny”.  Again, what is this? Is it normal? 

When I bring the above matter up to him, his literal words were that it’s all in my head and that “he thought I’d still wanna do something else despite the pain”.

On that same night, he didn’t even walk me outside while I waited on a cab home at 3am. And when I mention that to him, he says “nobody forced you to stand outside” etc. Again, is this normal? Am I exaggerating by being upset by that? 

Another thing about this guy is that we admitted to me he watches gore videos...I have always found this weird and don’t understand why he does it. It just makes me feel weird, but once again, it’s another thing I’ve tried to sweep under the carpet.

I know it sounds crazy, but I’m still with him and I’m supposed to be flying to see him tomorrow, but here I am having second thoughts and no clue what to do.

Would really appreciate any thoughts on it all! Here it goes..

So, I’ve been friends with this girl for 6 years through work. We’re both 24, about to turn 25. We started as apprentices together and have stayed really close friends since, despite us both taking different paths with work. 

When I first met her, she was already in a long term relationship. I’d met this guy a few times on nights out but that’s as much as I got to know of him. They always seemed like they were gonna move out together, get married, all that. 

Then in June 2020, I met up with her for a catch up where she told me they’d split up. She explained that he was still too immature, didn’t talk to her enough, didn’t take enough interest anymore - she’d outgrown him and things had been stale between them for a while. After lockdown, they realised things weren’t the same between them so they ended it. 

I met her again a month after that for a catch up, and things all of a sudden felt different with her. More flirty. We met up again a few weeks after where we both got drunk and ended up kissing. We were both quite open in saying it felt weird. I told her there’s a lot I like about her and she felt the same. But she explained it was quite soon after her breakup and she didn’t wanna rush anything. 

In that moment, she told me that she wanted to know more about me for it to go any further. She knew I’ve had a lot of personal issues with my family I’ve been dealing with for years which I’d never fully explained to her. She wanted to know the real me, which I liked. We agreed to see eachother again a few weeks later and see how it went. 

This time we agreed to go for dinner and cinema. But this time was different. I went into it telling myself that I was gonna tell her all about my personal issues, as she’d asked for. I massively regret this, because it killed the vibe completely. Instead of it being flirty and fun, I was anxious and only thinking about what I was gonna tell her at some point that evening. She even told me she had a free house, but I took that as an opportunity to tell her about my personal issues. Complete idiot, I know. Which I massively regret. Eventually we ended up round hers where I was fully open with her about my family problems - deep shit which, at the time, I wasn’t comfortable telling anyone. But I loved that she wanted to know more about it, so I did it. 

After telling her all the details, she was understanding and appreciated it, but admitted herself that she should’ve never asked for that info. The vibe was just off completely. She started telling me that she wasn’t sure about we were doing. Essentially felt like she was friendzoning me, but her main reasons being that it was too soon and she didn’t wanna upset her ex. I told her I understood, but that she shouldn’t be thinking about her ex anymore. We agreed to not see eachother for a few months and give ourselves space. 

I was gutted. I shouldn’t have given her all that info and killed the fun or it all. I made things dark and intense just because she asked for it. I shoulda been smarter and waited til the time was right.

3/4 months passed and we met again. She told me she’d met her ex to leave things on sweeter terms. But she told me she still had no feelings for him. There was no flirting involved between us. But she was texting me in the following weeks about meeting up again and going cinema/mini golf/bowling. “Date” kinda vibes. We met again a couple months later and went for drinks and mini golf, had a great evening, little bit of flirting, but nothing happened. She followed that with more texts suggesting we should go cinema/etc, but I was putting it off as I didn’t wanna do this “date” kinda stuff if it wasn’t going anywhere.

We met a few months after that for drinks and a catch up. I told her about some girls I’d been seeing and slept with since I last saw her, and she told me how she’s been talking to some guys. But we both came to the same conclusion that none of them were going anywhere serious. 

We planned to meet a few months after that for a catch up, but she broke her foot and was in crutches. Few weeks after that, she was telling me about how she really wanted to see a new film but had no one to go with, so I agreed to take her. Went well again, but she was telling me about how she was talking to her ex again because he’d lost a close family member and was a mess. She told me again she had no feelings for him, but felt obliged to check up on him because she knew his family well. Which I thought was understandable, but told her to be careful with speaking to him again. 

Month or so after that, we’ve met up again - which was tonight. She’s no longer on crutches and we went for drinks. Was a really good night. She’s told me about how her ex has been asking her to go on dates and see how it feels now, but she’s not sure on it. She’s felt lonely over the last couple months with her broken foot and lack of company, so she doesn’t wanna see him again just because she misses the company. I told her she needs to be sure how she feels about him before seeing him again - which she told me she’s not sure at all. After that chat, we had more drinks and things started getting flirty again. Really flirty. Nothing’s happened, but I’ve got a similar feeling from it that I did when first met her after she split up with her ex in June 2020. Something felt different tonight - we both really enjoyed eachother’s company. 

It just seems like a constant yo-yo. I definitely like her otherwise I wouldn’t be thinking about it this much, to the point where I’m reaching out here for advice. And I still get the feeling from her that she does like me. But, because we’ve been there and things got a bit awkward, neither of us wanna try taking it to that next level again. But we both effortlessly enjoy time with eachother. Things got a bit touchy tonight and close up. She was giving all the signs that she still likes me - touching her hair, touching my knees/arms/feet, happily staying out for my drinks with me, laughing at my jokes, asking me questions about my life, opening up herself. To me these are all signs that part of her still likes me and entertains the idea of seeing how things go again with me. 

So the question is - do you think I’m right? And, if you think I am, how should I play this going forward?

Has anyone else experienced a similar thing?

We will be fine for a week or two and then something will come up where we have to talk about and both end up feeling off for a day or two. It’s an endless cycle where she presses so hard to fix things right away, I pull away, and she chases. She has a long history of OCD, ROCD, and abandonment issues. I love her dearly and don’t blame her for any of this. However, it’s slowly began to affect our relationship. I’m part of this too where I didn’t know how to deal with it properly to help either of us at first. Many nights I’d spend having to convince her I wanted to be in the relationship and that I cared for her as much as she did me. It was very tiring and took a toll on our relationship. We both strive to be our best every day and some days one of us shows up better than the other. We have the mutual desire to grow as individuals and together, but I feel like this is all we do. She has spent a lot of time working on herself and therapy, and I can see that. It’s always long discussions on where we are going and me defending myself and my love for her. It’s only been a few months and I feel like a relationship shouldn’t be this hard this early. Due to her history and anxiety we have to be on the same page with everything or else she gets very anxious and digs for an answer until I “am” on the same page as her or I will be one day. This happened when she said I love you early into the relationship. I expressed that I wasn’t there emotionally yet, but that I cared for her immensely and was very happy with how our relationship was going. This was a big problem and she almost left me. I am a very flexible person and am happy to compromise, but I feel like she wants me to be a certain way when things come up and if I’m not there it’s a problem. She doesn’t get angry, just super anxious and I can feel her get uncomfortable and not able to see how I can feel differently about a subject than her. So, last week we talked and I told her I needed a break. The anxious/avoidant cycle was killing us and out relationship was getting unhealthy. We tried for weeks to work on it with no progress. On day 5 of the break, no talking, and it’s killing me. I know it’s for the best and I told her that I really just needed time to focus on myself and try and feel re-grounded again. Ive gotten texts since then about how deeply I’ve hurt her and her trust, and she felt completely blindsided by the whole thing, she doesn’t deserve to be treated like this, etc. I can understand her being upset and sad, but its upsetting to feel like your partner is trying to make you feel badly about a decision you’ve made for yourself in a long term positive light. So, next week we are planning on talking and trying to make a gameplan going forward on how we can best go about our issues. I feel so emotionally removed and sad, I don’t know what to do. I’m worried things may get better for a bit, but go back to the cycle they were in before where I feel like I can’t please her, and she feels like I’m pulling away. Just need advice/help. I don’t want this to be the end of our relationship, but I also don’t know if we are both healed enough to be with someone right now. She hasn’t been single since her last breakup of april/21 for more than a couple weeks at a time. I’ve been single for 2 years prior to her.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158375,public,self,Worried about my relationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/spmre6/worried_about_my_relationship/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,
