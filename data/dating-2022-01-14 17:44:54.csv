I usually start the convos a bit more often, but she starts them as well.

3,s46bvn,1642204341,I don't know if I'm in love with my boyfriend ?,"(sorry for my english)

I met my boyfriend (we're both 19) in november and we started dating at the end of december so it's only been a few weeks. Everything is going very well but I'm extremely confused about my feelings because he's my very first relationship.

He's a very good guy, I like him a lot, I love spending time with him, I love cuddling and kissing him, he's handsome, funny, respectful, we like the same things,... he's basically almost everything I was hoping to find in a partner. The thing is that I don't think I have any ""strong"" feelings for him.

I don't know how to explain it but I've only had one crush in my life and the feelings I had for this guy were super strong. I had butterflies in my stomach almost all the time and I couldn't stop thinking about him (dw I got over this crush a looong time ago and I don't have any feelings for him anymore). And I just... don't have that with my boyfriend, even if I'd like to. I sometimes have small bursts of butterflies when I think about us kissing or whatever, but it's rare and not nearly as strong as what I felt with that crush.

So yeah it confuses me a lot because even if I really like my boyfriend I feel like I'm not *in love* with him. I also feel like I'll never get that strong feeling I had with my old crush back and it kinda saddens me because it felt good.

He's my first boyfriend so I obviously have nothing to compare him to except that crush so maybe I'm a bit biaised, and I thought I might need some time but at the same time the feelings I had for my previous crush came almost right away so yeah I don't know. Maybe just I don't fall in love easily and that crush was just a stroke of luck ? Will I ever get these feelings again ??

Do you guys have any advice or experience to share on this ? At this point I just don't know what love is anymore lol

4,s46e6k,1642204536,BF wants to watch me hook up with another guy?,"My boyfriend (25M) wants to watch me (21F) have sex with another man?

I’m not sure how to go about dealing with this situation. This is my 1st relationship that I was lucky to meet my BF through a mutual friend.

My BF keeps trying to get me to have sex with another guy when I already told him I wasn’t interested multiple times.

Well on his birthday last week I caved in and decided to maybe try it and ended up chickening out after I saw the guy and his penis.

I figured that it would maybe be his friend or someone we both knew, but it was just some stranger that he met from tinder. He also said he wanted to watch me perform various sexual acts such as deep throat and anal, which he knows I don’t like since it hurts to do and see if I could make it work even though the guy was definitely quite a bit larger than my BF.

Ever since then we’ve been distant as he feels like I’m not trusting of him and lied since I didn’t go through with it when I chickened out and ruined his birthday.

I’m just new to the whole dating scene and I don’t really understand why he would want to watch me hook up with another guy. Like we both agreed to be exclusive when we started dating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s46e6k/bf_wants_to_watch_me_hook_up_with_another_guy/

7,s46ik5,1642204864,I have a sinking feeling that my long distance date is about to ghost me before meeting,"I (22F) have been talking to a guy (28M) long distance for almost 6 months. We are getting pretty serious, or so I thought. He’s coming up to visit me in less than a week, or so he said just 5 days ago when we talked on the phone. If he backs out last minute then I have my answer. He even told me he took several days off of work for this. He lives about a 10 hour drive away. We have talked everyday since we first started chatting. Usually all day long. We have intentions to date after meeting in person, one of us will move closer to the other. We have talked about the future and all that. Like meeting parents, work, etc. We have talked about how we are both long term people. We video chat, call, and text on the regular. He’s been pretty great so far. I mean we have so much in common and he’s easy to talk to. To be clear, I have verified his identity. In addition to video chatting, we Snapchat regularly. I found his sister’s social media and pictures of him on his family’s accounts too. Everything checks out. I have no reason to believe he’s a catfish. 

The past week his communication has been quite slacking a bit, way more than before. Each day it gets a bit more sparse it seems. He’s been leaving me on read or delivered for hours on end and his responses are pretty lackluster. He isn’t as consistent in his communication and he’s usually super responsive. Maybe he just wants to save some conversation for our in person meet. This is odd because earlier in our conversations he’d joke if I left him on read for an hour or two. He’d be like “Oh so no response, rude! Just kidding lol”. But this new behavior is making me worried and it’s super unlike him. He still does show periods of affection now and then but it’s on a much lower level than before. Like maybe he’s trying to create distance to back out of coming last minute? Or he’s just getting comfortable in the relationship and doesn’t feel the need to entertain me constantly. Maybe he found someone else or had a secret relationship going on. 

I feel weird bringing it up because he’s not my boyfriend, we aren’t even officially dating at this point. Maybe I’m just needy and he’s honestly been busy. But he used to send me random snaps of his day at work or around the house and even that has decreased a lot. I don’t want to seem needy either. I feel like maybe I thought too much into this, like I believed it was more real than it was? Like we created a fake fantasy. I’m good at reading patterns in people and I can usually sense when something is changing but maybe I’m getting worked up for nothing. I was really looking forward to seeing him and now I’m very skeptical that will happen. My heart is sinking.

We met on an OLD app. He’s constantly telling me how he thinks I’m the one and even asked me to be his gf but, I haven’t seen what I wanted in a relationship from him. I’m someone who is into romance and creativity. I like the small thoughtful gestures in relationships. I haven’t seen him do anything like that yet, even after I explained that this is something I want if we do go into a relationship. 

Also we talk in the phone daily, but he doesn’t text too much or send good morning texts etc. and that’s something I’m into. 

I like spending time/talking with him but this makes me think he’s not serious about me and makes me want to pull away.

11,s46zpv,1642206234,"Could I (M19) and a lady friend (F23) who are potentially gonna go down the romantic route, go down that path if we hold opposing political beliefs?","From what I know of her political beliefs she is pretty liberal/left, like white male privilege and animal rights stuff (and more of the same I assume), I like her very much, she is smart, pretty nerdy, and very fun for me to talk with about random stuff (we both seem to have that weird ability to understand each other without words kinda thing) we get along well and can talk about lots of things reasonably without ideology demons taking over.

I am kinda chaotic politically but for simplicity's sake, I am very libertarian, sorta centrist between left and right but leaning right, BUT I do have some quack opinions on certain issues that might make her hate me, nothing ideological just very nonstandard stuff that most people would hate me for before I could hope to explain myself.... But I am very open and agreeable and love to learn about people's political beliefs, when I see someone who opposes me politically and or morally I don't try to change their opinion but instead, I try to learn all I can and evaluate if some of the stuff makes sense. I don't believe in anything that doesn't make sense to me and I am open if what you say makes sense.

In short, If she and I were to date and politics comes up how should I handle this? I just want to be able to talk with her and disagree or agree wherever and still continue dating but from my searching online most people would never even consider dating someone who opposes them politically :/



I don't want to ruin what I have with her but I also want to go further with it, (I'm almost certain she does too).


Am I screwed?



An example that gives me hope was when she was and a classmate (we are in college) were talking minor politics and you could see the ideology demons start to flare up when she just use her charisma to make the whole thing into a laugh, both her and the dude (and me) were laughing by the end of it and we all made a group chat because we got along so well, But perhaps that was just because he is a classmate and not a romantic interest... :/



TL;DR

Me and lady friend disagree on some politics but might be in a romantic relationship soon, would our potential relationship workout? Assuming all else was compatible, I know I myself could care less if we disagreed on politics even morally but she might be different... (read the example above tho).

12,s473nh,1642206561,What do I do if I’ve never been in a relationship before ? Am I a hopeless romantic?😩,"I’m not actively looking for someone but I was never opposed to it. I’ve had mini crushes every now and then but they were never big enough for me to actually go for it. As for guys that had  crushes on me, I didn’t feel the same so I had to reject them. I’m starting to think that I’m the problem lol. 

When I was in high school I didn’t want a boyfriend until my junior year because I realized,”oh crap I’m about to finish school and I still haven’t got a boyfriend” By then I basically knew all my options.  obviously nothing happened and my options were limited. They still kinda are

So now I’m currently not in school but I do work. Do I go out? No. If anything I think I need a friend more than a relationship.  at some point I did have friends but never a relationship. I’m still young and stuff so I still have hope. And no I don’t like the idea of meeting someone through an app. Maybe I’m limiting myself?? I just hope someday I get to meet this person in the most natural way without me really thinking too much about it. 

I’m thinking to switch jobs soon and hopefully I’ll find something for me. And I really do think getting a friend to hang out with would be the best for me to get out of my shell. I do want a boyfriend mostly to finally know what it’s like to be in-love and for the experience. I’ve also been actively working on myself and my appearance so hopefully that’ll help.

I've written here in the past about my dating experiences and thanks to a lot of advice from here and soul searching within myself I feel like I am in so much of a better place.

I am a 22M asian and over the last year I asked out a large number of women who pretty much all rejected because I was too short, or too nerdy or not rich enough for them they would often tell me so I finally decided to embrace the heartbreak and just focus on being the best possible version of myself. I am focusing on building lean muscle, becoming a web developer and I want to make some indie games as well when I have time and I feel so liberated from not having the pressure I put on myself to find a companion. I have just accepted I think I am better off staying alone and if I meet someone I will be overjoyed! But it's not something I want to spend time actively looking for like I used to.

I don't hold any kind of bitterness towards these girls, I understand why they thought the way about me, being a brown guy living in the UK could be a bit intimidating for women especially when they have so many other options of guys who have a similar race and upbringing to them whereas I don't drink, smoke or party. I just like to code, go the gym and play some halo so I understand why women don't find that appealing.

It just honestly feels so refreshing and I can't help but smile when I see how much growth I have made over the person from being insecure and feeling like I needed a girlfriend to now being very comfortable with the idea of dying alone.

I wish the best for all you kings and queens and I hope my post maybe reassures you that you are not alone if you're having a hard time dating, you may just be better off accepting like me that dating isn't for you at the moment :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s47gxn/finally_feel_happy_and_comfortable_being_single/

In the beginning he used to always hug me, up until the end of December. He used to come up to me to say hi and he would always hug me. He's always very drunk, tbh I think he has an alcohol problem. He would often randomly ask for hugs or touch my hair or arms which I was btw fine with and he would always stand around me.

In November I found out he has a girlfriend but I never see him with her. I only saw her one time and she gave me dirty looks. There was this one incident at night in the end of December, he told me something like ""hey it's weird you're always first place on top of my stories"". Later that night I was walking with some people I met that night and I was gonna tell them bye because they had to leave. He was walking towards me and I noticed he was extremely drunk and he started hugging me a lot. I asked him if he's okay and it sounded like he was crying and he was like ""yeah never been better"". Then he asked me if I love him. I was drunk too, he hugged me like 10 times then he held me really hard and walked me backwards to the rest of the people there. He sat on the floor and I sat a little away from him because I was so confused. About 5 minutes later he left and he came down to hug me bye and he let himself fall on me

Then after this night nothing happened, only once. I asked someone if my hair smells like smoke because someone around me was smoking. The whole time he was around me, then when he stood next to me he stared at me and asked if he can smell my hair too. Now the past times I saw him, he always immediately leaves when he sees me. He also doesn't hug me anymore, he doesn't even say hi. I don't know if it comes across as if I don't like him because I'm very shy but I still always catch him clearly staring at me.

I currently live alone, dating a woman for  4 years but I just dont think things are working out, not in a bad way but personally I feel like im not happy. I want to meet an american lady, I have accommodation here in the uk. Can afford to live pretty comfortably. I get state benefit   but either how, Im getting bored of my current girlfriend. I would like to meet someone new.. And..  I dont have any children as I am not ready for it yet.  If you are interested in chatting , I do have a good microphone and like speaking on discord,  facetime etc.

26,s495ye,1642212707,What is it like to approach a girl (or anyone) at a bar?,"I am a 22 year old male. I don't drink alcohol or do any drugs, but don't typically mind if someone does. So, sometimes I end up going to bars with friends even though I don't drink.

I went to a bar last week and I noticed lots of people, and thought it would be a great way to socialize but I'm also curious if that is even a thing.

When I'm at more chill events, no music, partying, drinking, whatever, I will go to some group of people at a table and just start talking to them. I was at the gym, and there was a waiting area after some competition and I just chatted it up with these people.

Is approaching groups of people at a bar a thing? If I go up to a group of women at a bar, would that be socially unacceptable? Like I said, I don't drink, so I really would just be going there to meet strangers.

33,s49ve1,1642214836,Money Absolutely Matters in Dating,"As a man, I don't expect a woman to have a good salary, but I do expect her to not be in debt. Women look at men for security, stability, does he have his own place or live with roommates / parents? 

So it's absolutely fair game for me to be asking how much debt you have (and how much progress you are making on paying that off), what your degree is in, how much you make and if you will be a financial asset or liability. Love can only take a relationship so far and if you're not on a similar financial situation as your partner your relationship will derail and one person can take down the relationship without much effort. 

The truth of the matter is that while I'm not ""money oriented,"" you do need a certain amount of it in order to survive in society, have a little bit of fun, and not be stressed out to the max all the time. If my partner is deeply in debt, how am I going to enjoy vacations that I've saved for, fun planned activities, buying nice food, etc.

Now, I'm not going to say you need to make 6 figures, that's unrealistic, but I do require the women in my life who I am dating to at least have a full time job

Ladies - if you're going to attract the man you want you need to get your financial plan together. It doesn't have to be perfect but if you're expecting your man to have his shit together - why should he commit to you when you don't have yours together?

I posted this after having to get rid of a woman who seemed entitled to my stability after a few dates and I'm writing this to help women out there not get rejected.

38,s4akf7,1642216971,I caught the guy I was “dating” in a pretty ginormous lie.,"So I met a guy over holiday break. He lives in my hometown, and we decided to continue to try long distance even though I was going back to my city I live in and leaving my home. We had an amazing month for the time I was home, he  showered me with gifts love and affection telling me that he thinks I’m the one for him. 
He texted me nonstop morning till dark. I felt so incredibly special, a connection I had never felt before. 

I left my town this past weekend, and he agreed he wanted to keep dating even though I was going to be gone. But as soon as I left I felt a bit of a dip in his communication. He stopped being so flirty, and I definitely noticed a huge difference once I got on that plane. 

We’ve still been texting every day, back-and-forth and he keeps telling me he can’t wait until the next time he sees me and that we will have to meet up whenever he’s in my city and that I need to let them know when I’ll come visit there. I asked when is the next time he’ll be coming up because he vacations here a lot and comes for work and he told me he has no idea. This was just a couple days ago.

Well, apparently he’s not very smart because he shares his location with me and he’s in my city right now. Like on a trip this weekend right where I live and didn’t tell me. And I saw because I was trying to find my friends iphone, and see his little icon hovering near all my other friends. 

It’s the most insane thing I’ve ever seen in my life. Because he’s texting me like everything‘s normal. He even blocked me from viewing his stories but isn’t apparently stupid enough to block my friends. Oh, and he’s 27. I’m just so blindsided at why somebody could do this. And blocking me from seeing stories, really? At the very least he could’ve told me he was gonna be here but didn’t have time to see me this weekend or was worried about xyz and that’s why. He literally could’ve just told me the truth that he was up here and that he just didn’t have time/want to see me!! But instead he has to lie and be sneaky and tell me about how bored he is at home. Sending me smiley faces and trying to make small talk.

But he’s been lying through his teeth  He even called me on the phone earlier about how “bored he was”. Yet he’s posting pictures all around my town behind my back. He’s been texting me every single day since I left my hometown btw. 

I should be done with him right? I don’t know why somebody could lie to my face like that. Or, over the phone. I thought this was something he wanted to continue and that he was going to let me know the next time he was here, I didn’t think it was going to be literally the next weekend. I just don’t understand how somebody could do this after a month long connection where he treated me like a queen. And then do this and then lie about it. It’s extremely hurtful. I’ve never had a guy lie over and over like this before or go behind my back like this. And I know we’re not officially  bf/gf, but he was the one that said we’re dating and exclusive and he’s the one that came on so strong in the beginning so it’s still incredibly hurtful. He has been backing off the past few days but still insisted on wanting to see me soon. I’m just so confused and hurt.

I'm really happy because I'm a bit tired of all the guys who text like immature men, or ask to meet up without even getting to know me. I swiped right, that doesn't mean I'm gonna commit to a date immediately. Anyway, he didn't do any of that macho man or suave and flirty text. He doesn't seem desperate at all, like he has his own life whether I engage with him or not. He told me he is looking to buy his own house, he has a good job, wakes up early. The way he texts me makes me feel so supported, he encourages me before I start my work day and sends me good morning texts. It's not like I can give him anything or do anything for him and yet he's still showing interest in my life. Yesterday I went shopping in a nearby city and he asked me if my shopping trip was successful and if I found anything good, and was glad to hear it when I told him I did. Perhaps I am just a newb (never been in a relationship) and guys like this are normal, but to me he seems like a really mature and optimistic guy, and I'm just scared that there's something I don't know. It's all up in the air for now because we still have yet to meet up in person (which is unfortunately not possible because he lives a few hours away and his car is in the shop). I'm worried that I'll end up not liking him physically or that we won't have any chemistry. Long story short, I am afraid. I guess it's mostly a good fear. I admittingly was ready to engage with immature men but now that I've (fortunately) found a reliable guy, it means that I actually have to be responsible, and that I'm risking heartbreak too. I'm not nervous because I'm infatuated but because I genuinely feel loved and this could go somewhere.

I met him three months ago when my professor assigned him to help me. We instantly had chemistry and he asked for my number. He was the first to text me about a party at my house and since then we have been texting several times a week and partying together, alongside with him advising me. He has invited me to his place several times and we’ve talked for hours over tea. We started going out for dinner or drinks as well. We’ve been talking about really personal stuff and I feel like we’ve become rather close.

So… A party happens at my place and I decide to confess my feelings to him. He says that he thinks I’m amazing, but his boss, the professor, would kill him if he slept with me. I was really drunk that night and apologized afterwards. We haven’t talked about it since, but over Christmas break we started sending each other pictures of what we were doing almost daily with texts back and forth. 

My question is.. does this guy like me? Or is he just being friendly? I’m not American so the culture around friendships/relationship here is so difficult for me to understand. And it really complicates things that’s he is advising me as well.

I (26m) have been talking/dating this girl (28f) for the last six months. Sparing some details we both got out of long term relationships 2+ years. 

Anyway, we’ve gotten together about every 3 days since we met. I was even invited to thanksgiving with her family across the country but had to decline because I had already bought plane tickets. She’s been very enthusiastic when we are together but I can tell the days we don’t get together she’s not into texting me much unless I initiate. When we are together she’s very typical (very lovey, likes to rub up on me, we kiss quite a bit) 

Recently I posted a photo of us on my Instagram and she asked to take it down in case my ex saw it. Which is somewhat justifiable but I won’t go into details about that. My ex and I haven’t talked in months and I have her blocked, let alone the fact she’s across the country now. 

After that she brought up she wasn’t ready for a relationship and felt guilty about having sex with me because she didn’t want to “treat me like a fuck buddy”. She also mentioned she didn’t want to date other people but she doesn’t want to be in a relationship with me. She wasn’t “breaking up” (if that’s what you call it in this case) with me because we have gotten together since this talk a few times and things are going as they always have. Even occasionally hooking up but few and far between.

I guess I just don’t quite understand the red light green light. Is this something anyone has experienced before? To be honest i am being understanding of her situation because I think her last relationship isn’t yet resolved within herself.

66,s4d7ml,1642225616,Dating without alcohol and flakey girls advice,"Hello,

Im in a large city in southern california and over the last year gone out with a lot of girls. I'm 28M, have a good job, educated, generally pretty athletic, etc.  Does anyone else find it hard to date without alcohol being involved.  I cant tell you the number of girls who will literally only want someone to pay for their drinks. I like doing tons of things outdoors, there are museums, a world class zoo, beaches, that I have planned really fun dates to go with. However many girls want someone just to pay for their drinks and then drop them after a couple dates. Over the last year, I've met girls at different areas - work, through mutual events, dating apps, etc so I try to be fair about not generalizing. But many of the girls seem to be interested only in having things paid for and putting no effort into any part of the date.  Literally one girl showed up to a movie premier I had gotten special tickets for us 30 minutes into the movie and then afterword became annoyed when I wouldn't go out and buy her drinks.  I dont drink/smoke and I keep it pretty obvious (its on the dating apps, and when I meet people in person and it comes up naturally I mention it).  Another girl I met through work, I bought tickets for an event we were both looking forward to, then when the day came, she had ""plans come up"" an hour before. So I went by myself because I wanted to go. Then halfway through the event, she called and said she was now free, and I could take her to dinner.  Another girl I went out with, I got tickets to the zoo and brought her, we went to dinner after and I paid.  There was a christmas village event with many food stalls along with entertainment. She said she wanted to get drinks (she already knew I didnt drink, so I figured she just wanted something for her), we waited in line and when we got to the front she turned to me and said ""you are going to pay for me"" and ordered a $30 drink.  

So I guess this is a two part questions:  First, how do people who dont drink deal with those who seem to make it the only thing they want to do? 

Second, how do you deal with flakey girls who seem to only want to be entertained, flake out, or just have money spent on them. 

Maybe it is just the city I am in, but many girls in their mid to late 20's do not actually want to bother with dating.  It isnt just on dating aps, but people Ive met through work or friends.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s4d7ml/dating_without_alcohol_and_flakey_girls_advice/

I texted the guy I was seeing to suggest that we not hang out for a bit because I am getting a cold sore and they are infectious. 

He’s kind of freaking out right now and asking why I didn’t give him a heads up. I feel that I did—I just told him. But I guess he feels I should have told him before we kissed? But I did not have any cold sores then. 

If you get cold sores, when do you disclose that info?

Whoever took them must’ve been disappointed to find out that there were no actual airpods in them thanks to my high ass. But not as disappointed as I am since I have nothing to charge my airpods with.

70,s4dj97,1642226710,Pretty new to this and I'm not sure if this warrants a conversation between me and this guy.,"I'm a late bloomer and never really put myself out there up until these past few years. Late last year I met a guy who I ended up casually seeing (explicitly both agreed that we were not dating) for about 3 months, meeting once every week or every other week, and all of our meetups except for the first few ones, we would hookup. He was my first. He was very patient about that. We didn't just have sex everytime, but we would cuddle and watch something, we would order food, he made dinner, we saw a show together, I slept over a few times he would give me kisses and hold hands when we slept. I was of course enjoying his company and since it was the first experience of this casual thing, I just went with all of it.

In the beginning I told him I wanted something sexually exclusive where I could explore and have fun because I'm new to all this. He agreed then, but the last time we met I wanted to confirm that we were still sexually exclusive (mostly looking out for my sexual health as he has did not use a condom a few times) just so we were still on the same page. He assured me that it was still the case. Additionally, he was always open about who he was hanging out with, and told me he was going to visit an ex he was still friends with over the holidays. After that conversation though, he was not as responsive. I've reached out a few times after that, but I only got very lukewarm responses. Definitely not the same as before.

It has been a few weeks and I haven't heard from him so I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to continue our setup anymore. Now I know there could be a million reasons for fading out: got back with his ex, just lost interest, got busy, whatever. I've been moving on, hasn't been the easiest thing but I think I'm doing a good job (please congratulate me haha). I've been doing well of just not reaching out because he's obviously not into it anymore, but like I said, I was new to all of that so, after those months, after things we did, is it just a normal thing to fade out like that? I know ghosting happens all the time but I think we got along as friends. I don't want anything confrontational, just like hey so that was a thing we did and it's fine if we're not gonna do it anymore. Or should I just continue what I'm doing of leaving it alone and we're just never going to speak again?

Then I found out he was still following his former ex, who even doesn't follow him back and in relationship since few months ago. I told him I feel uncomfortable, and he unfollowed her saying he understood.

Then since this Monday, I felt something is different with him. We were long distance who can meet only on weekends. So seeing him distant for days on text and calls was killing me inside. 
I mentioned this last night and found out his depression got severe this week. And we had a deep on the phone for 1.5 hour. We found out we wouldn't work out so we decided to break up.


After breaking up, he deleted his IG pics, profile pic, bio and unfollowed around 50ppl last night.(He still follows me tho) Then he posted a moody meme on his story.
Even tho we broke up, I still care about him and his mental health, so texted once in the morning 'Hey, you ok?'.
Then he never replied. It was fine until that point.

But I just found he ran to his former ex's IG account and pushed likes on her posts uploaded last night, while still unfollowing her.
I wanna throw up. I was there for him at his darkest moments, kept trying and trying to not to give up and gave us opportunities again and again for months. But he just did that right after we called it a quit.

74,s4dvfc,1642227917,"It feels wrong, but I have more success in OLD when I'm shallow","I got back on dating apps last month after taking a break following the end of my last relationship. When I created my profile again, I used photos that showed me well-dressed, in social situations, and doing a few different activities. My bio described my hobbies, where I went to school, and that I was looking for a serious relationship. The results? In 3 weeks, 12 likes on Tinder and 6 matches that went absolutely nowhere despite my best efforts at starting a conversation. In fact, only two of those matches even responded to me. I went on a single date with one of the matches who responded and tried to take it slow and be respectful during the date, but she unmatched and blocked me afterwards. 

At the start of this week, I tried something completely different. I made my first photo a shirtless photo, made my bio a single sentence joke, and deleted a couple of my other photos. The results this week? 40 likes and 20 matches, including a hookup on Wednesday and another one that will most likely happen tomorrow. Instead of trying to start a conversation, I would make my opener something sex-related without being too over the top. I got way more conversations and interest from girls once I started using the shallow fuckboi approach.

On one hand, I'm thrilled with the attention I'm getting, but on the other hand, I feel like I'm not being my true self at all. I want a relationship more than hookups, but it seems like the only way to get any kind of engagement from girls is to be a chauvinist. I guess I'm technically looking in the wrong place for a relationship, but I really don't have many other options in the area I live. It's an extremely expensive region and most young people my age leave after college or move here already married.

Do any other guys feel pressured to be inauthentic and shallow on these apps? Maybe if I went on a paid dating site like eHarmony or Match I could be more authentic and true to myself, but as it stands, acting like a fuckboy seems to be working much better in terms of getting me engagement on the apps.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s4dvfc/it_feels_wrong_but_i_have_more_success_in_old/

***Quit sharing dick pics.***

There's another way to get women!

Wait. What?!? No way! Really?!?

Yes. Really.

Just so you know that I know what I'm talking about, here are some facts:

\- I've been married for 25 years.  
\- I am 50 years old.  
\- My wife and I have had an open relationship for the last 15 years.  
\- In the last five years I have dated over a dozen different women. By ""dated"" I don't mean dinner and a movie. I mean taking them home or going home with them. You figure out the rest.  
\- In the year immediately before lockdown I ""dated"" seven different women.  
\- I'm not especially good looking or fit. I'm pretty average looking. I have glasses, a beard, and I'm a HUGE nerd.  


Ready for the other way to get women?

Are you sure?

Here goes...

Talk to them.

I said talk TO them, not AT them. Ask questions about their likes and dislikes. Ask them about their goals and aspirations. Listen to their answers. Relate to them when you can. Don't assume you're right, and FOR FUCKS SAKE (here's the big one) don't assume that they are wrong about ANYTHING. If they are wrong about a fact and you KNOW they're wrong, just let it go. (Unless it's literally life-or-death.)

Human beings (yes...women are human beings) want to talk about themselves more than others. Resist the urge to talk about yourself. Encourage her to talk about herself. Don't try to show how smart you are or how strong you are. And DON'T SHOW YOUR DICK UNTIL SHE ASKS!!!!

Here's another secret: Women don't care what your dick looks like. All dicks look pretty much the same. Half the population has one. If she wanted a random dick she could get it. Yours isn't that impressive to her. She's seen bigger.

Do the thing that the other guy didn't do: Show some interest in her directly.

After a while when he got off he's feet, started reintroducing himself to his hobbies again, him and I are athletes, so I would encourage him to go on a run when I do, and seeing me do it made him wanna do it. He started doing the things he likes, takes time away without me bothering him or anything. After a while of dating he sat me down and made me take this internet test he didn't tell me the subject at the beginning. But after taking the test it was a narcissism test... Excuse me? Just because when someone tells me ""you look nice today"" I say ""thank you! I feel nice aswell!"" instead of ""really?! 🥺 I thought I looked hideous""  just because I have confidence doesn't mean I'm narcissistic.

Then we also text for a couple of days after before setting up the date. I went out ice skating with her and also to dave and busters. Its weird because I like this girl but i Dont get that same energy from her. Especially on the date it felt…normal. She didn’t ask me any questions or anything. It just felt like we tried to have fun. Should i cut ties with this woman?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s4em4j/first_date/

87,s4eovr,1642230982,Did I love bomb this girl?,"Me (25M) and this girl (26F) went on 3 dates. On the second date we had sex (initiated by her). In between the second and third date, she let me know she passed out and ended up in the hospital. I sent her some flowers saying “Hope you feel better soon”.

When she received the flowers she said she really loved them and they were nice. When she ask why I gave them to her I said “seems like you have had a rough few days and thought it would be nice”. I never mentioned the flowers again in any future conversations because I honestly didn’t expect anything in return. 

We went on our third date and it seemed to go well, well I thought it did. Unfortunately, she ghosted for a little over a week after the date. I initiated the conversation again because I left my watch at her place after our second date asking if I could get it back. During this conversation she broke it off with me saying she “didn’t feel a connection” and that the flowers made her feel “very pressured” because we only been out a couple of times. 

Making her feel “pressured” made me feel horrible. When I went and picked up my watch I apologised for making her feel pressured, that wasn’t my intention and wished her all the best for the future. 

Did I love bomb this girl by giving her flowers after 2 dates? I thought given the context of the situation of her ending up in hospital it would be appropriate, because if that didn’t happen there is no chance I would get her flowers this early into knowing her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s4eovr/did_i_love_bomb_this_girl/
88,s4f7uv,1642233113,I’m not sure how to tell her how I feel,"I’m not sure how to tell her

So I have a very close friend who is a girl, for about 1.5 years we were very close friends and I didn’t look at her in any type of romantic way, I’m not sure how but probably becuase I was always at home by myself working due to the pandemic and all we would do is talk to each other all day.

So around June last year I started falling in love with her hard but I just knew she didn’t feel the same, and her behaviour changed a lot. Talking about herself way more, telling me about the guy she was infatuated with etc and I felt like I never got to talk about myself anymore and it was all about her.

We’re in Australia so we had a 3 month hard lockdown when this happened so the hole I fell into was so much worse because I literally couldn’t do anything and all I would do is talk to her and listen and it killed me. I lost about 12kg in 3 months becuase she made me feel sick, I couldn’t eat, had no energy to work out.

So that went on for months. Fast forward to end of lockdown. She broke up with the guy she always talked about which kind of made me sad becuase it’s sounds so selfish but the fact the she was at least only seeing one person gave some sort of stupid security that at least no one else could have her.

After she broke up with him, becuase I became her emotional tampon of sorts, she told me when she was going dates with other guys and I tried to hold myself together and not explode. Until she went on a date with an acquaintance of mine who I’m not very fond of and I let my emotions get the better of me and we fell out, she sent me voice messages how I was a bad friend and that im not acting like a normal person and that I was exhausting even though I pretty much listened to whatever she had to say for months on end.

The worst part about all of it is, I fell so hard for her that I literally couldn’t find any other woman attractive. So fast forward, we stopped talking which was really great for me, because lockdown ended and it must’ve just been not talking to the person, not constantly wondering what they’re doing or where’s they are. I got my appetite back, started hitting the gym hard, talking to girls going out with friends etc, I felt awesome.

A couple times whilst we were not talking she sent me messages saying she missed me which I dismissed because I felt like she was just trying to reel me back in to be her emotional sponge again. Recently I saw her  at a New Years party as we share lots of mutual friends. I felt fine at the party, we talked alot and it felt like how things used to be, we walked to the beach arm in arm and left each other with a hug at the end of the party. I still felt fine the day after, but a few days later I texted her to come see me. I live about an hour away just for context. She obliged to see me that weekend and we texted a whole bunch during the week and about just fun stuff really nothing like it was months ago.

I’m not sure if I was getting the wrong impression but i feel like some of the texts did have a kind of flirty undertone. And she was sending me photos of what she was going to wear and how excited she was to see me.
So she caught the 1.5 hour train to come see me and she really made an effort to look pretty and presentable.

So we get on with our meeting/date (idk what to call it). I took her to two nice bars one which she was really pleased with as it included one of her hobbies (won’t get into that). Conversation is flowing nicely. I get brave and put my arm around her and she doesn’t resist. She says something along the lines of she can’t remember the last time she did this with a guy and how she loves me more than any other guy she’s dated. And how she wouldn’t have come all this way if she didn’t care about or love me. We go get dinner after and walking with my arm around her most of the time.

We say goodbye with a long hug, no kiss unfortunately. So everything pretty much the same as last week, talking having fun etc. yesterday we were texting and she gives me a hypothetical question of which person I would choose to date and she lists 2 people with different qualities one of them pretty much describing me to a tee. Conversation goes from there and again we get to the topic of how we missed each other and how she cried but we both just moved on blah blah. But she really made a point to outline how much she cared and missed me.

Anyways we talk again today. And I asked her yesterday if she was busy tomorrow night and she gave a maybe so so answer so. I took the hint and left it alone, I mention whether I can come see her again today and now she’s apparently going on a “kind of “ date with someone. I’ve falled back into the hole and worst thing is I arranged for. Flowers to be delivered to her on Monday with a message saying how happy  I am that. She’s back in my life and for her to make sure she’s free Friday night. And now I’m just stuck an emotional mess again. See how she’s reacts to the flowers I guess.

I’m not a very patient person when it comes to things I care about/get excited about. I also don’t have the best when it comes to anxiety. 

The girl works in a different department and she came around when I had to leave early one day which I was super upset about because it would of been a great chance to talk to her. So I’ve been an anxious mess wanting to makeup the missed opportunity. 

I want to talk to her so bad it’s distracting me when I’m at home and keeping me up a tiny bit at night. I need to calm down some so it’s not overtaking my life and eating me alive the next few days. 

On another note: a girl at work that is aware of me liking the other girl and is close with both of us offered to tell the girl I’m into her if I wanted.

Another girl I saw for a couple months. Didn’t have family to eat with on thanksgiving. Brought her a huge dinner. Took her out for lunch a couple times a week. Gave her a Christmas gift. Blocked me without a word on New Years.
