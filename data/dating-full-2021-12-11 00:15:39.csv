No matter what I do I can’t get rid of the feelings I have for him. For the most part we have such an amazing bond but on the other we are so toxic together for many reasons. 
We tried dating when we first met but it did not work due to him being manic and taking stuff I do or say the wrong way. Like when I asked him did he ever consider looking into Ativan? He took that as me saying he’s no better then a pill.. he suffered an addiction to Percocets that he overcame. He shut himself away from the world for an entire month would not see me and I tried talking to him about how much I miss him and hate being apart and he took that as me pestering. So we became friends. Eventually he moved across the country back to the province he came from. We remained in contact constantly talking every single day, video chatting so on. He came to visit me and it was great except we had a huge fight, lots of spilled drinks on me and a couple on him, a hole in my wall and my head hurts from him accidentally knocking my head with a glass… he does not want to talk about it… this fight started because he kept flicking his fingers on me, I asked him to repeatedly stop he did not. The last one caused me to spill half my drink on me so I spilled the other half on him and he freaked out.. it’s not even the first time he freaked.. when he was still living here he freaked out because I tried to convince him that he’s not a pos. he started throwing stuff around, broke my light switch cover and so on… after he left from the week with me and he landed we were talking again, I told him some off comment about how him sewing a part of a pair of panties from one of his hook ups onto his patch pants may not be original but still is cool (he’s a punk) and he flipped about how I don’t need validation and I said fine then I won’t give any sort of compliment if you will rect that way.. he said I’m never coming back again told me I’m having a temper tantrum and to shut it now is not talking to me… anyway as you can see toxic…how do I let him go… I want nothing more then to be with him and to fix the toxic behaviour but on the other hand he moved across the country and does not want me in that way or so he said part of me beloved deep down he still feels for me.

So me (m24) and my ex (f22) have been broken up for a few months now (she broke up with me). As a bit of background, she broke up with me, I begged and pleaded for a bit but wasn’t getting anywhere so I went into no contact. She was talking to guys on dating apps pretty much a day or two after she broke up with me but didn’t go on any dates, she just liked the attention/ a distraction from the break up I guess. 

So about 3 weeks of no contact in, she starts talking to me again and eventually says she misses me and wants to take things slow, I’m very skeptical, I never really get my hopes up but we go on a couple of dates, we have a really good time together, better then it’s been in months, and had some amazing sex. But after a week or so she decides she doesn’t want to be with me after all.

This time, I didn’t beg or plead, I just accepted it and went straight back into no contact, fully expecting it to be for good this time. But even though we ended things or really good terms, like I say I just accepted the breakup this time and we had a lot of laughs on our dates, she is pissed off at me now that she has broken up with me and I didn’t beg??

The main point is, whenever I see her she’s absolutely glued to her phone talking to god knows who. It doesn’t bother me that much and I definitely don’t let it seem like it’s bothering me but it seems like she’s very deliberately letting me see her phone to make me jealous or something or get a reaction out of me because she’s unhappy with the lack of reaction she’s got out of me so far? I don’t know. Or is she genuinely just taking to some guy and is just so inconsiderate as to do it right in front of me. In all honesty I think if I was taking to someone I’d feel quite disrespectful doing it in front of her.

A bit more background information: me and her have a 1 year old child together (that’s why I see her so often) we were together 5 years, owned a home together, we’re engaged and planned to have another child later down the line. We have had a very good relationship for 4 years, with a few arguments within the last year, she was diagnosed with post natal depression but is seemingly in denial about a lot of her issues.

Not necessarily looking for advice as I my situation is very clear. I’m in no contact and it’s staying that way.

Content: eating disorder, high insecurities and mental health unstabilities, bipolar , dermatophagia ..

For context: **please feel free to skip this if you wanna go straight to the problem.**

**\[** So my boyfriend (23M) and me (22F) have been together for almost a year now and it’s going great.

we’re mostly in a long distance relationship bcs he studies abroad. It really isn’t that bad though thanks the effort he puts to make sure he visits once a month even for a 2-days holiday and he doesn’t even complain. We manage to make the best out of the little time we have together. We make video calls daily and even if we very busy we just talk a little before sleep and let the call ongoing all night. It was his idea at first and I thought it was kinda clingy but it makes me feel safe and less lonely especially when im highly stressed.

Although we have very diff personalities and perspectives we both put our relationship as our number one priority and with that being said it rly stresses me out if sthg just doesn’t feel right. **\]**

**important to mention:**

He’s mentally very stable, doesn’t stress out a lot ,and tends to be more rational compared to my emotional ass.

I on the other hand struggle a lot with my mental health and tend to be more shy and unconfident even at my best phases. I am bipolar and my mood swings become worse in stressful times.

I struggle with dermatophagia too (for those who do not know it’s and uncontrollable urge to chew the skin around my fingers) and eating disorder (new to me)

My bf does know that and although he didn’t believe in “mental health” before because he’s rly stable and didn’t go through a lot (good for him) he learnt to stand by me regardless and respect me for who I am which is so nice of him.

He just doesn’t like it when I chew my skin and he goes nuts when he sees blood and tells me they look ugly (thinking that it would make me stop when it rly just makes me feel less of a person )

I’ve been physically fit most of my life. I liked sports and was into healthy meals and a good lifestyle bcs it helped ease my doubts and give a little credit to myself since I always underestimate myself and never felt worthy of love but thts for another day.

I used to weight 48kg (im 163 cm tall) ,I used to have a well sculpted body and defined abs. now im 55kg or so.

mention that I used to stabilize my mood by going to therapy once or twice a month and going to the gym 4 to 5 times a day; taking care of myself in general. It helped.

**backstory:**

since the minute he confessed his love to me I made a pact with myself to never disappoint him and be the perfect girlfriend, fulfill all his needs and I did. Never once did he complain from anything from my part which made me proud for a while. I couldn’t disappoint him . (I failed my exams miserably last year but that was the last thing I could care abt as long as im proving that he chose right)

until I began to feel rly drained and couldn’t find a balance between my needs, life responsibilities and relationship and this is where it all became toxic, I became toxic with myself, blaming myself harshly for every minor inconvenience and sometimes it results on me acting a little rude with him.

He noticed that im acting different and pointed it out. And my mind translated his words into “he stopped loving you bcs u’re shitty and unworthy of his love good job”

Ig thts what it means to live in constant doubt and fear of abandonment. Im so aware that my mind is fuckd up but I just cannot control my negative thoughts ig I just gotta live with it.

That constant blaming consumed me so bad tho that I’ve began overeating like crazy. It got to the point that I cannot breath at night and sometimes I find myself puking and then eating more.

I spend every minute chewing on sthg and it’s mostly some snack I normally hate. It almost feels like my mind is punishing me and pushing me to eat everything I hate nonstop because Im no good or whatever .

but every time I try to resist this urge to eat I end up eating more the next day. Im not even exaggerating I put on 6 kg + in a month and believe me I tried to put on weight before it seemed impossible to me no matter how much I ateI just wanna love myself again and forgive myself for not being 7/7 “perfect” cs it’s simply impossible and blah blah blah but I can’t . I just can’t stop it . if this is my way of killing myself than I guess it’s working cs I dnt recognize myself anymore. Im physically out of shape and mentally in my lowest point and im rly rude with the pple I cherish the most .. I feel like im losing everything at once.

**main problem:**

Lately I’ve been going through a lot . the last three months or so have been hell to me. There’s no need to go through details but as I said earlier I used to stabilize my mood by going to therapy once or twice a month and going to the gym 4 to 5 times a day.

But with the “pact” I made with myself to be the perfect girlfriend I just stopped all of that to focus on my relationship and used that money to buy my man gifts and indulge him as much as I could . I never let him spend a penny when he’s with me and I made sure to pay for the most expensive lunches and dinners just so he doesn’t regret the efforts he made to visit me for a few days or so. I know pathetic but please just go with me I have serious problems with self worth maybe from previous traumas. Im rly not sure but sometimes when he stays over longer than a week I find myself too broke to even pay for rent that month and ofcourse I wouldn’t say . I dnt want him to think that he’s a burden bcs he’s not. But that stresses me like crazy and I just have to magically solve it on my own everytime thinking that im doing the best I could for my relationship but not paying attention to my rude and bad behavior when I dunno what to do.

I study dentistry and sometimes I need to buy some expensive materials and tools and I can’t and I have nobody to tell so Ig I just snap at him unintentionally.

I’ve been having some real bad panic attacks, not that it’s sthg new but the frequency is no joke.

Currently im under a lot of pressure timewise bcs I’m sitting for exams.

So he’s coming over next week. He said that he’s not planning to stay long bcs he doesn’t want to interrupt me.

I know I should be happy because I miss him so bad but im more scared than anything.

Reasons:

1.He mentioned that he bought me some cute outfits which I know won’t fit me and it’s gonna be embarrassing.

He always mentions when we talk how he doesn’t like chubby girls or slightly overweight and prefers the skinny type and I didn’t mind it bcs I was really skinny but I always hated the way he judges pple and how much he cares about looks. Now whenever he talks abt someone’s shape my chest tightens and the negative chain of thoughts pops up in my brain.

He once talked abt Camilla cabello how she looks “ridiculous” and made fun of her and said that shawn was right to leave her (I dunno if he was joking but that hurt me bad) I used to know how to respond in this kind of situations and make fun of his judgy ass in return but I couldn’t say a word I just froze.

He always had fun lifting my up with one hand and taking a house tour like that . it sort of becme our thing and now im scared that he will try to do it and can’t or will struggle with me being heavier than I used to. I rly dnt know if I can get over such situation however ridiculous it may sound to u.

2. money is tight (I spent too much on food)

3. exams : I literally have no time to spare next week and im afraid im gonna be too stressed to be nice and welcoming.

4. I lied to him abt my dermatophagia getting better when it’s not : all my fingers are disfigured and the time until he comes is so little for the to heal perfectly ( he sees them always wrapped in plaster while in video calls but thinks they’re perfectly fine and that it’s just easier for me that way to control my urge)

I feel like my relationship is falling apart because of me being so stupid. He just called me out now on being aggressive and mean and I can’t blame him.

He’s the love of my life and I can’t afford to lose him but I find myself pushing him away bcs of my insecurities.

I need advice but please be kind im being too hard on myself already.

We have been seeing each other for the past three months. We first started talking in September this year I met her in class and helped her with some assessments. I used to make a joke of buying myself a coffee for my time helping during class, but she actually bought me my coffee. This coffee ended up becoming a 2-hour conversion that hit it off well.

About a week later she gave me a hug and laid her head on my shoulder in class. So I did the obvious thing and asked her out. I took her out and it when well, but then she told me she was Muslim and that she couldn't be seeing me. At this point, I just accepted the fact and was gonna move on to the next, but that same day she ends up thanking me for the ""date"" and adding me on snap chat. Which I think nothing of originally. 

Eventually, the snap chat turned out to be just an excuse to continue talking to me which I ate up lol. We started talking even more than before and continued to see each other and continued to ""date"" for lack of a better word. We got to know each other quite a bit and even started holding hands etc. This happened all of Sep and Oct.

About the last week of Oct we unofficially ""broke up"". The reason for this was instigated by me getting mad about some dude joking that we were together, but her always saying no. We ended up going to her car (ironically the day after a nice date) and discussed the situation at hand. She told me I was a great guy and she didn't want to lead me on. Bc she knows her religion doesn't allow her to date, let alone talk to a Hispanic man. Since her family is super religious and wants her to marry an Arab Muslim man, and if she were to get caught it be game over for her. To make matters worse we both end up crying rip. She was crying because she told me that this was the first time in a long time a man made her happy and I was crying because I honestly can see myself with this woman for a long time. 

You'd think this would be the end of our ""relationship"", but instead of it ending there and us moving on, we resume talking the very next week and replacing by cuddling with each other 2 different times that week. So eventually I just tell her that we should live life one day at a time and just see each other and make each other happy for the longest time we can. This was the first week of November, then we went out on multiple dates, and our connection with each other was gotten 4 times as strong as before. I just got done talking to her today cuddles and date lol. 

We both really like each other not to lie we talk every day, message each other every day, understand each other on an emotional level, a physical level and talk for hours without it ever getting boring.  The only issue that I know is I can (In theory) end up with this woman for the rest of my life since I don't meet the family's ""Arab and Muslim"" requirements. So we have been seeing each other under the tables so speak with. 

To basically put simply we both can see each other happy with each other for a very long time, but this religious/family issue is still her. I have no idea what to do. I am happy now, but we are both gonna be extremely sad when in may we both are gonna have to pull the plug on this relationship. Even now I won't see her for 3 weeks since we just finished our finals week today. So it's sorta eating me alive that we truly care and want the best for each other but we are gonna hurt each other so much in May when I graduate and no longer can make the excuse to keep seeing her. Idk I just wanted to share my story Don't get it twisted I care for this woman on a level I have not cared for any other woman in my life and I know she cares about me and likes me a lot too bc she is risking her own stable family for me.

I’ve been on dating apps for a couple months now, so my experience might not be a whole research study. I’m also a a straight female in a fairly large metro in the Southern US. I posted yesterday about catfishers and how much they ruin it for everyone and some of y’alls responses have been both enlightening and sad. 

I’m putting the bots &amp; scammers aside. That’s not who I’m referring to, those are just scum and everyone agrees. Whether it’s touched up pics, old pics, filtered pics, lies about weight/height - WHY? More importantly, why do that when you plan on meeting the person IRL? 

I understand people can be whoever they want online but do they think the other person won’t notice the 50 extra lbs? Or the dog ears that are missing? Or the head hair that’s not there anymore? Or the missing inches in height? I don’t get it. 

Thankfully, the men I’ve met so far only tend to fluff up their height but everything else checked out. I’m 5’9”, not a height queen, but I simply don’t see myself with a man shorter than me. That said, I’ve gone out with guys whose profiles said 6’ or 6’3” and guess what - we were either eye level or they were shorter than me. Yes, I measured myself many times and I’m still 5’9” in flats. 

My guy friends have it much worse and I feel for them. From “women” who turned out to own a penis (not disclosed prior!), to ones who were an entirely different person IRL, that’s just exhausting, incredibly disrespectful, and a huge waste of time. 

So, what the fuck? Why? How is it even better to have someone reject you to your face because you look different?

We have great chemistry when together, we have the same sense of humor, the same views, and so much more in common. I like him a lot and he has expressed the same to me. The thing is, he has gotten horrible at texting back. In the month we were talking before we went on our first date, he was really good about texting back in a timely manner, but in the last month, his texting habits have changed for the worse. 

We have maybe one conversation every 2 days. He has a habit of leaving during the middle of a conversation and not texting back for either a whole day or 2. When he does text back, I don't get an apology, usually just asking how I've been. In our last conversation, which was 2 days ago, he actually acknowledged that he sucks at texting, he mentioned it without me bringing it up. I know that was my chance to expand on it and tell him that I wish he would work on it, but I've never been good at expressing my wants so I didn't say anything. Also, it kinda bothers me that he knows he's bad at it but doesn't seem to be making an effort to improve.

When we are texting, he expresses a lot of interest in what's been going on in my life and we have funny banter and it's great, the problem is his speed at which he texts back. I do know that he works a lot, but he also worked a lot when we were texting in that first month, and this wasn't an issue then. Also, I feel it's also important to mention that we've only been on 5 dates. In the span of 2 and a half months. 5 dates. Granted, these dates usually last upwards of 4 hours and consist of great talks and getting to know one another really well. But still, I would love to see him more often. 

At this point, I would normally just assume he isn't interested anymore, but he goes out of his way to show me that he does. I very recently had a performance with a music group I'm in, and I casually invited him and he made an effort to come. Every time I looked over at him he was smiling and cheering me on. I also had a couple friends as spies (lol) in the crowd who both confirmed that he took a video of me during a song in which I was the soloist in. I feel like he wouldn't do that if he didn't genuinely like me??

Anyway, I just don't know how to tell him that I really wish he would text me back faster and I could see him more often. I know he works a lot and I don't want it to seem that I'm demanding more of his time and that I'm crazy, but this has really been bothering me.

Sorry this post has been so long, but I felt like there was a lot of details I needed to add to paint an accurate picture of the current situation. If you've read this whole thing, you're a real one.

We live 2.5 hours away from each other. During our first few months of dating, I jokingly suggested she should find a job here so we can live together or something and she took it seriously and got a job here, which starts next month, so we’ve had to find somewhere so we’ve decided to rent a flat together soon.

The flat will be 2 hours away from her house, and 1 hour away from my place that we are living at now. We collect the keys in just over a week. I currently live with my mum and dad, and she lives with her dad and her brother/his GF.

This job she’s got is one she’s been trying so long to get so she doesn’t want to lose the opportunity.

I’m the only child and me and my mum have lived together since I was born. She’s always been there for me and raised me up. My dad who currently lives with us, only just came back from living abroad 2 months ago. He’s going to return back abroad in 1.5 months, which will leave my mum alone. He’s not lived with us for around 6-7 years as they’ve separated.

My dad is early 70s and mum is early 60s.
My GFs dad is early 50s and her mum is early 40s.

Now that I’m moving out very soon, she’s very upset, feels worried that she’s going to be alone in the flat, lonely and depressed (she’s unemployed due to health issues and at home everyday on her phone on social media interacting with people that she doesn’t know). Her being alone might make her more lonely and depressed? 

She gets upset and says she’s raised me up and looked after me only for me to move out with a girl and forget about her. Lately, she’s been repeating the line that I’m ‘leaving her’.

I’ve already said I’m going to make the effort and come see her 1-2 times a week. Although I know I’m going to be quite busy with work, I’m still going to try once a week, but my friend thinks the ‘1-2 times a week’ will slowly decrease and end up being 1-2 times a month. Which I’m very scared about.

Her parents doesn’t have a problem with her moving. I feel the age of our parents play a part in this. As her parents are still young, they’re more chilled and aren’t concerned. My parents are older and have health issues, which makes it harder for me as I worry about them so much and me moving away just makes my mum stressed that she’s worried she’d be more depressed and lonely.

She has no friends and has no job. She’s got some health issues where she isn’t able to walk too much or lift heavy stuff. Sometimes I tell her that I’ve told her many times when she’s had opportunities to be friends with people or keep the friendship, she chooses not to and it’s her fault for preferring to be alone and have no friends as she enjoys not socialising with anyone.

She doesn’t understand that I need to try explore my life and learn to do things myself as right now she’s doing everything for me?

A big part of me wants to stay and a small part wants to move. But as she’s feeling so stressed and upset about it, I’ve already had to rethink this moving out decision many times already.

I don’t know what to do.. 

I’ve suggested my GF to move in here but she wants space and isn’t comfortable if my mum is here too as she’d want to do things with me.

A few weeks ago when I had to rethink, I did suggest to my GF to maybe to stay down there and not move up or she rents herself but she said she didn’t want to lose the opportunity with the job and she can’t afford renting herself as it’s pricey.

We’ve already bought some furniture and house things and are nearly ready to move in soon. We’ve signed the agreement which is 6 months minimum and 5 years max and paid the deposit.

But the situation with my mum still remains ongoing.

I worry how she will cope alone as she’s been so used to me coming back home from work everyday and cooking food for me everyday.
I worry she’d not have to do that anymore and feel depressed and rejected.

What is the right thing to do? I would feel sad that I’m not able to be with her during the times where she gets older (example if I saw her in a few months and she’s changed a lot, that would make me really sad inside as she’s already getting old and complains she’s weak and has muscle pain).

Some say I shouldn’t leave and just tell the GF I have to take care of my mum, and if she wants to leave then let her as there’s plenty of fish in the sea and I only have one mum?

I’m really stuck in a very awkward situation.

Day 1, we texted a lot, laughing, roasting each other, and by the night, yeah it happened. 
It was an awesome experience, and we ""Goodnight"" to each other.
Day 2, started with a goodmorning from her side, we exchanged our daily agendas, roasted each other (with her getting sun toasted by me) and laughing a lot. And I asked her to come on a video chat, and to my surprise she did. We spokr for hours and hours on video, spoke about family, religion and a lot of other things. And again that night, we did it. So we promised each other that we wouldn't do it the next day.
Day 3, sent her greetings, we started off our day pretty well, she was kinda busy tho, nevertheless we had a lot of time to talk. And then my conscience started kicking in and I told her that I felt guilty for what we did past two nights. She responded very maturely to that, and we decided to keep it low. And after hours of conversation , a lot happened and we confessed to each other that we had caught feelings for one another. Even though she dismissed her feelings in the beginning, she and I felt for each other in the same way. 
We were about to wrap up for the day deciding to date, and called each other 'babe', but we couldn't stop talking so we kept talking until it was morning.
Day 4, she hit me up, and we had the best moments of our lives, she admired me a lot, I admired her a lot, but in the evening we started to discuss about our relationship and how far can it go. We were separated by a long distance, a couple thousand miles.
There was no way we could have a future ahead of us unless we eloped together. But that's not an option. So we decided to hit the brakes, but then couldn't hold back and decided to go with the risks.

Essentially we had 95% of our dates in the car, which I enjoy, don’t get me wrong, but it just becomes lazy after sometime. After 4 months I asked him what his intentions were, but all he said was “there is no need to rush” or “eventually I’ll ask you.” I ended up cutting him off because I wanted to focus on my self. 

We didn’t end on bad terms, which is why we are friends now.  We have been talking and he says “I didn’t think of you as a friend” but states that he wants to see where it goes.

Basically this girl who many people would say is “out of my league” started talking to ME and expressed that she was crushing on me. I met her at my friends birthday party and we have all been in a friend group together since. 

She said she found me extremely attractive and many other things personality wise. 
Note that; She has an unfortunate past with abusive parents and such however has went to therapy and reconciled her relationship with them. 

I noticed constant changes with her.  I am a manager as well as head of human resources at my job which i believe helps me in handling situations that involve conflict. We text mostly and if i say something that might not even be what i mean, she’ll get mad and leave me on read for a while. Ive gone a day or two. I told her that she needs to tell me instead of shutting down.  I understand waiting for her emotions to calm down but i get confused. 

i also tend to be level headed to where i can nip the situation immediately. I feel as though i am walking on eggshells. 

When i asked her on a date she obviously agreed but expressed that she is very scared she will not meet my standards and expectations. And that she is emotionally unavailable and will need time to progress through romantic stages. That she cant promise me anything. Mind you we have been talking dirty etc where she has even said she feels like shes being she being bad lol and initiates that too.

Next day shes texting me dirty and sending pics of her in lingerie. She also is the one that really is reaching out to me and initiating. I am very confused. 

She is very outspoken and has very strong feels about men and sexual assault against women.  She believes that most men are toxic etc though. 

Again, i feel im walking on eggshells but we havent gone on a date yet so i want to give it a chance. 


Day before yesterday we got in a fight for something that happened in the friend group lmao ill explain if anyone wants. She apologized and so yesterday i gave her space and didnt text her until late that night she texts me that is she rethinking about the date. We talked in voice this morning and i am completely confused now.  She doesnt want to have something so formal as a sitdown dinner but rather getting something and going on an adventure.  She wants to be friends first. I asked if she felt as if things were going to fast to which she replied i think so. 
We tend to text all day everyday which before this i expressed i dont like and if we can find a compromise this way i can give my devoted attention in a conversation and that our texting doesnt begin to just be going through motions. 

I told her i was still interested in her which she claimed to say yes as well. I asked her what she wants to do texting and talking wise in which she said whenever youre thinking about me. Anytime. See how our days are going etc. 

After the call we texted a little and then when it didnt warrant a response i just let it be. An hour later she texts me again and keeps texting me. 

I am so confused. I am but also have doubt if i am even interested in her romantically anymore/should be. She is incredibly attractive like i said may even be out of my “league”.  But i am content in how i am and take care of myself too. 

I agreed to go forward but told her i wont tolerate being strung along as i dont compete nor play games. I have a life to live. And that i am fine with things becoming platonic but i will need time. 

Hopefully this isnt all over the place and i tried to make it short so im sure im missing things.

I met this girl as we were working at a family restaurant as bussers. We were still in high school at the time and were a grade apart from each other. We pretty much hit it off from the start. We’ve made inside jokes with each other, shared the same tastes in music, and so on. I always thought of her as a best friend, even though we didn’t really hang out of work, but we pretty much texted each other here and there. After a year working there, I decided to leave and work at another spot nearby, and so went our communication with each other. We talked here and there, sent memes, etc.

Fastforwarding to the current times, my father stops in here for a drink and there at her job and she constantly asks about me, as well as telling him to tell me to call her and whatnot. I never did. Last weekend, I went to her work because my friend was having his birthday party there. I surprised her as she was rolling silverware, she pretty much wasn’t expecting me to be there and jumped onto me giving me a big hug. During that moment it felt weird, being hugged. Like it wasn’t a normal hug I guess. We pretty much caught up with each other, she’s in her sophomore year of college while I’m in the process of enlisting into the Army. After catching up, I’ve been thinking of her alot recently. She told me to text her whenever I finished a book she read awhile ago (I made fun of her for reading it, and here I am reading it) and to tell her the ending, so I did. Today she asked if I wanted to borrow some books she found in a closet. Nothing out of the norm, right?

My girlfriend and I have been together for three months now and we have had a fairly physical relationship including having had sex. We are both baptist Christians and felt extremely guilty about this and have decided not to do it anymore.

Immediately after having sex she broke down into tears and I also felt guilty. However, following this, she began obsessing over whether or not she was pregnant, making me buy 6+ pregnancy tests, condoms, Plan B, etc. For about two weeks she was inconsolable and came very close to attempting suicide.

I have comforted to her to the best of my ability but at times she just shuts down and will not speak, leaving me confused and frustrated. She continuously asks me if I still love her, etc. and goes through periods of extreme affection followed by random periods of extreme depression and impulsive actions (walking around alone at night, taking too much medication, calling suicide hotlines, etc.)

I will say that she has just had her period and took Plan B twice… could this be the reason for her mood swings? Is she just mentally ill?

I (26F) have just re-entered the dating world after the end of a 4 year monogamous relationship. I matched with Chris (28M) on Tinder 2 weeks ago. 

Chris pursued me with gusto, and we ended up getting more intimate this week. He discloses he was HSV-2 prior to intimacy. I have never had herpes symptoms, but have an appointment for a blood test Monday in case I am asymptomatic. I do not think this is a judge of his character, and I know it is just a skin rash. But I have my own autoimmune disorder that can be impacted by the antiviral meds if I was to contract the virus, and to be frank I would like to limit my exposure. We put intimacy on the shelf for the meantime. 

I get to know Chris more and realize we don't have a ton in common, some differences in personalities, and we aren't quite on the same level (goals, career, finances). These are bigger factors for me than th HSV, but I will admit the HSV has limited my desire for something casual.  

Yesterday I kinda gave Chris the downlow I wasn't intersted in a commited relationship, I think he is taking it to the fact of his herpes disclosure, but it was more-so I wasn't feeling it. 

Now I'm laying in bed crying since I know the feelings of rejection. I could see it on Chris's face how he was hurt, dating involves so much hurt. I hate it. It brings up all my emotions of me being rejected. The empty feeling it leaves inside of you. I don't want him to feel unlovable, expecially concerning all the emotions surrouding herepes I have read about on that subreddit. I also have the new found super worry about contracting herpes (which I guess I knew all along, but honestly didn't really-I have done a lot of learning this week).

This is my first time using a dating app and I already sense the issues; mainly the lack of really knowing the person at all before joining into the idea of being romantic with them. If we would have met through the social world, I would have maybe been able to decern the personality differences before ever suggesting something romantic.

We are really steady and could already get married if we only have good financial and mental health status. (We already 24yo) 😅 in short,  HE'S REALLY REALLY AMAZING and I must have saved  a lot of people in my past life to deserve this love.

Anw, my issue is that I wanna be loved unapologetically. I am a romantic. I dream of cliche romantic stuff you can find in books and movies. So... Since this is the only relationship I will have (I'm claiming and manifesting it!!), I wanna experience a loot of things... every little thing. 

However, my partner is really shy and private... And this makes some of my romance dreams impossible.  🥺😞

I couldn't tell him these dreams bec I don't want him to do it just bec I told him I like them. It's like pathetic and desperate. I hope he could do those things to me on his own.. (ex: u want a flower. But ofc u cant tell your bf u want a flower for valentine bec then you'll only get a flower bec u told him u want a flower) hope you guys understand what I mean. 

The things I like for example is my bf posting abt me in his social media account bec he's proud of me or find me really pretty... Or writing me letters and notes.

I know what I'm saying is kinda childish and doesn't mean a lot for other people. But again, I would really like to experience all things other couples experience even if they appear immature. These are dreams that the child/teen in me wants. 

We have healthy communication so I have already told him that I am a romantic and would love to experience lots of things. I just didn't tell him specifically what they are bec ofc, that's for him to figure out. 

My bf is really nice in all other aspects and these things I'm talking abt are just big bonus in our relationship if they happen.

I met him on Tinder (F21, M25). At first he wanted me to come over to his place for the first date, but I declined that and he took me out for movies. The conversations so far have been pretty “basic” and surface level, mostly small talk or about our days, I don’t see much effort from his side to get to know about me as a person, my opinions or future plans. 

Before the second date he also made a slight joke that I see as a yellow flag. We were talking about his martial arts class, and I said I’d probably just get squished. He joked “probably, unless we’re fighting in bed”. I see that as a sexual innuendo?

**So Now we’re planning the second date** and he asked “so will you come over now? 😇”

I responded “Sure we can chill but I’m not promising any sexual stuff with you yet”

He said “I totally get it, it’s not the only thing on my mind either”

So I just said that’s good to hear. **Then for some reason he responded** “Is it the only thing on your mind then?🙈”

It's a full nude club so theres no alcohol at the bar, just sodas and water basically. I've had quite a few VIP dances with some of the girls there, but never interacted with the bartenders since there no real drinks, except for my very first time when two drinks were required for free entry. 

The other day though, a few weeks since my last visit, I ended up stopping by the club again after having some drinks and when I got halfway in the club, the bartender shouts my name and waves me over towards her. She told me she's been meaning to say hi and introduce herself the past few times she saw me and has been waiting for me to come in again since it's been a few weeks since the last time I was in there and she didn't want to miss her chance this time around. 

I followed her up by asking her how she knew my name, cause I had never met her before, and flirted a little when I also asked why she wanted to meet me. She tells me that she's been seeing me around for a bit and heard I'm pretty chill from some of the other girls and loved that I was also into researching crypto and stocks quite bit, but she was always too busy or couldn't get away from the bar to meet the past few times. She then ask for my number so that we talk some time. To confirm she has my number she sends me a text right there at the bar so she can see my phone that says ""hey it's (Name) the bartender😊, save my number so we can hang out and I can harass you about crypto sometime 😉"". This was followed by that sexy look girls give when they bite their lip a little and look you in your eye, yeah, she did that right when I looked back up at her after reading her text and right before i ended up leaving lol. 

Anyway, I'm just looking to see how most of you would interpret this or take this? Does she want me to ask her out? Or is she just looking for investment info or maybe she's got a hidden agenda of her own to get in my wallet?? 

What do you all think? Thoughts?? 

For clarity, I never intended to date anyone from visiting the club and I know when the dancers ask for my number after some dances it's so they can text or call me to come back. I'm well aware of the tactics from the dancers lol. But this was different, especially how it went down, so I'm a little lost here and it's of course tempting to go ask her on out on a date. She is pretty damn hot herself and she's right around the same age as me (25-30), although I'll admit she's probably just a little out of my league if I'm being honest, cause she is fine haha, but nothing that's not obtainable considering couples I see everyday walking around. I've also scored a hottie before, tho it's very rare since it's always been them coming to me lol, so I know it's not out of question, but it's still happening in a strip club so it's suspect.

A weeks ago I went back to another city to meet my best friend,one of my guy friend also lives there,we weren't much in contact since COVID happened but when I told him that I will be visiting he invited me over to hangout and ofcourse I wanted to see him cause it's been so long  and we've never hung out one on one cause we became friends through a group and so the dynamic was always like this.
Now I've had a crush on him before but just left it at that because he is quite popular among girls and a lot of my friends were actively pursuing him too.so I just let it go and was content with being friends.
Fast forward to me hanging out at his house I felt this weird tension between us ,and I felt that I missed a lot of signs .he was super super nice to me all the time I was there we talked about a lot of things and overall I had a fun time ,all my old feelings for him started coming to surface so maybe I started thinking of normal gestures among friends who met after long as something else.

Later on when I was leaving he said let's meet again and go to this bar and we met again a day later,so it was a pretty expensive place and I was like we'll okay one time I can spend ,we might not see each other for a long time again.he shows up dressed very nicely and was very attentive and was constantly asking me if I am hungry If I want something else , trying to make me feel comfortable overall which is something I haven't seen him do before specially how he behaves with our friends,girls too.i mean I don't know what it was.and at the end of the date he didn't let me split he said that we met after so long and it's his treat,and mind you the bill was high,I kinda felt bad.

We came back to my friends place where I was staying,as I had to pack and leave ,and he was just staring at me the entire time while I couldn't even meet his eye ,then he dropped me off and we said goodbye.my friend asked where we went and he casually said to her oh we went on a date and I just got even more confused and awkwardly laughed and agreed.

And I mostly have white friends. Live in a town where it's mostly caucasians, so nothing new. And I know I'm good looking so it's not the problem. The thing is unlike in high school which was a very difficult part of my life (mostly because of strict parents) I wasn't allowed the same freedom until mostly 20 years old approximately.

And it's not them who make me feel that way, but the guys. They will throw themselves just to say hi to them, offer drinks, and maybe offer me one at the last minute to be polite. I feel so left alone even though my friends have no control on the situation. They try to present me, include me in the conversation. I feel like maybe it's easy for them to go towards what they know is ""safe/familiar"". And they could also be wondering :""where is she from, does she even speak our language?"" Wich is very understandable. I know everyone has their preferences, like I do. It's just that it's starting to get to me how I am still perceived as ""intriguing"" ""different"" to people in general. Maybe it's because I was here probably longer or as much as them and I'm used to be black among white people and they don't know that about me. I feel like I am beautiful to look at and that's about it, until they actually talk to me and get to know me they let their guard down. Maybe it's also the maturity certain people still don't have, to be opened to getting to know new people just because they have a different skin tone.

I'm trying to figure out how do I navigate the situation now. If simply choose not to speak to him and wait for him to contact me whenever he returns, he may have lost interest by then. We have not spoken in a week, and I'm contemplating texting him now.

I have a slight fear of rejection, however we did end things off on a very positive note last week.

My gf is a pro athlete. She broke up with this dude like 5 months ago, and we now have a relationship for like a month. 

Her ex actually does a variety of sports, but they used to work out together a lot (yes, in both that way and the actually working out way).

He lives outer state, so it was kinda LDR. It is clear that he is not yet over her at all. He messages her on IG, while they agreed to not have any contact for the next couple of months.  
The conversation was first purely him asking how she was, her asking it back (I think that is just polite and respectful) and just casual talk. At the end, when he literally asked for every single f\*cking thing you can think about, he just asked: ""Hey, how about we stay in contact like this more frequently? Then we can meet up and do our usual workout""  


My GF read the whole conversation out loud for me, brought this whole thing up herself and answered him that she thinks it is not a good idea to stay in contact this fast, and they should wait to do so (would be fine in the future she says).  
She postponed telling me about this thing at the start, cause she was afraid it would come across as weird. She did not tell him about my existence at all though.

What would you do if you were me? Relax and sit back? Or must I do something?

TLDR: GF ex messages my GF (against the deal they made) to have a long conversation of him just asking how she is and her responding. Then the ex wanted to stay in contact and meet up. She declined and says maybe later, not now.

so, two ish years ago now i used an app called Taffy to meet my ex-girlfriend-turned-best-friend. the big premise to it, that i haven't seen anywhere else, is that your pictures and the sort are entirely blurred out until you actually begin talking to the person you match with. after about a week of talking, you eventually get a ""complete match"" and unlock their photos to see what they look like. truth be told, it's like the cliché dating shows with the three people behind walls lmao

however, i went to reinstall the app given recent events and... it's gone. and visiting its website provides a nasty certificate error, which tells me the Taffy gang have shit the bed and it no longer exists.

are there any apps that do similar to this? i love the premise and it seems -- both from my own experience and from stories i see online from people i happened to suggest Taffy to before -- that it was a working model. a lot of dating apps seem to have HEAVY preference on hookups too, where Taffy actually had numerous different categories dedicated from anywhere to dating, to hook-ups, to looking for more friends to play games or whatever.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1135286,public,self,potential dating apps like Taffy?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rdwo02/potential_dating_apps_like_taffy/,no_ads,0.0,,,
