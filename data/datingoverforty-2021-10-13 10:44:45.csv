I was reading another sub in which a poster stated that having casual sex doesn’t make sense for women because in those situations the men are basically treating them like fleshlights. That makes a lot of sense to me. But, being recently divorced, I don’t have much experience in this area. I currently have zero interest in dating, but would consider the casual route. (Don’t bother with the dms- it won’t be you.) Do you find that this is true? Is there a way to weed these guys out?

Also, how does a woman even initiate this? I live in a small city and can’t imagine putting up a profile that says casual. There is a non-zero chance that people I work with would see it.

26,q88lhe,1634244869,"Ok, Reddit, help a guy out! First date advice wanted","Background: I'm 41M, divorced, father of two; she's 51, divorced, mother of two. Our two youngest (10F's) are close friends and I am very comfortable with her youngest, as she's spent a lot of time at my house over the last few years. (Her youngest occasionally jokingly refers to me as her dad; biological dad has been out of the picture for years.) I've built yard equipment for her, and helped her oldest with homework, and we've always kind of gravitated towards each other at parties and such.

On Tuesday I surprised the hell out of both of us by asking her out when she showed up for pickup. She blushed and accepted, and sent me a really nice text when she got home about being really flattered and unable to stop smiling.

She's been dating without too much success for years; I'm not sure about her recent history but she's exceptionally attractive and very friendly, and I have a really hard time seeing her involuntarily on the sidelines.

I have not dated since my divorce a year ago. I have not been interested in casually dating just in general, but I am very interested in dating her specifically.

We're going out to coffee on Friday at 4:00. She's friends with my ex, with whom I am on cordial terms, and who is actually quite happy for both of us and immediately volunteered to watch all of the kids while we're out. (The kids do not know yet, and I do not want to set them up for potential disappointment, so they probably won't know explicitly for a while yet.) Apparently both of us have occasionally been the topic of casual gossip in the school mom's group when it comes to carrying torches, lol; I had no idea and thought I was just being friendly, but apparently the fact that I had a little thing for her was obvious enough for other women to comment on.

To the point: I have no idea what standard operating procedure for a first date is nowadays. I haven't been on a first date in literally 20 years, lol, and tbh I wasn't the most adept dater then either! And also most of the advice I've read seems geared towards first dates for people who have never met before, and a lot of the advice (like ""don't have the kids know about your new significant other for six months"") is obviously not even close to applicable here.

I am not concerned with being able to be authentic and such; the date is going to be fun and I'm completely sure we'll get along great. I'm mostly concerned with messaging and either missing signals or sending the wrong ones, especially since she is pretty much as involved in the current dating world as she wants to be while I haven't been on a first date since, you know, Y2K. I would very much like to get to a second date. 

I want to convey that I'm very, very interested in her but that I want to move slowly and carefully especially given our social networking and the kids. Right now I want to get to know her better and develop a closer friendship, but I definitely do not want to lose track of the romantic side of things either. I will very likely put on my big boy pants and use my words to say exactly that; but I don't know if saying that in and of itself breaks a norm, or would freak out people with expectations based on contemporary dating, etc.

27,q8b7rb,1634253455,Busy yet willing,"Hey everyone! I find myself in a conundrum and thought I’d hear how others deal with it.

Today I got home at 6 after a ten hour day and I’m pretty beat. Good news is this is early for me so I’ll have time to settle in with my kiddos to watch an episode or two of breaking bad with them before bed. 

I’m a big advocate for not using your busy schedule to shy away from dating but I’ve found it pretty difficult to think of how I could possibly smash it into my life.

Some background: I took a dating hiatus for 2.5 years for my mental health. Started up again…in February 2020. We all know what happened that March and because my mom is immunocompromised I chose to lock down hard. My parents now have their third booster and me and my kids have gotten our two shots, my work has a mask and vaccine mandate in place and I’ve been trying to be a little more social now, always outside and masked with people I don’t know. Anyway I’d like to maybe see about making friends, lovers, partners? (pretty open here lol) with people now. But during the pandemic I got a new job.

This job is amazing. I have an angel of a boss, incredible coworkers, unheard of good benefits, good pay. But the hours and work are demanding. It’s a social job so not only am I getting to practice my social skills (they kinda died in pandemic isolation) but we also have company supported programs to help with just that. I’ve been taking every class they offer and utilizing our company’s eap program.

With all this being said I’m not sure how to incorporate other people into my life. Anyone else have a mentally and socially taxing job that struggles to make time for others? If so how do you make that time? I’d like good strategies on making time for things outside of work and family. I’ve always made time for my personal time but seem to be doing a poor job of it now.

One of mine favorite bad tells is when (and I'm a man here asking women out) we discuss meeting for a drink/coffee and I suggest a time/place (and I always put thought into this to try to make their drive easy, directions, low-key vibe, etc). If they swat the place down and suggest another, that is an absolutely sure sign it's gonna be a bad match. I can't explain why, but 100% of the time they show up and are uncomfortable, offputting, just all ""wrong"". Maybe this is a dominance move or something?

It’s not the easiest conversation to have with your partner but I’m sexually frustrated and have been for the last month &amp; a 1/2 or two. Not trying to be a jerk but the facts are facts and I want you to know…..

I have two options here:

- don’t have sex with you ever because I just can’t be the full time initiator 
- get some Viagra or Cialis so I can have a “dick hard on demand”. Do ALL the initiating, always oral sex for you never for me

It can be done but not sure I want to put us through that. Why can’t you just like sex more?  I know it’s partly my fault because maybe all the shit you allowed me to put you through but fact still remains.

Another fact: I called Walmart to get a refill on my Cialis 

Another fact: I masturbated in your bathroom last night while you were asleep. Are you ok with that when you’re right outside the door?  I have a feeling it might not bother you that much at all because you seem more apathetic to things like that based on what I’ve noticed but correct me if I’m wrong. But either way it should not be that way when we’re together?  I don’t feel wanted by you anymore.  It’s rejection by the omission of almost all the effort on your part.

Youbdidn’t have to say I was a chore but it’s OK cause I already knew, I’ve known that for a minute now….  

I would say we have a bad sex life now.  I’m a chore because I have to do ALL the work to ever get anything started. You just don’t have the drive anymore or maybe you never did. Was it just our so called honeymoon phase? Idk but I feel rejected by omission of sexual attention from you.

I think I should feel attracted to by you but I don’t.  Men translate sex with love it’s just how we’re made.  If she wants to make love to me and she does on a regular basis she must love me. And if she doesn’t at least I get sex on a regular basis and it’s initiated by the other partner too. 

Not that bad of a life.

I know with you getting up there in age these things are not important to you anymore maybe they never really were because you had a really bad relationship with Phil for so many years. I’m not giving up but I just wanted to know how I’ve been feeling. It’s hard to talk about this stuff and it’s hard to be honest without anyone get their feelings hurt but I will try my best. I was too hot and bothered in the wrong way this morning I just had to leave before I said something I would regret.

I don’t want to bring up the J word’s name but this is the reason why I will never be with her and decided that years ago because she just doesn’t ever made the first move and it’s I’m not used to that. My whole life I never had to make the first move or the second, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and so on…

I wonder what a couples counselor would say on the matter with Jan not being fair. I don’t know but I know I love you and I know this hurts me a lot but I really didn’t/don’t know how to say it..

Ok, so J is 38, lives alone, separated after a sexless marriage. I’m 44. His wife is newly diagnosed with high functioning autism and they have twins, also autistic. He gets along well with her but she gave him an ultimatum after she was seeing a sex therapist - she doesn’t ever want to have sex again. They separated and amicable. 

He is in AA, has been sober for 6 years. We had a coffee catch up a few weeks ago and have been talking for a bit over 2 months. We talk every day, he expressed how much he likes me. I like him. 

So today I went to his place. I need to travel overseas to help my mother recover from a surgery and I will be gone for 6-8 weeks. He knows all about it and we wanted to meet and get intimate before my trip. 

He took himself off the OLD app soon after we started talking and we agreed that we want something exclusive and beyond sex. So we met and the sex could have been good. But…

He went down on me for 10-15 minutes but I would have needed more time to cum. Not sure why, I was very much in the mood. Anyway, I went down on him and then we got into PIV which was good. He hasn’t had  sex in a year and I knew he wouldn’t last long. He did last a good 15 minutes still. I can only cum from oral. I figured since he was amazing at it, I don’t mind if he cums and then we can repeat and I can cum too. The whole experience was nice and sensual. Had better sex but wasn’t a lost cause. The height and body shape difference (he is slim and tall, I’m short and voluptuous) does bother me a bit but we seem attracted to each other. 

Then he had to call his kids at bath time (10 minutes, his kids weren’t chatty) and of course kids come first. Coincidentally my kid is autistic too, so I get it, he should call the kids in the usual time. I figured we could have a second rd after. 

He kept saying he had a wonderful time and sex with his asexual wife was nothing like this and how attractive he finds me. And he is not seeing anyone else and he wants to try to see me before I go or he will wait until I come back. He also can’t believe he came before me. When he said this the second time I said to him well I didn’t cum. He says yeah I noticed.

We chat a good chat, all dressed up. So I indicated we could go back, he says he needs to go do groceries, won’t have time for a second round. 

He saw me to the car, kissed me and we talked about chatting later and trying to meet again. 

I’m unsatisfied and I don’t understand the whole situation. I feel that I should just end it with him asap. He was nice and otherwise very sensual and wanted me to text him when I get home but I feel upset and thinking of just ending this. 

Any thoughts before I pull the trigger? Thanks

P.S. He must have done his groceries in a flash because he is messaging me. Also asked if we can chat while I’m overseas. (Of course we can.)

75,q9y76e,1634475482,I picked the literal worst time to break up with someone,"Some of you are probably aware of my post history, I have had an on again off again relationship with a man for almost a year and a half. I posted here when we broke up before and then tail between my legs, did not post when we got back together.

I did the shittiest thing because we broke up a month ago (I don’t go for this drama and this is the only relationship I’ve experienced it) and then got back together. Before that, we had broken up and I gave him several, for lack of a better term, ultimatums. 

I can be a bit of an offence collector, it can be hard for me to speak my mind. So I did think it fair to lay out these issues a few months ago, he still wanted to be together and so he knew what it required. 

There has been very little improvement, and very little acceptance about his role in things which I now see as a huge problem with people. His mom recently got very sick and this made two things come to light: he wasn’t handling well and was short with me and picking fights. I can’t live like that. I am also very good to him and his mom (and he has other family in the picture helping him) and would have continued to help but I couldn’t put up with him being angry and then using me as his “safe person” to direct it at. 

With his mother getting sick, I already knew, but it showed me how much he relies on her and how much his dad does and how that would be my lot in life. He wanted to have a bbq last week and he needed all these things to get ready that I had to run around and buy… keep in mind I work fulltime and have custody of my child. I have often said I would give him the money as he’s not working and could get things but he doesn’t like to go in stores 😭. I know this may sound like a petty complaint, but he basically demanded everyone bring food (his sister who has been helping with his mom made 3 salads at his demands) I had to give him money to put gas in his truck, help him slaughter an animal, make something, buy a tote, 8 bags or so of charcoal, ice, plates, napkins, cutlery… in several trips because he’s not very organized either.

He sort of expected me to make his life simpler and while he said thank you he seemed to think he was entitled to that help? 

He was on a benefits program which has run out and only periodically had money coming in, and seemed perfectly content to eat at my house all the time, or ask me for money. There was no plan to change anything, he wanted to live together (no way, wasn’t big on the idea in the first place). 

The night before last he was over and started complaining to me in my room that my son didn’t make him feel welcome. I explained that I would talk to him but that I did not want to fight. I also explained that sometimes I need alone time as well. He was irritated that we used to spend a lot more of our free time together… problem is all his time is free and mine is pretty much spent working my ass off. 

He left in a huff saying he wouldn’t come over when y son was here anymore and if I wanted to let my son run my life, that was fine as long as it didn’t impact him. From my perspective, things were pretty much over and I didn’t hear from him the next day until the evening when he expected to go to a party with me. I had gone by myself, I would have had to anyway as I was so mad at him at this point I couldn’t talk to him. 

He said a lot of hurtful things and accused me of being on a date. It was a party related to my work which he knew but he gets irrational in arguments. 

He had been low key arguing with me for a week, and I think he was sincerely trying to push me away in his depression. Anyway, we broke up. He told me I was a terrible person and I’m doing this because his mother is sick and I don’t want to deal with it (I’ve actually been visiting her a lot and took her for the day recently, so doesn’t make sense) and because our sex life took a dive (it had before this and I do understand when someone is stressed it can and we had talked about it). 

He did not, at all, agree with my theory that: we have never been that solid and have broken up a lot, most recently a month ago, but at least 4 times during the relationship, I want to help but I don’t want to be taken advantage of for my time, money, etc. I want to be able to go to his home (huge issue, didn’t realize he cleaned it before we met to impress me, that was short lived and it’s scary now, sidenote, he also won’t clean it for his son or to have his mom sometimes so I will never win there), and that he needs some sort of income. And finally I don’t want to be fighting, and giving me the silent treatment, or have him picking apart how my son acts, he’s on the spectrum and doing his best and actually likes the bf.

If you’ve read this far, sorry for the book. You may wonder how this happened and it was gradual. He cleaned his house before we met. He shoved a lot in his child’s room and the basement, places I didn’t go. As time went on the house filled up with more junk. I thought he owned his house and truck, later found his parents owned them. Later found he doesn’t pay them anything for it and so they totally pay those expenses. 

I thought he worked with his father, and with his farm. Later found out the farm costs a mint to run, and he only works with his father once in awhile, when he feels like it, and not often as they don’t get along. 

I was pretty far in at the point these things came to light, and he paid lip service to improving, but it never really happened.

I am now taking a break from dating until at least January. I had a fwb in the past that I can see to keep me from hitting the apps. I’m going to quit smoking and lose some weight (he smoked and didn’t eat well which I can’t blame him for me picking it up, but regardless I feel gross). I’m going to catch up on work, hang out with friends, and enjoy my alone time. And really think about why I let this relationship go on.

I do know our family backgrounds were very traumatic and there was the thought, probably, that I could fix him. I pitied him I guess. I also like to help people to the point I will exhaust myself and I have to put a stop to that. 

It’s also furthered my reserve that I never want to live with someone. I can very easily get codependent which is not healthy. And yes, he’s basically a hobosexual. 

So again I guess my question is if I’m the asshole for my timing… I don’t feel I really chose it as he’s the one that fought with me and didn’t communicate and then got aggressive. 

I feel very sad it ended this way as I am in communication with most of my exes, and I know he needs support right now.

I know I’m a grown woman who should be able to stand up to her family, but I’m having trouble getting over that fear. (Side note: yes I’ve been seeing a therapist about this)

My BF has told me that my being on birth control offends him and makes him think I’m not committed to our relationship. Has requested in the past, and now demanding I stop taking it. He says that me “waiting” and saying “I’m not ready now but will be later” only gives him false hope. It’s basically now or never.

But then every now and then I just “fall” for someone hard and get washed up in a sea of infatuation. It’s happened 3 times in the past, and it’s happening again now.

And in all the previous times it’s ended badly, because I get obsessed with that person and become way too clingy, and/or they just weren’t feeling the same way or weren’t looking for a deeper commitment than the more casual dating we had leading up to it.

My question is how do I temper these feelings when they’re occurring? I know 100% that if any of these women had let things grow to a relationship, eventually these feelings would have subsided and then it would be normal relationship challenges. In the previous instances, no contact has always worked for me, and indeed I’ve been able to reconnect with 2 of them, and 1 of them I’ve formed a genuinely strong platonic friendship with. So I know I can do this, but this time I want to try and manage it while keeping the relationship going.

I’m also going to admit in all of these cases it’s been when I’m dating someone who I feel is out of my league looks wise. Well except one. But right now for sure that is the case, she’s genuinely dating down a few notches lol. It’s not that there isn’t anything else, we get along really well. But it’s just that combo where I connect well either someone AND they’re super hot that I start losing the plot",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/q9yxva/how_to_deal_with_my_own_infatuation_tendencies/

80,q9zzci,1634481542,How do I help my widowed father date and not be scammed,"My father (M/65) lost his wife/ my mother (F/55) 2 years ago. I wasn't sure if he would want to find someone else after a certain point in time but I always thought it was likely as he isn't very good at being alone. 

We have always gotten along but never really communicated about deep things. First time i saw him cry in 30 years was when mum passed. 

About 8 months ago (1.5 years after her death) he asked me how to send gift cards online. Instantly this was a red flag and after asking him about it he told me that it was to help out a woman who he had met online. After digging deeper it turns out someone added him on Instagram (he is very slow with technology and only really started learning after mum passed).

I tried to explain to him how scams work and never to send gift cards but he didn't wanna hear it insisting she was real. My sister got involved and her approach was a lot more direct and harsher than mine. 

After a while my sister managed to get a picture of her and reverse googled it to find it was someone from porn. Rather than believing he was scammed he believes she is that person and stopped talking to her because she didn't tell him she did porn.

He is on his fifth or sixth person/ scammer now, all with similar results. He sends them money, sister finds out they're fake images, he doesn't wanna believe it. Comes up with some story and blocks them before moving to the next one. 

I'm desperately trying to get him to stop adding random people and to try and find someone through a dating app or in person (hard with covid) but he just seems to brush me off every time. 

He also seems to want to find younger women. I'm not sure if this is because he is scared of potentially losing another companion and believes that he will outlive someone younger or if there is another reason for it but either way he won't open up enough to give me a reason. 

Does anyone have any sort of experience either from being the widow or knowing a widow going through something similar and have any advice on how to help him find someone and what to do if he doesn't want to find someone his age?

81,qa0b0p,1634482562,Being the oldest single family member at a wedding,"My 24-year-old cousin was married yesterday, which meant all eyes were on me, now the oldest single person in the family at 40. I originally RSVPed with a plus one, hoping I would find a friend or date to bring. My cousin emailed me to ask if it was accurate (at one point I was offering my plus one or my other cousin's stepdaughter) and if I had the name of my plus one. I was embarrassed and said to change my RSVP to one.

Flash forward to the wedding, and my aunts and some other family members could not stop talking about finding someone for me at the wedding. If any man was standing alone, one of my aunts would tell me to dance with him or talk to him - lots of these guys were there with dates. Even when the servers and busboys came to the table, my aunt would say something to them which was humiliating for me. Some of the servers were 19, 20. 

The dreaded bouquet toss, too...ugh. I was dragged onto the floor, despite saying I would not participate. 

Probably the worst moment was my dad saying he would be old and in a wheelchair by the time I get married. A joke, but one that stung.

My family has good intentions. It still felt like shit and I felt like a loser.

84,qa4nqx,1634495625,Dumped for wanting more,"My first post here.  I (41y) met an incredible woman (48y) who appeared to be the lady of my dreams.  No kids but ready to start a family.  Successful, beautiful, and musical.  

We spent the better part of this year learning about each other online, then finally met for an unforgettable week in Italy in September.  She even extended her visit by 2 days to spend more time with me.  After waiting so long, things had become official - we were an item.

So I thought. 

Not more than a week afterwards, when I ask to see her again, she accuses me of cheating and breaks up with me.  This hurts me deeply because I was entirely faithful and never deceived her.  

She claimed my behavior was suspicious during our trip, citing the fact I used her much nicer and newer iPhone to take photos of us.  I chose to not dare use my phone to take her photo because she is so private, has a “no photos” policy.     

I am still shocked.  I did everything right. We’ve had countless hours of talks and Zoom calls.  It was so easy to talk with her and be honest.  I thought we had built (at minimum) a friendship based on complete trust.

But in the end, I think she lied about trusting me.  So I sit here very sad and with so many unanswered questions but mainly this - why would a person spend so many months, send thoughtful gifts and play music for me on my birthday, just to dump me at the earliest opportunity after we met?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qa4nqx/dumped_for_wanting_more/
85,qa7mhg,1634504459,Trying to make sense of what he (43y) said.,"This is going to be long so please bear with me.

I’ve (29F) been seeing a man (43y) for 3 months. He had literally just come out of a relationship when we met, so the timing wasn’t great (we met in real life, not online, so he wasn’t actively seeking a new relationship).

We really enjoy each other’s company, we have fun, we can talk openly and honestly to one another. It feels easy. The sexual chemistry is very much there too, which is important for both of us. 

It’s worth saying at this point that I was with my ex for 8 years and we met when I was 19. And although I’ve been dating since I split up with my ex, I have not met anyone I genuinely liked until I met this man. So, this is essentially the first time I’ve met someone I am interested in pursuing a relationship with, since I was a teenager. I don’t know how to manage my expectations, or what my expectations even are. 

When we were together this weekend he wanted to speak about us. He said he really likes me, we are “very compatible”, he loves being with me and wants to continue seeing me, but said his friends had expressed concerns about him meeting someone so soon after coming out of that relationship. They are extremely valid concerns and I had already expressed those concerns myself when we first met, so I am in no way surprised or offended by these comments. He was struggling to find the words to say what he wanted to say so I helped him “you want to carry on seeing me but with no commitment?” and he agreed, he “doesn’t want to answer to anyone.” He referred to a question I’d asked him recently, which was whether he had slept with any other women / would do so since he has met me. He said that he hasn’t and he doesn’t plan to, but he doesn’t want to feel as if he couldn’t, or have to answer to anyone if he was to do so. He also said it would hurt him if I slept with another man or went on a date with another man. He said let’s just see what happens over the next couple of months. 

I’m left feeling, if I’m honest, pretty upset. Although we’re not in a committed relationship I haven’t seen any other men since I met him and I certainly wouldn’t sleep with anyone else. I couldn’t continue to see him if he had been with another woman. My feelings are that if what you feel for someone is genuine, you wouldn’t be looking elsewhere. When I said that to him he said it really isn’t like that for men (can some men chime in on this?!) 

The conversation has left a bad taste in my mouth and I feel conflicted. I can’t help but feel like he couldn’t genuinely like me if that’s what he thinks. Part of me wants to protect myself and call it quits before I get hurt. The other part of me wants to take it as it comes and just enjoy it, because I do really like him.

“J, I’m sorry if I seemed a bit funny yesterday afternoon. All new experiences for me, I really enjoyed being with you, knowing how to handle it is another thing altogether! But I had a great time &amp; hope u did too. 
Woke up with a sore throat today, got tested for covid. 
I’ll keep you posted as soon as I get my result back ok? X”

Yesterday I poured my frustration into words here and I didn’t say anything to him because I couldn’t find the right words. I’m very careful with my words and take my time to say/write things so I don’t inadvertently offend anyone. Btw Both him and I have ADD. 

I think this morning when I did respond to his morning text I might have been a bit colder than usual as I do feel unhappy. I guess I won’t break up with him after this msg, I need to focus on helping my mum recover in the next two months and maybe better “sexy time” can happen if he waits for me to return in December. I have no issues finding men, but I really need to like someone to get to even the coffee date level, that’s why it took me two months to meet him in person.

One thing I know, coming out of dead bedroom and a marriage with an unaffectionate ex, I won’t stay in a relationship with bad sex ever again. I love sex, I love spoiling my partner and I’m very open to experimenting as long as it’s consensual and legal. 

His text shows he knows there was something wrong, he came to the conclusion himself. 

And as for the responses, there was a lot of bitterness here. Obviously some people are very frustrated with dating (it’s not easy!) and behind the faceless profiles act like the Birds in the Hitchcock movie.

95,qaeqmv,1634529126,"Great chemistry over text, not in person","Just wondering if this has ever happened to anyone?  You get along great over text/OLD, have a lot in common, like each other's pics, then in person it's not the same.  Was there something you could put your finger on, or was it an overall feeling, or lack of feeling?

I had a date last weekend, we met on OLD.  All of the above, had a lot in common, had great conversations, etc.  He said he thought I was very attractive and loved my personality even more.  We talked every single day.  On the day of our meeting, he said he was nervous.  That evening, he picks me up and he was super quiet and things were kind of awkward.  I was very nervous too.  I can be shy, but with an outgoing person I feel fine, but with another quiet/shy person, then my shyness comes out more.  

When things were good and the conversation was good, I liked him, very nice, very polite.  But there were a lot of uncomfortable silences.  I also spent the majority of the date having no clue if he liked me or not.  Wasn't flirty at all and didn't touch me...not even like touching my arm when he talked like some people do.  It wasn't until literally in the last 5 minutes of the movie that he held my hand, and again on the way out to the car.  He did also ask during the movie if I wanted to do something the next day and I said yes.

We went back to my place and just watched tv/talked, but again, lots of uncomfortable silences.  He did eventually kiss me, but only when he thought I was sleeping because we both dozed off since it was getting late.

So after the first kiss, it led to more and we ended up having sex.  Please don't judge, I'm in my 40's, I never plan to have sex on the first date but if it happens it happens.  I've always thought the third date rule was dumb.  So anyway, afterward he finally goes home, it's really late.  I have a history lately of getting ghosted, so I asked him a few days prior to please just tell me if he wasn't feeling it.  

So the next day he texts me and says that he had fun the night before, but he wanted to be honest because I asked for that, and said he wasn't sure I was the one for him.   I wasn't too broken up by this, as I was having doubts that morning too.  I am over my ex enough to date, but being that this was my first date since him, I was feeling kind of blah and comparing everything to him.  How my first date with him was so easy, and how comfortable I was with him, etc.  So I kind of felt like things were pretty mutual about our feelings.

Then he asked if I would consider having sex again.  Before I met him, I was open to a FWB, and the sex was good so I figured why not.  So we hung out that day, and will again next weekend.  But in the days since, I've found myself confused again.  I am not sure what it is, maybe the fact that he doesn't want to date me has now made me want him...wanting what I can't have?  Or maybe I am just curious where a second date could have gone if we were more relaxed and not so nervous.  And I'm really confused how he could seem to like me so much all week over text, and then not be sure about me in person.  I mean, I guess it could just be a feeling....but I personally always have a pretty good idea if things will translate to in-person.  I'd say I've never been surprised, if I didn't really vibe online/over text, then it's the same in person.  And if we do hit it off online, it's always been a hit in person.  

I'm good with either, if he's just a FWB, or if down the road we end up dating.  But I guess I am a little sad to think of how much we seemed to click over text that whole week and in person, it wasn't the same at all.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qaeqmv/great_chemistry_over_text_not_in_person/
