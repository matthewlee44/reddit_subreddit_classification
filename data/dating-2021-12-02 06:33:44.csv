0,r76ksf,1638448731,Men do not even want me for something casual?,"Silent reader till now, first post, english not my native language, on mobile. I (37f) don't really have a problem getting dates – be it from OLD or meet cutes in everyday life – so I assume I am not hideous. But after a strong beginning the men seem to loose interest in me pretty abruptly. Sometimes after sex, but in other instances before we even reach that point. The intense connection over text or drunken banter just seems to fade. If I ask them, what made them withdraw, I never get a answer, rather a denial of even avoiding me.
I tried to not let it mess with my head, but after it happened again and again over the last two years, I can't write it off as all-made-up-by-my-self-sabotaging-brain. But how can I work on myself if I don't even know, what seems to be the problem? Anybody made similar experiences?

I'm 34 (m). Feeling so lonely lately because all of my attempts to get into a relationship fail.

I've been stuttering for 27 years now, it wouldnt go away whatever I do, but at the same time it never held me back talking to people or find success in life. I have a great job, friends, I own a house, I'm a positive person overall, but whenever I try to get into a relationship, I get rejected.

The usual excuses that I hear that they're not ready for a relationship or they just wanna be friends.

A friend of mine not so long go said she wanted to be with me, that she likes me, but a few months later, when everything were going smoothly, with no problems etc, she told me she's not ready for any relationship at the moment, she wants to be just friends again. Later I learned that started dating someone else. My feelings were hurt once again and this time the most.

My parents who are irritated by my speech problems always told me that it is the reason that noone wants me. Every time I didn't get the girl, my dad would tell me that. I never believed that stuttering is a problem for me but when you're told the same thing over and over again it makes you think what if it's true...

Currently I feel lonely and broken. I dunno what to do. The girls are liked recently again wanted to be just friends.

7,r782ht,1638453607,Needing a woman's opinion.,"I consider myself a fairly confident woman but I'm in a situation that I didn't expect, and it's rattling me. 

My boyfriend and I are both in our 30s, both previously married with children. We've been together for a little over a month, and within that month, we've spent every single day/night together except for when he went on a weekend getaway with his boys. 

My boyfriend has naked or otherwise inappropriate pictures of an ex on his phone from there years ago. 

The first week we were dating, he got a text message from a friend and he stated it was just a female friend from years ago telling him her husband died. We were out to eat and it was obvious he was texting a female, to which he told me the story and I offered up my condolences. He acts kind of strangely, he talked about her all throughout our date that specific night but I let it go. 

Several weeks goes by and he randomly admits to me on his own that the texter was an ex girlfriend and she's the naked girl on his phone - but swears it's platonic and her husband really did pass. 

Then randomly admits that she asked him if he was seeing someone to which he replied that he was dating someone (but that was before we become an official couple) a little later on after we decided to be together, according to him she started bringing up their past and how much she loves him and asked if she could come see him for Christmas. He told me he told her that while he's available to talk about her husband and kids and offer resources like links and try to get people to help her, it was inappropriate conversation to have since he's with someone. He also told me he told her he was happy and  blocked her. I asked if I could see the message by chance and he said ""I deleted it.""

So this is a few weeks after and I ask if he would delete the naked pictures of her on her phone since she's trying to cause trouble. I recognize and admit we've only been together almost month but that this is concerning for me and it hurts my feelings. He refuses. 

Fast foward to a month and we both have said we love each other. I'm good to his kids. We cook for each other. We've gotten each other Christmas gifts. 

But I did something stupid - I went through his phone 🙄 and I didn't see any messages from her but not only was she not blocked, her and her mom's phone numbers were listed as his emergency contacts. 

He caught me red handed and all I could do was apologize for invading his privacy but that I was looking for just some small proof that she was blocked and I found that she wasn't. He told me he had blocked her for ""three"" days but decided to unblock her. I asked him why would he block her for only 3 days, etc. 

I'm not normally a jealous person and I don't think he is actively cheating on me, but the fact that he's still wanting to talk to an ex he had three years ago knowing she came to him romantically and knowing he won't delete pornographic pictures of her off her phone really hurts me and it makes me feel like she's saving space for her. He is deadset against removing her. I'm hurt and confused.

9,r789ec,1638454133,I don’t know if I love my boyfriend yet,"My boyfriend and I just started dating, and he’s literally perfect. If I were to describe my dream man before meeting him, he would fit the description. He is so kind, caring, and openly shows how much he loves me. Quite frankly, I don’t understand how he fell for me so fast. We’ve been dating for a few weeks but we’ve only known each other for a little over 2 months. Maybe I’m just someone who doesn’t fall in love that fast.

Yesterday he told me that he loved me for the first time and I said I loved him too. I knew if I didn’t it would break his heart, and I don’t think it’s completely a lie. I don’t love him *yet*, but I feel like I will. There’s no reason not to; I see a future with him, he’s incredible, and more than I could have ever asked for. 

I definitely have feelings for him, I get butterflies sometimes when I’m around him. But it pales in comparison to my “first love,” aka my ex who openly told me that he didn’t love me. I’m only saying this for context; I don’t care about my ex in the slightest and I think the reason I’m comparing the feelings is because the first one was so incredibly strong. I do think a huge part of it was me being delusional. My boyfriend is so romantic and kind and my ex was absolutely none of that. One of these men is clearly significantly better than the other.

The thing is, I don’t know how to feel. Is it normal not to be “in love” 2 months into knowing someone that you really like? Am I just overthinking what the feeling is like? I remember feeling so obsessive about men in the past and this one just feels so calm (because he actually loves me) that I’m so confused.

12,r78gqc,1638454746,The biggest red flags to be aware of when you first meet someone. Don’t let looks cloud your judgment of their character,"If you’re looking for someone as a long term partner, it’s important to be mindful of the qualities you are looking for. As men, we are visually driven. If a woman is extremely attractive, we will sometimes assume automatically that she is someone we should want to be with, especially if it appears other men desire her. This is an ego-based behavior that will have consequences later. If a woman exhibits one or more of these qualities, it’s important to step back, be analytical, and determine if she is a quality person:

She is negative. This is the biggest indicator of someone will make you miserable. If she is constantly complaining, talks shit about people she knows, or has a generally dark outlook on life, she will ultimately drag you down. You only want to surround yourself with people who are uplifting, and will

She places a heavy emphasis on social media. If a woman is constantly checking her social media, or is more concerned about projecting her image, rather than cultivating her development as a person, it is a giant red flag. What is concerning for many of these type of women is that they conflate personal development and developing their image. There are extremely attractive women who are heavily involved in Instagram, and are attempting to build a brand around their image, so this can be an alluring trap. An obsession with social media indicates an underlying insecurity and need of validation and attention from others.

She doesn’t communicate in a healthy manner. Instead of being upfront with her emotions in a respectful manner, she holds things in, or voices displeasure through fighting or displays of drama. Despite what movies and other forms of media portray, frantic fighting and making up is not a sign of passion, it is a breakdown in communication, and will wear thin after a while.

She treats others around her disrespectfully. She is rude to servers, retail workers, her family, or anyone else in her personal orbit. Those who mistreat others directly are the most insecure type of people out there. They recognize that they could easily be in the same position, and it makes them uncomfortable. They show false displays of superiority to compensate, but it is a false front.

They are materialistic. They expect dates to be held at expensive restaurants, they place emphasis on what possessions someone might have instead of their personality, or their values. Status is an attraction point for women, but there are different forms of status, not solely materialistic. It’s fine for someone to enjoy finer things in life, but be observant of how much importance they place on material items.

13,r78h2r,1638454775,I Want to Ask a Girl Out on a Second Date But am Unsure as to How to Go About it.,"Dear daters on Reddit,  


Hello. I come to you asking for some advice. I spoke with my mother, and got her opinion on the subject, but she said I should seek out input from people closer to my own age.  


Last Monday, I went into the office of a particular woman. We'd met briefly 3 years prior, as I used to work alongside her brother, but neither one of us knew the other much at all. I asked her if she would like to go out with me, and she agreed to meet me for coffee on Wednesday, two days later. We met and had coffee for about half an hour. She was delightful. She arrived on time, had great communication skills, was an absolute pleasure to converse with, asked a lot of good questions, all up until she realized she would be late getting back to work, at which point she quickly excused herself and departed.  


Before she left, I made it a point to get her phone number, as I hadn't earlier. I texted her and said thank you for meeting with me, and that I had a really nice time. She did not respond.  


I'd like to go out with her again. There is a musical production in a town south of here next week. I thought it would be fun to have dinner, and attend the musical, and wished to invite her to accompany me. Where I'm stuck is trying to figure out a tactful way in which to do it. What makes it tricky is that while I like her very much, I have really no idea whether she is interested in seeing me again or not, as she really made no indication one way or the other. Add to that there seems to be a lot of underlying rules and guidelines nowadays as to the right time or the right way to ask someone out, and I'm really just not familiar with any of them, and there also seems to be so many conflicting opinions.  


Initially, I thought I'd wait until tomorrow and just text her and say something to the effect of ""Hey, there is x musical at x theater in x town next Thursday, thought it would be fun to get dinner and go see it. Would you like to go with me?"" My concern with this method is that on one hand, I've heard it is better to ask for those things in person or at least over a phone call, as it is more personal and direct. On the other, I've also heard that being too direct, especially early on, can be too pushy, which I'd like to avoid. Another concern is that she simply won't respond, and then I won't know if she simply never received the message, or just isn't interested. I suppose that when I am in her office again next week, which I will be because I have business there, I could say something coy, to the effect of ""I've been having trouble with my phone lately. It doesn't seem I am able to receive texts, because.... I never got one from you. (knowing wink)"" Again though, I'd be concerned that would cross some sort of boundary.  


So yes, I'm a bit lost. If any of you have any advice or experience or wisdom that you would care to share with me, I'd be most grateful. Regardless, thank you for taking time to read my post, and I wish you success in all your relationship endeavors as well.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r78h2r/i_want_to_ask_a_girl_out_on_a_second_date_but_am/
14,r78kbe,1638455049,How to Continue After Taking a Break?,"My ex and I only dated for a couple months, but a month ago she hit me with the “I think we should take a break”. It was stemming from her own personal problems she was dealing with, as well as the fact that I was not communicating very well. So I agreed that we’d give each other space for the time being, and had not contacted her and started to focus on things I could improve on (i.e., communication, effort), and really started to see some progress in those aspects.

After about a month and a half, she contacts me and we meet up to talk. We begin to discuss the things that had been bothering us and mentioning how we’re working on what we need to improve on. During the conversation, we both realize we still like each other and would give it another shot.

Anyway, we got onto food topic and I asked if she’d like to come get some sushi, something like ‘it would be good to see you, we can get some sushi at x, if you?’

She took a little bit of time to pause (as convo was free flowing until then). Do you think she was weighing up the invite?

I pinged her on LinkedIn and asked for her number and then texted her to confirm, it was originally going to be midday but she asked if I want to see her later in the day instead so I’ve pushed it to 5pm.

None of the women expressed any desire to be in a relationship beforehand. Neither did we discuss about exclusivity. I have been on max 3 dates with all of them. Now I am sensing that their behaviour has changed and there are more expectations then before. I am a lawyer so I am usually very busy with work and after that my interests and hobbies. 

One of the women I am seeing got a bit miffed that I don't text her a lot and she feels neglected. But my frequency hasn't changed at all. There are several other complaints regarding my behavior by the others which to be honest is exactly the same as before we slept togather. 

I was looking to know how should I approach this subject so that they don't feel I am some how ignoring them or being a jackass after they have slept with me. I am currently in no position to get into a relationship as even when I am with them I somehow compare them to my girlfriend. Even after we have sex, I miss my gf sleeping next to me. These are great ladies but I the ghost of my girlfriend doesn't leave my side even though I haven't answered her phone calls and generally avoided her since the last month just so that we both can get over each other. Should I be honest and spill my guts to my dates? That doesn't sound appropriate to me. 

What should be my approach? 

TL;DR- I broke up recently. Been on dates with some women. I am not ready for anything serious. They have complained about my unavailability. How do I approach regarding this them without hurting them or looking like an ass?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r79m5i/how_do_you_approach_unavailability_to_women_a_bit/

32,r79suz,1638458613,I will never find Love,"So...this happened 2 years ago. I went to my older sister's(not from the same mother...single child) wedding in another state. I was friends with this girl for 3 years at that time and we knew each other very well, and no matter what we always told each other everything. Not knowing, i developed feelings for her but couldn't tell her coz I feared she would end our friendship. After high school we got seperated and went to different colleges. Her college was in the same state, so we decided to meet up. She couldn't make it to the wedding but arrives the next day. We went out had a couple of drinks. I was scheduled to leave the same evening so I dropped her off to her dorm. When I was leaving she hugged me and couldn't let go. I told her we would meet again...hopefully. I left nd the same evening she texted me she loved me nd wanted us to be in a relationship. This was the best day of my life. I wanted nothing more. I told her that I was in love with her since high school but feared risking our friendship so I never told her how I felt. She felt guilty of not telling this to me when she was hugging me.


We talked everyday after that for a week Until...

One day I said something romantic to her, nd I expected to say something back to me. Insted she just told me that she was in a relationship nd she didn't love me. I asked her that what abt you asking me to be in a relationship. She said that she was just joking nd she never meant anything she said.


After that I was a mess. It took me a long time to get over her and I never asked her why she did what she did. I'm still not sure if I am over her. Maybe I was too gullible or idiot to let her play me. Why didn't I tell her that I couldn't be in a Long Distance relationship?
I still hate myself for falling for her. I thought I knew her but I didn't. 


After that I kept telling myself that I will never find Love.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r79suz/i_will_never_find_love/

34,r7a2a3,1638459352,Highschool crush wants to meet for the second time while in a 2 year relationship,This girl and I throughout all of highschool always had this weird flirty relationship but never fully dated. Mostly I was always really shy and basically friendzoned my self. We went on 1 date in highschool and it just never really panned out. We would always see each other through college on the holidays and as I blossomed more and more the flirting continued. Now I am 26 and working in a very high paying sales position doing well for myself and obviously extremely outgoing and confident (why I have the sales job in the first place). Randomly she reached out for me to come see her. I was dating someone at the time and brushed it off and I heard she had been dating someone seriously for the last 2 years. 6 months later I reached out to her  as I was curious and broke up with my girlfriend 2 months prior. I thought maybe she was out of the relationship since she reached out to me so out of the blue. She ended up saying we should meet for drinks. I did and there was instant chemistry and I think she was a bit shocked to see where I ended up at this point in life. I recently got into really good shape and again emphasis on confidence. She basically kept bringing up her still boyfriend who she lives with and all her plans for the future. In my head I basically told my self this ship has sailed and I mentally gave up on the idea. Then as we were heading out of the bar she told me we should get drinks again.... WTF you have a boyfriend for 2 years and couldn't stop talking about your future plans. I really don't think her boyfriend would be ok with seeing me and I feel either shes not telling him everything about me or she didn't tell him at all. I also feel suspect as I still have feelings for her and I don't want to get burned. You think she's just likes my attention or is it possible she really is interested and isn't totally happy with her boyfriend.

36,r7a696,1638459651,Men’s advice. The biggest red flags to look at for when you’re getting to know someone. Don’t let looks cloud your judgment of character,"If you’re looking for someone as a long term partner, it’s important to be mindful of the qualities you are looking for. As men, we are visually driven. If a woman is extremely attractive, we will sometimes assume automatically that she is someone we should want to be with, especially if it appears other men desire her. This is an ego-based behavior that will have consequences later. If a woman exhibits one or more of these qualities, it’s important to step back, be analytical, and determine if she is a quality person:

She is negative. This is the biggest indicator of someone will make you miserable. If she is constantly complaining, talks shit about people she knows, or has a generally dark outlook on life, she will ultimately drag you down. You only want to surround yourself with people who are uplifting, and will

She places a heavy emphasis on social media. If a woman is constantly checking her social media, or is more concerned about projecting her image, rather than cultivating her development as a person, it is a giant red flag. What is concerning for many of these type of women is that they conflate personal development and developing their image. There are extremely attractive women who are heavily involved in Instagram, and are attempting to build a brand around their image, so this can be an alluring trap. An obsession with social media indicates an underlying insecurity and need of validation and attention from others.

She doesn’t communicate in a healthy manner. Instead of being upfront with her emotions in a respectful manner, she holds things in, or voices displeasure through fighting or displays of drama. Despite what movies and other forms of media portray, frantic fighting and making up is not a sign of passion, it is a breakdown in communication, and will wear thin after a while.

She treats others around her disrespectfully. She is rude to servers, retail workers, her family, or anyone else in her personal orbit. Those who mistreat others directly are the most insecure type of people out there. They recognize that they could easily be in the same position, and it makes them uncomfortable. They show false displays of superiority to compensate, but it is a false front.

They are materialistic. They expect dates to be held at expensive restaurants, they place emphasis on what possessions someone might have instead of their personality, or their values. Status is an attraction point for women, but there are different forms of status, not solely materialistic. It’s fine for someone to enjoy finer things in life, but be observant of how much importance they place on material items. You want to be able to have as much fun with them going Target as you do in a five star restaurant.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7a696/mens_advice_the_biggest_red_flags_to_look_at_for/

38,r7a8al,1638459812,What am I doing wrong?,"Last night my boyfriend of a month told me that he felt left out. I asked him why and he told me how he thinks love is like an option for me. He feels like I was designed to be 
focus on school and career more. I don’t know if this is because earlier that day, I told him how next semester it would be tough for me since I am taking a lot of hard classes and have to work long hour. But I reassured him that, I will make time for us no matter how busy I am. He asked me if I am sure that I want to become a nurse, I said yes because that’s what I have always wanted to do. Then he said he’s happy for me and stuff , but I am going to be so busy. 
Then later that night he told me he’s the type of person who would sacrifice everything, and would change everything for the person he loves. He gave an example, if someone he loves move away for college, he would literally find a school nearby just to be with them.  I am going to be moving away for college next year, and it’s like 2 hours away from him. He kept thinking about it and bringing it up, and I reassured him that we’ll find a way to make this work. But one time, I did tell him that, if for some reason, the long distance relationship won’t work out and you want to leave, I will let you go and I won’t blame you for it. I was giving options, because he told me how he wasn’t happy in his previous relationship and was trapped in a toxic relationship for years. I didn’t want to do that to him or trap him in a relationship where he’s not happy. Then he blamed me for saying that and said it sounds like I didn’t love enough to make him stay. I know he has a point here and I admit maybe I was wrong for giving him options here. 
Then he started saying how his ex never made him feel this way. He said how the ex showed 
and made him feel like he was needed, even to the end. I don’t get it, because I thought he wasn’t happy with her, and he told me many times how badly he was being treated, and how the ex didn’t deserve his love and how toxic the relationship was. But now he’s comparing me to her, and making me feel like everything I have done for him was never enough.

We tried a FWB but after a while I cut that off bc I felt like I put all the effort into the “friendship” part and he was just mostly in it for the sex or not seeming interested in me at all.

However a few months ago (after about 3 months of not having sex) we had sex again and ever since that moment he now is suddenly being the one texting me first and asking me if I want to hang out instead of the other way around like before (with or without sex). He also seems to get turned on by solely sniffing my neck while I’m basically just sitting next to him doing nothing? Like, I don’t do anything bc I’m scared I might give off the wrong ideas but he still seems to get turned on just by my “presence”? Overall he suddenly just seems more interested in me.

I am probably overthinking this, but for some reason it’s giving me so much mixed messages. Is this just straight up horny guy/FWB behaviour or is he now like secretly into me or something?

I’m a 23F living abroad from my home and I’ve never really dated, and it’s mostly bc I haven’t been asked out or really seem to be around eligible men. Here’s the thing, I come from a conservative family and I’m still a virgin. So I basically know nothing .

I’ve been on tinder and some guys are pretty direct with what they want, others say they want nothing serious. But I myself don’t know what I am looking for, so I don’t know what to say when they make that determination bc ideally if things work out I’d like to have a boyfriend.

Mostly my worry is when I’m told they want nothing serious it means they want purely sex and I truly just want to date and meet people (sure that can be part of it but not exclusively).

46,r7b7be,1638462551,Asking someone out a second time?,"So back in the spring I moved to a new city, started hanging out with a   new group of people, and I met this girl who showed signs of interest.   Had other people in the group tell me they thought we would be cute   together. I was afraid of asking her out directly so we eventually just   went on a hike/walk with just the two of us, but I never actually  called  it a date. It was really awkward and there was no physical touch  or  anything. At the end of the hike I asked what we were doing (I  phrased  it nicely) in terms of dating and she said she thinks we would  be better  off as friends. All good and there were no hard feelings  honestly.

Fast  forward a month  later or something and I haven't seen her since but she  randomly texts  me asking me about car insurance stuff we talked about  before. Was a  little confused she reached out, but didn't blow her off  and we went  back and forth for a little bit over text. A few weeks later  I was  going to a free concert with my one friend and we had an extra  ticket,  so on a whim I invited her just as friends. She came out and was   definitely playful that night (teasing, hand on the shoulder, I always   found her sitting or standing next to me - which shes done this during   later hangouts too). I had another friend privately tell me later they   thought me and her were dating, which confused me again. We hung out   some more in the fall, another comment came from someone else (this time   in front of her and the group), saying we bicker like a couple, and  she  got mad about that. Idk if she was embarrassed or what but I never   commented on it.

So then she went   back to the other side of the country for a month to visit her family  as  she works remotely. I thought no biggie I'll just talk to her when  she  gets back. Nope she hits me up a few days after she left, looking  for  small talk. We went back and forth. Then again a few days later she  saw I  went out to a certain bar. She asked how it was, etc.

It's   pretty obvious what she's doing. And I don't want to be a sucker about   it. I think she's pretty, I like her personality and how we get along,   but I don't want to be strung along like this. I might be seeing her   this weekend at a bar as she's now back in town, and if so I was going   to be straight up with her - basically that I would like to take her out   on a real date and see where it goes. But I don't really want her to   keep hitting me up like this. I don't care if she comes and hangs out   with the group, however I don't want to be her texting buddy.

How   would you approach this? We've known each other for about 6 months  now.  Never kissed or did anything really romantic. I don't know.

The next day when we woke up I felt like he was indifferent towards me, he didn’t really care to cuddle and didn’t care to have long conversations, we had breakfast and it was just silent. Then he took me home and I told him that I had fun and thanks for everything, he just looked at me and said take care. I was like fuck it and kissed him, it was just a peck.

I told her during the date that we didn’t need to drink if she wasn’t comfortable but she said it was a long day so she didn’t mind. 

Date went well and there was some light touchy flirting from her and myself. I asked to walk her to her car which she agreed to. 

I touched her hand and we both pulled closer to each other and we kissed. I was only expecting a short kiss but she was pretty open so we made out for like a minute. I bit her lip and she stopped for a moment. Concerned I asked her if I did something wrong and she said “no, it was just really good” We continued to kiss and she pulled me closer.

At this point I started to move my hands around, with no resistance and continued kissing I did lightly pull her hair and squeezed her butt. We continued kissing for another minute then we stopped. I invited her back to my place and she politely declined saying she hasn’t been intimate in months. 

I said that was fine and no big deal, but I did enjoy kissing which we continued. Finally we parted ways and we both texted to make sure we got home safely. We also both wanted another date. We texted on and off, and then today she said she felt we were on different pages regarding physicality and that she was uncomfortable with being asked to go back to my place and me pulling her hair and squeezing her butt.

She said she doesn’t think it was my intention to make her uncomfortable but I feel terrible. I apologized for crossing the line and I felt like I really misread her body language.

I now recently started thinking about her in the ""lover"" way and its led to me getting closer and she told me she might be feeling the same way. I believed it first due to how she cared and how much time and attention she put on me.   
Then one day we were having a deep convo and she told me she kind of likes a close mutual friend meanwhile kinda feeling same for me. She told me she needed a week to figure herself out. Theyre really close and she borrows his hoodies etc and that annoys me. I always thought they had a close friendship but damn I got clowned lol. ANYWAY we had a fight over that and i told her it pisses me off. That ended there, two days after on the phone she asked me ""How bad is it"" She said she was talking about ""Us"". I had intended to move on but that question just fooled me back.   
And the past two days (including the day she asked that question) she has been dry on msgs but phone calls shes normal ig. I cant stop thinking about her. Its killing me. I like her for who she is/was/or my mind made her to be. Its not the looks, its the personality and ""cute"" habits.  


I feel like she chose him over me, they're lot closer, lot more ""everything"" but she still is giving the ide of me and her attention. Its annoying, because I am pretty much about to snap.  
It's not like i aint good lookin or got no game. I am really good looking(like fr), amazing physique, good personality and confident. Those are actual impressions i have graved into myself. I know whenever i get over this girl, Its over.  


Honestly the point of writing this is for me to think about her more lol but why not just make it ""productive"".

65,r7d4t6,1638467867,Confusing guy,"This boy is confusing. I was talking to this boy for almost 2 months and everything was fine. We finally met up and I thought it went well considering he text me later that night and called me the next day. A couple of days after our date, he started acting weird. He would still text me and send stuff on social media but didn’t call me again. I thought maybe these days are hitting harder than usual Bc of all he’s been through this year. He once told me he’s depressed and confided in me about what’s going on in his life and how he’s feeling (some deep stuff). So I didn’t wanna make him being a little distant about me. It seemed like he was gonna ghost me but still talked to me but I sensed a change. I decided to just rip the band aid off and ask him what we’re doing. First he said idk and then said he was trying to be friends until he figures out his life. I thought that meant he just sees me as a friend. I just agreed with what he said bc I didn’t wanna fight for someone that said that. We still sent stuff on social media here and there and he texted me 2 days after that convo. But he would next text back after talking for a bit. Now it’s a month later, He stopped sending stuff on social media and so did I. I checked up on him to see how he was doing. We had a tiny convo of how are
You and after him not responding back till the next day, I just didn’t text him bc I was annoyed. The next week he post this meme basically saying “to my girl who’s not my girl hmu when you’re ready”. First I was like wtf he’s talking to another girl and then I was like maybe it’s about me but then 3 hours later he post his food and there’s a girl in the back. I was so hurt by this and confused bc why would you post that meme. He made it seem like “the girl” and him weren’t talking. I wanted to say something so bad but I didn’t. He since hasn’t posted anything about a girl. I know he has a lot of girl friends from when he was younger but it was staged so weird, where it looked like he was on a date and then it didn’t. On thanksgiving he messed me saying happy thanksgiving and the next day I posted skydiving and he swiped up on it saying look at you (this is something we talked about before). I’m just confused on what’s happening bc most guys when they say they wanna be friends, don’t wanna be friends. I was getting over all of this before he “reentered” my life. He watches all my stories and hasn’t posted anything relating to a girl so I’m just like what are you doing. Others say he misses me and others say he was just being nice and others say he’s just keeping me there, which doesn’t make sense bc we didn’t hook up and he doesn’t text me or anything so he’s gaining nothing. I think he does miss me and he was just being nice but bc he’s not trying to fully enter my life again maybe it’s the just being nice and me hoping he was coming back",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7d4t6/confusing_guy/

Well the things were simple - she initiated most of our texting, she would ask me to go out just the two of us and go somewhere, she made comments like "" ask your mom if she would like me as a girlfriend to her son"", she always mentions that I'm the only person with who she can say and do whatever she wants without caring and send me pics of herself in her daily routine. When we were out/with friends she always walked next to me, laughed at my bad jokes and she would always hug me for a goodbye.

Well, we argued that these things **ATLEAST for me** were pure hints that she still have feelings for me and want to spend time with me but she refused since when I've asked her she got back into her toxic relationship with her still boyfriend.

Well, lets put that outside of my main question - was she really just being good friend or she just didn't want to confirm that she still had feelings since she got back to her ex? She even said to a close female friend that she have thoughts of talking with me about a second try but that never happend since her boyfriend wanted to talk with her and they got back together.

72,r7dw36,1638469890,"Is this situationship worth pursuing, and how do I bring up my need to have sex?","I am in the market to date.  In fact, I've been looking to date and find a serious boyfriend/girlfriend relationship leading to marriage for quite a long time now.  I am only on a select few online dating sites these days, thanks to an asshole doxing me and defaming me.  (The last thing I want is that same asshole, who I met on a very popular dating site, to find me on those sites and have more photos and ammunition to use against me.  Also, I am trying to convince him that I'm happily with someone, to spite him for him saying and thinking all those bad things such as ""you'll never get a boyfriend, no one ever wants you"", so him finding me on a dating site would totally nix any chance of him thinking I've already gotten a boyfriend)  Unfortunately, the foot traffic on the lesser known sites is very low.  I've only managed to actually meet one person in over a month now.  He seems ok, is nice.  I am still unsure how I feel about him, but he's nice and I guess there's potential.  However, I have some apprehensions and reservations.  Could you help me on this?  Am I paranoid or should I ""trust my gut""?


I met Jim about a month ago after talking on a dating site.  I met him after a really, really bad weekend, which involved me being stood up a total of 3 times by 3 different guys from dating sites (none of these guys I knew IRL, only OLD).  This was unfair because none of those 3 guys ever even gave me a chance.  I became convinced (and still am) that they found the trash talk, obscene pictures, and insults that had been posted about me incessantly on multiple gossip websites by some asshole I had dated last year, a guy who had viciously turned on me, and seemed to be on a mission to ruin my life.  I have already been confronted by multiple different guys about stuff they found online about me, including my next door neighbor (who I had told in confidence about the stuff online, but never actually showed him or told him where he could find that stuff, yet the neighbor still apparently managed to easily find all that dirt on me anyway) and various guys I never met IRL but only talked to through OLD.  I worried that no guy wanted me, and that I was just some huge joke or seemed psycho because of the stuff that asshole wrote about me last winter.  But it seemed that this guy was insistent on meeting me, even insisted I give him a chance and that we hang out later that day (a Sunday).  At the time I wasn't sure if he was my type, honestly.  He is rather good looking but not the usual type I go for, but I gave it a shot.  He came to my apartment to hang out and he seems okay.  So far he's visited my apartment a total of three times.  My roommate Abbie and her boyfriend, who stays with us more often than not, met him briefly once.  She said he seems nice.


So far we haven't gone on any dates out to places yet, just hanging out and watching TV.  Is this okay?  Is this too forward?  In the beginning he said he likes to get out a lot, and he loves to go dancing at clubs (dancing is totally not my thing), but we've only hung out at my apartment.  I haven't slept with him yet, or anything close to that, which has me a bit anxious to be honest, because I question how serious it can be if I haven't even had sex yet, despite him putting ""good sex"" as one of his ""things I like"" on his OLD profile.  Also, he's obviously seen my OLD profile and on my profile, I put among other stuff that I want a guy who is attracted to me and actually wants to have sex with me.  But so far we've only kissed.  To be honest, I wasn't concerned at first about the lack of sex or foreplay, because I was always told to wait until at least 3 dates before having sex with a guy anyway, but now that I've seen him 3 times and have talked to him throughout the month, I am starting to wonder when sex will come up.  Is this a normal timeline for something that might lead to a relationship?  What is the average amount of time that a guy will wait before trying to have sex (or even anything beyond 1st base kissing) with a girl he's seeing/hanging out with?  Do you think it's possible he's ""friendzoning"" me or not into me?  I don't really think he's ""friendzoning"" me, because if he did, he wouldn't keep kissing me, right?  He seems to like to kiss, more than I do, to be honest.  Kissing has me feeling kind of self conscious, mostly because a few guys told me in the past that I was a bad kisser, and because the guy from last year who posted all that trash talk online about me said that one of the turnoffs about me is that my breath stinks.  So as a result, I'm constantly chewing gum around any dates/male friends and highly insecure.  I kiss this guy but I don't like to prolong it, but when I kiss for a full minute and then gently pull back, he'll put his hands on my shoulders, look me straight in the eye, and say to me ""I'm not done yet.""  Does this mean I'm being rude by pulling away?  What is an acceptable normal amount of time to kiss?  If I'm feeling self conscious, should I limit my kisses or will doing so show that I'm insecure?  Please help me with advice on this kissing issue.


I guess that's another reason I hope to progress this past just kissing soon, because not only do I have sex needs and am currently in a sex drought spanning almost half a year now, but I think maybe if we move past kissing, there'll be less emphasis on kissing, which is the part of hooking up I'm most self conscious of (I have other insecurities but action wise, kissing is a huge one for me, because of what 2 different guys told me before about me apparently not being a good kisser).


How do I explain to him that I am hoping to have sex?  How do I even bring this up?  I feel so stupid for being a girl but not having had sex in nearly half a year.  I mean, every guy goes around saying ""it's so much easier for a girl to get laid,"" ""a girl can get laid anytime she wants,"" etc but here I am, sexless.  Even the last several guys I had sex with were guys who worked in the sex industry.  Yes, I realize that's wrong, and the stigma behind it is why I stopped doing that, and also because I had recently reconciled with my family and didn't want it somehow getting back to them.  So here I am, trying to have sex the ""organic, nontransactional way"", and it's just not working for me.  Do you think this guy wants me sexually?  Do I stand a chance?  How should I approach this with him?  Is it weird for us to be seeing each other for a month but still not advancing past kissing?  He is not strongly religious or has any morals against premarital sex, from everything he's told me.


TL/DR: I've been seeing a guy from an OLD site for about a month, after striking out on dating sites.  So far I haven't had sex with him or anything close, and am starting to get anxiety about the fact that he hasn't tried anything sexually with me yet, and that the lack of sex means a prolongation of my existing sex drought.  Is it normal to go a month seeing someone but not trying to do anything beyond kissing?  Or does this mean I'm ""friendzoned""?  How do I approach the sex thing without looking like a sl-t?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7dw36/is_this_situationship_worth_pursuing_and_how_do_i/

It was fun and he was clearly interested in me, like we laughed etc., but honestly I wasn't actually attracted to him.

And at the risk of being immodest, I'm an outgoing person who is pretty good at first dates and generally getting conversation flowing with strangers, like a friend once said she knew a party we were at was a dud because even I couldn't salvage it. I've always gotten the impression that my personality is better than my actual physical attractiveness lol, so usually my dates go well unless the other person is just truly terrible and I stop trying.

So sometimes I have these dates where like it's fun and we laugh and it's probably a good date from their perspective and they're probably more interested in me than they were when they walked into the restaurant to meet that girl they met on Bumble, but I'm honestly not interested in them because there was no attraction there and/or they don't meet enough of my soft internal criteria (not explicit dealbreakers like wanting kids but those little cumulative stuff like amount of shared interests and complimentary skillsets). 

But from their perspective it went really well and flowed very smoothly, and objectively it was a good non-awkward first date. Sometimes the attraction isn't there on their side either but more often than not, they seem kind of blindsided when I don't pursue. Because surely if I didn't reciprocate I would have been signaling awkwardness/weirdness/discomfort/unhappiness/desire to end the date.

2. “I’m not interested”

78,r7ehlc,1638471520,Interracial dating brings out the absolute worst in people,"Even if you’re not dating anyone you’re still subjected to some of the strangest ideas based off of essentially nothing. I don’t know how anyone “looks like” they only date white people, or why who they dated in the past matters so much as if it’s supposed to suggest something about their character because there’s apparently always a deeper meaning to this. I don’t like to pretend that race doesn’t matter at least when it comes to my experiences, but the wokeness surrounding this topic does nothing for my self esteem as an individual. It’s only more depressing. I’m already painfully aware of the possibility of fetishization and that’s one of the more obvious aspects that I’m able to look out for. But it’s very depressing to be told that people who are dating you are only doing so because they have no better options and no one else wants them, or that they probably feel that you’re not worthy for serious relationships and that they’re in a “phase”. 

I don’t like to place my worth in other people but this is great, I really needed yet another reason to question why anyone would find any interest in me, even if that interest isn’t genuine. At least I can always be sure that won’t happen with other people who share the same race as me. /s",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7ehlc/interracial_dating_brings_out_the_absolute_worst/

84,r7eo46,1638471981,Dating or Just Friends,"So there was recently a situation where me and two of my friends (male and female) were going to do something. My male friend invited me than later told me that it wouldn't work out because he told me that she said she just wanted it to be the two of them. I told him congrats it sounds like a date to me but he insisted they are not dating. My question is assuming they aren't dating why would a girl insist to hangout with a guy 1 on 1 and not want that guy to not invite his other guys friends if they are not dating. It does not make sense to me. 

To summarize: I was invited to hangout my friend and this girl that would be coming along but it fell through when the girl told my friend that she just wanted it to be the two of them even though they are not dating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7eo46/dating_or_just_friends/

Why do we have to pretend like it’s an equal playing field and we are all going through the same things? Cause it isn’t. Women have an undeniable advantage in all things sex and dating and I don’t know why we can’t acknowledge that the female problems in dating boil down to them having too many choices and the male problems are that they can’t get even one girl to talk to them.

I then sent her a message yesterday afternoon asking her out again but she hasn’t seen it or replied, do you Reddit people think I should just leave it?

I mean my hunch is that her texting “it was really nice meeting you today!” was a polite way of saying “thanks but no thanks.” Am I right? Should I just leave it?

I am 18 year old student and I met a 19 yr old girl at uni almost 2 weeks ago and we’ve been talking ever since. We texted every day until 01:00 AM, yesterday I asked her if she wanted to study together with me and she proceeded. We had some very good/deep conversations and I have never felt such a good vibe like this. She is stuck in my head and I cannot get her out of my head. I really don’t know if she wants this in a friendly way or a relationship way.  I want to know if she really likes me, but I really don’t know how. How should I let her know I like her?

Could some of you just help me, I have been so desperate for the last 2 days. 

I am sorry for my bad english. Thank you.
