So, I’m a 19 year old female who’s been in a relationship with my boyfriend for pretty much 2 years. 

We have always been extremely happy together, he is a really kind, loving and loyal guy and we really have always had a great relationship and connection. 

We do so much together and in September I went off to University which obviously meant not seeing each other as often, although he would come and see and stay with me around once a month or as much as possible. 

We have both been really supporting of each other and our goals and have always made a lot of effort to equally commit to the relationship on both sides. 

However over the past month or so I have started to notice my feelings not being as strong and prevalent as they have always been. I have been back from uni on my Christmas break and have seen him a bit more of course but my feelings for him seem really up and down. One minute I’m head over heels as I always have been and then the next minute I don’t feel all that much and it’s scaring me an awful lot. The thought of not being with him or breaking off the relationship makes me want to break down in to floods of tears. I imagined marrying this guy and having a future together and still want that but these feelings are confusing me. 

I am of course aware that after a couple of years the “honeymoon” phase wears off and the initial excitement period is not as heightened. I also have a tendency to over think and worry out of proportionally about things and beginning to think it could be some form of OCD or intrusive thoughts. 

My question is, is this normal. Do my feelings of fluctuating love mean something or is this normal as you get further into a long term relationship? 

To make it clear: I really don’t want to loose this relationship as it means the world to me and so does he ! 

Has anyone else every experienced this ?

Always been so happy but this has happened really suddenly over the last month and it’s really upsetting me as I don’t want to loose him or the relationship.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1156751,public,self,Long term relationship feelings !,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sj9ws1/long_term_relationship_feelings/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

Eventually, it was just naturally great having long text conversations with him. We met up after maybe a week or week and a half of texting. An amazing 8-hour date with this man. Literally our time together was very enjoyable. We didn't want the date to end. From the beginning, he stated he thinks he's ready for something emotionally invested, but I stated I'm going with the flow, but I am not opposed if the opportunity of something came up. 
Though, as the next few weeks went by, we were both pretty busy with work, so our time together was limited. We only saw each other once a week and talked about seeing each other more never did. 

The last day we had a consistent conversation was mid-November. He messaged me first the entire time, and even before our conversation wasn't dry, I was on an out-of-town project for work that weekend. I really tried my best to respond when I could. The day after, he never responded to a text I had sent since I texted him first that day. A week when by and of course, I basically was ghosted, so I informed him I didn't appreciate that he ghosted me and expressed his feelings of it not working out. He finally responds and says how he likes me a lot but realizes he wasn't in a place to be ready to be in a relationship. 

Honestly, I shrugged it off and tried to move on from it since it is what it is. I see he still watches my Instagram stories even now. He never gave me butterflies, but I did feel a sense of comfort and trust with him, which I haven't felt with someone in a very long time. I find myself debating whether I should message him just to catch up, but I think it'll just go nowhere, so I don't.

Etc until i started to push a little bit regarding his boyfriend asking if it was that serious with him and she says that she would not stay with him as she leaves the country during the summer but kept insisting that it was ok.  I just wanted  her to say that he was not that important.

I admit that i was a bit needy while talking and that  she may have noticed. I wanted to go fast and go straight to the point and not having to go to another or third date before coming conclusion or ejection.

When we left each other, the energy was bad : Nothing to say, silence.. Etc

We'd moved to a new city together during the early days of the pandemic to boost our careers, but I was never fully happy in the relationship.

I felt it was unfair to her to stay in the relationship given she wanted to get engaged by 2022—and that I didn't want to give her false hope for something I could not commit to in the long-term.

The breakup was a bit rough at first, but we've maintained a nice friendship. She's a good person. Still, I had to do what I had to do, and as a result, my dating life is the best it's ever been. After I left my relationship, I made it my mission to stop settling for women who I didn't fully connect with or was fully attracted to. That was my issue before as the result of low self-esteem, something that I've now done away with entirely.

I've never felt so comfortable, confident, and thankful for where I'm at with my dating life. Since the breakup, I've ""finally"" found my type, I've fully discovered my boundaries, and I've grown into a much more rounded person overall. Where I'm at now is where I've wanted to be for years.

I (22f) and my boyfriend (23m) and his best friend is (22f). My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years. Lately ive been so fed up with his best friend that I’m on the brink of making him choose between me or her!!
She literally makes me feel so insecure by the way she looks and the connection she has with my boyfriend! Not all of us can have a fit body, or naturally flawless skin. I hate how she tries to be friends with me too. Like I know she’s only doing it because I’m her best friends girlfriend! I wished respect that. 

They have been best friends since early high school and have a brother and sister type relationship which makes me sick! I hate how he met her before me! They literally beat each other up all time and make fun of each other,but they are always there for each other if they need them to be. She is soo toxic!! I wish he could see it. I figured they’d stop hanging out when we got together so we could do boyfriend and girlfriend things!  I WAS SO MAD when I found out he got into Marvel and other fandoms because she helped him get into it when he asked. 

Like she ruined future date nights/ ideas that we could’ve had! If he didn’t like those things I could’ve dodge a bullet bc I hate superhero/ sci-fi shit! 
I hate how when we invite her to events like birthday parties,or casual nights out with our friends she shows up! Like, be more respectful and realized I don’t want you to go I was just saying that so ppl won’t get mad at me for not wanting her there. 

Like I don’t care how nice she is to me,or to others!We have fights over her because he doesn’t like how I personally attack her for being around and the only one in our group that’s not in a relationship!

Yes I realized the irony of asking an advice subreddit where else to go for advice - but hear me out! My 2 best friends are married and I love them to pieces, but they just don't understand the day-to-day nuance of dating (I jokingly call them the straight cis white men of dating: strong opinions constantly shared on lived realities they know little about).

Nearly every situation to them ultimately ends up in 'cut contact with him he made one mistake.' And while the sentiment I realize is coming from a good place, they've both been partnered for so many years at this point that they just don't really get what it's like trying to find another imperfect person who is managing their own history, baggage, working through traumas, doing the best they can. Which is not to say I ignore red flags, I really think I have good and healthy standards. But dating is just so much more nuanced than a hard-to-read text, or feeling anxious about where things are going in the first few weeks, etc.

And while I love this subreddit - I really do - it's laughable how many top comments are 'red flag dump him.' A lot of the time these comments are super warranted (maybe most of the time), but text really is a hard medium to convey sentiment, momentum, and days or weeks of interactions.

Which is all to ask - other single folks out there - where do you go for more nuanced discussions and advice around dating? Or how do you interact with your long-time partnered friends? Therapy is great, but I don't want to spend every single 50-minute session talking about this stuff. And to be clear, I will continue to read this subreddit and love the community but sometimes I crave actual conversations with people who are single.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1156789,public,self,2 married pals simply don't get it.

Were were close and due toh mutual friend dating each other were were also a couple in the group, we planned a trip and we enjoyed a lot, when all were asleep we drank and came close and we had a very intimate moments and she this time knew that it was me not her bf and still she did not stop, even when I stopped her she was uncontrollable. Night ended and now I was hell curious that what was it but she never talked about that night and our friendship was going smoothly but after few days she broke up with her bf, reason was lack of attention and she thought that she is also not doing right with him ( that's what she shared ), I expressed my feelings after few days and we kissed again (we were not drunk this time ) I asked her do you want to be with me but she said it's a different bond, let's not spoil it by being in relationship, I was mad with this because I always wanted her and when she is single why is she not with me like a tag relationship ( it was kiddish , and I know it ) it was a different feeling for me because in that state of mind I wanted to feel that , no she is mine now. I spoilled things just because of these smaal things and I started cutting her off, it was damn hurting but I did, we meet to talk one day at my place and we got close after a long argument and I asked her to choose love or Friendship and she left crying that day before of that, she did not give any answer. We didn't talk for 2 months and I had fights with my group of boys and lots of stuff happened, I we started chatting but not so often , she knew about the fight and did react a bit, the group we planned the trip with and some boys whom I fought with were invited to her bday but I wasn't, I felt bad but I accepted, I moved to a different city because of many other reasons, after few months I got to know that she likes my best friend ( who was too in the fight that happened ) and we both were also not talking because of the fight for a long time, so I contacted her to know what is it , how is it happening and basically is she really with him, after building few days of convo, I asked about that like do you like anyone or is there someone and she denied but after few times of asking she shared that it's my best friend, I wasn't shocked because I knew that it was from her side not his, I wanted to know more so I visited the city and solved all the issues with him so that I get to know the things but he didn't share so I got him phone and check picture , he was having close pictures with her, childhood pics which I remember her said that she would never share to anyone, that moment I got to know that they are together and it's not only from her side, I feel devastated and hell bad because now too when I ask her to seek the truth she shares about being one sided with him again, I feel about her and this fact is killing me , when I changed the city I explored FWB and being with someone to forget her but it didn't work.

Ever since I saw the cancel culture and #metoo start, I lost basically all confidence with women. In all honesty, I was afraid to talk to them, I still am.

I believe anything I say might potentially ruin my social reputation. Which, in a couple of cases it has. Saying something as simple as ""hey do you want to get sushi this Thursday"". The quote in the sentence before isn't an innuendo or a riddle. I'm asking them on a casual date.

Almost every time, our friendship/relationship is never the same. Why?

How, as a kinda nerdy, but friendly guy am I supposed to attempt to find a partner within social circles within similar interests without ruining our friendships/relationships or getting a reputation of ""hitting on people"".

Just to be clear, I have a 1-night stands every once in a while, but, that's not what I want, just looking for a partner with similar interests. But at the same time, I don't want to ruin existing friendships or be labeled as a ""creep"". If it paints the story better, I'd say I'm a 6/10, I don't look like Jason Mamoa lol

So I recently realized I need a hymenectomy and if I were to have sex right now it would be nearly impossible and way more painful than it needs to be.

there’s my predicament, I want but I feel like this issue really prevents me from dating in this day and age especially because of hookup culture 

However! I don’t really wanna be that intimate with someone until I’m in a relationship with them (especially for my first time) so I don’t feel as used, hookup culture isn’t my thing

However, maybe it could work? Maybe dating in my predicament could possibly help me weed out the guys that just want sex until I get the procedure done? 

(But atm I probably wanna stay away from dating apps, and it’s not like I meet that many people, nor do I have much of a social life so this is probably not even anything to think about )

TLDR; should I get back into the dating scene even though I need a procedure done before I have sex?

He isn't very affectionate and we hardly ever go out together (he likes to decompress at home) he still to this day had no trace of me on his instagram and posted me once on his Facebook, though he isn't much of a posting kinda guy. He is quite slack in terms of house work at home. I work 2 jobs and pay for most things as I just built my place so he lives in my house and helps with occasional bills and food. I do a fair amount of cleaning. He has stopped messaging me during the day and very very rarely asks how my day is or how I am doing. He is going through financial hardship and is owed so much money that he is fighting for in court cases. Basically lost his life savings. Im trying harder be supportive but when he is stressed he kinda shuts down on me. I just feel like he has lost the drive and motivation when it comes to our relationship. It's almost as if he isn't in love with me anymore. I feel as though he has become lazy and complacent. I work out and actually do some bikini work for extra cash and maintain myself quite highly but I am anxiously attached and working on my own self confidence. I dont know exactly how to bring this up with him without hurting the masculinity or coming across as a brat, however I don't want to make excuses for his stress and how im being treated as a result.

He was super into me, but I couldn't return the feelings, I just came out of a 3-year-relationship and didn't want a relationship and no fwb either. We went on a couple of dates (no sex) and then I dumped him, he was quite sad and at the time I thought he's  very clingy: Our ""relationship"" was 99% snapchat, we didn't even kiss, why would you be so sad? 
So since then, I saw him a couple of times as we kind of share friends, in 4 years I saw him maybe 5 times. 2 years ago, a couple of days before the first lockdown, we finally kissed at a party and it was great and all his friends were like ""FINALLY!!"" lol. Then COVID happened and it just fizzled out. I
always thought he's a great guy so we kind of remained friendly and e.g. texted eachother for our birthdays etc. Last time i did that, he asked me out on a date. I was excited but told him we'd have to wait for a month or so, as I was finishing my thesis and was so stressed out, I hadn't hung out with anyone during that time. He respected that and we set up a date right before Christmas. It was absolutely amazing, super fun and in the end, he kissed me. I was kind of surprised at how well it went and was already excited about all the future dates we would have. We texted a bit for like 7-10 days, not everyday but every other day. It was important to me that I show initiative as well because I dumped him last time, so I tried texting first every other time we texted and to really drop hints that I'd like another date. 

Now, I haven't heard from him for a month. I was the last one to text first. I know that he had exams the past couple of weeks, but I still find it weird he hasn't tried to text me for a month. He seemed interested, the kiss in the end seemed to confirm that and his texts had been quite flirty since then. Why did he ghost me? Is he trying to get back at me for dumping him 4 years ago? Or did he meet someone new? Should I text him or not?

I’m new to this but was hoping to get advice on what I should do
I’ve been dating this guy for three years he just turned 30 this year  And over the three years I’ve noticed that his friends take advantage of his generosity. I’ve watched his friends extort him for money he recently sold his car and we went on a date, he asked his boys to pick us up he even bought us all food, only for his friend to park and tell him he doesn’t have gas to get us home and the car won’t move unless he puts in gas, I sat and kept quiet because I didn’t want to make him feel like I was over stepping my boundaries, he ended up calling another friend to pick us up who also requested for gas ( You might want to say yeah it’s normal but the guy he called always sleeps by my boyfriends house when he is in town Besides we weren’t even far from home and the friend that abandoned us went to the club to pick girls up )Anyway the same friend he called to pick us up has arranged a couple of robberies in my boyfriends house 
My boyfriend drinks and another thing I’ve noticed, most of the people he calls ‘friends’ only call him on Friday to make a plan and he is the only one spending
He puts gas in his car to take them from place to place over the weekend at no point does he tell his friends to chip in for the gas
He buys the alcohol and he provides the place to sleep when the night is done 
I’ve tried to talk to him about how he acts and he tells me I know my friends are stupid but that’s how we relate maybe I’m just over thinking things but it clearly looks like he is giving more than they are and it’s killing me to watch him get so comfortable with people who only think about themselves.
Some of his friends deal drugs and the cops came to search his house once because of his friend ( who got caught and spent his time in prision)
He lent $829 to a friend ( the guy who comes to sleep over when he is in town the same guy who steals from him) it’s been two years and this guy hasn’t paid a dime back, I decided to involve the bailiffs cause papers were signed but I didn’t know his address one of his friends knew the address but refused to give my boyfriend because he didn’t want to ruin his friendship with the guy he lent the money to.. 
funny thing is the same guy who refused to help us with the address, the same guy who parked his car and refused to drive until we gave him money for gas calls my boyfriend to ask for money cause he wants to buy a car 
Another one of his friends wanted to sell his cars muffler because he was told it’s expensive for certain cars, he came up with a plan and asked for my boyfriends car so he could take it to his mechanic remove the muffler and get the money 
I find the fact that his friends are able to disrespect him in my presence quiet disrespectful to me most of them are dating and I’m sure they wouldn’t tolerate the behavior they portray towards me to their women 
I need advice on how I can talk to my boyfriend about this because he isn’t getting younger 
I have talked to him about his spending and maybe him being as selfish as his friends when it comes to money but he told me 

Why does it matter who spends, I want to drink and I won’t do it alone I have the money so why not

I (31M) I have been talking to this girl (28F) from twitter for more than a month now. She lives in another city and we have never met. She has checked all of the boxes (first time meeting someone like this) that I look for except for one  (humor in person) since we need to meet. The most important box is (not wanting kids). 

In the early weeks, we texted twice a day (that died by now) and talk about random deep stuff, then we moved to sc where I gave her my sc (she could have refused and kept it on twitter). The frustrating part since day one is that I'm the one who initiates conversations, the only time she texted first is when she was wondering why I haven't texted her yet in our usual time because I got busy, other than that just some comment on my sc stories. 

The confusing part is that she is well engaged in conversations by sending long texts and voice notes, I say if she is not interested in talking to me she would have replied with short dead end replies. Even though with engaging in conversation I feel like I'm not wanted. Now it has been two days without talking and I'm getting tired of initiating conversation even if we talk for 1+ hours.

It just sucks when I thought that I met the best potential partner but I'm not the best to them. Specially when my condition (not wanting kids) is hard to find where I live.

The most amazing thing about women is how they look naturally.

Take care of yourself. You will always be there for your man. You take care of him and you always spend time for it. You will do anything for him.

You will never realize it in the process ...

You are really taking something from him. You are taking advantage of it.

You see, he wants to be your hero. He does not want you to be his hero.

Men like heroes. See how big men are still fascinated by Marvel comics and superhero movies.

Every man on earth, when he was a boy, dreamed of becoming a hero who saves the world - and at the same time get a girl.

Most men do not include their 9–5 jobs in saving the world

Here are 3 ways you can start today and invite a hero into your life

1. Ask the boy for help.

Contact him to buy a new computer. Ask him out well if he is no longer absorbed in the connection. Ask him to reach for something on the top shelf.

Then thank him heartily with a big smile of appreciation.

No, you do not need it. It makes a woman have a place for men in her life.

2. Enjoy in male company.

Boys just like women who admire men just for the sake of it.

What if his apartment is a shrine to sports? What if he spends hours on his fantasy football team? So what if the idea of a clean shirt at least wrinkles?

He is a boy. OK. You do not have to be like her, because you have covered the feminine part of the gender equation.

3. Let him earn his respect.

Superheroes love challenges. They don’t like to be given gold medals just for showing up. They don’t like to give your love to them on a plate. They want to earn.

There is one more thing they want than a woman’s infinite love: a challenge.

So give him a chance to prove himself. You do not have to work to win it.

Sit down, relax and give him the pleasure of winning your admiration.

We worked together on a research project and every time we met the conversations and vibe were great and relaxed, even though we talked more about each other than about our project. But every meeting was always in the context of university work etc. 

After our project ended with huge success, I asked her out to go grab a drink in my favorite bar for the weekend and she happily agreed.

Now here comes my problem:
Every time we met the atmosphere was quite personal and sometimes flirty but when we text it often seems kind of distant. I can't really interpret her signals and we expressed before, that we are both no big testers and haven't dated in a long time. Therefore the possibility is there that she will just see it as a meeting between friends. 

My question is:
Should I just ask her directly at the end of our evening if she thinks it's a date or do you guys have better suggestions what to do in this situation?

So my ex and I got back together after breaking up for a year and 3 months almost, we ended as my conservatice muslim parents F(17 turns 18 in august) found out i was dating my bf and being physical with him (M 19 turns 20 sept). I had to break up with him and not talk to him in this year and 3months and i never reached out to him again as i was hella busy with school and my parents never let me out of the house and my life was hell so talking to him would have only made it worse as i would miss him more and not be able to see him. During this year and 3 months of the break up he got with 3 girls physically (which is something not common in arab countries) and had sex with one which became his gf for 2 months then they broke up as he told me he only saw her as a hook up and made it clear to her that he doesnt like her romantically and is only attracted to her physically, and turns out she’s BPD and has Atypical bipolar disorder and kept threatening to kill herself every time he tried breakibg up with her during their 2 months relationship and also faked a pregnancy and threatened to have people kill him. He told me all the girls he been with was a result of me dipping on him and acting like he didn’t exist after the break up and completely avoiding him so he stopped believing in relationships and he believed only in hook ups, he also says that he never loved his ex and only liked her cause she was around him 24/7 and was only physically attracted to her and never saw anything more with her as he was forced into the relationship because she always threatened him and he couldn’t do anything about it. I said all of that just to give you guys an idea of my situation, note that he is my first love and kiss and i’m his first love and kiss. So he broke up with her in november 2021 and after 2 weeks he hit me up telling me he never moved on and that he can’t suppress his love to me anymore, i personally struggled so much to move on and i went through the lowest points of my life and my mental health was so ass as i was seeing him getting involved with all these girls while i had my parents up my ass for every move i did because of him. Now we’ve been dating for a month and a week i think and i can’t not imagine him with the other girls he got with and that he has sex with his ex as i’m someone who’s against premarital sex and hook up culture (the physical stuff we did was only making out and hand stuff) and i keep getting disgusted from him everytime i remember. My love for him now has decreased a lot as i moved on from him almost after a year, and it made me numb, i stopped feeling any emotions and i was living like a robot, i thought getting back with him will make me feel again and love him intensely again but i can’t love him the same was i did the first time we dated, and he loves me so much its insane and i dont want to hurt him and i think hes a great guy for me he treats me like a queen and makes me feel like im his world. In general i’m numb and i can’t experience emotions on a deeper level unless im on my period and the only intense emotion i experience is only anger. How am i going to get rid of the disgusting feeling of him being with other girls and how can I start feeling and experience emotions on a deeper level again, as he was the person that made me numb when i saw him getting with other girls it hurt me so bad and affected me so i thought that getting back with him might make me feel again cause i think about him everyday even after i moved on.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1156853,public,self,I really don’t know what I want,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sjiycq/i_really_dont_know_what_i_want/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

It will be LONG. 

I’m one week removed from my first ever serious relationship. First ever romantic partner, first ever intimate partner, first everything.

I’m 24 years old, male, and definitely a late bloomer of sorts. Grew up emotionally neglected, abused/groomed in my teenaged years and it took me a long time to put myself out there in order to date and attempt intimacy. Anyone who’s been through abuse of and kind will know how especially hard it is. 

We met by chance, both not really looking for a relationship, but a relationship is what it blossomed into and what it became. 

Looking back, I absolutely was blind sided by love and infatuation. Hell in her first few messages she even mentioned how hard conventional relationships and opening up was extremely rare for her. 

Still, we hit it off. We had GREAT chemistry in person, similar interests, great conversations at times and I learned so fucking much about love, intimacy, different genres of entertainment, etc over the last 6 months. 

We grew close. We bonded, laughed, connected, read together, made love. She confessed in me how I was the first person to ever make her feel comfortable saying “No” and how safe and loved she felt with me. We confided in each other, explored together and did our very best.

Looking back, I missed a fuck ton of red flags. 

The push/pull, the perceived negativity, inability to trust, inability to communicate what was being felt, the flaking and changing of hangout times. She was kind, she was empathetic, patient, listening to me when I needed it. But there always was the constant feeling it was always one foot out the door. 

I accepted it all, all of it. I never ever had an issue with the causes behind the actions that contributed to everything on a daily basis. I never once raised my voice, put her down, used her trauma/struggles against her for anything.

Eventually I had enough though. I started slowly setting boundaries. I started looking at what she said and instead what she was doing. I wanted to put in the work and communicate in order to provide a healthy relationship. 

All it took was our first “uncomfortable issue” unexpectedly propping up, a line being crossed and boundary put in place, and now 2 weeks later she’s gone. After what I thought was GREAT communication on the subject and respect from her end on what I said made me uncomfortable. 

But now here I sit two weeks later, one week post blindsided breakup, still upset. After 6 months of opening myself completely and giving my all, all I got (albeit detailed) was a text and conversation explaining how she “didn’t want to date ANYONE”, “I did NOTHING wrong” and “You deserve someone who can better meet your needs in a way I cannot.”

WHAT NEEDS DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERN’T MEETING?! 

What hurts and frustrates me the most is that she never communicated this with me. She came to the conclusion 3 days before dropping the ball, 3 weeks and a few hangouts after feeling unsettled. 

Was I the perfect partner despite her saying I was? No, absolutely not, I realize that. My anxiety was triggered at times, I could’ve taken more and pushed less and checked in a little more when in person. I could’ve been more clear on my boundary setting and needs at times. I could’ve done everything I could to avoid emotionally breaking down after  being blind sided. 

I know that, i know I’m flawed and fully admit my mistakes and understand certain actions of mine can be overwhelming or hurtful. 

Yet I also was willing to communicate, to sit down and listen to any grievances she may have, give her a safe space to share how she felt on anything that may have been bottling her. 

Instead that won’t ever happen. 

She said she wanted to remain friends because she did “Love me, care about me as a person and had fun with me” while also saying I was a good person. She said we needed some time apart before trying that.

I don’t think I can though. I don’t think I can wait around and torment myself for someone who’s after something else, weather that just be “I need to be alone” or something different. 

I can’t pull back the intimate drawbridge after it’s been lowered, not after how HARD it was for me to lower it in the first place. 

Plus, what’s to say being friends will be any different than being in a relationship. 

She hasn’t reached out outside one time and tbh I’m not sure if she ever will.

Deep down I do know she does love me, does care about me and cherishes the experiences we shared together. I don’t believe she’s inherently a bad person or broken or a sociopath or anything. 

I do love her too, and always will.

I still have never felt as disrespected and disposable more than I do now in my entire life. I’ve always let myself be the second option and devalued for my entire life and I’m finally saying no fucking more. I want someone to really fight for me, through the good and bad. 

She says she cares about me, she says she enjoys my company and thinks I’m a good person but her actions have never followed her words. They used to, but don’t anymore. She said she wasn’t being a good partner to me, and now i don’t know if she’ll do anything to be a good friend. 

And no matter what trauma, chronic condition, illness or experience factors into it, I don’t deserve that treatment. From anyone. 

I love her, I care about her and fucking hate that I think all this is just her pushing me away due to something going on. I will leave the door a TEENIE bit open if she wants to come back into my life, reconcile and connect again, but I have to push forward.

With my solitary job, the pandemic and world we live in, I know I’m putting myself sorta back into that isolating box. I’ll push on though, I’ll perverse. I’ve learnt a LOT, I know what changes I need to make as a person and the connections I desire now. 

I have to be kind to myself and my heart. 

It fucking sucks man :(

After I told him I wanted to keep things casual, he went on a trip with a girl. That’s when I realized I loved him and shared my feelings with him. Same day when he was on a trip he said ‘I love you. The quality of the time I spend with you isn’t comparable to the quality of time I spend with her’. I didn’t really trust him and same day went to club and made out with another guy.

What I have come to realise is this sub is terrible for advice for some reason:

1. Perspective: We are only getting the perspective of the OP, we don't know the whole story. Maybe from the perspective of the other partner the things may look a lot more different and we can only draw a proper conclusion and address their problems if we know what is actually happening.
2. The people giving advice: Like myself who stumbled upon this subreddit might chime in and give some advice to people, even though I am in no place to do so as I am just a kid who has never been in a relationship before. Also what are the biases of the people on this subreddit, what type of people are they? Are they an accurate representation of people in real life, or does this subreddit have a certain type of people who give a certain type of advice?
3. Lies: OP might not be giving the whole truth even from his own perspective thus rendering the replier unable to actually give any good advice.
4. Virtue signalling: this is a big one and it kinda irritates me, a lot of ""advice"" is actually just statements meant to flaunt moral virtue and not real advice. 

These are some reasons why I think this sub is not a reliable place to take advice.

I met this guy online and we really connected to the point that the guy asked me to hit him up once I’m home. I told him I’m would and the date when I thought I was going to be back home. He responded to that. I said something additional to him after that but he never responded. I know he put the ball in my court. Things  have changed and have to be out of town for a few more weeks but I haven’t updated him bc I didn’t want to seem desperate or say anything else especially if I’m not back and didn’t want to send another text if I don’t get a response. Is he just not interested anymore and that’s why he didn’t keep the conversation going after we both agreed to meet up/I said when I thought I was getting back so I’d reach out? Or he might assume I’ve changed my mind since I didn’t hit him up? What should I do? Should I update him or just wait till I’m back and hopefully he’s still interested/single ?

I was hesitant but I agreed and he really was open about everything. He always reassured me to go at my pace and if I wanted to stop or anything it would be ok.

I’ve (25M) been single now for about going into five years now. 

My last relationship (about 3 years. Age 18-21) ended as a “on again/off again” type deal until my ex secretly started dating another dude. Took me a few months before I found out.
I know now the whole thing was toxic and I’m to blame for letting it get there.

The next girl I seriously saw, while short lived, was a former close friend. We were both helping each other get over our ex’s until we ended up dating each other. Until one day, she called me and told me “she can’t do this” before disappearing from me and our group for a month. And came back with a new boyfriend when my friends’ threw me a party for my 22nd birthday (half of our friends didn’t know what was going on).

I know neither of these are “cheating” since I wasn’t officially together with them. But it took me a lot longer than I’d like to admit to get over it. I’ve went on dates and hook ups since then but there’s just been no chemistry. And getting out there was exhausting.

So when COVID hit, I used it as an excuse to take a break from dating. I wanted time to fully get over the girl I still had feelings for. And take some time to mature. I dove into my hobbies, worked in interesting situations due to COVID, and smoked a shit ton of weed (in the US).

Now here I am. Two years later. I live in a super small town in rural Japan for work. I met a woman my age who is responsible for introducing me into a whole community of friends. And for the first time in a couple years, I’m crushing hard.
But with all of the self doubt, afraid of losing another good friend, and possibly being left again for someone else. And in a small town like this where it seems like you only get one shot. I have no idea what to do.

It's been about a year and about a month and a half ago something extremely strange happened. Our schedule has never really lined up for the whole relationship so there would be periods of up to a week at a time that we wouldn't see each other. So she was very much into getting my dirty shirts. I always wear an undershirt for the sweat and when we started dating she started asking for them. So I started wearing the same shirt until my smell was baked into it. I would give it to her and she would cuddle it until the smell wore off. Once I started to get attached i asked for the same thing. So we got into this habit of trading dirty shirts regularly.

Here's where it gets really weird. A out a month and a half ago I was smelling her shirt and the smell had worn off. I went to smell my shirt to see if I had one to give to her. When I smelled it though, it was her scent. There was no mistake. It was very distinctly  her scent on my shirt. I smelled my armpits to see, and my armpits had her scent. I told her about it and realized that she smells like me now. 

My question is has anyone else had this experience? I've googled it and the best explanation I could find is that couples smell the same when they eat the same food, sleep together, have sex, etc. Here's the thing though, we rarely do those things together. We feed ourselves most of the time,  rarely sleep in the same bed, and that still doesn't explain how our scents switched.
