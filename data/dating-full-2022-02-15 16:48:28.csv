TL;DR bellow!** 

I (23F) know this boy (21M) since 2020. Let’s call him Boy. He was my coworker in an IT Departement of an apparel company. At that time I had boyfriend for almost three years (now ex-BF). My then BF work for Internet Service Provider Company as a helpdesk. And the company that I work for is a client of this ISP company. The IT guy sometimes complaint via Wahatsapp (WA) personal message because it is faster to follow things up with the helpdesk which was my BF. My then BF was really possessive and often pissed off about me close to other guys. People who worked with me was 95% guy. So i thought it was a good idea to tell everyone i have BF lol. That’s how everybody know who my boyfriend was.

Boy was 19 when i met him. He’s the kind of person that everybody will loves. He’s smart, such a gentleman, polite, open-minded and wise for his age. We get along pretty well. He get along with everyone and have a good skill at maintaining friendship (unlike me). For those reasons, I adore him. I like everything about him. He speaks english fluently even has cockney accent. That’s something uncommon. I like cockney accent!

Fast forward, early May 2020, covid attacks. The company where I work were almost bankrupt. Boy and I and almost half of my coworkers got fired. It was hell. Things didn’t go well with my life and my love life. Mid 2020 I decide to broke up with my BF. Let me tell you, it wasn’t because of Boy. Our relationship was toxic and ended it was the option. I’m not really open to my friend about my relationship with my then BF, so I thought I didn’t need to announced the news. But my ex-BF did. He rant on instagram, spamming my WA to the point that I think I had enough and blocked him. 3 month later he got a new GF and post their pics everywhere including WA profil pic. Tbh, idc.

Boy got a new job a month or two months later after got fired. I was really supportive toward him and he said I was his only source of happiness. He kinda love bombing me for several month and then dissappear. I thought, maybe he was caught up with his new job. Now im alone.

During my time alone I kinda feel depressed(?). I never see a doctor because my parents don’t believe mental illness, so disscussing this with them wasn’t an option. I told myself that “I am fine, it is just a phase”.  I try to change my habbit. I workout, eat healthy, I got my body in shape. Did skincare routine, cut my hair, i glow up. I built a really good habbit. 

Then around November Boy contacted me. I was really happy to finally get in touch with him again! We talk about ourselves for hours and share our thoughts. We connected even after months with no contact. He said I am unique and he love my personality. This time I am really in love with him. He is sweet. He knows how to make girls feel loved. Me, little by little became open with him, i’m willing to be vulnerable in front of him. I never be able to open myself but with him, i felt save. I enjoy the time when we were facetiming (we are living in different city). I started to forget about the good habbits I was built. Boy was the only thing i need.

Early 2021, we started confess our feeling. He never straight forward asking me about my relationship but i knew he knew something has changed. He still has a good relation with coworkers from previous job. Maybe he knows about me from them. I didn’t know if i was ready for relationship or not, but everytime he keep in touch with me i feel like he gives all his loves for me. He will call me everyday, sometimes gives morning call, he told me that I’m pretty, he said he loves me, he often encourage me to be brave to vocal my opinion (i have strict parents issues which makes me not confident). I see that as a positive sign. I told myself that i really need a man like him. I was really lucky to have him. But then the communication frequency decreased. Hours became days, days became weeks.

Now that I trust him, I tried to communicate my struggle with him eventho I wasn’t hear anything from him for weeks. It was my low low point and I text him after I didn’t hear from him for a couple weeks, hoping that he will comfort me. His answers was like a therapist trying to give explanation to the client. Flat, cold. And I was never heard from him again.

I wasn’t kind of a clingy or needy girl. So I text him when I feel the need to text him. But sometimes, I want to text him but too afraid because I don’t want him to see me as a needy/clingy person. So all I did was waiting. Tired of being exhausted, I started to built some good habbits (again). I like knitting, so I spent my free time knitting. Sometimes I workout too but not as intense as the first because I was underweight. And my hair has grown, I decideded to gave myself a wolf cut and partly bleached it. I was so caught up with my hobbies and routine. I was happy. When I missed him I watch movies that has british accent in it lol.That reminds me of him! I used to be alone without him until one day I got a misscall from Boy and a single text “Please text me”.

I call him back the night after he texted me. It was cold conversation. Maybe because I didnt talk too much. 30 mins later he switch to facetime and said he misses me so much. No cold ice anymore. We started to laugh, and cry, we connected (again). He told me that he will resign from his current job, and I said, im fully supporting him.

This time I was really sure he will never left me again because it was so intense. His words was so sweet, I love his words, I love his mind, I love his heart. He want things go serious between us. I was like, yes! I want it! I’ve been waiting for it! I have no reasons to say no! Then he love bombing me (again) like nothing ever happens. All of this makes me forget about my habbit (again). I became enjoy talking about myself with him, I’m not afraid anymore to state my opinion. I really want him. All I need was him. The thing is he doesn’t want to label our relationship. When I brought up the topic he said, “That ain’t my stuff, kinda like middle school stuff”. When I told him that he is my boyfriend he would deny it. He straight forward said, “No, I aint your BF”. Well, I understand him. I can’t mad. But to be honest, I feel like i’m in the middle of nowhere. Were we even started a thing? Who are you? Who am I? Why I felt uncertain about us? I’m nobody to him. I can’t see where the start line. I can’t see where are my feet stepped on. Everything is blur. That feeling eating me alive.

When I asked him what term he would use when he introduce me to his friends, he answered “You want me to tell my friend that you are my girlfriend? So the world knows you are special to me?” with a cynical tone. I wasn’t surprised by his answer but it did made me sad. I didn’t know how to argue with it. So i remain quite. Pretend that im cool with it. And then he dissappearing (again).

It’s been a month since I’m talking to him. Maybe he was caught up with his new job (again). I’m so done with this uncertainty. I want to be SOMETHING. I need to know who I am to him. Now his gone for the third time, and i don’t need him again.

Turns out there is a word for this; *Zombied-when someone ghosted you and comeback but worst*. This is the third time and the last. I hope he won’t come back. I have decided to end this relationship for good. Fuck you!

TL;DR A boy I’m in love with has dissapeared from my life \*then i built good habbit then he came back, love bombing me and destroy my good habbit i have built then dissappeared (repeat from\* 2x) and i choose to stop talking to him.

I’m dating multiple people, but this person I’ve really started to enjoy spending my time with the most, so I guess you could say they’ve floated to the top. After our first couple of dates, he made a point to figure out which day we could see each other next before ending the date. The last couple of times, he’s just said, “I’ll see you soon”. I invited him to spend the day with me after that, which he was happy to do! That “date” just ended, and he said he’d see me soon. I am pretty sure he’s also actively dating. I’m curious if this is a sign he’s now more interested in keeping his options open. I feel more interested in becoming exclusive soon. 

Ultimately, I will be bringing my feelings up with him next time (on the 5th date) - I’d like to share that my feelings have evolved. And, I know some of you will say I’m overthinking and to enjoy what’s in front of me.

Not abandoning our partner just because they gained weight, lost their hair etc 

Compromising on superficial parameters to an extent. If the person is compatible with us and has a genuine heart, it's alright if they aren't as good looking or as rich as us. 

If our partner is struggling financially, nothing wrong about lending a helping hand or guiding them on how to solve their issues. 

Trying to make relationships work for long term and not breaking up over small things. 

Being honest and transparent to our partner. Faithfulness doesn't necessarily mean not talking to anyone else but rather, it means not doing anything discreetly. 

Sacrifice, compromise, working on ourselves and self improvement, changing ourselves to a small extent to adapt better. 

Being expressive of our feelings while not being rude at same time.

Blindly accepting a person irrespective of looks coz physical attraction is important too.

Not considering our partner's financial / career aspects early on and later disliking their becoming a liability by being dependent on us.

Being with a person solely for the money they provide or because they take good care of our kids but having no attraction and emotional bond to them.

Promising a lifelong commitment, giving our partner expectations and later unable to meet it.

Being close minded to non-monogamy/polysexuality or judging our partner for being into those things. If they make you uncomfortable, work out a middle ground, or leave.

Trying to change ourselves completely into a person we can never feel comfortable with just because our partner wants so.

I pushed back and told him that we can slow down, I didn’t want to get hurt, and he promised not to hurt me.

He’s been struggling with his mental health the last week and I was being really supportive of him even though he kept bailing on our plans. Then over the weekend, nothing. I was worried about him, tried to check on him, then saw on ig stories he was at the bar with friends, no responses to my calls or texts. I found out through a mutual friend he regularly does this to women, and even abandoned a past girlfriend who had to have an emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy. 

I asked him, point blank, why he was ghosting me, and his response was that he was sorry/feels like his life is falling apart/avoiding responsibility is a problem for him. 

No effort was made to try to see me or make it up to me. So I was honest- he has the ability to work through it but dealing with that type of behavior is toxic for me. I need to know that I can trust the person I’m dating. And worrying about his well-being, picking my cuticles until they bleed while he’s at the bar is not good for me. Especially for someone I’ve known for a month.

As a person, I try so hard to be a better human. I go to therapy, communicate my needs, always try to be empathetic, I’m attractive, I’m fit, educated and financially stable. It’s so frustrating to continually try to be the best version of me, only for people to just take advantage of everything.

Just all of it was completely unnecessary and I have lost faith in humanity. I know we only dated for a month, but so many women have stories like this in dating. So many men have stories like this.

Every single year I couldn’t shake this feeling of being left out. All those couples out there posting happy pics of themselves on social media, kissing, buying gifts and celebrating their relationships…maybe the sex they would have later etc. 

Then this year it finally dawned on me that I just don’t care. Valentine’s Day feels like a scam for corporations to sell you shit. 

Even if I was in a relationship, y’all should be loving and showing affection to one another every day, not just when society tells you to on one day out of the year.

We are connected because we share the same cousin if that makes sense?? Her cousin is my cousin too,but again me and her aren’t cousins. We all just grew up together! 

I’ve always had a little crush on her,but I never acted on it because I was always confused on what she was to me. As I got older, I abandoned it. I never really saw her as anything,but extended family. And even more so now that I’m away at college so I don’t see her often anymore. So, she wasn’t even a thought until now. When we went to a big family vacation for a wedding. 

I don’t know why,but seeing her all dresses up and  everything brought it all back, I guess. Because I couldn’t take my eyes off of her! She definitely didn’t look like the dork I teased her for looking like, but still the weirdest person I know! When she’d catch me staring at her she’d make funny faces at me….I felt sorta creepy because I just was watching her dancing and singing. She eventually went over to me and tried to get me to dance with her. I felt a little awkward,but I figured I would since she seemed eager for me to be apart of the floor. 

 I saw her during my Christmas break when she came over for a Christmas party my parents hosted and I sorta had that same feeling too.  Like it’s amazing how much she’s changed,but yet she is still the same in many other ways. THAT JUST CONFUSES THE HELL OUT ME!!!

To summarize: FORD.

FORD is an acronym that stands for(d):

F - Family
O - Occupation
R - Recreation (hobbies, interests, fun time)
D - Dreams

during our last date last weekend we talked about our relationships with our fathers.  she said that her dad was emotionally absent (never told her he loves her) and consequentially she said that she has a hard time showing affection.  this manifests in her taking several hours or sometimes days to reply to my texts.  She said that she isn't a big texter, I had responded I was wondering what was going on with the mixed signals and we agreed to stick to phone calls in between dates instead of texting.

I'm fairly certain I'm the only one she's seeing since she spends the entire weekend at my place and just recently began hanging out during the week on her only day off during the week.  I tried dating someone else the last couple weeks but it was only a first date and made me realize I have no interest in dating anyone else right now.

I was so excited about this. everything was going like clockwork, I got to the airport right when he walked out and we had a warm kiss and hug.

then we went back to my place to settle in. we had some kissing and romance but not sex. he wanted to go and see the sights of the area, so we did for about 12 hours- scenic hikes, drive, popular restaurants, etc. he held me a little bit but almost all if the physical touch was initiated by me.

day 1 no sex. we got naked but no sex. I mentioned to him that one of the highlights of the day was seeing him naked.

day 2 - even more than day 1 with even more scenery and popular places. we had time and opportunities for sex but he just withdrew.  there was even a point when we were in bed together and I asked him to give it to me and he then rolled on his back and stopped all intimacy. I was shocked. this has never happened before. we talked about it and he said be wanted to and was into me, but nothing happened. I asked him to just tell me if he wasn't wanting to do that to just tell me and I would take it, but he insisted he wanted to be with me.

day 3 - we talked about the itinerary for the day and the window we could have sex and when that time came, he just wanted to go to the airport. on the way to the airport I felt like crying several times. instead of crying I sniffed deeply several times. I wasn't looking for a relationship with this guy, I just was looking for sex, fun and the promised intimacy we would have. instead it was just nothing.  

he was with me for the entire trip but on his phone. he says he doesn't have social media so I guess he was texting someone else. my therapist said he was probably doing what was comfortable and that was talking to someone not in his space.  she said it wasn't my fault. 

I understand he may have some emotional issues and/or physiological but I'm just having a really difficult time getting over this. I mean I did everything I could to have it be a positive experience and was kind to him, I just feel so disappointed and cried today and felt like crying all day yesterday. I was just really depressed about the whole thing.  it was so much leading up to it with his continued yes I want you, yes I want this, and then nothing.

I (30F) would appreciate your advice on this (english is not my 1st language fyi).

I have been single and dating for 2 years now and been quite dissapointed with the dating scene out there. I had my heart broken once in the process and still learning to get over it.

1 month ago I however met a sweet, wonderful guy (35) on Tinder and we hit it off instantly. He put (and still does) a lot of effort into organizing nice exciting dates and we are having a lot of fun getting to know each other. Sex is great as well and I am the happiest I have ever been in years. I really appreciate that he invests time and really puts an effort in dating me.

This being said, I cannot stop repeating myself that that I am not good enough for him and that he will leave me for sure once he realizes it..

He is quite accomplished professionally, owns his own flat in the city center (big capital) and has a LOT of hobbies and a big circle of friends. While I do have a good job myself and consider myself open minded and well read, I don't have as many hobbies and, more importantly,I am not as ""mondain"" as he is. I have some close friends that I see all the time, but I don't party like he does, or even get to go on big weekend trips with a lot of people (like he often does).

I feel very self conscious about it, and he even made some comments about how I am not much of a ""party girl"". I have always been more of a loner and can easily get socially awkward out there.

How could I get over this inferiority complex that generates a lot of anxiety ? I even consider stopping things with him at times because of this fear of rejection. I think I really met a great guy and that's so rare, but i fear i will loose him once he realizes how ""lame"" and uncool I really am...

This is going to be my second relationship but ideally, I want this to be my first ""proper relationship"" if that makes sense.

I didn't look at him like that and he didn't see me that way. But during that Friday we ended up getting close then intimate all in one day; something neither of us have a history of doing with anyone. We ended up staying the whole weekend together then decided to not see each other till Wednesday in order to take things slow. 

We weren't planning to meet up till Wednesday this week, but we both ended up missing each other so we've arranged to meet up today after one day of being apart. Is that a mistake? I really do miss him and I don't want to cancel tonight but I don't want to end up burning out and losing feelings as I did in my first relationship.

He told me he thought I like him more than he liked me and that he wanted to end things because he could not give me the “attention” I deserve/want. I was absolutely heartbroken but I moved on with my life and went on a trip the week after the breakup along with getting back on dating apps (just so I could get the satisfaction of knowing there’s more out there for me). About 3 weeks after the breakup after a bit of back and forth, we decided to have dinner. At dinner, we were both very drunk but him more much so. He admitted that he missed me, he’d made a mistake. I never told him that’s what he said because I decided it was a conclusion he needed to come to without alcohol involved. Following that dinner, we got dinner/tried a new restaurant every week and sometimes twice a week.  I’ll admit at first we were having sex but then I slowly started to pull away knowing how unhealthy it was for myself.
 
I started getting serious with someone new, and found out he had been on his first date (in January) since our break up. I realized I wasn’t giving myself the chance to really move on so I decided to start putting more boundaries on my ex. Well it didn’t work out with the person I was dating and my ex kept pushing to stay in my life the more I pulled away. I finally had a talk with him and let him know we couldn’t be friends, he then proceeded to tell me he can’t picture his life without me in it, that he cares so deeply, and can’t just stop talking to me. I told him no girl he dates is going to be okay with him having such a close relationship with an ex, and he said that’s a “them problem”. I essentially told him he couldn’t have his cake and eat it too and stood my ground on no longer being friends.
 
The weeks following, he kept repeatedly responding to my snapchat stories and sending me memes on IG. I never responded to any of it and kept him muted on everything. 2/3 weeks ago, I ran into him in downtown and we spoke briefly about work where he offered to consult on some research I was doing for a large work project. We got drinks after the research and one thing led to another. We didn’t hook up, but I did spend the night and we cuddled and got somewhat close to it.
 
Since then, we get together 2-3x a week. We get drinks with friends or his brother, I’ll go over to his place after I go out or something and we always cuddle and are intimate.  I spend the night almost every time but he won’t have sex with me. He’ll do other things (like finger me) but when I was sexually frustrated this past weekend I asked him why he wouldn’t have sex with me and he said he didn’t want to complicate things. I found out that when I let him be friends again he stopped seeing/talking to the other girl he’d been seeing. He specifically told me he isn’t seeing anyone else. He’s even made comments about me meeting his mom when she’s here at the end of the month. We talk/snap/IG every day.
 
Is he just stringing me along until something better comes along? I should preface he’s never been in a long term relationship and we were friends with benefits for a year prior to us getting serious. The relationship he was in before lasted 3 months and was 4 years prior to us, he’s always focused on his career. Does he not know what a relationship with healthy boundaries is?

The following day we hung out all day, then at a mutual friend's place into the early hours of the morning. She talked with the other chick there about she and her crush.

I notice myself feeling lonely today. As I suffer acid-reflux induced insomnia tonight I reflect on why as I stare into the darkness of Jon’s apartment from the couch. I really want a relationship, I think. But I’ve always wanted one: a girl who’s there for me. Someone just like me. Kind, gentle, supportive. Maybe iterations on women I’ve wanted before, only they actually want me. Come to think of it, I’ve laid my head to rest night after night for years, literally since childhood, with the same fleeting idea that one day I’ll stumble across that perfect girl. When I was younger I’d pray each night for it. 

Truth is I’m not sure why that is. When I actually do approach relationships with women I never know what to do with myself, or find some minuscule imperfection and exacerbate that into why I shouldn’t - or can’t - be with them. Or, more frequently, I convince myself that I’m not looking for a relationship right now, and think about all of the other opportunities in front of me. I make silly excuses and when my phone dries up I reminisce on all the great people I’ve passed up on my way back to loneliness. 

Is it a standards thing? Surely it is: they must be perfect, it feels like I’ve waited forever? I’ve been single my whole life, why settle for someone less than my ideal now? Throughout my dating experience I think this is the predominant conclusion when at the crossroads of keeping it casual versus perusing something bigger.

I need to be blunt about one thing: I like the version of myself that I present on dates. Confident, humorous, always asking questions; I sometimes feel like my best self when in these settings. Given most early in the game dates can sometimes be interview-like, over time I’ve perfected the craft of the first impression. It’s served me well professionally: I always get jobs and positions I interview for, and months of interview prep has perfected my art of answering not only a question directly but addressing the underlying intentions of what is being asked. I feel certain about my ability to shine when the spot light is mine and the arena of the first date seems to be just that.

So why, now 2:31 am on the night of Valentine’s Day, do I sit here in deep desire of a relationship but flatly without one? Are my standards that high that no one in the city of New York can fill them? 

To answer this question I need to dig deeper past a question of standards. Why maintain such standards? I don’t think purely for myself: to be totally honest I’ve myself struggled with issues of a sense of belonging. To delve deeply into this would take hours but my feeling of being a hexagonal peg in an octagonal world wouldn’t be  too far off. As a result of this, I’ve never truly felt confident in my own skin, and kinda just skate by most of life deeply shrouded in a sense of insecurity that I mostly ignore. I think it’s entirely possible that I maintain these standards of dating because of this insecurity. I could just be looking for someone who fits my friend’s ideas of a viable girlfriend instead of someone who’s actually good for me.

I’m also a firm believer in the idea that none of us can accurately sense how others perceive us, and that the truest aspects of ourselves fill the air around us like colorful gas that everyone can see except ourselves. It’s entirely possible that I could instead be scaring away potential partners who can see the insecurity and self confidence that I so desperately try to repress. 

Despite this all, and my recurrent late night thought loops that bring me back to the conclusion that I should be spending my early 20’s focusing on developing self love and building foundations for future successes in career and life, I can never shake the feeling that this lifelong struggle of self acceptance will continue for the length of life and that I shouldn’t wait to conquer demons before I should find love.  I look at my single aunts and uncles who lived full lives without life partners because they spent their early years just trying to survive in America. But equally so I look at my family in particular and see a bunch of marriages that don’t occur out of love, but out of necessity: kids, lifestyle circumstance, etc. Come to think of it, I don’t really think I know of any marriage - or even relationship - that didn’t come together because of such things.  And I have a big ass family. Marrying out of necessity and not love seems to be a generational curse that has gatekept me from knowing what a romantic sort of love is supposed to look like.  I learned of courtship and romance through books and TV: I never was taught how to act on a first date, nor told what to do on special occasions like holidays, birthdays, etc. Part of my dating experience has been figuring these things out as they come, and maybe feeling like a noob is part of the reason I don’t see a potential partner through.

But mostly? And this is a nagging realization that I have slowly needed to spit out - but maybe I’m afraid what they’ll think of me if we continue on. Sure I’m great on a first date, but will I be exposed as a fraud on the second or third? Like a shirt you liked when you tried it at the store, but realized later when you got home it doesn’t fit with any of your outfits, I’m scared that as my true personality reveals itself my initial appeal will wilt away with time and they’ll lose attraction to me. I’m scared that the idea of me that I can present for several hours on a date doesn’t represent who I am as the person I can’t hide after days or weeks. Even more so, I don’t think I even necessarily act like a different person while dating, but maybe more that I’m shocked that there is reciprocated attraction that it feels to me that maybe they have perceived me differently. And I’m scared that that’s what they’ll see right past over time. 

Recognizing that I just used scared 3 times in the last couple of sentences, I think that’s all it is. I’m scared. But faith shall come, or at least I hope.

I've been dating since late December. At first I was fully on the ""looking for nothing serious"" train. Almost every single woman I've spoken to have been on the same page, and it seems like most people my age really aren't looking for anything serious. As the months have passed, however, I've realized what I'm craving is the comfort and intimacy of a relationship again. I understand I'm not fully over my breakup yet, so jumping into a relationship with someone else is a few months away for me still, but I've realized it's what I want.

I've been talking to this woman (24F), Sarah, since Christmas. I had been on a few dates with other girls, but I've really grown attached to Sarah and we have great chemistry. I decided at one point that I didn't want to date or talk to any other women. By the 7th date I told Sarah how I felt, and that I eventually wanted to be serious with her. She responded by telling me she would eventually want to be serious with me as well, but that she had to work on herself first. I brought up possible exclusivity, and she basically told me she wasn't interested in being ""officially exclusive"", but that she was only interested in dating me (to be honest I have no idea what to make of this). She still has Tinder installed on her phone, but she definitely isn't dating anyone else other than me at the moment.

A few more dates have gone by, all fantastic. We gave each other gifts for Valentine's day, and we went on two dates over the weekend, so I'm assuming the ""situationship"" is kind of getting more serious. However, today I let her know that, if we're both available, I wanted to try to see her more than once a week. I was hoping she would agree, but she ended up responding kind of coldly.

I don’t want to go out with her, I ’don’t find her attractive and I don’t think I’d like us as a couple.

So I matched with this guy on hinge in early November, and we didn’t meet in person until early Dec bc of scheduling conflicts. Our conversations before we met were really good, we had a lot in common, and I feel like he was thoughtful in his responses.


Fast forward to date 1: We decide to get pizza and I said after we can go back to my apartment to play board games and drink since I know he’s into that. I also said he could sleep over if he ended up drinking too much. I also mentioned to not expect sex just because I offered him to spend the night lol and he was very respectful of that and appreciated my honesty. The date went well and he slept over; while we were in bed I said I would be down for sex if he was too. We ended up not bc he didn't have a condom. Instead we just had a conversation and I was telling him how horny I've been lately lmao because I haven't had sex in almost 3 years. (I drank a little too much and started spilling all my secrets haha).

Date 2: We went out to look at the Christmas lights and again he slept over at my place after drinking and playing card games. I was on my period so no sex unfortunately :(


Date 3: I go to his place and he cooks for me. I have zero culinary skills lol so I helped just a little and did the dishes for him. We watch tv shows in bed together and fucking finally we have sex. I'm not very experienced in bed but I am super fucking enthusiastic. I was throating that dick and he pounded me and I loved it lol.


Dates 4-8: We get dinner together, binge tv shows together, play card games, he cooked for me again, and every time we meet we have sex at the end of the night. 

He knows I love having sex with him, and I'm always eager. But I feel like I made myself too available (esp. on the first date when I brought up sex). He doesn't text me as much anymore, and his texts aren't as thoughtful as they were in the beginning. I feel like he doesn't appreciate the things I do for him. I got an IUD so he doesn't have to wear condoms anymore (horrifying experience lmao), I get my eyebrows threaded every two weeks, I shave my vag the day I know I'm going to see him, etc. There's a lot of upkeep that women do that men don't. It's his birthday coming up soon and I told him I wanted to treat him to a fancy restaurant he's been wanting to go to. I'm very fun in bed-- I suck the soul out of his dick, I ride him, I'm not a starfish. I don't mean to brag but not every woman is as eager as I am. Lots of guys wish their partner was more sexual like me. I honestly think that I'm a catch and that my efforts have gone unnoticed.  Yesterday was Valentine's day and he didn't text me :(. I just want him to initiate something nice for me. I'm really easygoing and would have appreciated something simple and small. Idk I think he feels like he bagged me and doesn't care to go the extra mile. I have no clue if he sees me as a fwb vs relationship material. I really like him and feelings are there, but I can't tell if he feels the same. People always say ""If he likes you, you'll know and it'll be obvious."" He's so nonchalant about things that idk if it's just his personality or if he really doesn't care lol. For example, the day I got my IUD, I was telling him how painful it was and all he said was ""that sucks"" and then proceeded to tell me how his feet hurt from playing soccer all day lol. Like he is so hard to read. He checks off everything I want, it's just the effort really isn't there and I'm not sure if it's just who he is or if he's not interested in me romantically.

I've been dating a wonderful woman and it seems we both want a long term relationship with each other. Which is super exciting and a great feeling! With that, comes of course some baggage.

Sparks all over the place. I ask her to grab a beer on another day but she rescheduled for that very night. Already good signs. 

We grab a beer and just within 45 minutes are making out and just having the time of our lives. It was honestly one of the best interactions I've ever had. 

All of a sudden she mentions she has an on and off thing with a much older guy but that she wants something more real and long term. I was hesitant for sure but said, ""let's keep it slow and see where things go"". 

We were there for hours afterwards and it felt like being a teenager all over again. After we leave she sends me a text of how much she enjoyed the night. It was pretty damn great. 

The weekend came and went, I was busy with work things and she had friends over. We exchanged texts a few times. Then on Sunday the following text thread happens: 

Her: hey can I bother you? 

Me: yea sure

Her: wanna come over, get down? 

Her: fuck. 

Me: I can't possibly turn that down.

Her: I'm so sorry, that wasn't meant for you 

Me: oh lol 

Her: omg I'm so sorry

Me: no worries just a little embarrassed 

Her: I'm so mortified

Me: don't sweat it dude. Have fun and I'll see you around. 

Silence from her ever since... And I mean yea I get that. I did like her, just a bit disappointed. I think it's dead in it's tracks but wow what a 180. 

I'm at a loss here. My instincts say this is dead as it gets but I also kinda wanna reach out still, let her know I still want to see if something can come of her and I - it was such a perfect situation within our friend group that I'd hate to just toss her to the wind...

Okay, so to start ive never had a serious relationship in my life. I’ve only ever had school “boyfriends” who I saw at school and that was really it. So I’m lacking in experience entirely, IE: never kissed anyone, Virgin, the whole shebang. I always attributed this to insecurity over my looks and the fact that I was insanely focused on school. I graduated undergrad at 20 with finance and accounting and again at 21 with my MBA. Now I work full time as an accountant and am working on my CPA. 

I worry that when I do finally put myself out there, I’m going to mess it up somehow. I’m a rather clumsy person with my words and I tend to be too giving to a point that it ends up hurting me. For example, a “friend” talked me into sharing explicit photos of myself with him. I told him countless times I was uncomfortable with it but I still did it because a part of me couldn’t bear the idea of losing someone else. I understand now that it was wrong of me to share them and I still feel the guilt of it nearly 6 months later. 

And knowing I can be rather gullible, it worries me that I’m going to fall into a relationship with someone who isn’t right for me. I’ve never seen a healthy relationship as everyone in my family either is divorced or in an unhappy marriage. So, I don’t even know what I should be looking for. I fear that my lack of experience will disinterest guys. I also worry I’m going to deal with a lot of fetishization. I’m South Korean and, supposedly being the new “it” race to be, I fear guys will only  be interested because of that. 

So, I’m looking for some advice. How do I approach dating and conversing online? What are some red flags I should look out for? 

TLDR: I’m shy, I’m gullible, I’m inexperienced, and I don’t want to fall into a bad relationship.

I had an abusive relationship it went on from mine 14 til my 17.

 After that one i had a relationship with a girl witch was my best friend since i was 13. Didnt work out blew it in 3 weeks becaus of the old scars and it was to soon should have taken it way more easy. But shit happens. 

After that i lost her i lost all the girls that where close to me.  

At 19 i found a girl in a new friendgroup. Developed feelings for here did my best but i didnt know how to behave or what to expect. Went out for a drink with friends. Just to find her kissing with my best friend.
Right there and then i lost faid in love and hit rock bottem. 

Af course i had an argument with the friend who kissed here because he knew i liked here and was like fk it im going for it anyway. But then his dad got cancer and died so i put it to rest and decided to be there for him. Some things are just more important.

Im 24  havent been in a relation for 6 year. still looking for a girl to have a serious relatioship with. I feel like i lost a part of me along the way. And feel like emtionless sometimes.

And every time i get a match on tinder or happen i get my hopes up but then the dont respond or its not mutial or its only about sex. And even if i didnt really get a connection with then i feel hurt as in hart broke. Have to press the reset button witch can taken some dayes sometimes.Kind of the same feeling when youre experiencing during a brake up just hart broken. Dont know where it comes from but it just hurts.

Feel hopeless some times. What sould i do ? How can i work on my self not to feel like shit every time i get rejected.

Also in 2022 it feels like when i go out girls stand in groups they know and they feel almost offended if you even ask how there night is going. Its like ther scared becaus owh shit some one talks to me how do i respownd maby not and just turn my back because otherwise ive to get out of my comfort zone.
