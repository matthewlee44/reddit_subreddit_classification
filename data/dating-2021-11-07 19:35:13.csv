0,qp33fu,1636335598,My (F26) middle name might as well be Rejection.,"
I‚Äôm (F) am in my mid-twenties and have always been rejected after confessing my feelings. 
I started dating for the first time when I was 18 years old, that‚Äôs also the age of when I had my first kiss. I was a late bloomer but never really minded that I was. 

Even when things seem to go well with a guy they always turn me down after I confess my feelings. Saying that they would rather be friends. 
I‚Äôm personally not a fan of switching back to ‚Äúbeing friends‚Äù after being romantically involved with someone but some made it work, some didn‚Äôt. 

People always say that when someone rejects you it has nothing to do with you. It‚Äôs not a personal attack and I‚Äôm slowly realizing and coming to terms with that. However, it doesn‚Äôt make the rejection less painful. 
I often wonder if maybe I‚Äôm not attractive enough or don‚Äôt really have enough of a personality for guys to stay interested in me. 
I‚Äôm starting to think that maybe there‚Äôs indeed something wrong with me and it is my fault that I always get rejected. 

It might be because of the isolation of the pandemic. (I live alone and started working from home during the first lockdown) I feel somewhat lonely. I know that romantic love shouldn‚Äôt be the center of my life, and it is not necessarily the center of it but since I hope to one day have a family it‚Äôs a little scary to think that I might never be good enough. That I‚Äôm maybe one of those people who weren‚Äôt made for love.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qp33fu/my_f26_middle_name_might_as_well_be_rejection/

2,qp39l6,1636336179,Bizarre near-hookup (What did she want?),"I (37M) went out dancing with a work buddy this weekend. I was shaking it pretty good when a lady (who later said she's 27) joined me. She was over 6 feet tall (at least two inches taller than me; I'm 5'10"" and 1/2) and fit and I'm very attracted to physically powerful women. We went to the bar to talk and she hugged me intensely and was touchy-feely in general, running her hands up and down my arms while she looked at them. (I'm fairly well-built.)

She asked me to join her at her friend's apartment to hang out. I was honestly just enjoying her company and her energy and didn't have expectations, but naturally I bid my friend adieu and left the bar holding her hand, and we walked there together. 

Back at the apartment she brought me to a bedroom, where her friend (a heavily inebriated, quiet man) hanged with us for a little while.

She eventually looked at this guy and said something like, ""Would you mind leaving so we can have sex?"" üòØ He did, and we made out... but no sex. I honestly was pretty buzzed and high since we smoked a joint (legal in my state) and I can't recall 100% what happened. We just stopped. I got her number, she kissed me and I left.

I texted her so she had my number and she immediately texted an address. I assumed it was her place and she wanted more privacy. I texted ""Now?"" She sent the address again, with a location description (under a restaurant). My reply was ""OK but when?"" Again, she sent the address, with the city (even though we were in the same city).

I thought this was weird, but I went. I tried to find an entrance, but couldn't. And the restaurant (which was the address she sent) was closed. I texted and called her again but no answer this time.

This is one of the strangest things to happen to me. What was her game plan? Was I almost murdered? Maybe she did want to meet me but couldn't make it and ghosted? Or did I do something to turn her off and she sent me on a wild goose chase to make sure I left? Maybe she's just crazy and there's no logical process in her head?

Thoughts? At least I had a good time and got a crazy story out of the deal....",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qp39l6/bizarre_nearhookup_what_did_she_want/

8,qp47ej,1636339312,My struggle in leaving dating apps for good.,"Throughout my time with apps like tinder, bumble, hinge, pof, badoo, and others, I am slowly becoming more cynical and bitter towards online dating.There were many disappointments during my years of searching: being ghosted by a few women, matching and connecting with those who were too far away, and connecting with someone local only for us to never meet due to numerous circumstances and complications. This has gotten so bad that it's effecting my mood in general. I have grown a sense of hatred for happy couples and the success stories from people that used the same apps that I used.

At that point, i pulled the brakes, dragged myself to a mirror, and looked myself dead into my own eyes. I had to ask myself, ""Is it really worth it? Do you think you are conducting yourself in a manner that will attract people towards you?"" It is of no surprise that I told myself no. It is not anyone's fault for my own burning hatred. This is the toxic behavior that will only perpetuate my current issues.

I cannot continue on like this. l want to stop. However, the incessant thoughts of me being a lonely loser will nip at me forever if I do. I know how damaging and wasteful it is to be like this, but I have a feeling I will crack under the weight of my own loneliness and come crawling back to those apps.

So, I am stuck. I want to have the willpower to leave and not look back, but I can not find it in me to do so.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qp47ej/my_struggle_in_leaving_dating_apps_for_good/

12,qp4gb8,1636340169,"What should I do over this guy, why does he act like this?","So I(26f) and a guy(33m) had a casual relationship for 4 months and it wasn't either exclusive. But he started chasing me since I went back to my home country and also had confessed his deep feelings and connection with me and that he felt bad about how he treated me and he'd now come for me wherever I go. And we kept this long-distance relationship for 7 months by his attempt of keeping in touch with me. And recently I moved to a nearby country of his. He eventually came over. But not totally because of me since he has his sis living here and gonna take care of her baby while staying at hers.



I tried to clarify what relationship this is when we met again. He said he thought I'm no more interested in him since he was the only one who‚Äôs tried reaching out all the time. And for having a relationship, he said it's unfair for me since I'm young and would have lots of opportunities to meet other guys. Furthermore, said it'll be uncertain as before since his life is as and also I'm living in another country. Also I asked ""do you take me serious?"" then he replied he wouldn't have done it that keeping in touch for 7months while we haven't seen each other if he didn't have feelings for me, and said ‚ÄúYou're about to dump me, can we just enjoy each other‚Äôs company at least for a few weeks I'm here?"" So I replied ‚Äúthat won't happen anymore, it sounds like you wanna have fun for a few weeks and it's been almost a year and I've had enough. This ambiguity is giving me a hard time.‚Äù Then he said he could see the future of us and if I could so, let's try?(I‚Äôm still confused if that makes sense)



After the date, we had sex at mine during the night and morning but he left right after having sex in the morning. He said he needs to cook for his sister cus she doesn't eat if she's alone. Before he left, he asked me if i want to come over to his sister's place the next day so I said yes however he didn't let me know until the day comes and then said, her baby is sick so not a good time for me to come. 



But still there are other confusing signals. He still carries our pictures in his wallet that we took. There are only three pics in his wallet and one is his parents' and another one is me and the rest is me and him together. Also, he has kept learning my mother tongue language for the last 7 months while we were apart. He kept an empty body wash bottle that I used because it smells like me. He asked me for travelling for Christmas together. Asking where I'd like to be settled down and live for good. etc..



It feels more than a casual thing but still, I can't stop feeling like I'm being used for sex and am not a priority at all. I feel like he just came over to take care of his sister and his niece while I'm just being here for his convenience. Especially I felt so since he left right away after the morning sex. I'm just wondering if I really mean anything to him or he's just deceiving me. I'm really getting exhausted from this relationship, wanting to stop but he means so much to me and almost feel like I love him.

Talked for three weeks then saw each other 3 times in a week. We clicked instantly, we both felt something, but we may have overdid it. We both ended up feeling different types of pressure, we both sabotaged it in some way, and even when we talked and basically righted the ship and we were in a good place, I got scared and cut things off in a way there‚Äôs probably no going back from. Hit her up once after to ask if she was willing to talk, but no response. 

In the time since, I‚Äôve been dating a lot and the experience has been a springboard to examine my behaviors and approach towards people, such as recognizing that I‚Äôm too guarded with emotional intimacy, and I hold back too much on even the simplest nice things after so many relationships where the woman took advantage. 

Now I‚Äôve been seeing this woman for and it‚Äôs probably the healthiest ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù I‚Äôve been in since high school, even though rn we‚Äôre more casual. She‚Äôs even been helping me to recognize and overcome my hangups. It‚Äôs a really nice thing we have. We say we‚Äôre not serious but I think we both recognize we‚Äôre inching closer and closer.

I‚Äôm worried I could mess up because I‚Äôm not over the woman from the summer. Or at least I‚Äôm not over the situation in that I just wish I had done things differently. When I‚Äôm with the new person, she has my full attention and my thoughts surround her. But as soon as I leave my mind drifts to the previous one, wishing I had the same experience but with her instead.

The girl I am interested in has me all types of confused. Her behavior seems quite inconsistent, making it hard for me to judge her levels of interest in me.

She walks her dog by my house a few times a week. I think she is cute, so one day I approached her and talked to her for a while. She seemed quite nervous, but engaged. She would talk to me, ask questions, etc.

Since then, she has continued to come by and, in fact, has done so more frequently. However, when I approach her she seems aloof. She will turn away from me when we first meet, avoid eye contact, and if somebody else is present, she will focus on them (i.e.. she will focus on my grandparents and sort of ignore my presence).

But, she doesn't run away. She will stick around for a talk if I make the effort. For example, when I ask if she wants me to bring my dog outside so it can play with hers she will usually shrug and say yes. She has also stuck around through some painfully awkward silences (sorry, I do run out of things to say sometimes.)

I have also been looking at my security cameras (a bit creepy, I know, but I need to justify buying them since they never seem to catch any crimes) and realized she sometimes stares at me when I turn my back and looks at my front door inconspicuously when passing by.

What do y'all  think? Should I leave her alone? Should I take it slow, play it safe and see where things go? Should I be very straight forward and ask her out?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qp5y2l/what_should_i_do/

I had my chance but I threw her to the side because I couldnt accept that anyone would want me or like me. I still feel this way and I am having trouble moving on. I didnt date for most of my life because I am mentally unstable. I am in sober living now a state away and I am seeing a therapist. I tried to rebuild a friendship with her but she just ignored me. This was last year. I hate feeling this way and I want to forget it. I still miss her terribly. Girls always liked and asked me out first but Ive been single most of my life.

33,qp67al,1636346560,"What does it mean to be ""too serious"" when dating?","(M24) I asked a girl out last month, we had a great time, good long conversations (though in the hindsight I think that I was asking more questions than her), the date ended nicely, we walked a long stretch to her place (no hug or kiss though, I am a bit shy when it comes to this). I got back, texted her that I had a great time and she looked good today, she said that she had a great time too, after a few more random texts we finally said goodbye.

Fast forward, I started waiting and texted her the next day to fix a time and location of the next date. She told me she had a busy schedule for this week, and explained what she was doing on each day, and said that she would see me after the coming weekend for sure, I agreed and left it that. On Sunday night, I asked her about the plains again only coming to know (after much deliberation) that there is some medical emergency and a plan would not be possible for the next 2 weeks. I thought that's fine, and we continued texting on and off (with me taking most of the initiatives, she is not much of a texter according to her). 

Fast forward, 3 weeks after the first date, I asked her again and we agreed to a day in the coming week, on that particular day she postponed the plan for some ad-hoc reason. Now, I sensed it and asked her to let me know if there is anything that she feels differently about so that our expectations can align. She told me that she would love to go out when she has time to do so and there is genuinely a place that she would like to go and she didn't understand what I meant by feeling things differently, I got confused at that, didn't really understand what it meant, but on her proposal agreed to meet next week sometime. This day finally arrived and low and behold she said she was very sorry and canceled the plan again, at this point, I left all the hopes with this going any further, though I still felt that meeting her again would be good. 

We informally decided to meet at this common college event. I only saw her during the end of the event (didn't reach out earlier as I was tired of taking the initiative by now), she quickly said bye just after the few seconds in the meet and I was taken aback, I was agitated by this and dropped her a text about not making any plans going further (the next morning she made clear to me that she was intoxicated and was rushing home due to the bad experience). However, I was not very convinced and texted that sitting down for a meeting isn't so tough and boils down to priorities, too which she responded that we probably have different expectations and I was way too serious about the thing. She only looked at this as something when she had time and was bored. I ended it at that, told her that in the future if things align reach out, said good luck to her. 

Now comes the things about which I am confused:

1. Isn't asking out someone formal enough to be considered a date? Did I do something wrong here? Will people go on a date even when they have no intention to be serious about anything? How can I avoid this in the future?
2. What does it mean to be too serious about stuff? Is it a lot of expectation to just consider meeting someone a second time or go on a second date or expect them to give you some priority?
3. I don't see any solution of reviving this after so much friction just to meet (no calls or Facetime even, in the entire period, even after insisting), open to suggestions on what I could have done differently.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qp67al/what_does_it_mean_to_be_too_serious_when_dating/

It‚Äôs just small talk but we had chemistry together (both literally and figuratively lol) and it was just a really easy conversation from the get-go. The vibe was good :)

So, we exchange numbers, and she has been texting me a lot ‚Äì almost every day initiating conversation. We agreed to go climbing after class one day, and after our night ended she messaged with me a ‚ÄúI had a lot of fun with you‚Äù text, and we agreed to meet up again outside of school later this week. And again, she said she‚Äôs ‚Äúlooking forward to it‚Äù ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt feel like something you typically say in the context of a platonic friendship.

Even as dense as I am, I think it‚Äôs quite likely that she‚Äôs interested. For context, she lives outside of my city so she‚Äôs even going out of her way to meet me since it‚Äôs out of school.

Overall, at this point in time, things are in a sort of undefined limbo where this could be a friendship or it could be a romantic interest, and I‚Äôm not sure how to clarify it. 

On one hand, I could ask straight up if she wants to date, but I don‚Äôt want to be too forward and potentially over-do it too quickly.
 
Or maybe I could ask it less-directly. As in, asking ‚Äúare you single?‚Äù and see how receptive she is‚Ä¶ but I also don‚Äôt want to half-ass the issue.

And the last option is to just keep hanging out without really addressing the issue. But she has already initiated most of the time, and since I truly am interested, I feel somewhat obliged to make a move here.

We went home after and cuddled in bed for a bit while watching videos but I didnt make a move for sex because I didnt know if she wanted to yet.
I asked her about why she's held out on losing her virginity and she just kinda shrugged and said I dont know (it wasnt awkward) 
maybe I shouldn't have asked that? I just started overthinking and dint make a move
Anyway I just drove her home and we agreed to a second date but Im worried that since I didnt make a move she wont think I want to have sex with her but I do

I  searched this topic  several times and the general theme of some of the responses has been that, since this may affect a woman's decision to sleep with a man, he is obligated to 'out himself' as virgin or else it's a lie of omission  (the lie being passing oneself as a normal sexually experienced adult). 

Do people have any thoughts on that - whether the likelihood  of bad/awkward sex, combined with being ""abnormal"" obligates  someone reveal their (lack of) a sexual history. 

Is  it creepy to deliberately withhold this from a potential partner specifically because they may  then choose not to sleep with you? Why  is it okay to expect virgins to do this but not okay ask about partner count?

We was long distance for a few months and it made things better between us. Fast forward few months later she breaks up with me because her mom got sick. She said it is all too much. I fought for us but she goes and take pictures with other dudes and post it to show me a point. Few days she messages me saying she needs me nobody else calms her down like I do this was because her mom went unconscious for sometime. After that she says she needs to learn to calm herself down. I agree and we stop chatting. She does this again. She sends me a message that she did this to protect me and she regrets leaving me. She needed me to calm her down again. I don't allow it because she's using me. She keeps on saying I became good now. I always tried to be I was younger that time and immature. I didn't come from a good home. I tried to make myself better for her for the past year I have been going to a therapist to sort my issues but she keeps on playing victim and making me bad. I begged her when she left and now she regrets leaving me. She keeps picking she helped me just like how I helped her but at that time she was my girlfriend.

At the end I went in for a kiss and got the cheek and was told ""I like to wait until it feels natural"".

I few years ago I broke an engagement to a girl I was with for 7 years because she just didn't show me enough passion or affection. Since then I have dated many girls for whom affection is enjoyed much more freely and those early signs translated into every day life with them; from little gestures like stroking my hair while watching a movie, to wild passionate sex.

So I read a lot into the very early signs of how someone treats physical affection and I am very paranoid about falling into a relationship against with someone who is uptight about affection and sex and so on. So I am taking this as a hard red flag, not really worrying about why it is she rejected it but just taking it as a sign things would not progress to a really physical passionate kind of relationship.

Am I being unfair?

92,qpe7dx,1636379993,For those of you women out there. What are your thoughts on geeks and introverts?," 

So what are your thoughts on geeks and introverts?? And what I mean by geeks is someone who is obsessed with things like Super Heroes, Video Games, and computer stuff.

And just a side note I am actually a geek myself, and I am learning programming and animation to be a game developer with the hopes of starting a studio.

I'm also 6,4, lean body, and I have blue eyes.

I'm basically trying to figure out if I am someone's type or not because it seems like most women like guys who are the complete opposite.

Also I'm going to give out my dating history, so basically I didn't get any crushes until I was about 16 and before I was 16 I did actually date a couple people but rather than me approaching them, they instead approached me and I dated my first girlfriend for about a year and I thought she was cute but then we broke up because she moved away and I didn't have a phone to contact her, and that was in middle school, and then during my sophomore year of high school(which is when I got my first phone btw) Another girl thought I looked hot and one day when I pulled out my phone she actaully took it out of my hand and put in her number and I was like ""Ummm okay then"" and so then we started texting and we both had some of the same interests but then after a month we just outright ghosted eachother and never talked again and broke up, and honestly I think there was multiple reasons for that but I'm not going to go into those though. And then about a year later when I was 16 I just outright decided that I was going to find another girlfriend and so I went onto YouTube for advice and tried to date another girl and boi did I make alot of mistakes trying to find a girlfriend lol. But after some time now I think I now know what I need to do and patients and not being so thirsty is 2 of them.

So yeah, I'm honestly just trying to understand women better and that's partly why I'm posting this. I'm just wondering if anyone would actually date someone just like me.

Also I'm 18 now btw and have officially graduated.

I did actually make a post similar to this one in which I deleted, and someone said that women are looking for a man who is really nice and is a good listener and I am nice most of the time but when I feel disrespected that's when I'm lets just say not so nice, and also I am good at listening most of the time but my brain also sometimes dozes off when random things come to my mind when someone talks to me. An example of that is a time a couple days ago when me and some friends of mine are discussing a game that we are making and one of my friends was discussing something while I was thinking about something else that he said and so therefore he had to repeat the thing that he was talking about after my brain went randomizer mode lol.

So yeah if there is anyone who wants to talk to me and be a potential girlfriend of mine, please let me know in a reply or a message/dm, I will say though since all of you are strangers, I would appreciate it if you gave me some information about who you are and I will do the same after, and please dont lie either because I know that there are alot of trolls out there that would do that. Anyway my type is any kind of hair color, hourglass body type but there may be others that I find attractive too, blue eyes but if you don‚Äôt have that color I‚Äôm fine with that too but I do find blue the most attractive, long straight hair or long and curly.

So yeah that's technically my type in terms of looks but yeah even if you think you may not be my type feel free to dm me anyways if you want because to be honest I probably have more than one type lol, but I guess those things that I listed are what usually what comes to my mind when I think about girls that I like.

Anyway now I‚Äôm gonna go into my type in terms of personality and who the person is.

Loves animals, is a geek like me lol, is funny, is creative, is extremely nice and friendly, has a cute smile.

And just so that everyone knows, you really don‚Äôt have to dm me or anything, if no one wants to dm me I am completely fine with that, also I know that I already said this too but for the love of God please don‚Äôt lie about who you are if you decide to dm me or something like that, also not only that but if you decide to dm me just tell me information that you are comfortable with knowing that I‚Äôm a complete stranger to you for now.

Also my age limit is 18 to 21, I‚Äôm not dating anyone over 21 as someone who is 18.

Also

I will say though that I‚Äôm really trying to focus more on other things in my life right now but that doesn‚Äôt mean that I won‚Äôt talk to any girls though. I‚Äôll have time.

But please be sure to follow the rules that I said earlier in this text though if you decide you want to dm me though.

So yeah anyway back to the question, do you ladies like geeks and introverts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qpe7dx/for_those_of_you_women_out_there_what_are_your/

We haven't been on any real dates yet but she has invited me to spend night at her place.

I mean, I don't know if she's just kind or if she feels attracted by me. I find her attractive, this is my second therapy. I say this bc I've been in therapy before and distance is kept in a very clear way, this case is kind confusing in that sense, help.üòÖ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qpebtm/flirting/
96,qpecpb,1636380432,I'm shocked by the amount of mutual connections in queer dating,"So I (F22) recently reconnected with a girl (F23) I was chatting to last year and we've been flirting and sending spicy pictures on instagram, meanwhile I've been talking to some other people too.

The other morning we were sexting back and forth and she says ""my friend and I had a full conversation the other day about how hot you are and I knew I needed to take this picture to send to you"" and so naturally I blushed and then went ""what friend? Do I know this friend?""

Turns out that this friend is my super hot masc non-binary date for later this week (NB23). Not only did they talk about me but they were asleep on this girl's couch as we were talking.

So I go to this person's instagram and follow and am going through their pictures when I see that another queer person I'm talking to (NB22) is in their comments leaving lusty comments.

This isn't the first time either, in June I went out with a guy (M24) and then ended up going out with his most recent ex (F22) without even realizing it. Even the bisexual community is small.

I knew queer dating was a small circle but I'll be honest I didn't realize quite how small it was. And I met all these people through tinder haha",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qpecpb/im_shocked_by_the_amount_of_mutual_connections_in/

Dears,


I (30M) have girlfriend (25F) of a few month. I have many turbulence so I apologize for document my life so much.


Lately, my girlfriend is very insisting on taking overseas trip. However, I have different schedule than she and she get annoyed when my work duty prevent me from engaging in travel. I feel like she should plan around my working instead of expect me to drop everything to join spontaneous stupidity trip. I love travel but she do not understand I have obligations.

99,qpesvc,1636381792,Calling it a day.,"Hi everyone, I've really enjoyed reading any and all advice I've seen here over the last 5 years. 

But I believe it's finally time for me to turn in. 

In a few months I'll be 30, and I never had any woman consider me attractive before despite all my best efforts to become a better, more well rounded person. 

I always wanted to someday go on a date, kiss, hold hands, something. 

It never did end up happening and I never did get any opportunity to ever do any of that with anyone. 

These past few days have been very eye opening even just reading through my reddit history as a wake up call to kinda just stop. 

I believe I'll be focusing my efforts and thoughts on productive and frankly more positive subjects other than women. 

Guess I just wanted to say thanks to everybody who ever contacted me or gave advice. Seriously appreciated more than you'll know. 

Thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qpesvc/calling_it_a_day/
