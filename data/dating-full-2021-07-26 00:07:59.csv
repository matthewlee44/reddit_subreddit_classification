We've been on the rocks for a bit because I feel like my efforts aren't being reciprocated. I plan and pay for dates; she just has to get dressed and get in the car. I keep both of our apartments clean. When I spend time with her, I ensure there is nothing to distract me from her. When she's upset, I either listen or actively provide solutions (every venting session is different). Recently she's been looking to get a second job, so I helped her revamp her resume, prep for interviews, and even spent some of my free time applying for jobs on her behalf. I shower her with compliments, tell her often that I love her, and give her as many hugs/kisses as humanly possible. On one hand, I don't feel like I'm doing a lot for her because these are all things that make her happy or feed into her in some other way, so I really don't mind doing it. I often find myself caring for her naturally because I just want to see her smile. It's like second nature to do things that I know will make her day a little better. On the other hand, I feel like I'm doing a lot. I don't want to be one of those people that does something nice and asks what they get in return, but....ya know? While she is a priority to me, I think I'm more of an afterthought to her.

I took my frustrations to her recently and told her how I felt like she wasn't trying, and she asked me how I'd like to be treated. My first point was that I'd like her to be more intimate and physical (through hugs and cuddling or whatever, not sex), and she said she wasn't that kind of person. I also asked for more words of affirmation, and she said *again* that she wasn't that kind of person. She said she'd work on it and that I'd have to be more patient until she was more comfortable. (Side note: she has no problem eating me out or being sexual, but hugs are simply *far* too much for her???). I asked for her to start planning/paying for dates and helping around the house, and she said she wasn't the best at planning, she's not in the best financial situation to start paying, and she works so much that it can be difficult to muster the energy to help clean. She's asked me to come up with other ways that I'd like to be treated, but I'm clean out of ideas. It seems like she's uncomfortable with everything I'm asking for, but I don't have any other things that I'd like that would be a decent compromise.

I guess my actual question is: how would I like to be treated? Does anyone have ideas on what I can ask her to do to make me feel like I'm more of a priority?

Now that I‚Äôm 28, I‚Äôm a little more aware. 

Having said that, here‚Äôs some backstory: 
Started seeing this guy (37) who I bonded with immediately. We were definitely on the same page and expressed a sense of comfortability with the other person we haven‚Äôt really experienced before. Talked about marriage, kids and values a lot so we knew we were both looking to pursue something serious. Unfortunately he lives 3hrs away, but would come back home (where I live) pretty frequently because of family. A little over a month into dating, his mother, who he‚Äôs very close with, got sick. I of course offered support. He kept me updated pretty often about what was going on with her, but the worse her condition got the more distant and scattered he became, which was understandable. I continued to offer any support I could from a distance since we couldn‚Äôt really see each other. 

In the end, his mom ended up passing away pretty unexpectedly since she wasn‚Äôt responding to the chemo. This all went down within the span of 6 months. During all of this we also talked a lot about me moving to where he is because I actually really enjoy the town he‚Äôs in. So there was an insane amount going on. Currently I‚Äôm just waiting to buy a house, but it‚Äôs slim pickings right now. 

Anyway about a month after his mom passed, I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in a couple weeks so I reached out just to offer my support and let him know I was thinking about him. It was a short, difficult, but reasonable conversation that essentially ended with a goodbye for now. What I got out of it was he is understandably not in the right headspace to begin a relationship with anyone. I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be an appropriate time either. 

There was an implication that he still wants to see me, we just don‚Äôt know when. I guess it‚Äôs just hard having feelings for someone when things are so up in the air and not being able to see them. I also can‚Äôt directly ask him to define things because I feel like it would be insensitive given all he‚Äôs been through. I know he needs time to process, but I‚Äôm having a hard time figuring out how to cope.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,918986,public,self,"I‚Äôm hung up on a non-relationship, but it‚Äôs a bit more complicated.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ornjz8/im_hung_up_on_a_nonrelationship_but_its_a_bit/,all_ads,6,,,,

We dated for nine months in total and we had a very positive and fulfilling relationship, there were just too many differences in values to make it long term. We broke up immediately after realizing this as we decided it would be better to salvage a friendship out of it rather than drag it out until we hated each other. Our break up wasn't rocky but we had our fair share of meltdowns and calling each other for support. The last time we did this was about two weeks ago, he (25M) and I (22F) decided we had to stop otherwise we would never move on. I encouraged him to go see other people and I would do the same despite how wrong it felt in the moment. I was visiting my family in Canada at the time (I live in Chicago) so it was kind of the perfect time to dip my toes in the dating game again without any kind of real commitment. I decided to download tinder and ended up matching with this guy named Riz. Riz is exactly my type and I was immediately attracted to him. We went on a date the next day and despite both of us saying we weren't looking for anything serious we hit it off and mutually agreed this could go somewhere. I've since left Canada and have been back in Chicago for about a week now. We have called, facetimed, and texted every day since then and our feelings are growing stronger. Despite all of this, I can't help but feel a little guilty. While nine months really isn't that long in the grand scheme of things I'm not the type to hop from one relationship to another. I was my ex's first love and I know that even though we are broken up it would hurt him to see me with someone else. I care about him so much that it would hurt to see him hurt. I'm having a hard time dealing with all of this and there is a part of me that feels like three months is too soon but I really like Riz and want to give it a fair shot I just feel guilty. Do you think that three months is too soon or is it an appropriate amount of time? If things get any more serious I would have to tell my ex (we agreed that we would tell the other one if things got serious with someone else) and just the thought of that gives me insane anxiety.

I guess I'm not a ""text everyday"" type person, and I dont know how to handle this. I‚Äôd rather talk in person. I dont know how to get deeper over text.

I never thought i could keep something up like this...pandemic has changed that. It's been 1.5 years and we are still going. I'm not used to distance, but he's better at it and likes to text. 

When i was younger, i felt like i used to text guys I was seeing SO much that i would have nothing to left to say in person. So i have this mentality, years later, that it's better to use texting to make plans and thats it. But it's a different situation if we are apart, and I forget how to have those crazy long conversations anymore. But i feel like he wants to, and i get stressed now if the conversation doesnt last.

We have a few nerdy interests in common, they are things that really help me feel like myself.  Sometimes that's what's carried the conversation, or sexting.

He's trying not to get separated from his band who are in Perth with him, but he also has his best friend here in Melbourne and wants to come back. I think its even more tedious, cause its been a few times where we thought he would come here, but pandemic stopped it. We are in Aus, so borders closed or someone gets stuck in lockdown. I'm in lockdown right now. There have been a few months in a row where I was like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I'll talk to him in person later this month!‚Äù but then NOPE more cases came up....more texting...again. Aug was looking like the next date he could come, but not with this current outbreak in Vic. He's supposed to come to play a show, but even if we are out of lockdown, the venue restrictions are gonna mean his show is getting postponed again.

He made a comment at me insinuating that texting was short or something, or maybe that there was a break for a week. I know he wasnt taking a stab, but it really got to me. I'm stressing about my communication.

Does he think we can‚Äôt talk about anything? Does he think i cant get deep? I thought I WAS talking. Now I'm afraid it's only sex that Im able to keep up over text. Sexting is easier, but chatting I hold back a lot. But it hasnt been nothing at the same time. This is messing with me. Sometimes when i reach out, he'll continue later the same day, or the next day. But when its my turn to initiate, I still leave it a few more days. I dont know, I get afraid my day was too boring to talk about, I  literally do nothing, it's lockdown...

I also still have a lot of hard stuff going on mentally, and i withdraw when that happens. Texting is hard to do when i feel like that. And its not because I dont want to talk. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm so fucking anxious and distance is hard.

We've had a big chat about it before. Earlier this year, I actually had a freakout because I didnt know whether I could trust he wasnt a fuckboy (I didnt say it like that), and it turned out he was really upset that I felt hurt. (I got him on the phone for it, so I could really hear the tone)

He even said at that point things like ‚Äúi feel like this has brought us closer‚Äù and ‚Äúyou need to tell me, dont let things build up!‚Äù - really understanding and nice things. This is when he told me he loves texting. But I still feel like this stuff is easier in person. Ever since then, he admits sometimes when he's not having the best day. It feels like we are kind of honest, but it's a mess over text cause it's hard for me to get deeper. In the first few months we were talking, he was so happy go lucky and saying he was going good all the time. (He still has such a nice presence, he has this positive energy about him).

it was sort of revealed that he was kind of doing what he thought was what i want. I think he really does try and take notice of things. But I am still overthinking, thinking that when theres a break he remembers im crazy and hes getting distant himself and he's changed his mind.

I dont know whether its really just that i still have shit going on, or are our styles incompatible? I feel like maybe I should bring it up and thats why i can get distant, but I dont know how again. I dont know if i should keep bringing it up? I dont know why i am still holding back even though he said he wants to talk.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,919026,public,self,Texting/communicating long distance,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oro2lg/textingcommunicating_long_distance/,all_ads,6,,,,

Last relationship ended at the start of this year. No success since then with online dating beyond some first dates and calls with a few women, and no options IRL (no women my age at church, working from my flat, small social circle of single guys). Not sure where to go from here. What would you do in my situation?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25M from the UK, looking for advice on how to move forward with dating. For some background: I'm a Catholic looking for an LTR, and hopefully marriage and kids; I want to be a husband and a dad someday! I'm also doing well for myself, so I've got the material means to make this happen. What I'm looking for is shared values, so I'm not worrying about finding ""the perfect Catholic girl"" or whatever; if we're on the same page values- and life-goals wise (and they're roughly my age. and in the UK), any faith or none is fine by me.

Ideally I'd meet someone new through friends or church, but all my mates are single guys with few/no female friends, and all the women at my church (and the others I've been to with travelling the country for work) are kids, married, or elderly! Through work's also not an option, as we're still mostly remote with the current global situation (and tryna date colleagues/their friends is a whole other minefield...)

So I've been trying online dating. Some faith-based sites/apps (like CatholicMatch and Salt), and some regular (like Hinge, Bumble, Coffee Meets Bagel, etc.). I've read up on how to put profiles together, taken time to get good pictures, put a lot of thought into selling myself, and trying to write good messages. But after six months I've been ignored/ghosted by 99%, and not got beyond a second date/call with the 1%. Fair enough, I'm not the best looking guy, but after trying so hard for so long it's really demoralising. On the faith side things're even more difficult because I disagree with the Church's teaching on contraception (i.e.: I think condoms are OK for family planning), which is an automatic deal-breaker for the few Catholic women I've managed to have a conversation with. Online dating overall just feels crap. A post in r/CatholicDating hit me: it was about how dating should feel fun and spontaneous. It just feels like tryna find a job in a bad economy. I'd love to get off the sites and apps and cancel the subscriptions but, with no options IRL, I feel like I'd be cutting myself off completely.

So I feel stuck. This situation's been dragging on since after my last relationship ended at the start of this year, and it's getting to me.

I have been texting with a guy for around 1 month and a half. We have never seen each other before because we live 3 hours away.

We didn't kiss or anything.
When he dropped me home I proposed him to meet today aswell. He payed for yesterday's coffee so I told him it was my turn today.
He told me he would meet his friends to drink alcohol and play games until 6 am, and he would get up late. He said he would text me when he wakes up so we can meet.
Today he texted and said he had a bad hangover and that we couldn't meet because he was feeling sick. He said he was sorry that he wanted it to be different, and that the next time I come to his city he would take me out and that ge hopes I keep texting him. 
I leave tomorrow and I frankly don't come to this place too much, and I'm a little disappointed we couldn't meet today.
I'm not sure he gonna go to see me to my city or not (mostly because we don't have a bond yet), he lives in a big and beautiful place and everyone comes here for vacation. My city is not very popular, and I don't know if we gonna meet again if I don't come here.

What's a good way to break it to people that I'm probably much older than they likely think I am? I am age 32 male but look 23ish. It's like it catches people off guard. Idc if it catches coworkers, new friends or etc off guard, but I do for potential dates. I'm invisible to girls my own age, or get laughed at in my face ""HAHAAA YOU'RE 32?? LOL"" and then they usually kinda go away. Girls that get flirty/giggly toward me are typically age 16-22 and usually stop the instant they hear my age, which is maybe for the better cause I'm not so into girls THAT young, especially not jailbait. They often act like I lied to them or deceived them, even though I do nothing what-so-ever to hide or manipulate my age.

I've also been told by multiple people that I'm going to like looking young. What am I going to like about it? Cause I'm not seeing any pros to it so far.

I like all sorts of music from pop, to country, to foreign, to several opera music. Lately I just found Andrea Bocelli and Im really enjoying all his songs, his genre, and looking more into opera-ish music (minus the high pitch notes). My dream date is to go on one occasion to a symphony wearing sophisticated attire and be completely entrassed in the music followed by a stroll holding hands with my date. 

Im the black sheep of the majority of public conversations I have with peers my own age. I find it meaningless to talk about boys we like bc my peer group likes to ask the ""what ifs"" instead actually making an effort to approach a guy. I find discussions around boys tiring because they ultimately never do what they say they will or walk up to a person. I much prefer talking about real life goals. I dont like talking about parties where the goal is to get drunk and make out with random people (I am not judging at all, but its simply not my cup of tea). I find pop culture to be extremely fake and depressing. I dont need instant gratification with anything. Going along with the pop culture, I always think abstractly and offer a different point of view in a discussion even one I disagree with because I would like to see dialogue and peoples opinion. I love service and volunteering. I have principles and stick to my personal values. But more than anything, I love to learn in and out of the classroom. I love excelling in a math concept or learning from a social interaction what I could have done better. All this I think about on a daily basis on how I can improve my personal self. 

The problem, however, is that most dudes my age are man children. I hate childish behavior, especially in a professional environment in which I see the youth of their age seep into their professional life. I would like to have a guy who is mature, open, easy to please with activities, kind, caring, sophisticated, outdoorsy, principled, determined, driven or simply just find a man who will be open to go on dates that deviate from the clich√© theatre or restaurant (bonus points if he is romantic). All of this becomes a struggle further as physical attraction matters too. Can I really find a buff, gym going man who likes to try out going to a symphony at least ones too? 

Are my standards too high? I find my life to be unhappiest when I pretend to shape myself to what a stereotypical teenager my age would act like, but faking it is tiring and im done with it.

At one point, she asked me to UNTAG her from a family Facebook album, which I refused and she let it go.

Even though we parted ways amicably, she initiated the breakup (citing mental health issues and the fact she was only a few months out of a LTR when we started dating.)

My friends would jokingly tease me and say she was 'out of my league' (she's what would be considered the top 1% of attractive - fit, exotic, beautiful, smart) whereas I am 5'5 with an ok face.

Fast forward a year later - she's dating a new guy. He is ALL over her social media, met her parents within months and she is extremely affectionate with him in public (we have the same social circle so often see each other at social events.) The guy she dated before me also was treated in a similar fashion.

I guess the reason I'm asking is I feel like I was treated differently in the relationship because of what I look like. The only major difference I see between this guy and me is his height. He is 6'3, conventionally attractive.

I feel like I'm spiraling. Since we broke up, I've had ZERO success on dating apps, whereas she moved on so fast and seems happier than ever. It's hard for me to not immediately blame my looks.

The amount of raw loathing at worst and apathy at best I read here regarding ethnic men is really astounding.

We start off pretty mildly, I introduce myself and start asking about her. She doesn't talk too much, but doesn't seem bothered by having a chat. After a while I notice that I've been asking about herself and carrying the whole conversation from the beginning, while she hasn't asked me a single question. All she knew about me was in my first introductory sentence and she didn't seem interested in asking, or most likely didn't realize, even when I told her ""I am going to finish my questions soon, next I'm gonna ask about pets, you might want to ask me something"". She didn't get the joke but started talking about her parents getting a labrador after she moved out. 

I was puzzled at her behaviour, but continued talking to find out more. I asked about relationships and here is when shit unfolded. She started talking about how she is single because she cannot find someone on her level: she has a master's degree in psychology/marketing, a prestigious job (not really, but she puts it down like this, and has been working only for little more than 1 year), and has literally tens of interestes from rafting to deep diving to anything you could think of. She wanted someone with the same academic titles and same interests since she was never home and always around for work or leisure. To which I replied that the only person with her same interest and self worth is herself. 

After this the discussion kind of died, I realized she was some sort of megalomaniac who values people's worth only on titles and thinks way too highly of herself.

I am a complicated individual, think along the lines of someone afraid to take initiative. I cannot really explain why I am like this but im guessing it has to do with my development as a kid.

Anyway, I am currently involved in a relationship with someone who is very beautiful, unselfish, and loving. This person I went through hell and back to even date. We had a serious falling out in the beginning of the relationship but ultimately ended up together a few weeks later. The only problem with this relationship is that my parents do not approve. Now I respect people's right to do whatever they choose, but I am a hispanic that comes from a very close family. Every move that I make in my relationships are heavily criticized within my immediate family. As I move in to my mid 20's, I see my american friends doing what they want whether its good or bad and their parents want them to experience failure in order to be better.  I see that as very productive because at least I can make my own decisions and become my own man but this is only a factor of what is going on.

As of late, my relationship with my current gf has been rocky for about 3 months and we have been dating for almost 2 years against the approval of my parents. Recently, it has taken a toll on me. I find myself arguing with my parents a lot and now that I have recently graduated from a radiography program, they have been on my ass about everything I do. Probably because they care a lot about me and I understand that. However, recent experiences with girlfriends tell me nothing will change, as they have threatened me with getting kicked out of the family and not seeing my 10 month old nephew in the past. However, my current relationship has been mostly arguements about little things these last 3 months and I thought about going on break. I saw her family this weekend and felt guilty due to one particular thing.

As a radiography student, I am required to attend clinical semesters and this last semester involves 4 other students from my class (you need a certain amount of ""competencies"" so several people in my class were put in a busy hospital) and in a class of 16 people, only 3 including myself are boys so that leaves 13 women. In clinicals I recently bonded with a girl in my class and it lead to me having a crush on her. It was also obvious she was sending signals that this woman liked me and wanted to know me better as we talked about our origins and out future career aspects and i ended up falling for her. I really wish I could date her but I feel bad for my current gf as she doesnt deserve any of this. To make matters worse, I have an interview where she currently accepted a job ( she told me ) and if I get accepted there I can possibly see an affair happening. I have felt so guilty that I talked to 2 of my best friends and they said its just a phase where an average guy brain takes over your normal way of thinking. This new girl is perfect. Has goals, values, respectful, beautiful, open to cultures, and just a cute personality. Whereas my current gf uses current insecurities against me in arguements. 

I really want more opinions as my future is in stake at the moment. I am going through a life crisis at the moment and I want everybody to know I have 2 previous suicide attempts due to my crisis with my parents and yes i am in therapy, i know this stuff isnt good for me thats why im seeking help any of you cant give me. 

So I ask, should I go with new girl A, or current girl J? I only talk about this with my therapist so I wanna know more opinions no matter how hard they are, give it to me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,919653,public,self,In need of serious help,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ortuws/in_need_of_serious_help/,all_ads,6,,,,

The Nurse decided to spring her friend on us at the Last minute.  

Literally when she was 5 mins away from the bar ""Oh i have my friend with me, do you mind?""   

The entire date was awkward because she was a different person than the happy person i originally met.  Now she was aloof, quiet and kinda Mean.  I ended up conversing with her friend more.

The POF girl held the Date hostage (said she couldnt go and leave her friend) if I couldnt bring a date for her friend.  So I had to scramble to find someone last minute.

^(He said hi and walked into the Bar.  They were sitting outside at a Table.  He didnt come out until I left.)
