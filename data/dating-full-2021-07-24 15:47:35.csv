I was dating this guy for 4 months and for the most part everything was great. We got along great, always laughing together and having fun. We would hang out usually once during the week since we both worked and then all weekend Fri - Sun. There were a couple times I got upset with him because he would get distant after sex sometimes and it really bothered and triggered me. When I feel someone pull away, I tend to pull away even further. Which I know isn't healthy. Anyway, this last time everything was great Friday and Saturday. We didn't sleep together Fri bc I was on my period. Saturday I wasn't bleeding much and we started messing around. He knew I had been on it. Since I hadn't been bleeding much, I went along with it and we ended up sleeping together. The sex was very passionate and he asked me if could finish inside me and I said yes since we were in the moment. I'm not sure if this is what made me bleed but when I went to the bathroom I noticed a lot of blood. When I came back I told him and he just said ""Yeah.."" and seemed all of the sudden distant toward me. The next day I go to his place and things were fine but the end of the night he seemed distant again and just turned over and went to bed. We usually make out or have sex every time we hang out.
His sudden shift in energy made me pull back all week. We text a little Mon and Tues and then nothing Wed and Thurs. We always text everyday btw. So Friday I sent him a text asking if he was ok. He said I've been acting weird since Mon and he doesn't want to go through this again. I text him back saying the reason I was acting weird is because he got distant with me after Saturday night and I don't want to keep going through that either. He never text me back after that and ended up unfollowing me in social media. I waited a whole week then finally sent a farewell text apologizing on my part and telling him I enjoyed our time together and wish him the best and don't have any hard feelings. This was yesterday afternoon and still nothing.
I just don't see how someone can't even have the decency to respond back after 4 months of dating. Has anyone else gone through something similar? Was he that grossed out by blood?

He tells me he didnt think I would still be there, he thought I would have left earlier, and so he had made these plans with his friend. So now I feel weird because 1. Im in a hotel with this guy who I still dont know well 2. I feel im intruding now even though it was never communicated to me he had these plans 3. He’s doing acid. So I walk out, he follows me, is apologizing, etc. We end up saying goodbye and I walk to my car. And then I got more bothered that he didnt walk me to my car because It was past midnight and he didnt care for my safety. I ended up texting him something like “thanks for walking me to my car btw”. I know, very passive aggressive I shouldve just asked him to.

Anyways, I feel like I overreacted by getting upset with him about the acid thing and the walking to my car and I feel like things are ruined now.

A little bit about me, I'm 24 years old, I love to go to the beach and I love to skimboard! On here looking for advice on something that disgustingly stomped on my confidence.

I've been quite active in the hook up world not so much in the dating world(by choice). With only one relationship under my belt that lasted almost 7 months, I'd say I have a decent ""mouth piece"" as they say - if you don't know what that means it's just another way of saying ""game"". So I recently started working in a retail store and I hooked up with this cute blondie after we got out of work and after 2 days passed, we were sitting outside making out. I was a bit tipsy but fully functional. She started to point out my quirks and stated that I have a lot of quirks.... 

I disclosed to her that I'm on the spectrum (I have asperger's). After that - the vibe completely changed and she started to be extra nice to me which weirded me out and we made out a little more and we both got a little tired so we parted ways. So when got home and for some reason she really wanted me to text her saying I got home safe since she was punctual about it last time and I didn't do it. I texted her that I got home and the little typing emoji thingy showed next to her name and she was typing for quite a while...

When I finally received a message from her, she sent a long paragraph text and to keep it short she basically said that she couldn't be with me in a sexual way because ""common knowledge is that with autistic people they cannot fully consent to sexual activities"" as she said....

I'm typically a type of guy to shake off any mean jokes or insults pretty easily or even say something witty back. I've gotten rejected by many women, but I've also hooked up with many women.

I come here to this sub humbled.

 But in all honesty I think this one stung pretty badly and I would really appreciate any sincere advice.

I think he felt the same way, plus he doesn’t go out much and is very focused on his career. 
These past years, we would constantly talk on Snapchat and I got to know him more and more, and I started to like him A LOT. Since two year ago we became closer because we were in similar stages of life (recent college grads, applying for jobs, getting in the stock market, dealing with becoming adults, etc).. He ended up accepting a job offer about a year ago in the city I live but because of COVID we was working remotely. Three months ago he finally got a lease here and he invited me to go to his house in multiple occasions but I never could. 
Two weeks ago I finally went over and it went SO well, we talked for hours, had a few drinks, and I got a good feeling about us. I ended up staying the night, we had sex, overall everything was good.. but ever since we have spoken twice and both times I initiated the conversation. I was expecting him to talk to me this past weekend, but nothing… and I’m getting a bad feeling as we would normally talk throughout the week. 
My friends say that I would have waited to have sex with him, as it looks like he lost interest in me… so idk what to do now. He mentioned getting food the next time we hangout, but it’s been two weeks ñ and I’m getting zero vibes from him now. 
A side note is that I accepted a job offer in a different state that’s 9 hours from here, but I still have a month and a half before I leave, so I thought about spending that time with him.

He found my socials and DMed me, and almost immediately asked for my Snapchat. I realize he probably does it with many girls.

We started talking, and we both acknowledged we were overseas. I understood this is just for fun to chat and get to know someone.

However, things turned out worse. He was very flirty, we vibed and having similar interests and such made it seem like we would be so compatible. He also teased me about stuff how he’d love to take me on a date and we actually planned our dream date together and mentioned it often to each other.

I started getting quite attached - whether he’s responded to me, what will he respond etc. He seemed very keen on getting to know me too.

Now - after a month of chatting, he suddenly got distant and left me on read after our last convo. He usually texts me goodmorning every day but not today. I’ve come in terms with this ending now. _I totally understand_ that this thing **cannot** lead anywhere bc of our distance, and it was supposed to be just a fun flirting experience and getting to know a foreign guy, but now I’m feeling sad and bit hurt.

It is widely recognized and hotly debated that taller men are selected over their shorter brethren by women online and even irl and that shorter men have to compensate for not being tall by being successful in other parts of their lives at minimum to be considered. 
 
Does the superficial standards imposed by women over height worry or make taller men more cautious in who you select in a long term partner? Especially in instances where the woman is 5’3 or less and only wants men 6 ft and above to match with? Or has this thought never crossed your mind and you are just happy that women like you for whatever reason enough to talk to you?

We have a third date planned for next Wednesday. 

When I reached out to her a few days ago and suggested my idea she couldn't do the day I suggested, but she did suggest an alternative day which I think is a good sign. 

I don't remember our communication patterns when we first started talking. But lately (maybe last 2 weeks) our contact has dialed down. 

She reaches out maybe every now and then now, versus when she would FaceTime me and text me first fairly often. We also used to have a really long streak on Snapchat but that got broken too. 

I made plans with her 3 days ago for next week. She doesn't leave me on read a lot, and at times if I'm busy and she sends me a message that doesn't warrant a response I won't reply either. 

She's still responsive, and she never gives 1 word replies or anything like that. She'll talk as if nothing changed, but the communication pattern change is obvious. I feel like our conversations end earlier and she will randomly not reply mid conversation. When this happens I'll go 1-2 days if no contact before reaching out again. 

I feel like I have been having to make the first move ever since our last date. She is responsive though and accepted my date plans I made 3 days ago. 

She's 20, and I'm 23. We have made out on every date so far and it's gotten pretty intense. Lip biting, shirt tugging, etc. she told me she isn't ready for sex so if it happens on this next date cool, I'm just going to go with the flow. 

I'm worried about the less contact. Yesterday I sent a mass snap to all my streaks/top friends last night including her and she opened it and didn't reply. Her and I had talked earlier in the day and I forgot to reply to her last message she sent me. I sent the mass snap late last night and she opened it this morning. 

I've never double texted or shown her any signs of neediness or anything like that. I'm just noticing this pattern/routine change.

I \[F20\] have had a tinder account for some time now but I don't really go on dates with random people for personal reasons. A few weeks ago I stumbled upon someone \[M20\] who I used to know growing up.

We went to primary and middle school together and these years weren't the best for me. I was depressed, reserved and very insecure. I wanted to fit in every social circle but somehow that made me less likeable. We live in a small town so I knew people talked behind my back. The guy and I didn't have a great friendship as well - he never exactly bullied me, but he did insult, humiliate and make fun of me plenty of times. As to the girls he liked, I knew one of them - confident, outspoken, straight-up rude and my worst enemy growing up. That's why I was shocked he had a crush on me when we were 15. I knew about everything from my best friend, his cousin. He was always a bit mean and a lot immature.

Back then I was going through my first heartbreak, I loved a girl that didn't want me back, so I was trying to open my heart up for new possibilities. We started hanging out and he turned out to be a sweet, friendly person.That's when the problems started though. I was extra careful about pursuing a friendship with him. I believe in human kindness and he was the definition of my least favourite person - racist, homophobic, transphobic and the list just goes on. I was known as the big bad atheist-feminist-equality-preaching-bisexual-weird kid so there was a moral conflict. I didn't have the time to consider it though. He told my best friend that he no longer wants to try courting me because... I used to like a girl and he just couldn't accept that. I was disappointed and angry. As we finished middle school, we couldn't even talk without arguing. Safe to say, we were never even close to being friends.

Fast forward to now, I decided to swipe right on him to see if he did it as well. It was never meant to be serious, but we did end up matching. None of us texted the other. He followed me on instagram some time ago and he's usually one of the first ones to see my story, so I'm pretty sure he's interested again after 5 years. I'm curious as to what kind of a person he is today and if he grew out of his bigotry. I don't want to step into a serious relationship but I'd definitely like to get to know him better. I'm worried about texting him first though. I feel like he should be the one to reach out, after all sadness and embarassment I had to go through because of him. On the other hand, he might feel like he did his first step by following me, so he's the one waiting.

Clearly, it doesn't apply to everyone.

I was considering that it's possible that heterosexual men have a slightly different perspective when it comes to dating due to the availability of women.

As we know, it seems women are spoilt for options so I think there is more of a sense of urgency on narrowing things down and not wanting to string people along. I think a lot of us want to figure out what is happening and label things pretty early because if it's not working out or leading somewhere we would like, then we want to cut our losses and move onto the next one since we usually can fairly easily. I find myself thinking, is it worth it to see where this goes and put other people on the back burner or stop dating at all while I explore this? How long should I put off dates with others for?

For men on the other hand, I feel like sometimes they have less choices and options so they can be more inclined to just ""see where something goes"" and spend like weeks or months figuring it out. It's not like they have a list of women they can be going out with so they'll just ride this wave and wait for the next one, if need be. Obviously this is a bit different if the woman is just absolutely terrible, but I've seen men pretty much settle for a woman as well just because that's pretty much the only one who's shown interest in a long time.

I'm recently single for about a month now and I want to try dipping my toes into the water. There's this customer who comes in-- really cute guy, tall, beard, a little pudgy/thick, just the way I like em'. He is 31. One of my friends is dating his younger brother and she suggested that I try talking to the older one. She said ""he's gorg, you're gorg, you should talk to him"", and she said he is very shy, quiet, comes from a good family in town, goes to work, comes home and goes in his room to watch TV or play video games. That sounds a lot like me lol, I thought we would have vibed over sharing similar interests, but we did not.. 

He came into the store yesterday and I thought in my head ""fuck it"". I told him that I think he is really cute, but I feel weird because he's this gorgeous guy and I'm just this dorky girl, and asked if he wanted to trade numbers. He asked for my phone at first, then he wrote his number on a piece of paper. I was ecstatic! Until I got off work and started texting him. He is SO dry and VERY short. I kept asking him questions trying to get to know him, he did not ask me any questions other than one; he asked me where do I stay, I told him I live at home with the parents. He lives with his mom and dad, too (so it's not like he can judge me for that). The whole time I texted him I felt like I was bothering him. I texted my friend and she assured me that he is interested and to just keep asking him questions. 🤨 

I was just like... ok... I said goodnight to him and haven't heard back. I'm not texting back. Not going to lie, I feel a tiny bit frustrated. Now it's going to be awkward when he comes into the store. Great.

I'm a virgin. I've tried to meet men in the past. Used dating apps. Met some at parties. I KNOW that not all men are creeps. But...I'll say I'm scarred by some experiences. Men I've gone on dates with have initiated kissing/making out and in many cases they'd escalate that to aggressive touching and make it clear they wanted sex. I'd politely tell them I really like them but I'd want to know them better before getting there. I didn't want to have sex on the first date. But they'd still try and persist. Even excessive fondling on the first date turns me off. I'd rather get to know a person and see if there's even potential for something long term before all that. But many men have been aggressive in pushing for fondling and sex. One guy even pleaded with me to let him touch me -after I said it wasn't okay with me-and when I apparently cringed he called me out on it. 

As a result, I'm now intimidated by simple things like kissing someone who isn't a boyfriend yet because so many times in the past it's led to this. But I know that this will inevitably get in the way of ever finding a relationship.

But!

Today, I was hanging out at his place again and he said ""it might seem like we aren't going anywhere, since I haven't initiated sex yet, but you must know I like you. I am saying this because it feels like I'm wasting your time, since you're not dating anyone.""

Um, what?! 

When I asked him if he is dating other women he's said ""no I am not. But if I'll be open to dating other women? I don't know atm"". 

I obviously ask him to explain, he's like that's all, no hidden meanings I just said what came to my mind.

I live in very rual parts of my country. I m a son of a farmer and work on the farm of my dad. I have a very hard time finding dates locally(in my area live like 3 women who are in my age group +-5 years) and on dating apps. I had a few matches (25) but most of them unmatched me after finding out I was a farmer (even tho it was in my bio).

I m not exactly very good looking, rather towards bad. I m 18, male and 6""7. Most of my time I spend on the farm or doing hobbies like playing with my pets, Games or tennis and going hiking. I also love going into clubs and parties. Farmer parties are also great!

Most of my chats are like this: 

M --&gt; me

F --&gt; her/them

-- --&gt; comment


F: hi, how are you?

M: hey, I m fine, how are you doing?

F: also fine, what are you doing in your life? 
-- this can be different sometimes I ask them what they are doing etc.

M: I m a farmer, my hobbies are playing with my pets, playing tennis and going hiking. What are you doing in your life?

Most of the time they dont write back or tell me they are no longer interrested

I dont know what to do anymore, its just too much, I cant believe so many women are turned down by my job, which has nothing to do with my personality or my hobbies.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird. 

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn’t... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest.

I (18F) have had a connection with a guy (19M) since we were in high school. We used to talk and hang out and We had a connection that neither of us felt before, but he backed out because it wasn’t me, but his own internal conflict. He wouldn’t say why. We tried one more time a year later but he restated the same thing. We’ve felt the same thing for the last couple years, even though we’d talk and then not talk for months on end. Yesterday he decided to text me happy birthday after almost 2 years of not speaking. We caught up and had some really deep conversations and he finally expressed to me that he’s emotionally inconsistent, which I respect and understand because I too have some commitment issues that I struggle with. He told me he misses us and wants to keep in touch and I agreed to this. I’ve always worried about how he is from a distance so the fact that he said he actually felt happy that we were speaking was surprising to me. It’s the next day, and we haven’t talked yet.  I don’t want to reach out first because that’s what I used to do and it obviously wasn’t a good approach. Do I wait for him to make contact first because I don’t wanna disrespect him or potentially ruin anything. It’s been pretty complicated for the past 3 years, and I’m still really young so I wanna make it clear that I’m not in love or think HES the one or any of that. He’s a good one though and I’m making a decision to give this a chance but be a little emotionally detached because I refuse to get hurt again. 

Could someone please advise me on how I could approach this situation? It would be a little weird if we just randomly don’t talk again for a few years lol. For now I’m not making a first move to contact him today but I desperately need another opinion. This feels like a situationship lol

More details than last time and filled in some blanks from my diary.

Not going to go into too much detail about how I ended up there but I was hospitalized for about 9 months after a proper mental breakdown. It was a place where we were focused on recovery so it was after the emergency stuff.

So we were about 10 patients and a lot of staff at a 24/7 facility. At first I was just too ill to really socialize. After maybe 2 weeks when I was a little more used to the place, one of the staff asked if I had seen this girl yet.

I had to admit that I haven't seen her. The nurse,my main contact, a Latina in her 50s said that it was the pretty one. I had no idea until a few days later when my contact introduced me to her. She was indeed pretty and seemed healthier than the other patients.

She seemed somewhat cold at first and I didn't really try to get to know her. Just assumed she wasnt interested in talking. But at the hospital we had a lot of activities so eventually most of the patients were talking to each others.

I think she started talking to me out of boredom after a couple weeks. I realized we had a lot to talk about and we actually got quite a lot in common. She was 23 at the time and I was 25. So we often just sat around in the living room talking for hours every day.

I started crushing on her a few weeks after that. So I tried to find ways of flirting with her without making it too obvious. So in the beginning we often sat together when going on a road trip etc. She flirted back eventually and we were basically together but I never kissed her. It wasn't really socially accepted.

We watched a lot of Tv shows and talked. Our favorite show was catfish. I cant say exactly when we started flirting but it clicked right away. It started with her asking if I wanted a cup of tea and our hands briefly touched. We started doing this quite often. Her favorite was Vanilla and I preferred mint.

She started asking me a lot of very deep and direct questions. What I would do if I had all the money in the world, if I was the only person left in the world and so on. She was an extrovert and I was more of an introvert but with her, conversations were just easy. We could talk about anything for hours and we had a similar sense of humor.

The staff often told me that what we had was special and that I needed to stay in touch with her after I left the hospital. I thought I had found a girl that I could stay with indefinitely.

We always sat at the same table during meals. Also some of the staff liked to join us. I remember how nervous I was when I asked her to play Mario Cart. I had no idea if she liked video games but she did and told me she used to play Skyrim. Her laughter when I touched her arm the first time after I lost. I fell in love with that laugh and it was one of the most memorable moments when I realized she was just as into me as I was into her.

She was also a good singer so we played sing star a few times. I wasn't the best but she enjoyed it a lot, and I appreciated her talent. And there was a painting room at the hospital. She was very good at painting. She went to arts school before she was hospitalized. And we often had group therapy sessions where we tried to paint something based on a theme.

She eventually left the hospital after staying there for 4 years. The time we got together wasnt too much. 2-3 months maybe. I stayed for 6 more months after that and I lost contact with her completely.  I never forgot about her although my crush for her gradually dissipated.

So when I finally got out of the hospital I realized I still got her number and wanted to check in on her. I called her. I told her my sister just bought an apartment in her city and that I was in town for the weekend if she wanted to meet.

So we met up and things went pretty well. We met several times a week for a few weeks and seemed to never run out of things to talk about.  I eventually asked her if we could be together and she rejected me at first. She told me she wasnt ready and to be honest I wasnt really ready myself.

So we stayed friends for the next 3 years. The spark between us was always there and we met around 10 hours a week almost every week during that time.  We were basically in a relationship even though we never took any serious steps.

And it was long distance so we couldn't meet every day. It was just during weekends mostly. And we both had abandonment issues so we had a somewhat dysfunctional relationship. It was nice despite all of that. None of us were ready for a sexual relationship. We were somewhat intimate but it were mostly an emotional connection.

So we watched each others grow over those several years. We both got better and better for each passing month. She eventually got a dog and two birds. I got myself a cat. She bought an apartment next to my sisters apartment so they became neighbors. They also became good friends.   Eventually she started referring to our meetings as dates instead of just hanging out. We started sharing drink and food

Eventually she started referring to our meetings as dates instead of just hanging out. We started sharing drinks and food. We started holding hands and talked about future plans. She invited me to sleep over once her apartment is ready.

I started visiting my sister quite often. My sister was often out of town too so I had the keys to her apartment. So I met my girlfriend (I would say), more and more often over the next months. Usually Friday-Sunday was the best I could do and we could go on 10 hour long dates.

It was still somewhat dysfunctional. She could have episodes where she didn't answer my texts for 7 days while lying in her bed crying all day. Dating me was stressful for her. It was stressful for me too but over time we came to understand each others illnesses better.

I visited her city this week. She was a little ill and hard to communicate with the first two days. But it got better and better. We have known each others for 4 years now and we haven't kissed.

We went buying some bubble tea. I touched her neck and massaged her for a few seconds. She asked me if I could give her a massage and I said ""maybe later"". I asked her to show me some dance moves and she did some bailey. She was a bailey dancer when she was younger.

I showed her some martial arts moves but it was mostly just an excuse to touch her. I had both my hands on her face and she did the same thing to me just to see if this trick of mine worked.  Then we walked for an hour or so trough a park. I have learned that I need to make her stop up every now and then and sit down or she will just get stressed and walk on forever.

After a little while I gave her that back massage she asked for earlier.  She got stressed out after a few minutes and wanted to walk again. So we walked a little more before sitting down under a tall tree. I laid down on the grass and asked her if she had heard this new version of the song ""Begging"".

So we laid there for a little while listening to my Spotify. Then I asked her if I could take a personality test on her to figure out what personality she was in Lucifer (a very good show btw). The test took about 10 minutes and she turned out to be an ENFP which was the Goddess of all creation. I on the other hand scored as an INFJ or Maze, Lucifers demon bartender.

I followed her home and we were about to part but I asked her how she was doing with her apartment so she invited me in to have a look. She showed me around her apartment and told me it was almost done. She just needed a kitchen.

We sat on her couch for half an hour or so and just relaxed. When I left, I expected that to be it for now but she told me that she needed to relax for a few hours and that maybe we could meet up later tonight.

2 hours or so later at around 9pm we met up again and went for a pretty long walk. It was still hot outside despite it getting late. We eventually got to a lake and she suggested we test the temperature. So we took our shoes off and sat there talking about reincarnation for a little while. A few fish and some ducks were swimming around and we were all alone.

She asked me if I wanted to go for a swim and I hesitated at first.  I told her that she had to go first. She hesitated as well and contemplated it for a good 10 minutes before she stripped off her clothes and jumped in.  I did the same thing.

It was the perfect moment to kiss her. I held her face and touched her lips. Behind us came a bunch of guys and she pulled away. A little ashamed we got out of the pond and we had no extra clothes.  The walk back was around an hour and we held hands a few times.

None of us were dressed for a bath really so we looked like two half drowned cats while walking back home. We were back at around midnight. It was getting dark outside and we were standing under the full moon.

I pulled her close with my hands on her waist. I then leaned in. She just smiled back at me. I went for the kiss and we kissed for maybe a minute.

I've never posted on this subreddit and never expected to right now since I haven't done any dating in so long. The situation with person I am seeing hit me like a brick wall out of nowhere and though it is absolutely amazing, it is really conflicting and I am not sure what to do about it.

I'm 19M and seeing 18F, and her and I are INCREDIBLY similar. We met at work two years prior, and for personal reasons on her end we didn't speak for the second year of that period. All is fine, and I am very understanding of personal situations. We reconnected and at this point we were both single! We met up and it was absolutely amazing. Of course, we met as friends and I didn't expect things to become romantic. We've always been very attracted to each other but we never really mentioned it (especially because before this we were both in other, less-than-healthy relationships; we were naive kids).

Now, she has told me a few times she doesn't know what she is looking for, and is still recovering from her recently-finished relationship (her ex is still being toxic and all that jazz, and I wish it were my place to help her with those things but I don't know him and it would be not a good idea to step in). I totally respect that and I care a lot about her as a friend whether or not things turn out to stay romantic between us. She means the world to me. On our second time meeting up (and we had been texting every day with each other, catching up like crazy), with a little flirting, we both confessed to having feelings for each other. Great! This made me feel amazing. I felt so happy that she felt the same.

The next week or so goes on and we begin flirting heavily, and we both can't keep our minds off of each other. Admittedly, I began to struggle with productivity because of how much I was thinking about her. Not my finest hour. Anyways, we saw each other a third time and this time it was at her place. I made a move and kissed her. That turned into a lot of released tension between us and it was great! Before the fact we had set both our boundaries on what was okay and what wasn't, because communication is VERY important to us. We went as far as we both were comfortable with (making out) and that was really fun! Obviously I won't get into the details of it, but we were now even more into each other. It also helps to know that we we're learning a LOT about each other on a deeper level. I find personality and someone's passions very attractive, so learning about her hobbies and aspirations has been absolutely amazing. She loves to listen to me talk about mine as well.

At this point we are doing things that couples do. We go on dates, we flirt all the time, we vent to each other when need be, we schedule a meet up right after finishing one, hold hands, kiss, etc. (basic new honeymoon-phase relationship stuff). We just saw each other today and by this point even though I tried as hard as I could not to, I've caught some serious feelings for her. From the day we confessed to each other I deleted dating apps and stopped entertaining anyone else romantically because I was so invested in this possibility. She even told me she wasn't interested in entertaining anyone else either. So we are even exclusive, to my knowledge! She told me she is worried about hurting me; she's still recovering and doesn't know what will happen if she is in a relationship so soon. I totally get that and support her wholeheartedly. Her feelings are hers and I want to be there for her no matter what she is feeling.

My biggest problem is this: I feel incredibly conflicted and confused with this situation. I've never done something like this and felt ""casual."" We cuddle, we kiss, we talk about deep things with each other, we are comfortable around each other, and the list goes on. We are practically the basic definition of a new couple. We see some aspects of dating a bit differently and that's okay, but I'm struggling not to feel a little melancholy about the situation. How do I get my mind off of her? How do I stop myself from getting too invested to the point of balancing my wants over her needs? Is this a normal way to feel? Am I being selfish by wishing she would want to be in a relationship? I know she wants to wait and I totally respect that and would 100% wait for her even if it takes a toll on me, but is it bad that I wish I didn't have to wait? And is it bad that I do small things for her like buy her her favourite candy when she's having a bad day and drop it off at her place?

And a side note, we are both super into plants and so I was at the store and saw these orchids that looked like her hair colour, and I instantly thought of her so I kind of impulse bought them for her and gave them to her today (she's been having a rough time as of late). She told me it was super sweet and she loves them but was that overkill? She told me it wasn't, but I don't want to be overbearing (and I feel like she might not want to tell me if it is, even though she seems just as keen as I do in perspective when she's not having a tough time).

I hope this isn't too long of a post, I just really need some guidance with this. I've been in a ton of relationships and this one feels a lot more comfortable and real. I feel totally out of my alley. Usually by now I see a major red flag, but with her I feel so confident and at peace? I don't know. She's amazing, and I just want to make her know she's special to me.

My main question is ladies have you ever stop wanting to have sex with a guy because he was nervous the 1st time you guys were together and did not perform at his 100%


Here is the situation, I'm gonna sumarize it in short sentences and paragraphs 

-met this girl on tinder on april, we saw each other 5 times 

-expect for the 1st date, all the others dates we saw each other on her house, she is 22 and lives alone 

-we had sex on the 4th date it could had happen the 3rd time but she was drunk that night, And I dont like having sex with drunk girls
-I remember since I met her I ask her what she was looking for in tinder and she said she was just bored and some friends of her told her she should join tinder that she was not looking for anything in particular.


-3rd time we saw each other was a little unexpected because we did not even plan to see each other that
night. She suddenly texted me late at night asking me to hang out with her in her house that she was out with her friends and that she was arriving soon to her house which it was true cause that night she posted some stories going out with her friends. 

-When I get to her house she was drunk laying in her couch.We started making out and went to her bed then outofnowhere she started saying opening up to me. She said the reason she lives alone is because her ex left her a couple months ago and he was the one that encourage her to go and move on together but later on he left and that she is still mad at him.That night she cooked me a meal, I even slept with her till the next morning when she had to go to work like we were boyfriend and girlfriend lol. 
-Then next day I went to her house again and we had sex.Not gonna lie the sex was not that good, we were both nervous specially me.I have anxiety and I get nervous when I'm with a new girl not all the time but sometimes I do. And this time I remember it took me a while to get hard while we were foreplaying  then I got hard but I struggle a lil bit to put the condom. 

-We tried a few positions I even finger her and eat her out, she did not gave me oral cause she wanted me to get tested 1st before she did that.But when she got on top of me for some reason my erection was gone.It was getting back up but I struggle to put the condom on and got frustrated.She said is all good I understand is not big deal.We watch tv and talk for a bit then she suggested for me to get tested so I had no problem with the condom anymore and so we could had sex raw and with no fear of catching anything. 


-Now me saying that she lost interest because of the bad sex is just me taking a guess here but I don't know I doubt it , because after we had sex she kept being as eager to see me and keep talking to me since the 1st day with the same amout of reciprocation even texting me 1st ,like there were no signs of a slow fade yet.Also the main sign that tells me it was the bad sex was because one day after we had sex I saw that she had uploaded a new picture on her tinder profile but I don't know. 


-3 days after we had sex I asked her through text what she was even looking for with me just out of curiosity and she said I answer you that in person.Then we saw each other again this time we made out but did not have sex because she had done laser on her vagina to erase hair forever ,which it was true. 

-Then she said she just got out of 3 year long relationship and is still pissed off at him which she told me before and she doesnt want to get on a new relationship while still thinking about him and doesnt wanna put me in that position and also because she is super busy with school and her job.But she does likes me and wants to continue seeing me she said she wanted to but was just not ready I said is perfect then I said to her whenever a female tells me that I always think is a form of rejection lol and she told me trust me is not that is just I'm not ready yet.She even deleted her tinder profile in front of me for some reason.


-Then we continue texting like we use to but a couple days after that she kept going distant like no longer initiating texts, then texts getting dry, sometimes leaving on read, sometimes being online and not even opening my messages, everytime I asked her to hangout keep saying she was busy.One time she texted me and told me the reason she was a lil distant with me was because according to her I was posting quotes on my stories that were directed to her and she was a lil mad about that but that she did wanted to keep seeing me that she was just super busy.


-I stopped texting her for a couple weeks ask her out again then the same answers I'm busy then I honestly got tired and a month ago confronted her about it, I ask her if she wanted to see me or not as she said back in april and she said 

-""I'm just not in a moment of meeting or talking to anybody you are a really handsome and great guy but I'm just too focus on my jobs and career now I don't want anything serious now even more after what I went through with my ex, of course we could keep talking but I dont have much time to see you"" I also ask her one last question, why did you did not wanted to sleep with me no more you were so eager to keep doing it? And she said I dont wanna have sex with anybody now. 

-This was a month ago, through all this time she kept watching all my stories litteraly always the 1st person that views my stories sometimes even reacts to them.She been posting some stories lately of some pot of flowers at her house which made me believe that the whole thing was a lie and she is dating someonelse or got back with her ex maybe Im overthinking, even tho I have go on other dates with other women I keep thinking about her.I wanna keep talking to her but I don't wanna fall in the friendzone category like just talking but not even seeing each othet in person.

I met him at my church and immediately was connected to him. He has now became my best friend. I was previously married 16 years in a very toxic marriage but we shared 5 kids ages (5-15) my Kids love him. When we first met he told me about his rocky past with being a addict. (Pain pills, meth and Heroin) he had been clean almost four years. I was great full for his honesty and didn’t think much past it because he showed no signs of that lifestyle. ( I’ve been around addicts my whole life) and we are so close and both of us chase after God daily. We are involved in church be do almost everything together. 
      Well 2 months ago, he came to me sobbing and told me that he had been taking Kratom for about a month. We talked about it and said that we would start a recovery program every week and get past it. I told him that he could talk to me and I would try to be understanding if he ever felt weak. Well after that I asked him periodically how he was feeling and he told me that he was doing fine. That he wasn’t having any issues. My gut told me differently.
So I went to our local convenience store and found out that not only was he still taking it but now three times as much. So I confronted him. After days of reading about it I knew it would be unfair to ask him to go cold turkey and also didn’t want to expose my kids to his behaviors-of him withdrawing. So I told him he had a choice, move back to his house or he had 10 days to wean and then cold turkey. (My kids left for their dads in 10 days for the summer) well.... it all went well. I didn’t leave his sight and we spent those days keeping bus, it was actually a good three-four days.
So Now...... everything has been great, we get along like little kids and so carefree. I left to Fla to visit my mother for 4 days and sure enough the day after I left he went and bought some Kratom. Not just once but twice a day, every day since I’ve been gone. The lady at the store called and told me. 
I am completely broken. I love him so much but I know I can’t bend my boundaries for me or my children. I haven’t confronted him yet. He has no clue I know. I go back home in a few days and I’m completely lost on how to handle this. I bought some Kratom drug tests weeks ago that he knows about. I’m going to ask him to take it. But not sure how to handle the conversation or situation from there. My heart aching and I feel as if I
 am mourning him already.

We have been in a long distance relationship right from the beggining. I migrated to Canada for my future studies 2 years ago. We both live in the same building and were in the same school. We got closer and closer until we started catching feelings for each other. At first she was not that attractive or hot. She was actually 4 years younger than me and I actually never find people more than 3 years younger than me ‘Hot’. I liked her because she was kinda pretty, sang and danced really well, and was pretty much a great person to talk to. I loved our late night conversations the most. And towards my the end of my life back at home which is in india btw, we started meeting more often than ever, talking and laughing. I had actually dated her about 8 months before I left home. But that was a disaster because i jumped up on the opportunity and she said yes too quick. We had the worst relationship ever for a month and broke up. Ever since we remained freinds and got closer by the day eventually developing feelings for each other. This is was the time i said that we used to meetup a lot a we went for like an official date just because we both knew we liked each other. I proposed to her once again a month before leaving. She told me she loved me but is not interesting in dating for just a month and then breaking up. At that time we both did not have any interest towards long distance and so we both rejected that option. On the my last day, we met for the last time, said our goodbyes, and i hugged her for the first time which made my heart do a backflip. I had a connecting flight from Qatar to Montreal. So here i was waiting for my second flight. That is when she texts me. She confesses everything which I already knew. She said how much she loved me and that she will miss me a lot and that she wishes me best of luck. At that time i knew i was so in love with this girl. I kinda wished that she was also interested in long distance but when she said all this stuff, i kinda wanted a long distance with her because anything is better than nothing. I reached montreal the next day. For the next 3 days we texted like crazy, sending kisses and loves like we always do even though we are not dating. She is not really a call type of girl but those 3 days we video called almost every second of the day. I was literally falling for her every minute and i felt guilty of not able to make her mine when i had the chance. The next day, it happened. She gives me a hint about long distance. She tells how a lot of her freinds have done long distance and that she doesn’t think now that it will be a bad idea. I got excited when she said that. I immediately asked her. “ So do you think we pull off a long distance relationship?” She said yes. And then she asked me am I interested. I dint reply anything because i was too excited. She then asked me “Yes or no”. I asked her back “ Wait a minute. Are you proposing me?” She said yes. Tears filled my eyes as i was about to make one of the best decisions of my life . I said yes. And now for almost 2 years we have been in a very successful and romantic long distance relationship. Even though we are 25,000 miles away. Our hearts cannot be closer. We have already decided to spend the rest of our lives with each other. I know this is kinda early to truly decide whether this will last till marriage. But i dont know. I have never loved a girl with so much dedication and passion as i have loves this girl and i get as much love from her. And if we could do this in a long distance relationship. Im pretty sure we can in a normal one. Im planning to go visit india within 4 months and to see the love of my life again and spend a wonderful time with her. We have totally mastered the art of long distance even though there have been tough times. For example, now is actually a very tough time for us because her dad found out about this relationship and like any indian parent, he took away her phone and now we can only text each other via her laptop which she only uses while attending online classes. That time is when we text and if we are lucky, call also. And puberty really hit her. She turned from an average pretty girl to an absolutely hot goddess whose latest instagram pictures i admire everyday. Yea so thats it.

Just happened again where a girl and I seemed to be vibing over text thought everything was going really well. Then the next day she ghosts me for seemingly no reason and today she unfollowed me on IG and removed me from following her.
