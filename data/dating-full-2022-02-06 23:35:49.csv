She wasn‚Äôt moved on her from last relationship and the effects of it. It is what is there. How it unfolded and ended is what has left me broken.

We went to school together, she slid in my dms, we talked for three months. Went on a bunch of dates, hooked up once. Met my sister.. blah blah

We planned a date ice skating at Central Park the weekend before Christmas. I went and said goodbye to her, from being exuberant from having what I thought was the nicest day I ever had with a girl, to walking into my house crying not understanding what I did. She texted me it was becoming overwhelming &amp; ‚Äúnot fair to me‚Äù. 

I just wish that date never happened to begin with, it should have never occurred bc she clearly did not wake up that day feeling nothing. 

I didn‚Äôt even get the chance to communicate without her running. Her fight or flight hit, it left me so confused.

Though we never had a relationship (like I thought was unfolding) she doesn‚Äôt believe we can be friends. It‚Äôs such a shame to me, I never connected with someone like I did her.

This experience has only left a bad taste in my mouth about opening up and making myself vulnerable. It just ends the same way every time.

I met this girl and things were going really great. We had a very nice conversation and we understood each other perfectly. We just had the same vibe. On top of that she is really pretty. She even gave me her number and Instagram without me asking. She also sent me numerous signals/signs. When we said goodbye she told me that I should write her. From this point everything went downhill. We texted the next day and her texts were really dry and I tried my best to keep the conversation going without being clingy. One day later I asked her out and we met on the same day. However, she unfortunately told me that she also made arrangements with 2 friends this evening. So I took two of my friends with me. We were 3 boys and 3 girls. We had a chill evening. Things were going alright and we laughed and made jokes in the group. I tried to focus my conversation a bit on her, but I also got along well with her friends. She only sent a few to none signs/signals and I thought to myself ‚Äúno problem take it easy‚Äù. Asked her out two days later, she said she had no time. No problem. The texts were still very dry and it always took her a while to respond but I thought to myself maybe she‚Äôs just not good at texting but it‚Äôs okay as long she‚Äôs nice in person. We then met a few days later to drive to our university together (we share a course) and also drove the way back together. Had a nice time and conversation. She also laughed a lot at my jokes. Then I asked her out the next weekend. She didn‚Äôt reply for 15+ hours and finally texted me ‚ÄûI‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm replying so late but I‚Äôm sick etc. etc.‚Äú. From that point our texts went incredibly dry for no goddamn reason even though I was nice to her and wished her a speedy recovery etc. On the following days I checked on her and asked her how she‚Äôs feeling and told her that she could call me anytime if she needs anything. It always took her 8+ hours to respond on one message. And I tried my very best to keep the conversation somehow going without being clingy or feeling like an idiot or douche. On the last day she told me that she‚Äôs feeling good and almost fully recovered, so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs too sick to respond or anything. It‚Äôs completely okay to not respond immediately. But 8+ hours EVERY time ?? The answers were also one-sided. Now, it's not like you could say she's bad at texting. It feels like she has absolutely no interest or desire to be involved with me.

Feel free to ask any questions... She says she wants to be with me and she misses me and etc but she still leaves rather than trying to work things out... I don't understand that mindset. 

The last time this happened she spent the weekend with a friend getting passed out drunk, went to a dealers house to get coke, etc, she's had issues with alcoholism recently and was drinking in the day time, occasionally at work etc. This has been better as far as I know. Her sister who is recently divorced keeps telling her that she cant afford her rent and doesnt have time to take her animals out, every time they talk she ends up being way more emotional and gets upset very easy. Then we end up in some type of argument and she ends up over there, I believe her sister is manipulating her for her own benefit but I think all that is beside the point. 

Anyway here is the conversation: 


Me:

Don't call me. Just grab it and go. You left... 

I don't want to talk, or work things out over the phone while your out and about.

You aren't here. You aren't going to be, you made that clear and that's all I needed to know

Her:

I‚Äôll be there in 30 minutes I need my antibiotics because I still feel shitty

Me:

Where are they

Your adderall is here, you probably have your antibiotics with you

## Sat 8:15 PM

Her:

Did you live my stuff?

*move

Me:

Nope

You're going to move it.

Her:

I‚Äôm about to go pick it up

## Sat 8:58 PM

Her:

Are you not going to talk to me ?

Me:

Is there something you want to say?

Her

I‚Äôm upset ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand how you give up so easily but I guess you e been waiting for this

Me:

You gave up, you left... good luck with that

Her:

No I‚Äôve been super upset and you don‚Äôt get that

Me:

If you don't want to be with me I can't force you.

Her:

Yea same

Me:

K bye.

Her:

just tell me you do wtf

Me:

You already told me you don't. No need for me to say anything.

Her:

It‚Äôs been so weird between us. You aren‚Äôt happy and I try I really do but you seem to only care about you.

Me:

No worries. I don't do anything for you or support you... so I'm sure you'll find someone who will

I'm going to bed, good night.

Her:

I don‚Äôt need anyone to do that what I need is someone who understand. I‚Äôm just an average girl who is trying her best sorry you need more.

Me:

No worries.

Her:

Fr ?

Me:

You clearly have your opinions. Regardless of what I have said, or didn't say.

Good night.

Her:

I don‚Äôt get this

Alex

I don‚Äôt understand how you can just give up on someone

If you ever loved me you wouldn‚Äôt

Me:

 this isn't the first time you've left

And if I decide to stay with you, it won't be your last. I don't want someone that does that in my life.

Her

Please just talk to me

I‚Äôve changed so much and I just need your support

Me:

You've always been like that and you aren't going to change. Someone leaving and trying to come back is a hard limit for me.

I wasn't supporting you, helping you, or doing anything for you. Remember?

Her:

You know I‚Äôm not a bad person you know all I‚Äôm asking is for your attention

Me:

Well, I don't know how you expected to get my attention by leaving and staying somewhere else. That isn't how you do it. Sorry

Her:

Alex you are right you are always right I don‚Äôt know how to do things or how to be better I‚Äôm sorry.

Me:

That's ok. I hope you figure it out some day

Her:

I can‚Äôt lose you

Please just don‚Äôt give up

Me:

I am done Sofia

Her:

I understand

Me:

When you left and I went to bed by myself I realized that we are done.

Her:

Please just think about it I‚Äôm not a bad person and I love you so much. I‚Äôve never been so motivated to do better like I am now

You can‚Äôt just give up you can‚Äôt

Me:

No one forced you to leave, no one made you stay anywhere else. You're a grown adult and you make your own decisions. So when I went to sleep alone knowing that you'd rather be somewhere else, as much as it hurts, it is what it is.

Her:

Alex please don‚Äôt give up Ugh

Alex

Me:

GF I'm sorry but I'm done

Her:

Just think about it 

I would never give up on someone so fast

Me:

Yet you did

Her:

No I didn‚Äôt

Me:

Oh, so why weren't you ""home"" last night

Where did you sleep?

Her:

On my sisters couch crying my eyes out

I‚Äôm not how I was before I‚Äôm really not going to be stupid.

Im working my ass off for nothing and now I lost you

Me:

Yeah, well I hope going there was worth it

Her:

Obviously you are never going to care

Me:

You know, sometimes I try to believe you and convince myself otherwise but then I think about you crying to me on the phone saying you miss me and a guy showing up to your place to pick you up... or finding you at that breakfast place. That makes me realize I can't trust you, that I can't forgive you.


I remember you promising and swearing that you weren't doing anything bad while you spent the night at a hotel, and went to Seattle with a ""girl"" but got dropped off by a dude with fresh hickeys on his neck.

I can't be with you after that.

Her

Really months way months after

And that would never happen

So now that‚Äôs your excuse

Fuck

Me:

I love that you're being a better person, you aren't drinking, you're working out, fixing your credit. Keep it up, elevate yourself. I've always supported you and I try to so what's best for both of us... I just can't be with someone who has to leave every time there's an issue


I hope you didn't let anyone manipulate you into making that decision. I know your sister needs someone to help pay rent and take care of her animals but that's not your responsibility. Somehow when she left for a week and needed you at her place we ""broke up"" and you did that... now she comes back into your life and 2 days later you leave again

Her:

I need you I really do I know it sounds stupid but all I need is for you to understand that I need your attention that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking for.

Me:

Why?

Her:

Because I really love you and I know I do because I e never tried to be so much better for anyone else

I know I don‚Äôt contribute anything to your life but I hope you care even just a lil

Me:

I do care, and you do contribute. I love doing things with you and spending time with you. After what happened in the past I can't bring myself to trust you, and I never want to be with someone that leaves every time there's an issue.

I'm going to the gym so I won't be able to talk

Her:

I wish I was more like you

Yea Alex have fun

Me:

I don't know what you mean.

Her:

You are just better than me

Me:

I don't think so.. I'm just stubborn. Why do you say stuff like that

Her:

I can‚Äôt wait to be like that I wish things didn‚Äôt happen to me like this

Me:

Everything was fine and everything is making progress slowly... don't stress, when you work on things they get better

Her:

As much as you want to say that it‚Äôs not true

Ignoring me and giving me the cold shoulder when I am stressed and upset is not fine

Me:

Neither is leaving when your upset

Her:

I‚Äôm (20M) currently on break with my gf(21F) of one year,5 months of ldrs.
We got into long distance when I suddenly had to come to US for college because our country got unsafe. I‚Äôm currently attending community college here while working about 50 hours a week. 

Her family is financially stable but doesn‚Äôt have enough liquid money enough to send her here and pay for college. She says she wants to be with me but doesn‚Äôt want to work like me and study on the other hand as it stresses her out. Everyone is doing it here and I know she‚Äôs smart enough to handle it all. But since she lived her whole life without having to work and her parents paying ppl to make stuff more comfortable for her ,8 get that she doesn‚Äôt want to work a lot.When we started dating , she used to say she‚Äôd like to study abroad and settle down in Australia or Canada. But now,since her family can‚Äôt fully support her expenses,she wants to wait .It could take up to 1 to 3-4 years for her to come.

Her family is against her going abroad to study on her own since she‚Äôll have to work a lot. They‚Äôd also be against us dating since our religion is different and this whole thing gets me so anxious. If she marries me she‚Äôll probably lose her whole family and relatives. I feel bad for her. 


She has broken up with me twice before.
First time was because I wasn‚Äôt giving her enough time, I was stressed and gamed a lot. 
Second time was because she got mad at me for hanging out with a female friend at her place for a few hours when she didn‚Äôt want me to but I felt so bad because our third friend didn‚Äôt show up. I know I breached her trust , she got hurt a lot,which I‚Äôm guilty of. She can‚Äôt get over it until now. After that incident , her coming to me got vague and she grew distant.

I‚Äôve compromised when She said she don‚Äôt want kids so I agreed we won‚Äôt have to. (She did agree to adopt or surrogate but only for me)She wanted to keep our relationship hidden from her family except her brother until she‚Äôs sure we are ready to marry because they might cut ties with her if they find out she‚Äôs dating me. 

It‚Äôs been 5 months of ldr and there‚Äôs no sign of certainty when it comes to her coming to me.I started asking her to come to me since we miss each other a lot and she does want to stay abroad some time. I even told her I could come to her a few times a year after I finish college and stuff and we could close the distance after. But she wouldn‚Äôt talk about coming unless her family fully fund her degree. It was miserable for us to be together so I broke up with her a while ago thinking nothing can be done unless she decides to come to me within a year.

I know she loves me a lot and try to be there for me all the time on the other side.would have attention on me and care about me. Would do anything for me but would be anxious about coming to me.I get that her family is stable and she probably doesn‚Äôt need to work her whole life but I just want her to make some effort to be with me.

Before that I was ALWAYS in some sort of relationship and I never felt ‚Äútoo old‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt settle down because I was holding out for basically Mr. Perfect.  Since then, the pandemic and lockdown isolated me (just like the rest of the world) for a while and I also had a couple of relatives pass away during this time.  

Well, I spent the past year or so working on self improvement and not really dating.  Getting into really great shape, meditating, reading and learning, and focusing on my new job.  

Well the thing is I just turned 37 years old.  I just had a major surgery which I am recovering from (jaw surgery, which I needed for sleep apnea).  So, needless to say, the next few months are going to be pretty isolating while I recover.  

I had two things happen to me that have kind of made me feel like I am ‚Äútoo old‚Äù to find love anymore.  I am in really good shape for anyone, much less someone my own age.  A young guy (25M) asked me out last November after my 37th birthday no less and we ‚Äúdated‚Äù for a month.  I was really smitten but I said some judgmental / harsh things to him and we broke up.  Basically I discovered he smoked weed daily and he had told me he rarely did it and it was a dealbreaker for me.  But, I still felt lonely after the breakup because I hadn‚Äôt liked someone in such a long time.  The second thing that happened was I matched with a really great guy - great job, tall, attractive - on OLD who was 33M.  Well, we started texting and I check my OLD profile and I see that my birthday is wrong and it has my age at 33.  I think this happened years ago when I first downloaded the app and I wanted to see how many more matched I‚Äôd get if I said I was 29 (vs 33 at the time) and I was just messing around.  Well, fast forward to today I downloaded the app but I didn‚Äôt realize my age was off. 

So I tell this guy hey I am actually 37 not 33 and I also tell him about my jaw surgery and send him a photo of me now and he doesnt respond for a while and then he says, it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo much to digest.‚Äù  So I say no problem and I delete him.  

But I have to say - I‚Äôm really feeling down now.  Like, being rejected sucks.  I didn‚Äôt ask but I wanted to know is it because I look bad, too old?  I am so insecure about my looks and about ‚Äúgetting old‚Äù and still being single.  Also‚Ä¶ On the dating app the quality of men available when your age is 37 is WAY worse than 33.  I‚Äôm sure its even better at 27.  I basically feel like I am just getting the dregs of society and like I am a dreg too.  

It just really sucks because I am ready to find a partner and I think my age is going to prevent me from this and it‚Äôs too late.  All else being equal, I wouldn‚Äôt have this problem if I was 32 or something.  

Has anyone else found love, gotten married and had a family at my age or older?  As a woman? Id love to hear your stories or if I should just give up. Or kick it into high gear and just find someone before I turn 40.  I‚Äôm teetering on this just making me really depressed but there‚Äôs something inside of me saying I can succeed if I am positive and put together an aggressive dating plan once I am recovered because I never had a problem before and I‚Äôm not really trying right now, I am kind of in this transitional post-op recovery phase, and I‚Äôm just freaking myself out.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157634,public,self,Women where did you find forever love in your late 30s / 40s or is it too late for me?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/smds2j/women_where_did_you_find_forever_love_in_your/,no_ads,0.0,,,

We stopped talking a few months ago. I'm just looking for some listening ears and advice on how to heal from this. I know I wrote a lot so I tried to organize it a bit.

**Context:**

We met when I was in middle school and when we were members of this friend group on a video game. Very dumb way to make friends, in retrospect, but I guess I felt it was my only option at the time. He liked to flirt around in our group, but it was kind of just taken lightly/as a joke. He had multiple gfs in the time I had known him and pretty much repeated the same behavior regardless of whether he was with someone or not. I guess I didn't think too much about it then because it was pretty normalized and no one really made a big deal of it, it was just kind of expected you participated in it. I'm not sure the gfs were aware of it or cared. The reason we stopped talking was because he had flirted with me to the point it had made me uncomfortable. I had feelings for him at this point and I guess I did not know how to handle my feelings along with the fear of rejection, so I ghosted him. (Also not proud of that but I left with the intention of not speaking again). Told myself I would forget about him, and I did. 

**Situationship:**

Fast forward to quarantine. I somehow found our convos when I was looking back at messaging websites we used to use, and I guess the nostalgia with the mix of old feelings motivated me to try to talk to him again. Remembered his snap because we did talk on that sometimes. Hit him up (he didn't initially recognize me because I went by a nickname and I pretty much never showed my face) and told him who I was. He was excited to hear from me and I was surprised. Basically I came back to confess my feelings and to ask whether he had ever felt the same. Went through a few weeks of snapping back and forth. Asked him if he wanted to text instead, so we exchanged numbers (I kind of thought I was dropping a hint here). We live in the same state, so we know which city the other is from (that is something I did disclose to him when we were friends). One day he texts me and tells me he's gonna be in the area for the weekend. I was on vacation, so I told him that because I did not know how else to respond. I assumed he was hinting at hanging out. I ask him why he's in the area because I was curious why he was here (he lives on the other side of the state). He texts me when he returns home he came to visit his ex. He kind of gave this weird justification too for why he came to see her. I didn't really know what to say. I was kind of at a loss at this point, so I kind of just gave a polite response. I figured this wasn't a good situation to stay in and I should just leave, but one of my in-person friends, who I had confided in about everything at the time, suggested I just tell him at this point. I had nothing to lose, according to her. And I'm not blaming her. It was my choice. But, wow, really fucking stupid of me. I should have left. 

So I tell him how I felt right after my awkward reply. Ghosts me for a few days. I assume that it's a ""no"" but then he replies and tells me he did reciprocate at the time. Says he's not good at communicating his feelings. Tells me ""I'm one of the smartest people he's ever met"" and something along the lines that he ""always hoped we'd find each other."" 

We talked on-and-off three separate times. I had a lot going on in my personal life that I didn't when we initially started talking, so I broke it off when it became too much. He would keep coming back though, always say something along the lines of hoping I was okay or checking on me. Initially, I thought was sweet, but now it just angers me. It just felt like he wasn't done with me yet.

Even outside of the on-and-off, there were a lot of underlying issues. He was hot and cold throughout. Initially flirted a lot and said a lot of cutesy shit in the weeks after I confessed to him, but the other than that he kept things pretty neutral.  I always was the one to express feelings first (positive or negative) before he did. He would mirror me or claim to reciprocate, but never was the first one to say anything. I always felt like I had to give in order to receive, if that makes sense, and that kind of ate away at me over time. Everything stayed on text. We never called/Facetimed each other, even though that was the norm when we were friends. 

He always made a point of telling me he was nearby when he was hanging out with friends that lived near me. I never knew how to respond to this, so I just replied with what I was doing. The third time he tells me where he's at, I ask him if he wants to hang out since I'm assuming he's dropping hints. Says he's down, then he pretty much ghosts me for a week and doesn't mention it again until I confront him about it. Tells me he hopes we can still be friends. He later tells me the reason he was avoiding me/creating space was because ""he didn't feel deserved to catch feelings"" and those feelings ""conflicted with his feelings of connection"" with me or something along those lines. He also says he has issues and the whole ""I'm not ready for a relationship right now"", but mentions being open to one with me in the future. Still not really sure what that has to do with just hanging out. I just genuinely wanted to meet him and at that time I didn't even know how he felt because we weren't really flirting and there wasn't really an romantic connection. Just felt like he was breadcrumbing me and was saying a bunch of things to appease me. 

But basically he always used the ""friend"" label to keep me around. It was really confusing and hurtful because it almost felt like he kept calling us ""friends"", so he could treat me however he wanted, but also so there was no reason for me to be upset. Like I had no justification for feeling the way I felt because everything was just casual. We were ""friends"", but he never made time for me. He would keep telling me was busy doing this, or he was a ""bad texter"", etc., but he had enough time to keep telling me about what he was doing with everyone else. And like I said, he would keep coming back.

He kept offering to be there for me and he would always be here to listen, but at that point, I didn't feel I could trust him. I could barely could get a text back from him most of the time, so how am I gonna confide in him? In general, when I would confront him about his behavior, he would just play dumb, act indifferent, or disappeared if things weren't going smoothly. We were ""friends"", but he was unreliable. And I never really got an apology for him. 

**Bottom Line:**

There were a lot of red flags. I had a gut feeling multiple times to let go, but I just didn't listen and I feel pretty stupid about that. It's ironic though because our conversation was pretty dry up until I told him my feelings. He would never ghost me, leave me on read, or give me one-word responses in the first few weeks we were talking, but it got to the point where there wasn't really a point in replying. And I felt rude if I just ghosted. I don't know how to explain it, but I just felt like he didn't want to let go. Like that was also gut feeling. But anyways, I guess this is all hurtful because he just said a lot of things he didn't really mean. He would give me a lot of compliments or he would keep telling me all these things he thought about me that he never mentioned in the past. He always called me ""smart"" (I guess I was known as a bookworm by my online friends). The second time we starting talking again, I told him I had missed him (which is why I was coming back) and he told me about how he used to look for my account to come back online after I left him a few years ago. So I guess, in short, it's hurtful because apparently I'm ""great"" or supposedly I'm all of these ""great"" things in his eyes, but he doesn't really want anything to do with me. I also revealed my face, real name, my phone number, and other info I usually never revealed to past online friends because I felt I could trust him. And I told him the significance behind that before I shared those aspects of me, because at the time, I thought he had earned it. But evidently, he wasn't listening and didn't really care. And I just genuinely thought of him as a friend and cared for him lol and I guess it just sucks to learn that he never really felt the same romantically or platonically. I just feel like I was manipulated, repeatedly lied to, and I was his toy, and I guess I struggled/have been struggling with for a long time why he thought it was okay to treat me this way and also how to not let my worth get tied up into all of it. I guess I also am trying to learn how to forgive myself because I felt like I brought it on myself by messaging him in the first place.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157633,public,self,Getting over/Healing from situationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/smdzcs/getting_overhealing_from_situationship/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Wasn‚Äôt even confident enough to even look at her. 

 a couple years go by after high school, I hit her up via snap out of the blue. We texted for a couple months. I managed to ask her on a date to a restaurant, she said yes. 

I did not have high hopes coming in to this date, for one it was my first date ever with anyone. I was very shy and kind of awkward to the people that didn‚Äôt know me.(still am) And tbh I never really had any type 1on1 convo with any girls at all. So I knew there was no recipe for success realistically. 

So I pick her up and my heart is beating out my chest. My first words and sentences towards her were coming in at about 90 mph and stuttering all over the place. I don‚Äôt even know what I said tbh. And all I could think about at that point in time is her consciousness telling her. ‚ÄúHoly shit this guy is awkward, what a long night this is gonna be.‚Äù 

From that point on I managed calm to down a little bit, but still was in my own head real bad. I would try to play out stuff in my head of things I should do or say to make her laugh. I was overthinking every thing I should and shouldn‚Äôt say. There managed to be a couple decent moments but most of the date was an awkward disaster. Still tried to text her for a couple weeks after that. NO DICE. Which was what I expected.  Like I said I expected it, but it just ate me up knowing that the date could of went really well if I had not been so nervous and been in my own head.

In theory, I feel that my sensitivity is what is beautiful about me. I am empathetic, sweet despite a lifetime of traumatic abuse, and very loving.

I often fantasise, as a hyper-feminine woman, about meeting a really strong, stoic man who will love me for my sensitivity and my vulnerability and not see it as a weakness but a strength. Someone who will cherish it and want to protect me. In the past, it has attracted a lot of predators and I am tired of it.

I want to get married, and I believe in (personally) being submissive in various ways to the man I love. I live for love and love the idea of love though, and maybe this is my problem - or perhaps, despite all the progress I have made in therapy, I am still not ready for a relationship - I don't know.

I‚Äôve been meaning to ask out my friend‚Äôs roommate (let‚Äôs call her Jane) for way too damn long now. Like, it‚Äôs been over four months since I first thought about it (I know that that‚Äôs unhealthy behavior). But today I finally did it! And Jane said that she‚Äôs been talking with someone else. I‚Äôm a little bummed out, but honestly I‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôm glad that I took my shot, even if I‚Äôve been rejected.  

Here‚Äôs the thing that I‚Äôm now struggling with. I went to a party this last Christmas season, and an old friend of mine (let‚Äôs call her Sarah) showed up. I hadn‚Äôt seen Sarah in about a year because she moved out of state, and when we saw each other a year ago, I had thought about asking her out. We were at a New Year‚Äôs Eve party and had got to talking. She‚Äôs super nice and easy to talk to. But she was moving out of state for a year of contract work, and after that she wasn‚Äôt sure what she was gonna do. Well now she shows up at this Christmas party and tells me that she‚Äôs moving back to my state, like five minutes from where I live (before she was a few hours away, and we only saw each other a couple times a year due to our families being friends). At this Christmas party, I considered ditching any feelings I had for Jane (who was also there) and just asking out Sarah, but like I said, I have trouble working up the nerve. Flash forward to now. Jane‚Äôs rejected me (literally like an hour ago), and now I‚Äôm already thinking about asking about Sarah. And I can‚Äôt help but feel like a horrible person for this. Because it makes me feel like I‚Äôm prioritizing the idea of having a girlfriend over asking out the right girl. I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm just trying to feel better about getting rejected by Jane by thinking about asking out Sarah, and that‚Äôs kinda gross to me. I don‚Äôt know. It also doesn‚Äôt help that while not super close friends, Sarah and Jane do know each other and hang out in the same groups, so Sarah may hear that I asked out Jane through their friends.  

I guess what I‚Äôm ultimately wondering is how long is an appropriate amount of time to wait before I ask out Sarah?

Me (25f) and my bf (26m) have been seeing each other for 3 years. 

Things have be good overall. My family and friends like him. I do genuinely love him. But recently I‚Äôve been feeling overwhelmed by what the future holds. 

For background my bf has a really high paying job and I am currently working part time.  I also start school in September this year so, I will be attending that full time soon. He has been covering me for rent for the past few months by choice. (If I was not living with him he would be paying the same amount. I also help as much as I can with the house. For example, I wake up at 6am to make him breakfast for him several times a week). 

My bf does not seem to care or listen to my feelings as of lately. See below: 

I had ADHD/anxiety and he has made me feel on numerous occasions that my ADHD isn‚Äôt real (he says this because an adult ADHD diagnosis is odd to him). He gets upset with mistakes I make due to my adhd. 

I‚Äôve had really bad trauma in the past and he has invalided it by telling me to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù when I feel depressed or low on some days. He does not know the extent of it but I don‚Äôt feel supported. 

He has so many female friends. He told one friend (colleague) a really traumatic and personal story about me as a joke in front of a group (I was there). The group and she ignored the story and has mistreated me on numerous occasions out side of this. After multiple attempts to get him to cut out someone who has hurt me and makes me uncomfortable  he still talks to her and thinks my feelings toward her are invalid. 

In almost every group encounter he has difficulty listening to me talk. He often interrupts me and will even ask me to explain something I just clearly stated. He also seems to prefer dominating the conversation by changing the topic or self-referencing many times. 

Also he tells me that he is not sure about our future since I don‚Äôt have a high salary job right now and constantly talks about his future goals about buying expensive materialistic things. It‚Äôs been made obvious that my salary prospects do not seem enough for him to live the lavish life he wants. This makes me feel horrible because I am genuinely doing the best I can. (His family is super wealthy and mine is not). 

He seems to be working on the above but I just feel really overwhelmed because it keeps bringing me back to my trauma. I just don‚Äôt want to relive my past and I‚Äôm worried about what the right decision is. (I hope I am making sense.)


Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you so much!

Every time I go out with my partner, I always notice him staring (10+ seconds) at objectively attractive woman. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself an envious person. Honestly, it‚Äôs a matter of respect imo. 

I‚Äôve directly addressed it by initiating a conversation about it, and he didn‚Äôt really respond. So, the other day I approached the matter differently; I asked if he knew that person. Of course, he didn‚Äôt. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be fixated on this if it weren‚Äôt the fact that he had saved pictures of girls he knew in his spank bank (basically what it was although he wouldn‚Äôt admit it) &amp; a subscription to OF.

Approaching my Mid-Twenties now I've realized that I needed to re-evaluate some of my values as person and simply put ""stop being a ""fuckboy"" (toxic yes ik). 

From the start there was a lot of physical and emotional flirting. She invited me to multiple events of hers with her friends and even before our first date was almost overwhelmingly open to me. About a few weeks into talking we had an amazing first date at a 3d laser show. Throughout the tour we shared some deep personal thoughts and playful cuddles. Both of us felt very comfortable with one another and our ""cute and playful tension"" was starting to turn into this possible romantic connection. This natural bond between us formed very quickly from our energy levels to personalities and shared common interests. About 2/3 of the way through the date we find ourselves dancing under the lights of a dark auditorium; she pulls me in under a singular beam of light and whispers ""we are now together as one."" I could feel her beaming eyes begging me look into her soul and kiss her, and I couldn't even just look up.. I said some stupid joke and laughed it off.. A part of me hates myself as that p***ys ego is afraid of being vulnerable.. After that moment I could just tell she was thrown off. And how could she not be?! Like we built up all this tension just to develop it into a friendship? Lmfao what a fucking joke I am. I ended up dropping her off, exchanging casual goodbyes, then we both agreed to hang out again sometime. Old me would've said fuck it! Onto the next! But I actually feel something real from her that I haven't felt in a years of hook up culture.. karma? 

Fast forward a week to now and I'm still not even interested in anyone else but her.. Trying to stop thinking about her, I went out with some buddies last night. This tan petite girl practically threw herself on me and asked if I could show her the rest of the tattoos on my body. I couldn't even form a response because all I could think about was how I missed her smile.. 

Honestly at first I was just confused on what I exactly wanted with her, but now in hindsight a real relationship is all I want. I wanna get to know her more and build something true with her. She threw herself out there for me multiple times and I left her with uncertainty from my timid and insecure emotions. It feels like she started pulling away a little bit this past week so today I asked if she would be available at all; completely spacing that she would be out of State for the remainder of this week. She made no attempt to try and plan anything else in advance and can tell I missed my opportunity.. 

So I guess my question is: Should I Keep Pursing So I can Pull The Trigger? Or Try And Move On? 
I obviously haven't been on her agenda of priorities lately and for almost a month it seemed like thats all I was to her.

I have this female friend and she had a few boyfriends who were always assholes to her and she broke up a few days ago with her ex bf. 

For a long time we only have contact through internet but she trusts me. 

Im not the ugliest guy, i had a gf once, dates and stuff and she dated different kind of physical kind of guys. 

I know many will say i will screw up the friendship but im really thinking on approaching her somehow (online) and see if she is at least up to some coffee. 
I have a crush on her for more than ten years now. 

I dont like to think of my family close to a possible girlfriend cause i dont get along with my family but i feel comfortable with the idea of her and my family together. 

God i would do anything to make her happy!

We started talking and then texting. 

He wrote on his profile that he's in management consulting and added a grad school in addition to his undergrad. 

I've noticed that he repeatedly misspells a few words, like omicron is omnicron, meet is met, and casually is causally. 

After some side investigation and mutual connections, I've learned that he's a business analyst in health economics, and that's not management consulting. 

He first said on hinge, that he got out of a relationship more than three months ago, and he's moved on from it (but people have told me that it's hard to move on from that time).

The other issue is that first, he said ""not into hookups and not looking to take anything meaningful or seriously"" and then after one phone call, he proceeds to start flirting. Then he asked to hang out. 

Why couldn't he be friends first? He said he was bored and wanted to meet people in the area who have similar interests. I really think he's not in the right state of mind, and very confusing.

One random day he liked my dating profile &amp; said ‚Äúlet me spoil you‚Äù of course I fell for it but have let him know let‚Äôs just be friends because I don‚Äôt believe in LDR. We had a 2.5 hours phone call &amp; he said he‚Äôs never been on the phone with a girl for this long. I think that‚Äôs kind of BS but I went with it &amp; gone with the flow with this connection to see where it goes. He did say he is looking for someone to marry one day so it did sounded his intentions were serious. We exchanged instagrams &amp; would text eachother almost everyday for 3 months. I did notice within 1.5 months of talking he deleted his profile from the dating app. He is 39 years old and was a military General who graduated from West Point &amp; also went to Army Ranger school so that‚Äôs pretty intense. He has worked in Wall Street before too &amp; is now a financial advisor in LA. I‚Äôm an 28 year old accountant. He did say he‚Äôs been to AZ a few times for boating &amp; hunting; he offered to buy my plane tickets so that I could visit him but I said i am not sure about that so then he said he will fly to me. The texting/calling/&amp; FaceTiming conversations seemed pretty legit but now thinking back he did put my hopes up by saying things like when you move to me you can work upstairs of my house, saying things like your dad &amp; I will get along, saying things like he thinks he will like me more than I like him when we meet, just hyping things up like there‚Äôs a future. He texts me everyday, we would call each other cute nicknames, &amp; he will text me good morning &amp; good nights. So it seemed like everything was in a promising direction. However in this rose colored glass situation, I have neglected other things/red flags such as him saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the most alpha male I‚Äôll ever meet‚Äù, ‚Äúall LA girls are superficial that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs looking outside of CA‚Äù, ‚Äúgay men are not real men‚Äù , ‚Äúhis deal breakers are someone who is a liberal‚Äù, ‚Äúhow he has not learned anything from his previous relationship lol‚Äù, ‚Äúhis ex girlfriend would cook for him even if she works too‚Äù, so right off the bat he does give off bad vibes but I just went with the flow. So finally in NYE he flew over to AZ &amp; I picked him up. The interaction was fine at first until I told him that today I also happened to have hung out with a gf whose bf was sick. He got all paranoid &amp; said well do I know if they are tested negative? I don‚Äôt so then I asked my friend &amp; waited for her to respond. It was after this incident it felt like the nice-ish mask came off and he showed me this frustrated side of him like how can I not know better. But I understand he is coming from a concerned point of view since he hasn‚Äôt really traveled since covid &amp; now he‚Äôs taking a risk with me. Anyways on this NYE day he met my best friend &amp; we played pool, jenga, swam and drank/smoked weed. When we headed back to the hotel he kissed me really deeply (like deep tongue French kissing), hugged me a little bit and then when he was about to open up my legs I told him I‚Äôm not ready for sex (bc the last time I did it was with my ex boyfriend which was almost 2 years ago)‚Ä¶he was like are you sure? And wanted to go/convince me further but I looked scared and replied yes I‚Äôm sure. His face got all disappointed, dropped my legs, and positioned his body to the edge of the bed back facing me &amp; arms crossed lol. That was such a weird response of him from my point of view but then I fell asleep. The next day I was still contemplating about the previous night‚Äôs weirdness. I am extremely attracted to him so in the morning I couldn‚Äôt keep my hands off of him‚Ä¶I started massaging his back and hugging him although his body language was still pretty repressed. He said he was disappointed he didn‚Äôt get a good time and that morning I was just super horny too (since it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve had sex) so I went for it with him. This time around though he did not kiss, cuddle, nor did any fore play with me. He went straight to condom &amp; intercourse. And it was not just regular sex but really rough sex‚Ä¶he was going extremely fast, was choking me, you can imagine the rest. Afterwards I asked him ‚Äúwhat are we?‚Äù And now he says he doesn‚Äôt believe in labels and just goes with the flow. lol. Well I was very disappointed with that response since I wanted more‚Ä¶he said technically this is our first time meeting like a first date so you can‚Äôt expect it to be anything. I guess I was really frustrated since I feel blindsighted &amp; thought we were more than that. The next few days you could only imagine our interactions not go too well. He started judging me  alot such as saying things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so clumsy, you talk so loud, you have no filter, why do you ask so many dumb questions, like do you not have any common sense?‚Äù I was just being myself like how I always been but now he‚Äôs judging me so hard &amp; saying things like how can he date someone like that? You are like a child‚Ä¶just calling me a bunch of BS. He also said things like I need a woman who will one up me &amp; put me to my place. In the moment I didn‚Äôt feel hurt but was kind of internally laughing because of how ridiculous his criticisms were. What is even more weird was that during a dinner date I personally didn‚Äôt think my food was wrong but he said it was not hot enough &amp; he is going to tell the waitress about it; when the waitress came &amp; asked how‚Äôs everything I replied everything is good. He got very infuriated because I guess I ‚Äúinterrupted‚Äù him lol. Even though it was my food &amp; I thought it‚Äôs fine. So then he complain to the waitress that ‚Äúmy food‚Äù wasn‚Äôt hot enough lol. On top of that he is not affectionate at all, power walks faster than me, doesn‚Äôt initiate any hand holds/hugs until I do, and doesn‚Äôt help me carry things. He also said he never kissed me when he clearly kissed me night 1 &amp; when we showered together once. I think the only good thing he‚Äôs said about me was he rates my attractiveness a 9 out of 10 &amp; that he rates himself a 5 out of 5 lol. Long story short on day 4 i dropped him off the airport so he can go back to LA. I told him to text me when he‚Äôs home but he never did so I texted him &amp; he said yes and we texted maybe for 2ish days but I was kind taking a little longer to respond to him because I was still processing over this weirdest encounter between us and he also mentioned in person one time that he needed time to think about how he feels about us so I just wanted to give him space. Anyways i really didn‚Äôt see a future with him since he explicitly told me he doesn‚Äôt do labels (which contrasts with him saying he wanted marriage from the past) so I reactivated my dating profile &amp; then 1 day later I saw him reactivated his dating profile too &amp; his bio again says he‚Äôs looking for marriage. Lol I guess he doesn‚Äôt see that with me. Anyways he did texted me that I am a sweet girl &amp; he is the a**hole with issues. I said I can help by sharing with him philosophy, Buddhism, behavioral science things I‚Äôve learnt to help him &amp; he said yes sure to the offer. So I wrote him papers on how to control anger, mental health fixings etc. He would occasionally like the documents I send to him. One random night he said he‚Äôs going to make a Snapchat to follow me &amp; I responded is it for naughty pictures which he responded maybe. Anyways he did send me a shirtless pic so I took a screenshot of it. And then again he got extremely angry &amp; said why the F did I screenshot it. I responded it‚Äôs really normal to screenshot snaps from Snapchat I do it with my friends too. So then he was like friends? And then said Bye and blocked me on Instagram. I tried to call and text him to explain what i mean but no response so then I sent an angry text myself too saying it‚Äôs really petty he feels the need to block my IG over that and he needs to grow up. And he responded ‚Äúhe‚Äôs going to need some time alone‚Äù. He has not blocked my phone number but just IG and now he never responds to any of my texts, which he hasn‚Äôt blocked my number yet since the texts will go as delivered. Anyways what do you guys think of this encounter? Do you think he just realized he is no longer interested in me? Or did he actually just played me?

The first date we had dinner and played this ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt really strangers game‚Äù and got super deep (emotionally lol). Then the next few dates were great and I literally helped him pick out furniture and art for his new place. I then spent hours helping him hang everything and get his new apartment together since he was new to the city. I‚Äôm probably naive but i thought picking out furniture/art with someone was kinda a big deal since you will have to look at that stuff forever. We didn‚Äôt actually hook up until the 3rd or 4th date and that was really just 2nd-3rd base.

But sadly I was ghosted and extremely confused because everything was going so well. I ended up deleting his number to prevent myself from texting him (but i didn‚Äôt block him because i really thought he would reach out) FAST FORWARD 4 MONTHS.. today I was swiping on hinge and i see him with a different name. I made a joke about him changing his name and we ended up matching again. 

He ended up texting my phone and i said ‚Äúwho‚Äôs this‚Äù because his number was deleted.

Maybe he just wasn‚Äôt that into me and didn‚Äôt want to sleep with me because he knew he didn‚Äôt want to pursue things further.. but if that‚Äôs the case then why reach out again?!?

So i guess my question is do i: block, cuss him out, or just delete his number again.

Because she is very close with her family, she will never leave the state of Ohio and even referenced dying there on more than on occasion. She plans on moving out later this year but that is up in the air still. Because of this, I am currently stuck in limbo not knowing if I should move back to Ohio for her and risk and sacrifice everything or continue to stay at my parents house in Ohio (while paying an apartment I'm not even at in the South). I want a solid plan moving forward, but she wont give me one because she wants to make sure we are stable (been on and off for 3 years) before giving me that. I dont know when she will give me this timeline, but it will at least be for a few months, all while Im here and paying rent for an apartment in the South. I also worry she will have much difficulty living on her own since shes lived at home her life and has been spoiled by her parents. What should I do here?

I love my boyfriend. We get along very well and have a great relationship aside from this issue. We started dating in high school and are now in a long-distance relationship since we picked different colleges. We took things pretty slow. Whenever something went further, I was almost always the one to initiate it. It took him 6 months to kiss me and 9 months to say I love you. Pretty soon after that, we did have some sexual contact (mostly grinding or touching over clothes). It did escalate into me giving him handjobs about 1 year in. He has only tried to give me handjobs a few times (maybe 5 total the entire relationship) because it typically doesn't feel good for me. We also started sexting a year in. He's definitely more bold over text and talks about sex. We used to sext a lot but don't do it much anymore. We typically stay up very late when we sext and my boyfriend wants to get to bed at a decent time because of his classes. At about 2 1/2 years into the relationship, I started giving him oral sex. He does tell me that he appreciates it and never asks me to do it, I always initiated it. I did mention after a couple times that while I am okay with him not being ready to perform oral sex on me yet, I expect that oral sex would not be a one-way street. That was over a year ago and he has never performed oral sex on me. I tried to talk about sex occasionally to see where his comfort level was and why. He has told me he is not ready yet, and I have always been supportive of that. His primary reasons he has given me is that he is worried about losing control (maybe with how sex will affect him??), he's still getting to know me, and we have time for that later on in our relationship. He will sometimes mention that he doesn't want me to get pregnant, but has also told me in the past he's not worried about that happening if we were to have sex (I have an IUD and would also use condoms). To me, these don't really make sense to me. I don't think the effects of sex are that much different that oral sex (correct me if I'm wrong). He also is not actively trying to get to know me better. We have conversations and ask each other questions, but they are more about our lives than him trying to get to know me better. I am am overthinker and these reasons just don't make sense to me. Am I doing something wrong? Is there something going on I don't know about?

Extra info:

He is a pretty quiet, calm guy. He is also awkward and is not very social. Pretty much a classic nerd. He isn't very horny (compared to my friend's boyfriends) but he still initiates some sexual contact and makes dirty jokes. He does not make me feel pressured to perform sexual favors. I end up initiating them as much as I can because that's the closest I can get to getting my own sexual needs met. He is very confusing when it comes to consent. He has made out with me, guided my hand into his pants, but then told me he wasn't in the mood when I went to take his pants off. He does reject my advances often, but it mostly happens when we are not home alone. He is respectful of me and would not be mad at me if I stopped sexual contact. He is bad at initiating things in general in the relationship. We have struggled with that in the past. I highly doubt he is cheating on me because he is very busy at school (he has a hard major) and is not great at socializing. I am aware this situation may make him look gay. We've talked about sexuality in the past (I'm bi) and he seemed to be okay with talking about it. His parents would not reject him if he were to come out as gay.

Growing up, purity culture was constantly forced on me by my parents. I was taught that if I was a virgin when I got married, I would be like a fresh piece of gum for my husband. But if I had sex before I got married, it would be like someone already chewed on me and no one wants a piece of chewed up gum. I was punished for being curious about sex growing up. I realized about a year and a half into my relationship how toxic and damaging that was for me. I told my boyfriend I was ready to take things further, which hasn't happened yet. I am still a Christian but I do not want to wait until marriage. He is also a Christian and he told me that waiting for marriage is not a motive for not having sex. My virginity makes me feel like I am still trapped in purity culture and I don't want it anymore. He knows this. I feel embarrassed talking to my friends about it because no one else I know is having this problem. I also feel like I'm missing out on the experience of having sex as a young adult. My reasoning for wanting to have sex is more about the intimacy and experience than the pleasure. I do have a vibrator so I am able to pleasure myself, but I still find myself longing for that level of intimacy with him. I am very much a physical touch person. Physical touch is not his first love language, but he is okay with physical touch and does initiate it.

Pretty soon after I started my freshman year of college (he was a senior in high school). I realized he was watching porn after I made a joke about him watching it and he blew it off. We had not set this as a boundary in our relationship, but I consider it to be cheating. I know that I should have told him this before and was dumb to assume he wasn't watching porn. I had a lot of issues in the past with self confidence and feeling attractive. I do not have a very curvy body so it made me think he was watching other girls because he didn't find me attractive. We had a conversation about it and he said he wouldn't do it anymore if I wasn't okay with it. A few months later I brought it up again because I didn't trust him yet. I have never been in his phone or had his passcode, but he's always had mine. I gave it to him without him asking. So I mentioned that in the conversation and he said his dad told him he shouldn't let anyone have his passcode. (He is not a controlling person). He kept repeating this instead of talking about my concern. He eventually said no and we haven't talked about it since. I kind of doubt that he is still watching it because he felt bad about it and he isn't very horny anyways.

I do not want to force him to do anything he doesn't want to do. I just wished he wanted me in the same way I want him. I don't like bringing it up a ton because I do not want to make him feel like he has to have sex with me. I sometimes wonder what it would be like to have a relationship with someone that would have sex with me. I am worried that this will build up and make me lose feelings for him.

Has anyone else had this problem? What do I do???
