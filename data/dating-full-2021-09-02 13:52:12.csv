We've known each other for a month, so a relatively short while but during this time we've had 2 dates, a weekend together and have been in daily contact. There have been lengthy phone calls too. So its pretty much gotteb intense fairly quickly. 

Now typically i would be hesitant or cautious about anything if it was at this speed, but to give you context ive been single for over 3 years and in the last 2 years have been actively dating. There have been many a first dates and a few where weve dated very slowly and its fizzled out. So at this stage, i feel quite secure in myself, and know what i want, am looking for and what I won't tolerate. 

Anyways this guy, i have to admit, at first instance i didnt look at him and think wow and to be honest, i still have some concerns/reservations (i.e. he hasnt totally won me over and im not crazy about him... Yet). 

I liked the confidence at first, and then as weve talked, i realize how smart he is, and how much we have in common. The first time we talked, the first date, it felt like id met someone ive known all my life. The level of comfort i feel around him is amazing. 

Hes very complimentary, caring, sensitive, smart, gentle, grounded. Had an idea of goals/ambition, quite masculine and strong which means i feel free to let down my hyper independent persona i put on. Thus sounds really positive etc, but i can see that he has a darker side, his trauma, he seems insecure about his body, addicted to the gym. So at this stage i feel like i have a fairly balanced view of him and although i know there's more to learn, i feel like i know who this person fundamentally is. 

About me, i have a lot of baggage, mainly trauma and i keep this hidden but during our most recent date/time together i told him some of it. I have extremely extensive scarring from self harming throughout my teenage years which has been a deal breaker for many and. He found the scars hard to stomach, which was expected and feels that i am quite troubled because of my history. 

Anyways the last time we spent time together, we had an absolutely amazing time, it was beautiful we both connected on every level possible but on the way back, the conversation was based a lot around his last relationship, and what he is looking for in the future. I guess what stuck with me the most was this phrase he said ""im looking for someone a bit screwy"" which basically to me sounded like im too much for him. 

Anyways im feeling quite down by this because the way he talks about me and about what he is looking for and what he liked about his ex basically says to me that i am what he is looking for. It feels like what's holding him back is mainly fear that we could be toxic together because of my (past) and his (current) struggles. 

Anyhow, i didn't want to pressurise him or anything so i asked if this is goodbye, because although i would ve gutted, i totally respect if he doesn't want anything more with me. He responded that hes not good with good byes and asked i let him know when i get home and when i said i might do, he was worried he'd made me upset. When we were saying goodbye he sort of lingered. 

Anyway, i since reflected and let him know i got home safe and he has since reflected/reminisced about how much of a great time we had together and how i made him feel. I told him that i feel confused about us and he just agreed, so i dont understand what is going on at the moment. 

Im refraining from any deep conversations and we're not messaging as often as prior, more like the odd, how are you albeit the messages are daily. 

I don't know what to do, part of me says just step back and if he wants he will pursue and the other part of me says just keep it light and see how things go - dont make a rash decision and say goodbye or bring this up again. I don't know what to do, and i feel incredibly confused. 

Most of my friends have suggested giving it time.

He has a very close relationship with his ex-SIL who he calls his sister. His brother was married to her, but he isn’t part of the family anymore and they don’t speak to him. The SIL has been in my bf’s life since he was a teenager. She is a little older than him.

I’m concerned about how close my bf is with his “sister”. Here are some examples of why: 

• Inappropriate touching -When we are out together, his SIL is almost always with us. It could be in a group setting - they have a big friend group that she is part of - or just the 3 of us. When they say goodnight, he will hug her from behind, or give her a big hug, grab her face, and kiss her multiple times but never on the lips. 

• If we have a date night, she has invited herself and her daughter (my bfs niece) to tagalong with us. Usually I don’t mind, but sometimes it can be annoying. 

• 50% of the time we see each other, the SIL is there. 

• they text and call each other every day. 

• If he takes me on a date, the next evening she will call him and ask to go out to eat with him. They have 1:1 time together at least once a week. 

• if we are in a group, she will ask to go somewhere private so they can have a conversation just to themselves. 

• she has told me before that I don’t need to take things too “fast” with him and that my bf falls in love easily with women. 

• since the SIL is single, if she ends up talking to a guy she meets when we are out together, my bf will watch her closely and be focused on her. 

All of this came to a boiling point last week when we were coming home from a baseball game and my bf and I got dropped off at his apartment. The SIL got out of the car just so they could have their weird hugs and so he could kiss her and “comfort” her because apparently she was not in a good mood after the game. 

This turned into a big argument where he started yelling at me pretty bad, a side of him that I haven’t seen before. I think things got overheated because we had all been drinking, and I did storm off when I saw them hugging, kissing, and whispering to each other. He said how could I accuse him of having an inappropriate relationship with his sister? But the thing is, she’s not his bio sister, she is his brothers ex-wife. When I said this, he got really angry and told me that his brother is dead to him. 

I think one thing his “sister” is trying to do is make my bf the main person she goes to for emotional support. She is recently single and has never really been single before. She knows he is willing to take care of her to an extent. 

But I feel like and outsider. I’m left wondering where I fit in, and how my bf and I can form a strong emotional bond when so much time is focused on the SIL.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,984684,public,self,Concerned that my bf has feelings for his “sister”,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pgjdnq/concerned_that_my_bf_has_feelings_for_his_sister/,all_ads,6,,,

I am confused because she showed every sign of interest. I even Googled some of it to make sure. How can she give clear signs of interest only to tell on me and embarrass me like that?

&amp;#x200B;

* She answered my questions in depth
* She smiled when talking to me
* She told me I did a good job and that I should keep it up
* She gave me good grades
* She laughed when I imitated Caligula or a Paleolithic troglodyte (she's a history teacher)

I live on the East Coast US and I spend the majority of my time working (no complaints, love my current job as a barback). It's been 2 years since my break-up and I'm interested in seeing people again. I'm not currently in college due to COVID, but I've been staying busy and productive nonetheless.

In contrast with many men/""boys"" my age, I am genuinely looking for something real. My last relationship lasted 2 years, and despite being only 15 when it started, it was an extremely mature and healthy one to be in, at least in the beginning. I ended things off when ""dating"" turned into her coming over to my house just to sleep, cuddle, and have sex instead of going on dates, having meaningful conversations, and working towards something. No disrespect at all to her, but it wasn't something I felt content with anymore.

I find dating apps/sites to be an incredibly diluted experience. It's like you have to take all of the emotion and vulnerability out of the process of talking with someone who you may or may not like, and then suddenly bring it back when things are going well, just to get ghosted. Perhaps a bit of pessimistic view, but regardless, I'd like to stay away from online dating for the time being.

If I were 21, the obvious answer to my question would be to go to a bar. It's where my parents met, my parents' married friends met, and where most of my friends' parents met. I see it all the time in my work. But regardless of whether or not alcohol is the true social lubricant that gets everything started, I'd rather not go down that route in the future.

I met my ex-girlfriend at a county school-funded event my parents forced me to go to. Kind of funny how that worked out.

While obviously it's most important that wherever I'm going I actually want to be there for my own sake and not to just cast my fishing line, I'm curious to know places that tend to spark socializing a little more than others.

I feel like I hit the lottery with her!

I’ve lived in NY my whole life and shes from Malaysia and she has been traveling and going to school internationally for a large majority of her life. My early childhood was in poverty, as my parents were immigrants and had to receive benefits from the government. Right now I manage an ice cream store and make a little over $50,000 a year after taxes and work 50 hours a week, planning to own the store in the next few years.

On the other hand, she owns several businesses, her own clothing line, she’s also a freelance model, and an influencer. 

Her family has A LOT of money (they have maids, animal caretakers, and licensed exotic animals walking around their home) and I can’t help but feel intimidated and a little pressured by it. I really do feel like I’m falling in love with her, but I feel like I have to address this insecurity with her to have our relationship proceed further. 

Part of me feels like I shouldn’t be concerned about this, but it’s such a drastic different in lifestyles it’s almost scary to me.

If anyone has any tips, advice, opinions, or perspectives  on how I should approach this or anything at all on this situation, it will be much appreciated!

For me personally I still try to meet in person as well as use apps and double dip. 

Something I’ve noticed in just this last week alone, was that I’ve had 3 or 4 separate opportunities to ask a woman out in person, but didn’t follow through not because of fear of rejection, but for the fear of being labeled ‘creepy’. 

For one example I went hiking by myself last weekend and came across a trip of friends. One of the women in that group actually fell behind to talk to me and seemed interested in casual conversation. Later during the hike I ran into them again but she was alone while her friends were in the lake. I thought to myself, “Nows your chance to ask her out dummy.” I sat there for maybe a full two minutes trying to force myself to do it; but alas I chickened out because I didn’t want to be awkward and come of creepy while she was with her friends. 

Another example was at a local Best Buy where a woman purposely looked back at me as we were both walking into the store and said “hi how are you?” Seemed like a great opening to have some conversation and maybe see where it went. I finished in the store first but when she came out seemed like she was in a hurry and left pretty fast. I didn’t want to be that creep who runs up to her car and try to keep talking. 

I guess my point is that after reading so much advice from Reddit that women just want to be left alone out in public, I keep myself at distance from making a move in fear of being that creepy guy. I could care less if they so no, but I never even make it to the point of asking them out.

Don't have anyone irl I can open up with so reddit to the rescue. I am 29M and there is this girl I have been seriously interested since the last 4 years, we went graduate school together. We did became friends at one point and I did confess my feelings as well but was rejected but still we kept the friendship (we did had a couple of romantic moments during this time where we hold hands after I asked her to),few months later we had a horrible fight(I acted immature here) and we stopped talking completely and blocked each other on social media only except one, this was in 2019.  


After that I just dropped one text after around 8 months of no text/contact apologizing for my behavior and thanking them for our good times together as I was leaving the town we were in. They replied and wished me well. End of story and no further contact from either side. 

Now from then till end of 2020 the only social media we were connected on whenever I posted a story they would always view it , never missed a single one although I didnt post a lot tbh. Made me think that she remembers me as well since I tried a lot but could not move on myself honestly. Fast forward earlier this year I reached out just asking about how she has been and all that casual stuff. Got replies some with enthusiasm which fizzled out fast. (mixed signals) so I stopped again. Then few months back she commented on my story which was just my selfie, I was surprised cz she never did that ever giving clear attention, even when we were friends. 

I again tried to stir up a conversation ended up getting cold responses again. Stopped again trying to talk to her. Now I post another a week back and she commented again with no interest to talk further when I replied.

I've been dating this amazing guy for over 8 months now, and I think he's the best. He also has invested a lot of his resources into me, mostly money and time, but also effort and affection... whether its planning an expensive weekend away, or him outfitting me in better gear for our backpacking trips, or buying me pottery classes that I've wanted to do for a long time. He's a very generous guy, and very thoughtful.

 I don't make much money but I love gift giving. So i decided to go out on a limb and put together a book for him called ""30 reasons that you make me happy"". Some of the reasons are funny and silly (i love it when you backseat drive), others are more serious (i love how supportive you are of my goals in life).

The issue is that I told some of my dude friends about it, who all thought it was cheesy and cringey, and a little too much. It made me feel pretty awful as its in production now and I don't know if maybe this gift is too much too soon since we haven't even been together a year, or if its something he'd be embarrassed to have lying around his place.

My date last night was more of a friend date/potential
hookup and gave me the following feedback:

""You're a sweet guy, and very attractive. You need to just get out more"" then said she wants to go on a 2nd date for fun. It's a happening bar/live music scene in the city. I know her intentions are to have sex after lol. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that this absolutely gorgeous 45 year old is just looking for a hookup, give my age, but with my life the way it is I'm anxiously looking forward to it. She's a well to do business woman in my area and super well connected. I'm not worried about her at all. Not sure how I got here but...I think I need this. It's not me, but my life sucks and I never got to experience things growing up.

Date #2 is tonight. A walk in the park with a sweet redhead who is my age. No kids, and wants something serious. I'm excited to finally get to talk in person after a couple weeks. There's mystery to her as I don't know her intentions 100%. She's not a hookup girl and I'm fine with that, it's refreshing. But I don't know what she thinks of me long term or her views on things. Guess we will see!

Date #3 is a potential only and waiting on a reply, super cute blonde with one small toddler. Like minded politically, and already pre-vetted by a common friend who hooked us up. It's the unknown out of the three. Also the most attractive to me physically.

It seems like dating wise I'm doing ok since my big breakup, but I'm worried that my more reserved lifestyle will hurt me. I don't drink and won't drink, I don't really like bars and clubs at all it's not my scene.

I met a girl via Tinder. On our first date we had drinks together while having very interesting conversations and I then went home at about 4am. The next day she thanked me for the great evening she had and told me she would love to see me again. Of course I said me too as she is cute and I really liked her as well.

So she came to my place the following week, again we talked a lot until early in the morning, we had sex, slept together and I took her home. When I said goodbye, she kissed me on my mouth.

We conversed via text messages the following days, I asked her if she wanted to meet me again and she said yes, but progressively she started to take longer to respond and acted like she wasn't interested anymore. I was like WTF? So I asked again, do you really want to meet one more time? She agreed but said she finds me very interesting and nice but more as a friend.

I am a bit disappointed of course, I told her I am OK with that despite I would have liked to meet one more time and maybe try a more serious relationship. I added I would have liked to know earlier that we weren't on the same page.

So first, why do girls prefer to show disinterest step by step and not say directly that they are not interested? Maybe she didn't want to hurt but I think the way she did it is a lot worst.

And, do you think she met another guy she finds more interesting and that would explain why she changed her mind?

Also, should we stay friends and meet again? Or should I just delete her number? I am not in love with her so I am not very sad or anything but it was just very frustrating.

What do you think about her behaviour?

So I recently reconnected with a childhood friend. We have been texting for a month and half straight every single day. I think it’s clear that he likes me , however he lives in Texas and I am in California. On top of that he is a truck driver and I work from home. I like the idea of building something with him and I can tell he is been trying hard to stay engaged in the conversation and move this along. He is always on the road and sometimes when he is off , he doesn’t text for a couple of days. I didn’t think much of it but last time he was MIA for 5 days straight. I thought that was weird. I brought it up to him and he said he was resting. I know it’s bullshit but I didn’t pursue it further cause I thought this whole thing is very recent and I shouldn’t bring drama into it . I don’t believe in long distance relationship so my understanding, is that at some point if this evolves, one of us would have to move. We have talked about every subject that a couple would take about raging from mariage, kids, sex and pretty much anything under the sun. I’m holding back and still don’t consider this as a relationship whatsoever cause you know nothing is official yet. I talked to my friend and she encouraged me to take a leap of faith and travel to see him so  told him that I was going to book a flight and go see him.  I have him a couple of weekends date for September and he was available on the 18th but busy the other weekend. Unfortunately, I also have plans that weekend. It was my understanding that he has more freedom because he is a truck driver and can pretty much take a weekend off if he wanted to. This is where I am conflicted, if he really wanted to see me , he would jump on this opportunity and free one of his weekends. especially because I’m traveling to him. I’m thinking about taking a step back because I don’t want to be his “ pen pal “ of virtual fling while he is on the road or bored. He says he wants to see me and blah blah blah but actions speak louder than words. Also, we have been talking consistently for a month. Is this too soon to want to see him?

Also kind of venting after what seemed kind of scary.

I went on a second date with a guy. First date was just coffee and lunch which was fine. Second date-We live on opposite sides of town and both took busses to get to the center of town and meet up, each ride takes maybe 1.5 hours. For context, the bus is totally safe, the parts of town we met in and respectively live in are totally safe. We met up around noon and hung out until about 4 PM and at that point I had to leave-I had some work to do for the next day which for me (but not him) was a working day. I'd told the guy this ahead of time. He kept insisting that I stay.  Date went...okay...some awkward silences bordering on ominous. This is a feeling you get hard to explain on here. Finally around 5 I told him I really had to go.

He insisted that he would ride the bus, with me, to my side of town aka the opposite side of town for him. I told him it's fine (I was honestly really exhausted and also my gut feeling was saying something may be off with this pushy guy). But he kept insisting. The third time of insisting he said something along the lines of ""there's this coffee shop that's one stop away from your stop that I want to do groceries at""-of note that coffee shop isn't all that unique, but okay. We get on the bus. The stop where his coffee shop is at was 5 mins before mine. It was broad daylight and as I said, totally safe bus-I thanked him for accompanying me and told him his stop is coming up and he can get off here and the shop he's looking for is right there. The dude insisted that he would accompany me home even after I said I'm totally fine. So totally skipped that shop. At this point warning bells were going off in my mind. This wasn't a sketchy bus, sketchy part of town or late at night. It was totally safe to be out walking alone/on a bus alone. Why was this dude so pushy even after I said I'm fine multiple times?

The dude comes to my stop, gets off and insists on walking to my apartment with me. And once we get to the building, he asks me if there is a restroom in the lobby that he can use. This may have been a legit question, but also may be an excuse to get up to my place-and, for context he had just used the restroom a few hours ago, after which no food or fluid intake...

The vibes were too creepy and pushy, obviously there wasn't a restroom in the lobby and I did NOT invite him up to my place to use the restroom there as I was worried something may seriously have been up.

He was very attentive with lots of hand holding, touching my back when we were walking, a lot of indications that we were both into each other. Anyway, as it tends to do, during our text/phone conversations, sex came up and the conversations often delved down that road. 

After we met for dinner and drinks we wanted to hang out for a bit and wound up sitting in my car to talk. Which of course led to making out. Which of course led to … more of an oral nature. I had already emphasized that this was something I liked to do and offered but he was already talking about the next date saying wed have to go to his place so we had more room for him to return the favor, etc. 

Anyway, the night came to an end and was lovely. He texted me goodnight once I got home. And again the next day. He'd told me a few days prior that work would be crazy that day due to an event so i didn't expect to hear too much from him. I got a few kissy emojis throughout the day which i thought was cute.

We both got divorced earlier this year and kind of became divorce chat buddies. In total we have known each other around 5 years. I wouldn't say we are flirty, but have good chemistry when we talk. A couple of times since then during social occasions, she has asked me some probing questions, if I'm dating anyone. At the time I always took it as if she were asking what it was like dating post divorce as I was a little earlier than her. But could she have been thinking of asking me out?? I always responded with fun stories from my post divorce dating misadventures, which I'm now afraid may have scared her off.

I thought about gauging her interest at one point, but there are a few reasons why she may not be into me. I think she wants kids in her future, I already have 2, and a vasectomy (she is 38, I'm 44). She is a little taller than me, and much more of a beast in the gym than I am. I think she may want a traditional attentive boyfriend, but I'm a little limited in that area as I have primary custody of my kids and they come first in my life. If I thought she were actually interested I would jump at the chance because she is a great person not to mention gorgeous.

So in any event, we've been in each other's DMs and are looking like we're gonna grab drinks Saturday. She actually invited me out last week with a few mutual friends but I had to decline.

In view of this whole situation, should I believe she is interested here? I have history of reading these things wrong.

I met him initially through work - same organization but completely different roles/normal job sites. I had just begun working there (I graduated college in May of this year) and he's been around for a year. There was immediate attraction between us both and we kept bumping into each other. One thing led to another, he asked me out, and we've gone on a few dates. He's been consistent, straightforward, and the standards I have for a partner have been met graciously and naturally (honesty, respect, effort, communication, chemistry, shared goals/values, and I enjoy spending time with him more than being by myself). 

I guess I am struggling for two reasons. First, insecurity because he's accomplished a lot in his life time - he's a recovering addict (we both work in the field of mental health/substance use and abuse) and has been clean for eight years. He graduated college around the age of 30, taught history to at-risk youth for several years, he lived in a major city and dated a high-profile hair dresser for years before he moved to another major city in the US and worked in a director position networking for another recovery/treatment org. He was extremely important and worked insane hours from what he told me. 

I am also struggling because he has an astounding ability to retain and apply knowledge that he learns and while I love to read and learn, I have a really hard time articulating my thoughts well/mentioning knowledge I've obtained when pertinent and I wind up just listening a lot. He's practical, efficient, clever, good-humored, articulate, wildly extroverted - all things I admire in someone else. To some extent, I know I have these qualities myself (although I am absolutely more introverted). But he's incredibly well-rounded. I struggle feeling like I am adding anything important to his life. I know this is my own personal insecurity projecting outwards but it's not insignificant. I am doing my best to take things one day at a time and not attempting to control the future.

Has anyone else ever dated someone significantly older than them? I love spending time around him so much. He told me I would be welcome to join him on his holiday with his friends and he went so far as to tell his friends about me. On our first date he showed me all around his hometown and talked about his life experiences. He is not shy about liking me/telling me the things he appreciates about me (he's told me I'm witty, intelligent, pretty, compassionate, etc.). But he's extremely cultured. And I feel as though I'm just starting my beginnings in becoming that way myself where I've been in school for the last half decade. I guess I'm looking for support, advice, and insights.

I am 35/M and matched with a girl, 33, off Bumble. I have a full time job, my own car and home. She is living with her parents at the moment, as she moved here from New York a few years ago. This was a bit different however. The girl, let's call her ""Krystal"" had her friend, let's call her ""Sara"" set up a dating profile for her. So when I matched, I was talking with Sara. I thought it was different, but creative as from my POV, her friend gets to ""screen"" the guys for Krystal. Texting with Sara, I seemed to get along with her. She asked why she should ""pick"" me as a potential date. I told her I don't think I'm better than anyone and I don't do drugs, stay out of trouble, etc. Sara seemed to approve. We eventually set up a day/time to meet Krystal, and the day of, Sara gave my number to Krystal. We start texting that day.

We met for coffee, we were there about 3 hours. I thought it went pretty well, and we talked for a bit outside after. I find out she is a teacher at my old elementary school. I ask her to dinner, to which she says yes. In the meantime, we would text almost every day. Not constantly, but on and off. Some days I would text first, some days she would text first. It was about 50/50, I felt like I didn't have to ""guess"" when to text her. I felt comfortable talking with her.

After we checked our schedules, I asked her after texting a bit more, if she wanted to grab dinner Thursday night. She said she was busy. I did not get a follow up day (""I'm busy but what about this day?"") so I assumed that was that, but we still kept texting. Saturday night she went out with some friends, one of them Sara. She was texting me while out with them, then an hour or so went by and she texts me if I'm free Monday for dinner. I thought maybe her friends were telling her to text me to set something up. We agree to meet Monday night at 6:30. Monday comes, and maybe 3:30 or so I get the dreaded ""You're gonna hate me"" text. She had to cancel as her stomach started bothering her. I tell her no worries, and asked her if she needed anything. She said no thanks but it was sweet that I asked.

We are still texting, I ask her how she is doing the next day and she said she felt better. Texting on/off still and she asks me if I'm free Friday for dinner. We set up a time and place, and she said she would see if we could do a reservation. Fast forward to Friday, we meet up and the dinner date lasted an hour. I didn't get the vibe that she wanted to eat then leave, it was just we ate and that was it. She did most of the talking. I paid, she offered to give me some cash but I told her no worries, I got it. After, I walked her to her car, I didn't want to get too close and creep her out or anything. She suggested before I could, that she has a wedding to plan/go to the week after next, so maybe we could do something the next week. I agreed, said I had a good time. No hug/kiss or anything. I was standing about a foot from her, so for me personally, if I tried to kiss or hug her it would have been awkward.

We keep texting throughout the week, but between school starting up soon and the wedding coming up we didn't have time to hang out, plus her car was being serviced so she had no car. I offered if she wanted to do something I could pick her up. She said she would let me know, but nothing ever happened. The week of the wedding the texting became less and less, but I knew she was busy with that and wanted to take a step back and not hound her. For example, I texted her Thursday night, just saying hope you had a great week and good luck with the wedding. She got back to me the next day saying thanks and it was starting to get hectic (with a smiley face). I simply texted back ""Enjoy!""

I waited until Sunday afternoon to text her, as I figured people were getting ready to leave at that point if anyone stayed over. I ask her how the wedding and her weekend was. We start texting, then talk about school starting this week and Labor Day. I mention that I have a 3 day weekend, and if she is free I'd love to see her again. Never responded after that. I have no idea what happened, now I have to sit here and think ""should I not have asked? was it too soon to ask? should I have had her ask?"" If you're gonna ghost, why even respond to my text in the first place? Every time we texted, she seemed happy to talk to me (example - ""Hey! I'm doing well. How is your day going?"" she also used smiley emojis in our texts).

Just for the hell of it, Tuesday night after work I sent her a text saying ""Hey I haven't heard from you. I enjoyed going out and talking with you, I thought things were going well but if you're not interested I understand and no worries. I just don't want to be left hanging."" I still never heard from her. I deleted her number before I went to bed that night. I usually don't send texts after I've been ghosted but we talked on/off almost every day for a month and went out twice. A simple ""thanks but no thanks"" would have been fine.

\[Optional\] Other possibly relevant information

**Date Prep**

I put reasonable effort into my appearance before the date: shower, clip nails, trim the beard, cologne etc... and wear some decent shoes, nice dark well fitting jeans, collared shirt ironed immediately beforehand. I get to dates \~15 minutes early.

**Things that may be helping me:**

I have a pretty successful career, have some hobbies, keep in shape via running and biking, and though I've never been particularly popular, I have and have had good friends (of both genders) my whole life.

**Things that may be hurting me:**

I'm short (5' 5"") - however I have this in my profile, so my dates know this before they agreed to go on the date and I assume are fine with it.

Pretty skinny (I've lifted religiously for 3 years in the past; my lifts were not terrible - I could 1RM Bench bodyweight, but I didn't gain much muscle). I have a picture of me in a t-shirt in my profile, so my general build should be clear.

My ethnic background is Indian (2nd gen immigrant) which comes with some unfortunate stereotypes. But again, this is completely obvious from my name, profile, and pictures.

I have a speech impediment (similar to that of the titular king in The King's Speech).
