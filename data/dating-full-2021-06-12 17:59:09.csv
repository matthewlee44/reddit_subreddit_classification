It happened when she came with me to watch the sunset at the school rooftops when after the theatrical practice when I ordered 3 boxes of pizza. One for the theater, one for those who asked, and one for me. Then we were last alone so I asked if she wanted to watch the sunset with me in one of my secret spots. She said yes so, we went to the school rooftops restricted to students. The sunset was beautiful The scene was like those you see in movies so I chuckled and jokingly said along the lines.   
 

“What a beautiful sunset...”    
 “Hey, do you like me?”   
 

I was expecting she would say no like they usually do so I’d shrug it off like a regular conversation, but nooo,   
 She said with a small pause “Y… yes...”  
 So i was shocked and also surprised.. So then I thought it was a joke so I said... “You sure?”  
 She then replied with a firm, “YES!” anime style.  
 At this point in life I didn’t believe in courtship and leaned on more to “If you like each other, date! If it doesn't work out, then that’s it. None of the trying to convince you I’m a good person bs.” type of dating. So, I blurted, “you want us to be a thing?” And she replied with a straight face “Yes.”   
 

“Cool. I guess I have a girlfriend now” I said to myself while my first thoughts in my head was... “I wonder when we’ll break up? 5 minutes? tomorrow? Next week? Next month? Eh… I’ll just enjoy it while it lasts...  
 

I offered her a pizza slice, then We both looked at the sunset peacefully as a new couple   
 ... until she remembered she forgot her sister was waiting for her.  
 

Long story short,  
 She was my first GF, I knew it would end sooner or later cause she was young, I loved her whole heartedly nonetheless. It was sweet and I had a decent experience. She got cold 2 months later and on the 4th month, we broke up in campus.  
 

After that experience. I realized I’m not mentally, and emotionally mature for a romantic relationship.  
 I still miss her form time to time, and I was thankful for the experience.  
 

people still saw me as a pedophile since I sold brownies and gummy worms to elementary and highschool.  
 

But I didn't choose her because she was young.  
 

Being honest, she was the first to admit to me she liked me (like first time ever), so I just grabbed the opportunity for the experience.  
 

So that’s my story on how I accidentally got a girlfriend.

So I was on the train last Monday and I saw this beautiful lady. I'm 31y and i hate dating apps so I walked straight to this girl and made my move. Just told her she had very beautiful eyes and that I wanted to know her.

She was really happy and all smiles told me she was flattered and all we've chatted a lot then when we left the train station we kissed and we added each other on Instagram. I don't know if this matters but she's 24y and i told her I'm 31y. We texted each other that very same day and she told me she arrived safe at home. I replied her and she never replied me back which felt like a first red flag but fine. A day later I texted her again just like ""Hey how's things"" like 8 hours later she replied and told me she was fine and asked of i was fine, I then replied her and again she didn't there was no ""seen"" on my texts as well. This time i didn't text her again, she was checking all my stories.

Today she just blocked me on Instagram and I don't know why :(

Is it that wrong nowadays to start things like this? I mean if she didn't want anything she didn't have to kiss me or anything. I was polite and respectful.

Age doesn't matter too much to me as long as it's within boundaries. To sketch the situation, that does mean I can feel attracted to women of 16-17 just as well as to those of 28-29 or those of my exact age, if their behaviour is attractive to me.

Over the past years, I've tried multiple ""dating apps"". Some of those were also available for younger people of 16-18. As of today, most (if not all) aren't anymore. 

Dating apps are highly biased towards women, as we all probably know. It's not easy to be successful as a young male, and I know that. Getting a decent amount of fruitful likes/matches is really, really hard for most men. Even for a (as far as I know) reasonably decent looking and sociable guy as myself.

However, when I used other apps years ago where I could meet younger people (also some considered under-age nowadays), I got plenty. Literally hundreds of ""likes"". Well, obviously I'm way too old for that app now.

I wonder, why did I use to get so many matches with underage women when I used to be just over 18, while now these apps are purely 18+ (which is pretty well understandable), I practically get zero?

We messaged each other everyday for almost 7 days but I'm the guy who initiates conversation the most. 

I actually ask her to meet in person after we start messaged for an hour because I think texting means nothing compared to actually seeing how they act in person. Then she said ""that was too fast, you don't even know what I look like and this is kind of dangerous to meeting random people like that"" And this is my response ""I understand what you worrying so if you want we can meet at the public place have a good conversation get to know each other and I think texting is kind of waste of time tbh because I think having a conversation in person for even just 10mins are still way better than sending text message to each other about 10 hours"" At least in my past dating experience I basically just ask the girl out after she gave me her number none of them are playing hard to get and we setup date pretty fast so idk if I was wrong. 

Anyway, she still said no so I was like fine...... So we messaged each other everyday and like I said I'm the guy who initiates conversation the most. After we sending messages to each other for 2 or 3 days then I ask her again ""do you want to meet next week?"" And she said no again because she thinks maybe I'm still dangerous maybe I'm a murder bah bah bah. Then here's my response ""So you think I'm going to murder you at Starbucks????? And there is no point you still think I'm going to hurt you if you see my post history"" And Here's the thing she knows my reddit username and she looks at my reddit post history so she knows my life story and I'm cybersecurity working at bank company rn. Like I really don't understand like we sending tons of message a day and she still thinks I'm dangerous.

Ok fine I'm about to leave because she is wasting my f\*\*king time tbh. But then she send me a message ""I actually have some anxiety problem need to see therapy and my mom overprotect me, I don't have friend and I'm very shy blan blan blan something like that. What about we setup a video call before we see each other"" To me, it is definitely fine so I tell her ok let me know when you're free for the video call :)

So we keep sending messages to each other. After 4 days she told me I can video call at night. I was like omg yes finally we can talk. but tbh I don't really like video call because I'm the type of guy who looks ugly in a selfie but looks way better in person nvm so I set up a zoom meeting for her and she responded to me ok. I send her the meeting ID so she can join but then she literally no response to me so I'm a dumb idiot waiting for her to join my zoom meeting for almost 30mins. After 30 mins I'm done I close the meeting and I feel like it is so god damn rude tbh. 

After 2 hours she sends me a message ""A guy he having very hard time and he calls me so I spend 2 hours talking to him"" I was like are you f\*\*king serious????????????????????????????????????????????? but then I said ""If you can't join the meeting for whatever reason at least you should send me a message let me know so I don't need to wait u for 30mins"" she responded ""I'm sorry Imao""

I have dated 4 girls in the past but the connection isn't the same with this girl. 

Anyway, she makes me want to vomit. Because I could have done *so many* other things with the time I spend on her. I feel like I'm so stupid at the same time I just want to vent to someone. The worst thing is I look at her posts history yesterday and I saw her keep posting sh\*t on [reddit.com/r/cuddlebuddies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cuddlebuddies/) she is looking for cuddlebuddy wtf. I was like why are you looking for a cuddlebuddy if you're that scared to meeting people in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

Just for reference I meet her on [reddit.com/r/MeetPeople/](https://reddit.com/r/MeetPeople/) and this is my post looks like

\[21M\] Fort Lauderdale wants to meet someone

Hello,

I’m 21M from Hong Kong currently living in US for almost 5 years.

I have a full-time job work 9-5 Monday to Friday(remote) but I never went to college. I don't have many friends now since I lose almost all my friends after graduate high school.

I really want to date someone....... Let's meet up at a coffee shop, restaurant or park

We can talk about anything. I don't really mind if you're a guy or girl at this point tbh. Even I kind of want a relationship more than friendship but I mean having more friends is never a bad thing right :)

If I’m giving an honest assessment of myself, I’m kind of a catch. I’m pretty cute, active, doing great financially and with my career, fun, great cook, kind, bright, with lots of interests. I’m really who I want to be - I mean, I’ve got things I’m working on, but I feel really happy with where my life is right now. I find it easy to make friends, and my life is full of people I love who love me. Except romantically. I’ve been single for over three years now, and it’s been the same story again and again. I’ll go on a few dates with someone I think is really a great match. Conversation is easy, physical attraction is great, we share the same values and relationship goals. 

Then, it’ll happen - sometime in between the “getting to know you” stage and the “we’re a thing” stage, I’ll get the text. He needs time to work on himself. He’s just not feeling the click. He’s realized he’s not quite over the ex.

I am crushed, because I’ve just started feeling like we could be something together. After this happening repeatedly, constantly, over the last three years, I’m starting to lose hope. I can’t seem to bounce back. Every time I let myself like someone, it’s haunted by this feeling that I shouldn’t, because I’ll just get hurt. Every time I see a text from a date, a little voice in my head has started saying, “this is it, it’s the one, he’s ending it.” 

I hate that I’m approaching dating with this anxious little voice in my head. It’s even worse because the anxious little voice has been right so often that it's no longer so little. I used to be a really securely attached person who had a lot of fun with dating- who could say, “well, that’s unfortunate, but must not have been meant to be” when it didn’t work out. Now, it’s turned to, “of course it didn’t work out - you knew it wouldn’t work out, because it never works out.”

I know a girl with whom I have worked for 1 year and we would casually chat on our breaks sometimes (no big deal)

Last year I have actually asked her out on a date and she agreed. Here is a big part: We had a total of 4 dates and I DID NOT make any move on her like trying to kiss or etc even though having a big crush on her.

The only thing I can assume is that she lost romantic interest in me because I could feel that we were doing good when talking so on our last date I told her I liked her. I believe still that I acted too strong on her in that case and when I said if we could move forward with the relationship she said more likely no than yes.

She said she would like to stay friends and did not want to lose me but I have denied that offer and told her to text me if she would change her mind.

For the next 9 months, we had zero text or call or etc direct contact. I have noticed she was seeing and sometimes even reacting to my stories and also liking a few of my posts on FB.

She actually texted me (replied to my story) asking about the stuff in the story video and we had 3-4 total texts. She replied to my story again after a week and now the story was totally on a different topic and I have asked her about her new job and we talked for like 5-10 minutes.

\^ This happened a week ago after 9 months of zero contact from my side. I was not even seeing her stories or reacting to anything whatsoever.

I asked if she would like to go on a date and she did agree to that. The thing is that it was a week before and she was supposed to text me as we have agreed that she would text me a day before. Well, she has not texted me not only on the day before but actually today as well which was supposed to be our date.

I am feeling a sort of letdown cause I thought that I could start from a scratch after this long.

My thinking is to do nothing and not text her back but at the same time I would like to see her but I don't want to be a victim if it's one of her ""tests""

I would like to add that she also looked interested in me and on a date she even applied a lip balm (no clue if this is correct lol but it's the invisible stuff for lips) in front of me. I am no expert but I still believe that we had some chemistry there.

My mom and dad  divorced 6 years ago after I saw them both slipping into a dark place.  At 15 I was wholely conscious of everything and I felt betrayed multiple  times. Now they live back together since 1 year and things haven't gone  for the better. There have been lies and betrayal, still and they can  be extremely cold to each other (especially my mom, who might be  depressed or have a midlife crisis).

My  best friend (who is mildly autistic), also came out of a bad  relationship with a manipulative and possessive woman, who even told her  dad he beat her (didn't happen, guy wouldn't hurt a fly).

My  brother, who lives in with us with his girlfriend, may seem pretty  happy. But they argue a lot, both get jealous really easily and he can  be very intimidating at times (also to us).

I,  myself, have been in a fling sorta relationship last year for about 2  months. Main thing there is that I didn't like who I became. When I was  depressed from time to time and she was having fun, I got jealous and  possessive. She hardly wanted to make time, or invest...

Right  now I'm trying to plan/find a way in life to find happiness without  pursuing anything romantic, although I often crave affection sometimes. I  ain't easy, but I hope my mental instability won't be there too much to  disturb my in this pursuit.

He just got out of a long term relationship. Things went real well at first, then a few weeks into March we got into some weird arguments since he was accusing me of all sorts of things like being racist, homophobic, using him for sex, using him as a backup option, and about to ghost him.  I didn't ghost him, but I withdrew majorly because I didn't feel like I could trust him. Things were pretty awkward all of April. We did not see each other as much, but it progressively improved. 

Things improved a lot in May, we finally reached a much better place. The first part of May was a little weird, he went like a whole week not talking to me so I got back on Tinder thinking he was going to ghost. I found him on there and swiped as a joke. He apologized for his crappy communication. He admitted that he picked those fights with me because he was in a poor place mentally and apologized for accusing me of all of that. He said he sees now none of his accusations were based in fact. A lot of things improved after that and I finally felt like he was someone I could trust and invest in. He did make a joke somewhere near the middle of May about not knowing what we were.

Now we are into June, things have stayed great for a while so I decided to throw in some talks of where this is going. Claims he wouldn't be driving to my area and sleeping with me if he wasn't interested. Okay. Says I'm the only person he's sleeping with and wants me to tell him when I get with other guys. Ummm, I don't roll that way pretty monogamous. Also says that while he feels things have improved he still feels really distant from me and like it hasn't gone to where it was pre-arguments March. So I said, okay how do you expect me not to emotionally withdraw when I hear that? He claims I misunderstood him, then says we have already talked about dating before and says we have different goals in life. What when we were arguing about how he couldn't date me because I am a racist? To the second one, we both want to go to graduate school, no kids, and help our communities. I know he has his wounds, but I like what he is doing in life and want to support him.

I [18M] been working with this girl [18F] for about a year and a half now in a retail store. She caught my attention the first time we met (we were hired at the same time) and I thought that she's just waaaay out of my league, tbh at that time I even thought she probably had more bfs than I had friends (believe me I've had quite a lot of them).

As we started working together, I figured that she was quite the opposite of what I thought of her. She is pretty shy and doesn't talk to many people, but I'm one those who she casually talks to. I started having a minor crush on her in late summer of 2020, but I brushed it away as I was going into first year of my uni and I needed to concentrate on school and we also had a pretty shitty covid situation, here in Ontario.

She was going into her last year of hs and I remember asking what she was planning on doing after it. She mentioned wanting to go to a pretty good uni about 1 hour away from Toronto to be able to go to med school afterwards. I remember pitching her the idea of coming to my uni but, like most people who wanna go to med school, she said no way (My uni is notorious for giving its students depression, low GPAs, and having a few suicides every year while covering it all with this giant blanket of prestige and recognition).

As the academic year began, I went into full on studying mode and my crush on her started growing day-by-day, but I couldn't do much because of covid and school.

After a series of lockdowns and reopenings, our store reopened in March and I thought ""how convenient, the province is not in a lockdown and my semester ends in a month. I'll ask her out at the end of April. "" This came back to fuck me up. At the beginning of April, the province shut down again and it wouldn't reopen till yesterday. 

In went to work today and saw her there, by this time the minor crush had turned into a pretty major one. We talked quite a bit and she mentioned that she was going to a different uni, not the one she was planning for (I would assume because of online school, a lot of people with very high grades got rejected this year). And when she mentioned what uni she was going to, my heart sank. It's a uni 2.5/3 hours away from Toronto and she was gonna be living in a dorm. For most people, this may not be a problem as they can just drive, but not me. I don't have a car and neither am I planning to sink in all of my savings into buying one. 

She will basically be quitting in a month and a half/two to move into her dorm and I genuinely feel like crap, to the point that I don't even wanna go to work anymore.

This shit sucks, should've asked her out last summer :((

However, as we know quite well, self-improvement is crucial to dating, and that's why I think this post is relevant. We live in an interesting world. Despite being more technologically  advanced than ever before, we face many difficulties and problems.  Depression and mental health rates are rising, and happiness levels are  dropping. Cellphone and social media addictions are the norm, and people  are not taking care of their health in the ways they should.

It is now common to live a sedentary lifestyle, to indulge in instant  gratification and overstimulation, to be overcome by unhealthy foods  such as excess sugar, and to live our days constantly comparing our  lives to the polished profiles that we come across online.

It’s difficult to make progress in life. To be great, we must be  better than most people. To be better than most people, we must do the  things that the majority will not. With good health, a good mindset, the  knowledge, the work ethic, and the passion, it is possible to slowly  improve and to one day become the people we know we are capable of  becoming. Below I’ve compiled a list of 25 things we can do to improve  our lives.

1. Lifting: Lift weights  consistently. 3-5 times per week is a good number. Get jacked. It will  help get you healthier, happier, stronger and more confident. The best  fitness book I’ve read is “Bigger Leaner Stronger” by Mike Matthews.
2. Cardio:  Do cardio every week, whether it’s a going for a walk, going for a jog,  or playing a sport. I personally walk 10k steps per day.
3. Stretching: When lifting weights or doing cardio, don’t forget to stretch.  
4. Hydration  and Nutrition: Hydrate yourself daily. I personally drink at least 2  litters of water per day. Furthermore, make sure you are eating well  balanced and healthy meals. Gut health is greatly correlated with mental  health. 
5. Health Testing: Get all your important physical tests  done yearly, such as blood tests. Make sure you are fully healthy.  Prevention is often more important than treatment.
6. Other Health  Facets: Make sure you are prioritizing all aspects of your health, such  as teeth care and skin care. You don’t want to develop problems later in  life.  
7. BMI and Body Fat Percentage: Make sure your BMI and  body fat percentage are in a healthy range. They aren’t always the  perfect measures, but they give you a good idea of where you stand.
8. Health  Problems: We all have unique health problems, such as acne,  gynecomastia, or a number of other things. Deal with your unique health  problems as quickly as possible. You don’t want them worsening. 
9. Sleep:  Wake up at a consistent early time every day. Go to bed at a consistent  time every night. Turn off your electronics at least 1 hour before  going to bed.
10. Sunlight: Get sunlight daily. If you can’t get the  right amount and form of sunlight, make sure you are supplementing with  vitamin D3.
11. Mental Health: Prioritize your mental health. Make  sure you are healthy and stable. If you are not, get some help and  figure out what you need to do to reach optimal mental stability.
12. Social  Life: Prioritize building a good social life. This includes friends and  family. We are social animals and social support is crucial for our  development and well-being. Take social risks to grow your social  muscle. If you have social anxiety, you will lose it one day and become a  natural. Make sure you are putting in effort into bonding with your  friends, and that you are choosing to spend time with good people.
13. Intimacy: A healthy romantic and sexual life is important. Learn about this aspect of life and put it into practice.
14. Self-Love: Understand that self-love is the most important form of love. Be kind to yourself.
15. Mission:  Make sure you have a mission and purpose in life and that you break  your objectives down into SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable,  Realistic, and Timely). Work on your craft daily. Incremental  improvement is crucial. Make sure you enjoy what it is you choose to do  with your time. Be more of a producer than a consumer.
16. Finances: Get a job, start a business, and learn how to save and invest your money. Financial health is important.
17. Organization and Cleaning: Keep your space clean and organized.
18. Alignment:  Make sure that you are in alignment with all parts of yourself. Your  thoughts, feelings, actions, dreams, and intentions should all be in  alignment. Stay true to yourself.
19. Reading: Read books. Read  articles. Learn from the best people in history.  Continuously try to  learn about what it is you are interested in. You brain is a muscle. If  you don’t train it, it won’t stay healthy.
20. Mindfulness: Understand that life is a process and stay mindful of the present.
21. Goodness: Be a good person and give back to the world. Help others when you can.
22. Environment:  Your environment is crucial to your well-being and success. Make sure  you are living in an environment that is healthy for you and that you  are surrounded with the right people.  
23. Legacy: Build your personal brand and leave behind a trace of who you are. Work on creating a great legacy.
24. Reality:  Stay grounded in reality. Limit your use of electronics and try to live  in the real world as much as you can. For example, go on a walk  outdoors and get some fresh air. 
25. Courage: Go after what you  want. Steve Jobs once said, “Everything around you that you call life  was made up by people that were no smarter than you.” He was right. Be  courageous.

The advice above has to do with health, relationship, finances,  happiness and mindset. Remember that the best way to improve is to enjoy  the process and to take things slowly. If you try to implement too many  things at once, you will get burnt out and you will not enjoy life.

Be kind to yourself. Failure is normal. Try to improve just a little  bit every day and understand that there will be some days where you will  mess up. It is the intention, the drive and the daily action and habits  that counts. With the right mindset, decisions and circumstances, you  will improve incrementally and be better than you were yesterday.

They imply if no women want such a man, then he must be either a monster or a loser.

Loads of women will fuck and lust over worthless criminals like Jeremy Meeks. Does the fact that Jeremy Meeks can get laid make him a good person? No. He's a degenerate who has contributed nothing of value to this world besides being a tall mulatto with a good looking face.

On the other hand, there are loads of men who actually are good people and contribute to the world meaningfully yet can't get dates/sex because they're just not good looking enough or maybe they have anxiety/depression/autism.

These guys get attacked from all sides. They get called ""nice guys,"" are told they are deep down monsters and only act nice because they are manipulative, get called betas, soys, c.ucks, i.n.cels. 

As far as I can see it, the only way to not get attacked if you are one of these men is to just say, ""I'm totally fine with the fact that women don't find me attractive."" Anything else and someone will attack you in one of the ways listed above or a combination.

Since when did we as a culture decide that the female sex drive was so incredible and virtuous that it should decide whether or not a man is a good person or not?

We recently learned 66% of male university students are celibate despite most wishing they could have sex/dating/romance.  If you looked at the small 34% of university men who are having sex, what do you think you would find? What would the race mostly be? What would their height mostly be? What would their looks and physique mostly be? What would their personality mostly be?

What is virtue for a man? Is virtue Jeremy Meeks? Or is it something else? Do we really believe those 66% of men are not virtuous? Or that Jeremy Meeks has more virtue than most of them?

No one does the same thing with the male sex drive. No one tells women who can't get dates (if any exist) that they are horrible people because of it.

So why do people tell men who can't get laid they are automatically the worse of society?

The majority of the girls that I meet and flirt with are at uni, and it is very difficult to find someone that doesn’t smoke/drink.

The problem arrives when a girl says “I don’t drink/smoke either” and she’s just lying. This happens 99% of the time when dating or meeting new girls. They’re like “ahaha I don’t smoke either it’s just that I’ve started trying it”. At the end even if I try to hangout with them or have a relationship I just can’t cope with it (the strong smell, “poison”, smoking attitude, etc.)

My question is how can I date with someone and ignore this? Or is there some niche I must look into?

She seemed cool enough,  down to earth. She had 2 pictures that looked pretty, but they were just face shots and had a strong filter on them. So it was had to tell what she looked like.

I sent her very accurate photos of me, no filter and one from a distance. I asked her for a recent photo, but she sent another with a strong filter and again just her face in low lighting. I didn't want to be rude,  so I just decided to trust that they were a fair description. I'm no model myself, I'm fault average looking I think, so I'm not looking for a 10 anyway. 

I asked her to a movie eventually, A Quiet Place 2. She canceled on me twice but finally agreed to go today. I asked where I could pick her up and she said she'd prefer to meet me directly at the theater. That's fine, I got there and was looking for her and I see this girl standing in the corner who waves at me.

This girl looks nothing like the photos she sent at all. Her hair was way different, she was much bigger and, I don't like to call people unattractive cus that's mean,  let's just say she wasn't my type at all and I was just really was shocked. 

I politely said 👋 and she asks if we can see ""In the Heights,"" which is a musical,  becase apparently she already went to see A Quiet Place, with a friend on one of the days she canceled on me. I hate musicals but I said sure and bought both tickets. Then I got us popcorn and we talk casually on line before going in. 

I hated the movie, as expected, and I  was sitting there and just being annoyed, feeling like I had been catfished. I decided I didn't want to sit there miserable for 2 hours, so I told her I was going to use the bathroom and then just left. I was going to text her, but I was a coward, and just blocked her instead. 

Idk, I feel kinda bad, really bad actually, but I also feel like she lied to me. I've gone out with bigger girls before, unattractive girls, sometimes I just want someone to chill with so I don't care.

Her friends were still talking to me- but she had kinda shut down. She was sitting on her phone the majority of dinner. On the way home it was just as awkward- her friends were still talking to me as normal- but she didnt say anything.

We started the conversation with music and then so forth,  I asked about her music taste again trying to know which other artists she likes so we can move forward from there, and she left me on seen. she looks at all my stories at the very end when my posted story starts to disappear. like if you really want to talk and are interested why playing all these games with my feelings? its so frustrating and annoying that I KNOW she likes me equally and is willing to at least go on a date.

One of the things I’ve noticed is the strange feeling I get when a guy is attracted to me or wants to spend time with me. This feeling also occurs when any person in general wants to be friends with me. I am just not used to it and I feel surprised when it happens because of previous experiences. I’ve never really had friends and I’ve had a lot of bad “friends” who treated me poorly and weren’t actually my friends. I’ve had a lot of bad experiences with guys involving them calling me ugly or annoying. So I find it hard to believe when someone is actually into me or actually enjoys my company.
The thing is, I don’t even think that I’m ugly or annoying. I think that I’m a good friend, I just have trust issues and don’t connect to people easily. My previous trauma with friends and guys have massively contributed to these issues and that’s why I am so shocked when people actually include me in their conversations or activities. I’ve gotten so accustomed to nobody liking me at all. Guys still don’t like me that often but when they do, part of me thinks that they’re lying, or that they will change their mind (also from a previous experience).

We dated on and off for over three years. Broke up 3 times. She dated in between, I’m not sure why I kept going back. She slept with multiple people and even claimed she “loved” some of them. She even contacted her most recent ex (after dating for one month) to tell him she made a mistake picking me over him, once she knew there was no hope of me coming back. 

I know I dodged a bullet but how do I prevent meeting someone like this again? She was attractive, financially stable, motivated, intelligent but was a horrible selfish partner. 

I’m in my mid thirties, bought a camper and drove across the country to be near family. I want to buy a plot of land and build a small house, away from the city. How can find someone and date in small town rural America? Seems like the odds are stacked against me.
