2,rmyu5e,1640275539,Was I wrong to call out being ignored?,"Throwaway account for reasons.  

I (m47) and my GF(48) went for a casual dinner last night and at ate at the bar.  After a few drinks my GF can get chatty.  She strikes up a conservation with the patron next to her and spends the next hour talking to her with her back turned to me.  On the way home I mentioned that I didn't appreciate being ignored.  Her response was that I was checked out on my phone, which is true because what else was I going to do.  We get home and talk about it.  We didn't have a knock down drag out but the experience is leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  We've been dating for 6 months and there is a lot of positives but this isn't the first incident like this and always when alcohol get involved.  

To be fair I drink as well, usually a couple of cocktails in the evening but when she gets on a roll, it's nothing for her to put down a 12 pack in 1 sitting.  

Was I wrong to be upset?  Am I being insecure?  We can have glasses of wine or cocktails no problem.  But sometimes when she gets on the beer I feel like I'm back in college dating a sorority girl (which she was and I was a frat guy  )  In the back of my mind I'm wondering if her drinking is a red flag.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rmyu5e/was_i_wrong_to_call_out_being_ignored/

I started dating a gal 40 yo ~9 months ago and it‚Äôs been really good.  We are good together, she has her life together for the most part, she doesn‚Äôt have kids and never married, she spends time with my son and I.  It‚Äôs been good.  
I just started thinking about asking her if she would like to move in together.  I feel she would want to.  I even brought the subject up to my son.  His initial reaction was that he didn‚Äôt like the idea.  He likes her and thinks it is great I am dating her.  I only brought it up once to him and have left the idea alone.
However, I am still thinking about it.
My concerns are:
- that if my son kicks back if we move in together.
- if I don‚Äôt end up liking living with her
- if I am settling 

I really don‚Äôt want to screw up my relationship with my son or her.

I also took time to send messages that asked about what the other person wrote in their bio, or made sure to if they messaged mw first. 

When I made contact with someone our chats were always above board and interesting, and I never acted creepy. I had several amazing (and two horrid) video dates, and a few in-person after that. All of them were great. The dates were all with women in their mid forties to early fifties. They are all marvelous people and they commented on how I wasn‚Äôt like the usual set of guys they run into. All I could think was ‚ÄúWow, this advice works.‚Äù 

That plus taking my time to have dealt with past issues through therapy as well as improving myself to the point where I knew, or at least believed, I was ready to start a relationship and to be able to meet my future partner as a complete person, I think it all enabled me to have success at dating, even during this time.

51,rpfu52,1640583079,Dating parents,"Still processing the end of my (49f) recent  relationship of over a year ...and reflecting on whether a relationship between someone childfree (like my most recent ex) and a parent of pre-teen (youngest nearly 11y) can work.

He told me a significant factor was him missing me at family events on the WE. I have my kids a decent chunk of every WE although I have other parts free, and we did spend time together then.

This was not at all the only factor. He has  major avoidant traits and a tendency to detach rather than try to work things out. Which I can relate to as previously I've had many of these traits too, but have done a lot of work and am much more securely attached these days.

I was working towards a scenario where he had met my kids then they could come to some of the events. But ultimately he chose not to go down this track. But appreciate this is not the same as having childfree time the entire WE. 

So if you are a parent of kids around that age, have you made it work with someone CF? Or does this sort of thing always come up?

And conversely if you are CF, have you had a fulfilling relationship with someone who's a parent of pre-teens?

I'm thinking, moving forward I should only focus on parents - but we all know that can get tricky too, parenting styles etc -  or ppl with kids who've flown the nest.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rpfu52/dating_parents/

56,rprtvy,1640624384,Unsure of own level of my [40M] attraction to her [38F] and other women I've dated in general,"So here's a weird one.  I don't know if I'm attracted enough to the girl I've been seeing over the past month.  How do I not know?  Well it's weird.  She's not my typical type, for one.  She's got a nice body and I think she's objectively pretty, but I don't have that kind of primal attraction to her.  We've had sex a few times and I perform but even during sex I don't have a real strong urge and sruggle to finish. She thinks the sex is mind blowing because I'm a passionate lover but hearing this makes me feel even worse because I'm really not that into it.

Seems like clear cut not that into her, buy frankly I worry it might just be in my head.  See, this lack of sexual interest has persisted since my divorce.  Most women I'm with I don't stay with long because I just never get that strong desire for them. Thing is, I still get strong sexual urges when I think of  my ex wife. I have no desire to be with her on any real level. But thinking of sex with her gets my heart racing and it's frustrating that my libido feels locked into someone I'm not with or interested in being with anymore.

So my dilemma is, I don't know if maybe I'm just not staying with anyone long enough to develop what had 16 years to grow with my ex  or maybe I'm just keyed in to a very specific type, or maybe I'm looking for something toxic/unattainable. 

Whatever the reason it's super frustrating. I'm a passionate guy and emotionally available but I can't seem to feel physical need for people.  This woman I'm with is great so far, we seem very compatible in a lot of ways, and I do like her body, I worry that I'm nitpicking things I don't like in order to prevent that attraction from growing? I don't really know it doesn't make sense.

Has anyone struggled with this? Is this a stay the course kind of situation? Do I cut her lose and keep working on myself? Been in therapy for 2 years. How do I learn to develop attraction for others if I don't try to date?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rprtvy/unsure_of_own_level_of_my_40m_attraction_to_her/

After this but still in the first day or two of chatting, he asked me about whether I have kids. Normal right. I say no and that I‚Äôve never been married and I say it kind of sadly. He gets super excited and says something like - oh this is perfect because then we don‚Äôt have to work around each other‚Äôs schedules because I have my son part time. Ok - very presumptuous that I have nothing to do but maybe he was burned recently and I get that kids add a level of complexity to scheduling. 

Then he asks about my neighborhood and how it relates to our metro area (some places are ‚Äúclose‚Äù in distance but difficult with traffic etc).  I give him a vague description and He then says - well we will have to take turns driving to each other‚Äôs houses but it‚Äôs not a bad drive.

So I‚Äôm like - uhhhh I mean aren‚Äôt you jumping ahead, shouldn‚Äôt we decide if we like each other first?

Been with this guy for a couple years. We are both 43, divorcees with college age kids. It was a rocky beginning but it got better for awhile. Lately I have been noticing he likes EVERY comment I make on fb regardless of the random page I made it on. He got his feelings hurt when he read a comment I made to another woman saying to basically go live her life and do what she wants and to stop waiting for the perfect man to live life with. So I asked him how he was able to see all of my comments in the first place as my profile is private and other people I know are not liking my comments etc unless it was on a local news site or shared page we followed. He said he did not know. So I went and checked and he is following a lot of the same pages I am active with, even ones he has no interest in. (Gardening, composting, science, health, nursing, even a few gossipy pages). I have also noticed that whenever I bring something up or ask him to do something he says he was already thinking that or about to do it. I told him he didn‚Äôt have to agree with everything I said or pretend he was about to do something, he of course got offended. Lately though I have noticed him picking up my snack habits (I like to eat certain things all throughout the day, like ice cream, banana bread etc until I am sick of it) I also eat meals but these will be my snacks. If I decide to have a drink so will he. If I go to bed early so will he. He is also becoming clingy. Am I overthinking this? Is this something other normal people do? I have never been with someone that started doing this before. I was new to dating again after I got divorced (marriage of 16 yrs) and didn‚Äôt have much experience prior.

 I suppose that he saw me so sensitive, that he never wanted to say it for not hurting me, within the messages that he sent me today he told me, how beautiful I was, and all those halgos, that obviously I feel that he does it so as not to make me feel bad

Huddle up, wise Redditors!","I (47F) had a coffee date with a guy and am trying to figure out if I should go on date number 2. Looking for some input here as I really don‚Äôt want to waste our time or energy, especially emotional energy. I could use some ‚Äúcrowd-sourcing‚Äù from my wiser Redditors out there, as I have very little experience (rarely go beyond first dates), but I‚Äôm trying to be more open:

Him (well, my perception of him after a whopping 45-60 min):
43 y/o. Last relationship ended 5 months ago. He was living with her and it ended badly. Never married. No kids. He works in athletics and his hobby is creative (I like that). Not an intellectual by his own admission, but seems intelligent based on his curious nature. I enjoyed talking to him. I find him attractive: he has that combo of authentic masculinity and natural gentlemanliness that I I‚Äôm attracted to. Oh‚Ä¶and he said he finds me very attractive and wants to see me again.

Me:
47 y/o. Married very young and stayed waaaayyyyyy tooooo lonnnggggg.  Ended marriage and moved away from ex-spouse 2 years ago. Kid in college. Intellectual ‚Äî background is science and business. Was a corporate executive and now starting my own company. This is a stressful time in my life but I‚Äôm loving it. 

My concerns: it doesn‚Äôt seem we have very much in common to build from. Our lifestyles are very different. Plus, I have a bit of a hang-up about being &gt;4 years older (I know it‚Äôs dumb, but just being honest that there‚Äôs some anxiety there). I was the younger wife for a long time. 

Normally I‚Äôd just call it done right here. But for some reason I just ‚Äúfelt good‚Äù in this guys company. That‚Äôs literally the only thing drawing me to a second date. But is that enough? Looking for feedback because I need to keep my feet on the ground and not get swept up in attraction if there‚Äôs no chance this can go anywhere. For those of you who have more relationship experience, is the incompatibility here so obvious that a 2nd date is a bad idea? I‚Äôm concerned about how attracted I am to him.

We have a great ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù, and it feels like a great match. There seems like no way out for her for a while. She has committed to me that her current relationship is over, and completely non-physical and not romantic.

90,rr8e5w,1640785109,Helping a friend in Lansing,"So, I have a friend that lost his wife a couple of years ago. He has been on several dating sites without luck. His previous wife was a lovely woman who was a college professor who unexpectedly died from cancer. So yes, he has some issues and his previous wife set a pretty high bar.  
I think part of the problem is that he does not have a good realization of how others might see him. So, I am putting out this profile that is brutally honest, in the hopes that maybe I can pass on to him someone that still might be interested despite this description. 
He is a bit eccentric  to say the least. He is high maintenance- a bit needy for attention. He can be abrasive without meaning to, though he sometimes purposely says things to shock people ( sometimes outrageously not politically correct). And sometimes, he can be utterly exhausting.  
He is super smart. He has written books about database management and such, but he is so much more than your typical ‚Äúegghead geek‚Äù. He definitely needs someone with which he can engage in mental combat. If you are not also super smart, he will probably get bored with you after a short while.
His original degree was in philosophy with a minor in German film. He has a very broad range of films that interest him, but most of the ones he talks about are definitely the art house variety. 
He has zero interest in typical sports like football, baseball and basketball, so there would be no being a sports widow for any season! 
He loves to travel and has been all over the world. 
He has already done the sugar daddy thing and is just so over and done with it, so if that is your angle, NEVERMIND, move along.
He is in his fifties, and yes, he prefers younger women ( what guy doesn‚Äôt?).
