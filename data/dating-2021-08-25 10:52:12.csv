0,pbemak,1629908432,A persistent interest derails most things I say.,"So I've had this man giving my persistant attention for more than a year. 
When I mention I'm not ready to date he goes on his usual rant about how guarded his heart is and how he has walls up from a previous relationship that ended two years ago. 

One day he sent me a funny video, but it was my brother's birthday and he has recently passed, so I told him I wasn't really in a laughing mood and told him that it was my brother's birthday and he died last year. 

His response was ""well, it's been two years since I've had my heart trampled on"" (she had changed her mind about loving him, and that wasn't fair) 

I'm just not sure how to get him to stop updating me on his daily life and trying to pressure me to hang out. I'm dealing with a lot of health issues and need space. And telling him that doesn't seem to mean anything to him, it just starts him on his own rant. And he also acts like I should feel lucky that he's willing to let a bit of his wall down for me. He doesn't seem to realize I don't care. I have my own problems I'm dealing with and nothing he says or does is going to change my mind. 

How would you let him down without causing him more stress, since he seems so sensitive to heart break.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbemak/a_persistent_interest_derails_most_things_i_say/
1,pberbg,1629908837,"""The world would be a better place if women ran it."" Now that women control the dating market what do people think?","I remember in the 90s when I was a kid I constantly heard the phrase: ""The world would be a better place if women ran it."" I remember people always saying women are more compassionate, empathetic, equitable, less superficial, less racist, and more open-minded. I believed this was true because it was what I was told constantly.

I think the dating power balance could be described as:

1950s and before: Men had most power.
1980s to early 2000s: Men and women had equal power.
2010 forward: Women have almost all the power.

Dating apps have given women a monopoly of control over the dating market.

So what do you think? Is the dating world a better place now that women run it?

My initial sense is dating was best when both genders had equal power. As they say, absolute power corrupts absolutely.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pberbg/the_world_would_be_a_better_place_if_women_ran_it/

12,pbflry,1629911358,Personal preference vs. body shaming??,"
I (38M) recently started seeing someone (27F) I met on a dating app. We’ve been on two dates and the banter/chemistry is good. I have my doubts about dating someone that much younger than me, but we’ve been on two dates and the attraction/banter/chemistry have been good enough to keep me interested. There have been a couple flags that have come up, mostly having to do with what she’s looking for  in a relationship e.g, long term vs short term, monogamous vs poly, etc. I think these are pretty black and white preferences, but her answers weren’t all that clear. At any rate, I figured that’s okay for now since we’re still getting to know each other. 

Anyways, we got into some pretty heavy kissing and petting on our second date. There’s definitely some good sexual chemistry between us and it took a lot of willpower for both of us not to let things go too far. The following day we chatted over text and both said we were excited to see each other again. Things got weird later when she said “bummer your parents snipped ya.” I was wearing some hiking pants that leave little to the imagination when I’m aroused I guess. She then told me she prefers uncircumcised men and that she is pretty “anti,” and as a medical professional would never perform a snip on a child. 

One of the things that attracted me to her in the first place was her candor but I’m kind of at a loss now. We all have our preferences, but this doesn’t seem like something to say to a potential partner or even someone you’re in a serious relationship with. I think it’d be analogous to telling a large breasted woman I prefer small breasts, which I would never do. I’ve never felt self-conscious about being naked around a partner but her comment makes me feel kind of like she was body shaming me or something. 

I’m considering just calling things off with her, but wonder if I’m overreacting. Maybe she slipped up because we’re already pretty open with each other? At the same time, I’m not sure if I’d ever be able to think that she’s not somewhat disappointed by my body.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbflry/personal_preference_vs_body_shaming/

I met this guy on the Whisper app. I'm 27 F and he's 33 M. I posted about how I got stood up twice in a week (not really dates but more so friends). He replied saying he wouldn't stand me up and he would like to go on a date. We exchanged pics and phone numbers and date plans.

We settled on getting sushi and Ice cream after. During dinner he turned out to be really cool We talked about all our travels, family background, work etc. Our conversation flowed smoothly. We talked about interests music, TV shows We liked. It went really well. We got ice cream then he invited me back to his place. 

Once I got to his place he introduced me to his new puppy and we talked and played with his dog for hours. I was sitting on his computer chair and he was sitting on the end of his bed.. He asked me what kind of music I wanted to listen to and played it on the speaker. 

With all the talking we did none of it was sexual. But after sitting across from each other in his room after hours of talking there was def some sexual tension going on. And we did end the night off with an adult activity. 

Anyways after all that I never knew what his work schedule was like. Our date was Sunday night. I stayed at his place all the way up to 6pm Monday. I thought to myself wait when does he work?"" He then told me he works 7pm-7am Monday-Friday and doesn't work weekends. 

Basically before I left he's all next time I'll give you the wifi password and told me when I find out my next schedule to let him know and we will get together sometime. 

So a few days go by and midweek he asks how I've been doing and I told him that work has been pretty rough and he asked what my schedule was like. We talked a little back and forth. I told him that I'm off Tuesday and Wednesday. And that I get out at 4 on Sunday etc. And he never replied and it's been 5 days. 

I'm just in need of some advice. I don't like to double text .. but.. I really like this guy or maybe he's ghosting me now idk. Wondering if I annoyed him by ranting about work or maybe he's just a busy guy???

I (F) created a Tinder account a couple days ago and was feeling a little frisky yesterday, so I decided to hit up one of the guys I matched with for a makeout session. We exchanged pics on Snapchat and videos. We planned for me to head over that night. He said he lived alone, but rented out his basement. So, I told him when I was heading out, he said he'd see me soon. I drove 30 minutes, met him in the driveway and he said ""hold on for a sec"" and went to th backyard. I sat on the porch and less than a minute goes by and he comes to the front and says ""I gotta help my friend with something..."" And I look at him and say ""really?"" To which he just shrugs.

Again, he shrugged and I got in my car and drove home.

Here's the thing, there most likely was no friend because he hadn't messaged me at all during my drive. He said he was alone before I left.

23,pbgsyk,1629914878,I like her but have had mixed feelings throughout our friendship,"So I've worked with this girl for a few months and met up with her a handful of times as well as called her a couple of times. We're both looking for the same thing (relationship that will lead to marriage), but there are a few things I'm looking for that she doesn't have and not sure if I should try to pursue something with her or just have her as a good friend. So here's the pros and cons of this girl.

Pros:

\-She comes from a 2 parent household with strong masculine and feminine role models

\-She's nerdy

\-She's kind 

\-She's virtuous and possibly a virgin (claims she's saving herself for marriage)

\-She's not covered in ink

\-She doesn't have a sailor's mouth

\-She's short and petite

\-She wants to be a stay at home mom

\-She strongly believes in monogamy

\-She dresses modestly

\-She doesn't pursue constant male validation and doesn't post anything trashy on social media and isn't on any dating app.

Cons:

\-She's insecure

\-She's a little selfish and self centered

\-She has a bad spending habit

\-Though she's thin, she's borderline anorexic

\-She doesn't know how to cook and expresses very little to no interest in learning

\-Learning about her dating history, possibly due to her insecurities she picks fun of her dates which caused her ex to dump her, and she constantly over compliments celebrities and fictional characters she's crushing on with little to no compliments towards those she dates or are involved with

&amp;#x200B;

I had asked her out on an official date which she said yes to, however because of my mixed feelings I went back on the date offer and instead mentioned that we should be just friends, however she looked a little hurt and instead I back peddled gave her the option to date or just be friends, which she decided we should be just friends and that she likes me but I'm nearing 30 and she's nearing 22 and doesn't like the age gap.

We hung out recently as just friends and talked about goals that we had and she opened up a lot more including family drama. We talked about kids and I told her why I haven't had any despite being 30 next month and told her that I tend to go for character because ""looks fade"" (not directed at her) and that I dodged a lot of toxic bullets because of that mindset. She tried hyping up herself saying that she doesn't have to worry about that, that she's got good morals and that she's got a baby face so she'll age slowly. It almost sounded as if she was hinting at why she'd make a good partner. Our hugs have been getting longer and I'm not gonna lie I have thought of just shooting my shot and kissing her, but it's the mixed feelings that have stopped me from doing so, also I'm moving to another state and know how rare long distance relationships ever work out.

So if you were on my boat, what would you do? Would you down play the cons and try to start something or would you wait for a better option to appear despite them having a lot that you're looking for?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbgsyk/i_like_her_but_have_had_mixed_feelings_throughout/

Unlike anything I’d had in the past I felt a real connection, and I felt like it was mutual. There were no warning signs at all. Saturday night we met up at a bar, I ended up going home with her and we had sex for the first time. The night ended with me going home at 430am in a Uber. After that night I heard nothing from her. I reached out yesterday and she said she had fun but was no longer looking for a romantic relationship from me. I am absolutely crushed. Can’t sleep, can’t eat, and can’t get it off my mind. I asked her what went wrong and she left me on read. It seems to me like the obvious answer would be that the sex was bad, but without going into to many details it was not THAT bad.

At said dinner, she fed me food(??). She wore my hoodies, was always very touchy/ flirty, and generally went out of their way to hang out. We shared umbrellas and ate together outside many times, I even wiped food off her face. After we finished studying in the library she would always be able to come up with some excuse for us to spend more time together, whether she needed to buy something or wanted to see something cool together before she went home. She was almost an hour late to dinner at a fancy, very well known (not going to mention it because someone stalking will figure out where I live, but I am willing to bet most people reading know of it) restaurant because she was with me. She went to her vacation home with her family for august, and we facetimed probably 4-5 times a week for 1-2 hours a day. Before i myself went on vacation i decided to ask her out on an “official” date for when we both got back.

She was uncharacteristically flustered for a good minute or two, and said she didn’t want to say yes because she didn’t know when she’d be back from her vacation home. That itself is fine, but then she said me asking her out was very unexpected, and she had no clue I had felt this way about her, even though her friends knew about my interest months ago. She also said she valued our friendship?Overall awkward asf, and she ended the facetime with a have fun on vacation or something like that.

I had no romantic feelings towards her until she became flirty and we began doing “dating” things, and now she told me she didn’t even think I liked her that way? She also has not opened my instagram msg from before I asked her out (4 days ago) but since has reached out to ask a question on text.

30,pbh822,1629916143,"Girl texted me 3 weeks after no contact, what now?","This girl and I used to talk/date unexclusively. Shes 20 and I'm 23. After a few dates sitting around the 3 month mark I asked her about her intentions. She said she wasn't looking for anything serious but wanted to keep going on dates and seeing me.

I wasn't/still am not ready to jump into a relationship, but I am interested in feeling this out more with this girl. She knows that because I told her. 

Our last conversation 3 weeks ago wasn't the best. She had been dialing back on talking to me as much, since she used to FaceTime, text, and call me all the time. She was giving me a lot of attention and I got used to it. When things started changing and being one sided, I voiced my concern to her

She said she needed space. I asked her if she wanted to cut ties or if she just wanted space, and that I would leave her alone. She got a little annoyed and said ""I've literally said it already. I just want space rn. Thank you."" So I gave it to her. Went no contact for 3 weeks 

Last night, after my band's rehearsal and maybe getting a little baked, I saw a text from her at like 11pm. She texted me saying ""hi stranger, season 3 of Manifest is out !""

I've been thinking about her a lot during the no contact period. Just some self improvement things I need to work on, and i missed her. Seeing that text from her was almost off putting because I was pretty zoinked from my delta 8 pen and didn't wanna deal with it at the time. 

I don't know why she texted me or what this means. I'd like to talk to her again and pick up where we left off maybe, it's just a little unexpected because I thought she would never text me again.

33,pbhn42,1629917357,Am I boring?,"M21

Hey,

Recently I've met F24 in my university, she asked me out to park (it wasn't romantic). She is a bit unique in the sense that she isn't shy at all, it is extremely easy to approach people for her, and she is very straightforward (sometimes it is borderline rude).

We were talking about each other, and she has told me that I am boring 40 years old. Honestly, I was surprised as thought of myself as erudite but socially dull. 

I've mentioned to her that girls are not important for me, and I want to study extremely hard, almost torturing myself to achieve high grades, and later on, have an excellent job with a lot of money.  The justification of that was that if I work hard on myself and have a lot of money the girls will chase me instead of the other way around.   
Also, I don't drink, don't do drugs and don't smoke. As it may fire back on me. My family had a lot of alcohol abuse, and it is an extremely sensitive topic for me that I didn't mention to her or to anyone. The thought of drinking a bottle of beer is already disturbing for me. 

I am reserved and introverted, although I dress well and it isn't a problem to have a good conversation with someone.

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

As time progressed we remained friends, still talking on the phone everyday, telling eachother everything going on in our lives and she frequently said things like she is really happy that she has me in her life and that she needs me. But as time progressed it also was harder for me at times. Especially if she was hanging out alone with her guy "" friends"".

I was feeling jealous and really questioning my own self worth/ respect at times. I know i just should have go NC the moment she friendzoned me, but yeah stupid me.

But i was becoming more distant from her to just protect myself and 3 weeks ago she send me a messages that she really misses me and did not thought our bond would ""break"" this quickly. I told her i miss her aswell but from the moment she told me she just wants to be friends a lot had changed because i really thought we were building something more then just friends. she did not respons on my reaction.

For the last 3 weeks our conversations are really dry and it feels forced. I got a snapchat from her last week from her that she was taking a drive with her ex, which she always complained about to me and talked alot about when we were ""dating"" in hindsight it maybe meant she was not over him still. But since she send that snap i did not contacted her and it has been 3 days now.

I need some advice on what to do next, should i stay no contact or should i contact her? i have to be honest and tell you all i am having a hard time, also because she is undergoing surgery coming thursday and i want to be for her, but on the other hand it is hard to be in her life as just a friend",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbho7x/i_need_advice_no_contact_or_not/

Of course they started to have contact again when he started being weird and said he doesn‘t know what to do, like when we both talked, it felt extremly real and genuine and he even said things that pointed to him having feeling for me, but after hearing the story I’m just confused.

He came over and everything seemed fine at first. Then he started to get really hands-y while I was cooking and straight up was trying to make out with me while I was trying to cook. I did make him shred a ton of Parmesan to literally keep his hands busy (aka off of me). It really bothered me that he was trying to essentially get me into bed before I even finished making dinner. Even the assumption that having him over some how meant we were sleeping together was irritating. this kept on happening throughout the night and at some point in my head I was like “I need him OUT.”

In the end, my first impression from my first date with him now took a 180. He was the charming respectful guy on the first date, turned into this sleezy guy on this second.

So first date, everything went perfect. Never a dull moment and we made each other laugh. I always respected her boundaries and always asked if I could hold her hand, if I could hug her , etc. She told me she really loved that about me.

Second date was yesterday. She came over so we could cook together and watch a movie and play games. We cuddled and I could tell she loved it as we watch the movie. I felt like I found the one at the moment because our chemistry was off the charts. I was happy she was too. Until that changed so quickly. We started to kiss and things escalated so fast. There was a lot of hands on involved on our bodies. There was no sex though which I was fine with. Until I realized something was wrong. I could tell by her face. I stopped it and asked if she was okay. She wasn’t. She said things were going to fast and then told me that she is always the one who always has to tell the guys that she has boundaries and how her faith will always be number one. I felt so shitty because I feel l messed it up . She started to cry but I was there to comfort her. I told her how I loved who she was was, that I liked her because of her beliefs and her values. I tried to reassure that her body had nothing to do with it.  That I respect her too much to lose What we have.  I told her I care about her feelings. I know I’m not like any other guy who just want a hook up. I believe in my faith too. She didn’t really believe me. 

She told me she wwnted space and time.  And told me to not be too hard on myself.  But I can’t help it.  I feel like I screwed up. I just feel like the next time she sends me a text it’s too end things between us. I screwed up Reddit. Or at least I think so.

68,pbm8ar,1629930992,Rant: Is dating officially dead? What happened?,"Sex and discreet hook-ups got more accessible via these casual fling apps like Tinder, Badoo, Bumble, etc. and people’s interest in relationships/marriage went downhill. 

I’m currently feeling hopeless because I’m never able to attract the right person. There’s either no chemistry or they just eventually end up ghosting. Most are guys that really have nothing much going for them, at least they seem decent enough to strike up a good conversation with, but the potential partner qualities just aren’t there.
You end up getting used more often than not and usually the frustration of finding a mate is more aggravation than it’s worth.
And when I do find someone attractive, everything is great up until they start to talk, which reveals they are extremely shallow and that gets annoying/disappointing fast.

I get that maybe I’m not the greatest catch in the world but I do have a lot to offer. 

Interesting conversation, consistency, a loving home, stability, etc. 

A positive attitude to go with it. But that’s slowly starting to change.

I would consider myself very feminine in appearance and behavior but I can be a bit outspoken whenever I feel like I need to get my point across..

Why do I always get hit on by the unattractive, weak men? It may sound a little harsh but I’m honestly sick of getting pursued by the undesirable.. Is there something I can do to change this? Or is it inevitable?

They usually live with their parents, socially-awkward, no money, effeminate, no assertive nature, etc. 

Is this what the average woman has to settle for now?

When you sit back passively and wait for guys to pursue you, you get who you get. I get that. 

More to the point, you get who you attract. Which is why I’m asking myself if I need to be the one doing the pursuing. I’ve gotten a good guy occasionally but the rest are majorly bad apples.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbm8ar/rant_is_dating_officially_dead_what_happened/

Says yes but was out of town and wanted to connect the following week to get together.. I reply back with a ""of course"" albeit some usual banter.

I follow up a week later and she's been just ghosting me. I waited a week for her to reply and nothing. Extremely unusual as she typically responds almost instantly to all my messages.

Afterwards she's been orbiting everything I do on social media and it's getting frustrating. I was thinking of texting directly to see what's up as we've been mainly messaging on social media. But I think that wouldn't help.

You read over every text message, read into everything, initiate pointless conversations and end up feeling foolish when you realise that you missed the signs that they are just not into you.

You punish yourself because you immediately conclude you’re unlovable and unworthy of the person you desire when in reality it’s an issue of compatibility. When you realise it’s that, the fantasy in your head dissolves and you come to know you would never be happy the way you imagined with the said person because you were not meant to be.

We met when we were 19 in college, through a mutual mentor and ended up working together and starting a club with some friends in college. We started off normally and went from acquaintances to friends, but towards the end (I'm a year ahead in school) when I had graduated and was in our college town working a year before grad school and he was a senior in college, I started getting this vibe from him and from a lot of people who know us that he was into me. 

What I mean:

He always hugged me whenever we saw each other but never does that with anyone else; he would always ask if I'm seeing someone (""who's the lucky guy,"" etc.), says I remind him of his mom, liked all my stuff on Facebook, the friends in the club we started all asked us if we're together and say they can't imagine us without each other.

He never made a move and I hate missed connections so (since we're both from California), I invited him to the county fair in my town in the summer when we were both back, a no pressure thing, for fun and to kind of feel things out. He drove 150 mi to get there, insisted on picking me up, and we hung out all night, but again, no move. I tried one more time to get a sense of what's between us and asked him via text if he thought that was a date, and he said no, and we left it there.

We both went to law school on opposite coasts, and were busy and didn't talk for a few years but got back in touch in late 2019 right before the pandemic because there was some stuff going on in my family and I needed a character letter of recommendation. 

It's been 10 years and as long as I've known him it is so easy between us when we're together. But also as long as I've known him he always has a different girl, and they are most always dysfunctional (e.g. one of them made him wear lifts in his shoes to be taller). I happened to be in the same city as him 2 weeks after his breakup with the last one and he tried to make a move on me (we had dinner, he wanted to meet for breakfast the next day and show me around the shopping area near his office, and then texted me on New Years to see what I was up to)

When he did that, I brushed him off by talking about how crazy things have been with the family, because I didn't like that he tried to use me as a rebound or to indiscriminately fill a space in his life of ""generic girlfriend."" 

He has trauma in his past and we have a lot of childhood stuff in common and I had really started to like him towards the end of college and haven't been able to shake the feelings all these years later. Whenever I see him and I have a bf he seems annoyed and changes the subject. 

Now it's about 1.5 years later since we last saw each other and we just spoke about something he and our old group of friends are helping me with, and he told me he's moving in with the latest girlfriend after only dating for 7 months and they are looking at rings. She is the type who has 70 billion selfies on social media and is slightly manipulative and I really care about him and don't want him to end up with someone bad or who's a narcissist.

79,pbnjcw,1629935231,A girl at my new job who’s only 17 seems to have a crush on me; how do I sensitively handle her advances while making sure she knows this will never happen?,"
I’m 23 and recently started a new job and one of the girls starting with me is 17. We were paired off during group interview stuff and then kind of sat next to each other and got talking on the first kind of day. I was naturally trying to be as friendly as possible because, well obviously you want to get along with your workmates, and I’ve been in her position before entering your first big job and I knew it can be daunting so I wanted to make sure she was comfortable and didn’t feel awkward.

Anyway, during the first day I noticed she was gravitating towards me all the time, even when we weren’t paired off. And during conversation she started dropping hints that I would usually take as a girl being interested in me. Now, it could be perfectly innocent, but she started saying she would give me lifts to work, she was talking about how we should grab a drink to ‘celebrate’ the fact I’m leaving my old job, she messaged me on Facebook starting conversations and asking how I am and when I’ll be in work with her and stuff. It was all just a bit much after knowing someone for a couple of hours. I’m not an idiot; I could tell she was trying to get us to hang out outside of work and trying to kick something off beyond being work colleagues, but it’s deeply uncomfortable for me for the obvious fact of how young she is. 

I’ve never really been in this position before. Girls my own age never really take notice of me and I’m never the one being pursued. I’m really noticing a trend as I get older of girls around 4-6 years younger than me being attracted to me and it makes me feel really uneasy. I have a baby face but I’m still an older guy, so I think for them it’s like the best of both worlds; I look their age but have a bit more maturity or whatever. I’m not used to being given attention like this in general, but especially when it’s unwanted and uncomfortable for me like this. 

She’s basically been trying to message me all for a few days and I’ve been replying really slowly as not to encourage it, but beyond that I don’t have a clue how to handle this. I need to sensitively out it across to her that this is never going to happen. But she’s 17, she’s young, stupid little crushes like this can feel really intense and make you emotionally vulnerable at that age, etc., the last thing I want to do is upset her by ignoring her and making my job awkward. But, at the same time, I do not want to entertain it for a second and give her any ideas. I just don’t know how best to do that. I need to be friendly towards her, but not so friendly that she gets the wrong idea like she seems to be doing right now.

So, how can I handle this and make sure she sensitively, but firmly is sure that this will never happen? It’s hard putting your foot down like that going into a new job. And, I suppose in more general terms, why am I always attracting younger girls and how can I stop that? It’s a trend I don’t like; a little younger is fine, but obviously when they’re teenagers it becomes really uncomfortable to have to deal with, doubly so in a work situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbnjcw/a_girl_at_my_new_job_whos_only_17_seems_to_have_a/

Title says it all really. I'm 32, gay and male. Last year I went through a really rough breakup. Basically, my ex boyfriend got me excited to go out on my  birthday for dinner, proceeded to dump me after dinner, tell me he only spent time with me out of pity and was two timing me with someone else. He has never acknowledged this or apologized for his behavior and the only contact since has been about 6 texts two months ago. For context, my ex had been watching my social media posts regularly and I called him out on it and implied it made me uncomfortable. I don't want him back in my life in any capacity, so that's not what i'm looking for. 

I stayed single for the entire past year, for a few reasons. 1. I was (understandably) upset about the breakup, 2. I was questioning my own ability to judge character of others and 3. I wanted to focus on myself and meeting personal goals.

In the past year, I finished grad school, lost 20lbs, got featured in a spotify podcast, sold my home, moved out of my hometown to Dallas, Texas, got a full-time remote job with the mickey mouse company, started stock investing and just bought a new 2022 Honda car.

Sounds top of the world, right? Yeah, but i'm not excited to date at all. I have Hinge and Bumble on my phone and have a few dates lined up, but i'm not excited for this. Maybe it's leftover feelings of annoyance from last years fun breakup? Maybe i'm jaded from constatly feeling like people are a waste of time? Who knows? 

Anyone have any tips or suggestions?

94,pbp1f6,1629940480,Nearly all my matches are with unattractive people…,"Pretty much the title. It’s become so common that I sometimes ONLY swipe on unattractive people just to prove that they are the ones that typically swipe right on me on dating apps.

I’ve been called a relatively good looking dude (I’ve been compared to Zac Efron and Leo). I’m in incredibly good shape. I have a great income for a 22 year old. I think my pictures and bios/captions are good, I’ve put quite a bit of thought into them.

Yet, over several months I pretty much only match with people I don’t find attractive at all. I can’t lower my standards if the people who are attracted to me are not remotely attractive to me.

Is this just the normal experience of online dating as a man? Is it because I’m short (5’6”)? Because otherwise, I truly feel that I’ve improved myself a lot and that I don’t really have too many other shortcomings.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbp1f6/nearly_all_my_matches_are_with_unattractive_people/

The minute we met I felt attraction, the first thought I had when I saw her was “shit, she’s cool and gorgeous, I wish I had met her first” They had dated for about 10 months, me and her had gotten along really well, but I had felt an attraction/crush on her since he introduced me. They recently broke up but for some reason I can’t stop thinking about her, I know my best friend was in love with her, but I just can’t shake this feeling of attraction, he’s my best friend and I could never do anything to hurt him, but this feeling is eating me up, what if she felt the same?)
Any bit of help would be appreciated, I just want to get past this feeling, I don’t want to hurt my best friend, but this feeling is fucking killing me, thinking about it all the time….

98,pbptkd,1629943245,Why didn't he text? Please give advice.,"So i went on a date with a guy on Saturday, the date went well and he texted me right afterwards saying he had a good time and that we should meet up again. On the following days (Sunday to Wednesday) i texted him everyday and we ended up talking every night. Yesterday we even decided to meet up on Thursday again. Today is the first day i didn't text him and waited from him but he didn't text me. I like talking everyday and i'm not clingy or anything but i think it's important to text at the first stages of dating. I feel like i have shown this to him by initiating the first text 4 days in a row. Now i wonder whether he's not as interested as me thus doesn't wanna spend much time. Do i expect too much? 
Any advice is appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbptkd/why_didnt_he_text_please_give_advice/
99,pbpubb,1629943314,35M struggling with moving on,"35M EMT struggling with relationship trauma

Hello. Im an EMT and I just had the rug pulled from under me a month ago by my gf of 2 years. We started really properly dating during covid, and she was very bubbly and optimistic, which is complimentary to my usually reserved nature. We supported each other and had great times, and I really thought I had a keeper on my hands. 
We ended up moving in together during covid and my schedule got busier and busier. I still tried to connect with her as much as possible, but she had a bit more time on her hands than me. She started becoming distant and cold. One day I return from work and her bags are packed, and she told me we were incompatible and she had found someone else, and was going to move to Europe. 
Since she left, I have been lost and can’t focus on work, and it’s affecting my libido as well. 
I know I might be a bit too old for problems like this, but this has made my abandonment and trust issues worse. I’m having difficulty engaging with my friends and family. I still love her with all my being, and I just don’t know if I have any more love left to give anyone. And covid isn’t really helping. I feel so lonely and tired, a part of me still can’t believe that this happened to me. I invested a lot of time in this relationship and treated her like an empress. 
Do I make peace with my heart only desiring unavailable women?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbpubb/35m_struggling_with_moving_on/
