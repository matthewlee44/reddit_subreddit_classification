I’ve known him for a long long time and we had a fling around 2 years ago. He ended it because I (self-admittedly) was very very desperate. We’ve kept in touch but maybe only one small-talk conversation every couple of months or so (sometimes we wouldn’t speak at all for 6 months or more). Then he asked to meet up with me and was all flirty and interested again? I reciprocated somewhat but made sure to not be responsive to every advance he made as I’m now wary.


After our date(? I guess you could call it that) he said it was really great seeing me and then he messaged me saying how nice it was to meet me again. I responded saying thanks and didn’t continue the conversation on much longer.


A few days later I asked if he was free that night - I was unsure how I felt about him and wanted to test the waters. He said he was busy and I didn’t continue the conversation. He hasn’t shown signs of interest for about a week now and I’m honestly just a bit baffled? I have ADHD so I can’t really imagine speaking to someone on an evening just for fun as I find it unbearably boring speaking to people I don’t know very well but maybe he was just bored that night we met up and I just can’t relate.


With ADHD I know I’m incredibly vulnerable to the playing hard to get tactic (to keep a long story short - ADHD impairs dopamine regulation in my brain. So when a guy I’m attracted to shows signs of interest I have an overwhelming surge of dopamine which makes me attracted to him. When he then goes cold my brain craves that dopamine release and I become hyper-focused on him). Because of that, I’d like to know if I should brace myself against his playing-hard-to-get behaviour for my own benefit.

I see a lot of posts by men talking about having an abundance mindset, and that its the mindset that men are supposed to have to show that they have options beyond the woman that they wanted to date so that her rejection doesnt really mean anything to him. The thing is, I can tell that it would be hard to keep this mindset if, 

1. you dont realistically have options or women who would love to date you
2. you keep getting rejected

So my question is, how, as a man, would you ""have options"" like women do when it comes to dating?

I have light hair and dark eyes with pale skin. Up until my mid to late twenties I only ever dated men. I also never masturbated because the bigger the buildup, the better the release… That’s what I’d say anyway. But it was really how I could get turned on enough to want to have sex with these guys. I always knew I was a lesbian but wasn’t brave enough to come out.

It’s been some years now since I’ve been sexually active with anyone. During this time I’ve been in the closet to most, while struggles from a mental health disorder I’ve had since I was a kid, have taken over. It’s kept me trapped in my head and the heavy meds have dulled my senses. Then the pandemic happened, keeping me stuck in my house too, like a lot of other people. Regrets over wasted time weigh heavily on me, the way I wish a cute girl would. Thoughts I’ve never expressed and feelings suppressed have finally been squeezed so tight that they’re starting to seep through.

I’m journaling again and able to write personal stuff like this. I’m also beginning to speak to women on dating apps. Coming from being a hermit with zero experience navigating social media, it’s a hellscape. I’m not ready for a romantic relationship. Though I don’t think a quick/drunk hookup will do the occasion justice either. It would be okay, I’m a patient person and like a slow burn. Except I never did take up the habit of masturbating, right up to the present. After so many years since I’ve truly gotten off (if ever?), I’m in a rough state. Added to that is seeing so few people over the course of the pandemic, and I’m easily over-stimulated.

At a store recently, I bumped into a random woman around the same age while turning a corner. I didn’t even see her face but felt her skin on my arm and smelt her shampoo. All of my muscles tightened and the top of my skull nearly blew off my head. I hope she just thought I was startled. Actually I need to catch up on half a lifetime of missed orgasms and have my mind blown for real (it won’t take much).

I matched on a dating app over summer 2020 with a man. We talked very briefly and he was relocating to about an hour away from my town. I wasn’t interested at the time and forgot about him until a wildly profound coincidental interaction related to Reddit in December 2020. We hit it off pretty well, making me regret not interacting sooner, and met a few weeks later. 

Since then, we’ve seen each other every 1-2 weeks with me driving an hour to visit him and explore the city. Two weeks ago, I relocated to his area, something that been planned well before meeting him but catalyzed by our time spent together. We’ve had fun exploring the city together and live in the same neighborhood (for me, this is solely work related) now. 

There are some stark demographic differences between us that I’ve been worried might eventually drive us apart, but I’m slowly coming to the conclusion that our differences are beautiful and he can teach me a lot, as he already has. While he is undoubtedly privileged and apparently fairly ignorant to it, he is never unkind or demeaning to those with less privilege. He tries to understand multiple sides of political arguments, including those he disagrees with. He’s so genuine and unlike anyone I’ve ever met. I am irrevocably falling very hard. 

We’ve yet to define our relationship as official, exclusive, etc., but do refer to ourselves as “dating” and as a “couple” in passing. (Ie. “we are a cute couple” “I’ve never dated anyone that X the way you do”) I’ve met some of his friends from his home state that came to visit. I just moved to the area and have some friends who also recently moved that I would like to introduce him to. I also would like us to make friends and connections together since we are both still fairly new to the city. We spend a lot of free time together (he has a daughter, I work full time) and other than some awkward but necessary silences here and there and my irrational fear of us being too different in terms of demographics, it is a very pleasant and healthy relationship. It’s a great balance of fun, sex, friendship, independence, and affection. I never want it to end. 

As we’ve never established exclusivity, however, I have still been going on dates with other men. I am not sure if he knows or not. I know that both of us are still on dating apps and this doesn’t bother me much because it seems most of his free time is spent with me anyway. If anything, I probably use the apps more frequently than he does. It’s not because I don’t adore him, I just put a lot of emphasis on our differences and wanted to explore if I might be more compatible with others. I also wanted to expand my social networks in my new city, which dates are great for regardless of sexual or romantic interests. 

Last night, I went on a date that was so painfully awkward and bizarre, I couldn’t help but think that maybe this guy really is the best person for me to prioritize (other than myself) right now. I’m ready to tell him how I feel sober; usually, it requires a few drinks and fantastic sex for me to say really sappy things. 

Thing is, I don’t know if he’s ready to hear those words from me or if it’ll scare him away. I don’t want to lose what we have, I want to continue to build on it. But I also don’t totally expect him to drop any other potential interests he may have because I care for him so much that I just want him to be happy. But still, I’m wondering how we can continue to build our relationship if we are both (mainly me) entertaining the idea of others. I am certain he has strong feelings for me; he builds me things, we went on a vacation, he is always very responsive even after I go rogue for days, he asks for a kiss every time before I leave, he pulls me close randomly, his child knows my name and that I exist, his family knows I exist, etc. 

I’m ready to tell him how I feel, but should I mention that part of the confirmation of how I feel has been related to me dating other guys this whole time? I’m worried he might be upset by that, but again, we’ve yet to establish exclusivity. I’m concerned that if I reveal that, he may feel he should put more effort into other women first before we determine where the future our relationship is going. 

Tl;dr: I’ve been seeing an incredible guy for five months and dating others during that time. The others only further cement my love for the primary man.

That day never comes and you end up wasting your time becoming bitter yeah it's my fault for not getting the hint so now I'd rather move on than make that mistake again.

I don't want to use her for her body I want to be loved and that's better than just glorified masturbation but if I don't see a path forward I'm not not going to try the time investment doesn't pay off, would you invest in something that most likely won't give you a return?

Maybe I'm the problem I'm a loner and I don't have many friends I actually have a legit female friend, she keeps lecturing me about my closed minded about starting as friends.
 it's no secret she has even stated that she considered dating me and I think she would legit but it wouldn't feel real I just feel like I'm an option rather than her actually wanting me.

Perhaps my experiences has created a false reality.

I have none of the associated mental illnesses with autism, I love live concerts and do not get overstimulated easily. I am not exactly an extrovert or an introvert I've been described as smart, hilarious, creative, but also painfully self aware and I have a tendency to beat myself up after a long day of social interaction where I percieve my actions as cringy but I learn and adapt quickly. I'd consider myself fairly attractive, I have a nice face and I am in great shape/slightly skinny with a little muscle. I also try to dress nice and wear make up a lot. I have a good amount of nerdy interested like anime and work an interesting job, I make good money, my living space is clean/organized, I budget well and manage my money well. I'm able to maintain friendships and most people tell me that never thought I was autistic just eccentric. I'm not loud or super cringey I am slightly social ackward but I own it and add a little humor to it. 

The issue that's happening right now is that when I disclose autism later, after 4 or 5 dates I get guys who get mad at me for not telling them something so important earlier and mad that they had sex with someone whose considered disabled. Ive even had one guy tell me he wouldnt have dated me because he didnt want his future kids to be autistic and he felt decieved. When I tell people early, I have alot of people who tell me they arnt ready to date someone like me even though they seemed perfectly fine with dating me before and telling me that. I've also had a couple dates tell me they felt I was oversharing by telling them that fact by the 2nd or 3rd date. I'm getting pretty frustrated, I've attracted a lot of guys, most of them tell me things like I'm the funniest women they've ever met and they really like me, im sexy, and super fun but they don't know if they can deal with dating someone whose ""mentally disabled'. I've been trying to date nerdier guys who I thought would be more understanding of eccentric behavior but at the end of the day many of them are the same.

At the time, he said that he definitely wanted to know if I ended up going to school in that state. He said this again (even knowing that I probably won't find out until mid/late summer) later on in the week while we were snapchatting in response to already having plans when i asked him to hang out again.

Since then, we've completely stopped talking (he left me on read and I'm too scared of double rejection to send him something else) but we still look at each other's stories. My graduation wasn't that big of a deal because it was for a graduate degree and it was via zoom but I know that his school takes it really seriously and it's this whole big affair for a whole week after finals. I know for myself, it was perhaps a good idea to take some space from him before knowing for sure where I'll be this fall.

Every time I see a Reddit post made by a low self esteem, frustrated OP with a long history of being neglected and treated poorly by the opposite gender, they always have the same qualities

If they’re a woman, they’re almost always a dark skinned BW

If they’re men, they’re almost always short or not white

You think those things are coincidences?  These are often times people who are fit, have decent careers, look after their appearance, etc but those things can only go so far. They didn’t come out of the womb as pessimists but years of poor treatment can do that to you 

Life isn’t fair. We know that. It’s not fair economically, it’s not fair when it comes to health, it’s not fair when it comes to geopolitics so why can’t we admit that it’s not fair when it comes to looks/dating? Go to the relationship advice sub and see the type of treatment people tolerate from men/women when they find them attractive. Some of the stories on there are absurd.

A woman, 27, liked me on a dating app and we talked and hit it off, but I’m incredibly nervous I won’t be enough for her. 

I grew up in a relatively poor family, so I had to work for everything, started at 16 and have held 2 jobs since 22. I also have fairly bad social anxiety, I struggle big time talking to strangers, which extends to meeting potential date’s friends and family. Working most nights in high school and college, I didn’t get out to parties much, and I have no friends I talk with from before college. I have a small social circle, and I do go out with them sometimes, and I go to the bar with coworkers after work during the week when they do. 

My issue is a never really had a group of “the boys” as everyone calls them, no group of guys who hang out, raise hell, party on the weekends and that kind of stuff. Because of how much I worked and still do, I have what I’d call a boring life, very few crazy stories, life events, whatever. I’ve done very little traveling compared to most my age. I’m just...boring in my opinion. 

This girl is incredibly nice, attractive, fun to be around, great career, and we get along, but she’s my social opposite. She has a ton of friends, multiple circles including the one she’s incredibly close to, can talk to anyone, goes out frequently, and has tons of family events, parties, weddings, and travels all over. She has a never ending supply of entertaining stories and likes to get out. 

I just feel like she’s eventually going to realize how boring I am, how few places I’ve gone, how little I’ve done. She’ll realize I never really got out much, and when she’s like “bring a bunch of friends we’re doing xyz” and there’s a chance I’ll have maybe one that can make it. 

I’m one of those people where I can hang out with those types of people for the most part, I’d love to get out and travel, I just haven’t, but I don’t know if she’ll wanna deal with that, or if she’s going to lose interest.

Allow me to explain.

So I met this lady the other day while we were out drinking and, well one thing led to another and we got on really well, so later that night I take her back to mine and we slept together (no intercourse but we did do other sexual things). So that was great, the thing is when she left the next morning we didn't really establish anything in terms of what we ""were"" or what we officially ""are"". This is partly my fault and something I need to work on ( I have had a history of girls seeming to become dis-interested after I try to put an official title on it, / tell them I have feelings which has put me off asking, unfortunately) ... and so she left and said she would text me later.

So... we exchanged a few texts and eventually I asked her if she would like to get some drinks with me next week at a cocktail place, to which she replied she would.

 Now onto the problem. I did not specify this was a date, so in my head I am thinking she would surely view it as a date right? At least that's how I would take it, so I am planning to show up dressed really nice with a buttoned shirt, nice shoes, nice jacket etc HOWEVER, do you think there is a chance she just views this as friendly drinks and NOT a date. If that is the case, would it be weird if I showed up dressed like this and she isn't.

I guess what I'm asking is should I dress nice regardless of whether she thinks it's a date or not. Or is it a bit cringe / off putting if I am over-dressed and she just viewed it as a friendly thing? I am probably over thinking but any advice would be great.

My mom has a history of abusive behavior towards my family. There was a big rule that we weren't allowed to go outside or interact with anyone outside of school, and I spent most of my childhood locked inside a hoarded house.

There was never any privacy when it came to my mom. She would look through my phone and all of my messages when I was sleeping and yell at me when she saw I was messaging a girl. She would also make very big scenes whenever my sisters would date someone. When they were in high school, my mom would do things such as driving to my sister's boyfriend's house uninvited to confront his family. She's even gone as far as punching him in the face because he brought her back home after sneaking out. It's crazy to me that she never faced any legal consequences for the things she's done, but I was a kid at the time and didn't know what to do. The rest of my family just acts like these things never happened. It's very frustrating to me because a lot of the things she did to have left me traumatized, even years later.

This summer, my girlfriend is planning to come to my city for a few days after almost 1.5 years of social distancing. Family members like my dad and my grandparents have met her and approve of her, but they've expressed that they're scared of what my mom would think if they met her. My dad looked terrified when she interrogated him about my girlfriend, and he told me that he left out many details such as her ethnicity so she wouldn't get angry. The last time I was with her, my mom didn't even know she was visiting and my grandparents lied to cover for me because they were scared of how she would act. 

I want to stay with my girlfriend but I just know that my mom is going to be overly invasive and try to track down where the hotel is. I know that legally I have no obligation to follow her rules but she gets very dramatic and loud when she doesn't get what she wants. She would probably say things like ""You have to tell me because I'm your mother."" She's definitely going to call her names and try to intimidate me. 

The simple solution would be to call the police if she does something crazy, but I feel like the trip would already be ruined by then. I just want to be able to stay with my girlfriend unbothered without my mom trying to butt in.

But then again, if that's how he feels it's valid, even though its dissapointing. 

But I've been thinking a lot today and I see now that dating is really just getting comfortable with being rejected. That every time you put yourself out there you risk getting rejected and that that's okay. That it's not a flaw of my character, it's just the nature of dating.

When I was 17 I got drunk at a middle aged lady’s house and she grabbed my ass and my dick at various points in the night. I ended up leaving because I didn’t like that but I guess that meant a woman was interested in me hopefully. I had two invitations into threesomes: one with two bi girls, one with a friend and his girlfriend. I didn’t have the balls to escalate on the first and they left after they straight up asked me, I just didn’t take them up on the offer for the second like an idiot.

I missed obvious opportunity after opportunity with this one really pretty girl I really, really liked because I never broke out from being shy and never escalated. My favorite night with her: we got drunk at a friends house and were both laying down on our backs on a trampoline, looking up at the night sky, talking for a long time. It was perfect. Then we went into the house to crash. I laid down on the couch and she laid down on the floor next to me. We talked some more. Then a friend came in, sat next to her, talked to her for a bit. Then he started making out with her. She said, “Nooo, I want to kiss [me].” He kept making out with her and I did nothing. I just sat there watching them the rest of the night. One time after I failed to escalate after probably hundreds of opportunities, I heard her mutter “It’s never going to happen. Never.” Then she never came to a party I was at ever again. Plenty of other pretty girls showed interest back then and I was just too shy and they moved on one after another.

Eventually I hit a point where the dynamic of social things changed for me significantly. I stopped getting invited to parties, didn’t have any good friends anymore, and girls weren’t interested in me like they were once. I was invisible now. And that’s just gotten worse with time.

I finally had sex with a girl that pitied me when I was 33. I was just trying to get it over with, I wasn’t attracted to her much and it was pretty fucking awkward. But she was the first girl I had run into for years that seemed like she might be willing to go there.

Everything else in life is looking good for me. I ended up very successful. But I’m still extremely invisible in that way for some reason. Dating apps go absolutely nowhere. Everyone irl has a family and kids. No one invites me to anything.

I just screwed the fuck up on this one lol. Sometimes I tell myself that those opportunities were never there, that it was just in my head, and that explains my current situation of invisibility. But they were there. I just missed my opportunities, assumed they would keep coming, they didn’t, and I’m screwed now.

They were chatting with eachother, but then laughed/giggled as they approached me. I felt embarrassed so I got up to leave, but as I tried to walk past them one of them teased ""enjoying your food?"". Instead of replying I rolled my eyes [poor choice I know].

Then, on the bus home there was this really hot waitress who got on at the same stop. She was glancing at me when I wasn't looking, and I met her gaze met once or twice - but nothing came of it.

The thing is, I've never acted in response to any of these teases or eye games because;

A) You can never be certain a sign is intentional or imagined.

B) Social stigma surrounding approaching women is pretty high right now + virus.

C) What on earth do you do in response? Let alone say.


One recent example was on the train. A woman on the other side of the carriage was looking at me, but when I glanced back at her she looked away and started playing with her hair.


Another odd interaction I had was with a woman at the gym. She thought I looked closer to her age, but when I told her I was younger she murmured that she didn't look it.


On a more positive note: I'm always insecure about my perceived blemishes, but if people are giving me attention I mustn't look THAT bad.

But tonight at a party as I was chatting to an interesting and attractive woman, the words just fell out of me. It almost felt like I was on autopilot when I offered her my number.

And you know what? Nothing bad happened! I wasn't called a creep, she didn't back away. She simply informed me that she had a boyfriend. I said ""congratulations, and please take it as a compliment"", and we carried on chatting as before. People are mostly friendly, I have to remember that.

Just posting this for anyone who needs this. This is an experience I had not that long ago but I’ve only really fully processed it and wanted to share for anyone who needs it right now. I had a date with someone a few months ago and it went amazing. We spoke for 7 hours that night and was incredible. Like it felt like the kind of date where it felt we both were falling for each other hard. After the date we start exchanging texts. I’ve had confidence issues in the past but I felt really good because she was the one initiating the texts, asking for my Snapchat and everything. We were both law students so setting up a second date was difficult given work load but we finally managed to and the week of the date she gets into a car accident and snaps me pictures of it. Naturally, I reach out making sure she is ok and if she needs help or anything. 

Later in the week I reach out to her making sure she is feeling better and seeing if she would still be interested in meeting. She says she probably wouldn’t be up to it because she isn’t feeling well which I said I completely understand and maybe instead we could do a virtual happy hour if she would be up to it (this was in middle of covid). She said she may be up for that. Long story short I text her two days later asking if she’d be up for the virtual happy hour she ghosts me and when she finally does reply she says I was “overwhelming” and basically implying I didn’t get the message she wasn’t up for it that week because of her accident. 

Naturally this really hurt my feelings as I am usually very conscious of not over texting from a past bad experience. I’m usually very critical of myself and was blaming myself so I reached out to a female friend and send her the text exchanges as well as some of my other friends to see if I was in fact “overwhelming”. They are usually blatantly honest with me but in this situation they said I had did nothing wrong. I wasn’t overwhelming as I hadn’t texted in a few days and when I did text it wasn’t “over the top” so to speak. Additionally, I had no reason to know that she wasn’t up for it because she told me she might be interested.

This isn’t to say that the girl I was talking to was in the wrong but it taught me not to always blame myself. I don’t know what was going on in her life. In fact, I met her on an app and it was her friends who set up her account which may indicate that she is hesitant to date for whatever reason. I know the story was long but if my words mean anything to someone reading this it’s just that don’t be so quick to blame yourself when something doesn’t work out.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,790183,public,self,Sometimes it has nothing to do with you,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/niv6vb/sometimes_it_has_nothing_to_do_with_you/,all_ads,6,,,

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

A week later even though we did not meet up irl she told me she only sees me as a friend, i told her i cant be friends as i had a similar experience last year with a girl and it just broke me, so we went no contact for 3 days and then i said i want to remain the contact as i really enjoyed our conversations and i value our bond. But it makes it very hard for me because i keep on thinking about the what ifs, it makes it hard because the first few weeks she did had those feelings and attraction, as in touching me and giving compliments, and it just vanished like fairy dust. She told me she really needs me in her life and really values our bond.

But i dont know what to do, the attraction was obviously there and now i am friendzoned. Is there any possibilty she can see me as more then a friend after a while or is it not possible as it is clear for her after some thinking she only sees me as a friend?
