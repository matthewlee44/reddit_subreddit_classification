Honesty, integrity, education, confidence, discretion, cleanliness and a genuine respect for others go a long way with me.

I'm particularly interested in a more matured man that have professional lives. looks are not important to be as beauty is in the heart and that is what count to me. Age doesn't matter. I value honesty, and I am not into people who are ""Players"". I think that I am most attracted to someone who likes to have fun. He should have good sense of humor. I want a man that shows up when a date is made and doesn't get nervous and get cold feet. You need to be open, excitable, curious, alluring &amp; honest. A decent guy who's looking to get married...

Great sexual and mental chemistry, we have so much in common, including esoteric and geeky interests. Same values, same taste in music, fashion and humour, and even the same political/social views. We were like two peas in a pod when we were together but sadly, he had to move back to his hometown 2-3 months after we’d met, and we haven’t seen each other since. When he left, we stopped talking; however, he did text me a few times 3 months later, 4 months later and 6 months later. I was in a serious relationship with someone I met after he left, so I did not respond to his texts at all until the 6 month point? I told him of my relationship from the get go and he was respectful and talked to me as a friend but would still call me sometimes to know what I’ve been doing. Eventually my relationship didn’t work out, so yeah I’ve been single since then - for 3 years now. He’s been single the entire time, too. He’s asked me when we’re going to reunite, he’s said he’s waiting to see me, he’s asked me to fly over to him when he’s in a nearby town but I just haven’t seen him because I’ve been doing my own thing and working on levelling up in life y’know? But now I’m at a point where I think I’d really like to see him again soon and get it over with because I’m getting older, so I told him he should fly to me while we were sexting… then he says… maybe? haha what? MAYBE? Then he said I had to prove that I deserve having him buy a ticket to see em. So, I’m really confused but mind you, I’ve never asked him to see me prior to this, like, I once blocked him for 8 months once when I was getting over my
breakup with my ex-bf, and we mended things right away. For an entire year, I did not send him a single nude image/video because I was hoping he’d get over me and move on. I even asked him if this is purely a sexual thing for him last year, and he said he actually liked me and wanted to see me again. We only started to really sext each other again intensely about 4 months ago, like really intensely, talking about what we missed doing with each other in bed. Bruh, I am so confused. So, does he not want to see me/not a priority right now? Maybe he just wants sexual gratification online? Should I just move on and forget about this man? Or am I being silly? Was his “maybe” just playful? I don’t understand this man at all. I barely put out, too, and I’ve told him to talk to other women, but he says he just wants me, and how no one can “take it” like me.

Hello all. I'm 24F and I met this girl (""Anna""), 21F, on Tinder about 2 months ago. We matched and then chatted for about a month, just kind of getting to know each other before I worked up the courage to ask her out. She said yes and we settled on a coffee date. This took place a couple weeks ago and I thought it went really well. We stayed until close talking and afterwards she told me she'd like to do this again sometime.

The next day we were texting and I gave Anna a compliment I'd been too nervous to say in person. She returned the compliment and I made a comment about how she was the first non-family/close friend to ever say that about me, which is when she asked if I had ever been in a relationship before.

At this point I had to admit that no, nobody has ever been interested in me. Growing up I was very different from everyone in my small town, so I was constantly turned down by boys, and then after realizing I'm bi and trying to branch out once I went to college, none of the people I was interested in ever reciprocated. It's been a point of hurt for me but I try to stay positive and not let it bother me too much.

It was after this admission that Anna told me I should know that she isn't really looking for a relationship at the moment. This caught me off guard because she had never brought this up before, and I was under the impression we went on the date to start getting to know each other in a romantic capacity. My friends say my lack of experience isn't what made her say that, but it just seems too coincidental for me.

So okay, fine, another one didn't work out for me. That's okay, I let myself be sad about it for a day, and then I got my shit together. Anna and I have still been chatting because we expressed mutual interest in continuing to talk. Last night I asked if she'd like to go out again sometime, and that ""it doesn't have to be a date if you don't want it to be"". I want to hang out with this girl and if she just wants to be friends that's cool, I don't want to pressure her.

But she replied ""it can be either"", before suggesting dinner and a museum. Now I'm just so confused. Is she interested in me or not? Advice from my friends hasn't been helpful because they feel she's jerking me around but I'm not so sure. I have a hard time because this is entirely new territory for me, I've only been on 2 other dates in my life besides with Anna, and neither of those lead to second dates.

Before the situation above happened, I had put together a video of all of his family &amp; close friends telling him happy birthday &amp; he was so excited. Later that night I took him to dinner &amp; I gave him his final gift, NBA tickets. When I gave him the gift he said “oh wow, thanks babe.
I appreciate this. You didn’t have to do this.” I was videotaping. I was kinda taken aback by his reaction. Not in a bad way but I just expected him to be wayyyyy more excited. So I started overthinking on rather I’d gotten him the right gift. This is where things went down hill. I started crying at the restaurant. Not because I was upset but just because I wasn’t sure if I had gotten him what he wanted or if I had done enough. &amp; once I started crying it just kinda dampen the mood. He wasn’t really himself for the rest of the night. &amp; I asked what was wrong &amp; he said “it’s hard seeing your wife cry on your birthday &amp; now I think I did something wrong” &amp; I told him he didn’t. We returned home &amp; he said he wanted to watch a scary movie &amp; I said “at night? Idk about that” &amp; he said “it’s my birthday, hush” &amp; I took offense to it. &amp; he said “I was just joking, doesn’t feel like I can do anything right”. We ended up going to bed &amp; we talked some more. This morning he got up &amp; fixed my lunch for work &amp; drove me to work &amp; he was silent. He dropped me off &amp; said “I hope you have a great day. Love you”. It just felt so off. So I texted him this morning &amp; he said he’s still working through emotions from yesterday.

 I want to get a bit more comfortable with them, which can take only 30 minutes or less. But I just do not like doing it immediately (heavily flirting nor having sex), unless there is a very strong connection/attraction straight away.

I just swapped one problem for a different problem.

For the longest time, there was nothing I (f24) wanted more than to be beautiful. When I was 18 y/o I would walk out of the house feeling like a 10, only to have guys overlook me for my friends. Now I know I shouldn’t have based my self esteem on male attention but I was young and only human. 

Things took a turn for the better when I accepted my situation. I took matters into my own hands and approached guys I liked irl. If a guy was interested in me it never started that way. It always started as a friendship that developed into attraction. 

My last LTR lasted three years. As a big advocate of self improvement I never stopped working on myself. I continued to work on my fitness, style and confidence. Objectively, I know I’ve gotten more attractive.

Now that I’m back on the market, it’s wild how differently I’m treated. Other than confidence, my personality hasn’t changed much. And yet now, I struggle to get people to see past my looks. I’m no model by any means, afterall the gym can only do so much but now it seems I have the opposite problem. Guys find me physically attractive but I have to work to get them to like me as a person. 

Because it’s so different from what I’m used to, I’m grossed out by how quickly things escalate sexually. Some guys don’t even care to get to know me before they tell me what they want to do to me. As a result, I’m a lot more guarded now so I can figure out what guys want from me. Even if I think I know what they want, I need to mentally prepare myself in case they lose interest in me once I sleep with them. Love bombing is something I had to understand quickly.

Before I was invisible, now I’m afraid to be used.

Need ur opinion on a particular 'behavior'. Long story short, I noticed a girl in the same class at university. After class finished that day, I decided to approach her in front of her friends, introduce myself, and ask for a number. She blushed like hell (even my friend run away when he saw I m going for it), talked a bit, and gave me her phone num. Two-three days after, I asked her out for a walk and coffee, but she rejected me with an 'I m busy' excuse and didn't offer any backup date. Firstly I was like: ""Meh, that was expected, after all, she doesn't know me well. No big deal."" I started teasing her a bit about her being busy, she was engaged in conversation, and we continuously texted afterward. Even at university, it was obvious and even kinda funny how we were checking each other out, blushing, smiling, etc. (she is very introverted). That lasted for about two weeks (we were texting that period), and I decided it was an appropriate moment to ask her out again. She again rejected me with 'I m not feeling it"". This time, I lost it, started looking for an explanation (overall needy behavior), and ofc she 'run' away. I said: ""Ok, this is a lost cause, there is nothing I can do right now besides let it go"". Took an 'L', deleted her number, shortened communication to the max, and moved on.

Time passed (8 months to be precise) and I got a message: ""Didn't know that u have similar research interests as I do"". I replied: ""I don't know who is it, but yeah, that is my field of interest."" When she said it is her, I laughed and teased her a bit (Apparently, she saw some of my work, although we already talked about that earlier while we were in touch). She took it with ease and said: ""I thought u r would offer me some suggestions to help me out, but u r making fun of me"" I was like: ""Why not, let's meet up out on a day/time/place and see what we can do."" Guess what, she rejected again but this time exclusive with a counteroffer: ""Only at university."" I said: ""That's not going to work for me, but if u change ur mind, hit me up.""

Time passed again (3 months) and yesterday I got a message from our mutual friend. The message was: ""She says hi"" and a picture of her."" I responded only: ""Looking good, have fun"".

My question is how do you explain this and what is she trying to achieve now? Would u differently respond to the last contact? Maybe I missed some obvious things? Maybe she wants to be friends, but that is a big no-no for me, and I believe she knows that well.

This post is going to be a bit long because I want to describe everything important. 


A while back, I asked a friend if his wife happened to have any cool girlfriends that I could go out with. 

It turned out that she did and she is currently single. He sent me her profile, my type - I went into action. 

(Im 26yo - She 23yo)

I wrote straight away that she is attractive and looks like an interesting person so I decided to take a risk and invite her for tea.

She lives in another city (about 25 minutes by car). So I came to her town, we went for the previously mentioned tea and generally had a nice time talking. Our interests overlapped. But at one point she told me straight up that she didn't want to get into any relationship because she was fresh off a breakup with a toxic guy (they'd been together two months). I replied that I wasn't going to kneel down and ask her to marry me on the first meeting and that I had no expectations - time will tell.

After tea we took a long walk around town and I walked her to her car. It was obvious that we were both a little stressed but we found a common language and it was nice.

Less than a week after the meeting, the girl went to visit my friend's wife and reported about her date with me. She said that I was her type and called me a mirror image of her personality in a man's body - she also suggested that I didn't speak to her after the meeting. Of course, a friend summarized her visit to them for me.

I decided that I would hear from her two days after the event. So I did, invited her out for skating and dinner - she agreed, but in a few days because she currently had a lot of work and studying for college. 

This time she came to my town - she insisted herself - she picked me up and we went straight to dinner because she was very hungry after work. Again we had a nice time talking, there was a lot of laughter and generally it was more relaxed. I even inflated her car wheels after dinner because she complained that she had no air. She drove me home, we thanked each other for a nice time and went back to our homes.

And this is where my doubt begins. I wrote to her the next day - she wrote back a day later and zero interest in me. I wrote back, same situation - she wrote back the next day explaining that she had a lot of work to do. I felt a little sorry for her and decided that she might actually have a lot of work and study to do and not have the time to talk to me.

It's been almost a week since our last text interaction and I was secretly hoping that she would write me back with at least a silly question about how I'm doing. But still no initiative. 

In the meantime I told my friend about everything and he told me that there was little chance that she would contact me first because of her low self-esteem. She was in a long relationship and got cheated on and another guy found her weird and told her to fuck off. 

As far as I'm concerned from a body she's not missing anything and the personality type totally fits me even though it's only been two meetings. 

And I'm trapped because I don't know what to do, whether to give her more time, call her and set up another meeting or let this acquaintance go. 

If you've reached this point, I'd like to thank you sincerely. On the one hand, I'd like to express my emotions somewhere, and on the other, I'd like some advice on what I should do to put this relationship on the right track and show her that she's a valuable girl and finally met a decent guy, in whom she'll have support.

The vast majority of our relationship has been in-person (not long distance). And we actually moved in together about a year and a half ago. I always felt like we were on the same page when it came to our future, and we would frequently talk about getting married and having kids.

Well, about 4 months ago, I started a 9 month long grant to teach overseas. Leaving the home that we had built together was one of the toughest things that I've ever had to do, but before I left he made me a photo book filled with pictures of us and he wrote me letters detailing all of the fun things that we would do the summer after I come back. Since my grant started, we've Facetimed every single night and we've continued to talk about how much we miss each other and all of the plans that we have for when we are reunited.

This month, I had a bit of a break in my teaching duties so I booked a plane ticket back home and arranged to visit my boyfriend for 11 days. He always sounded eager about my visit when we talked about it on the phone. Well, two nights ago I arrived and I could tell that something was off. He refused to be intimate with me and would often stand on the other side of the room from me and just act weird. Then yesterday he confessed that he wants to break up because he doesn't feel ""a spark."" I tried asking for him to elaborate on that and he just said that he didn't feel as excited to see me as he thought that he would be. He keeps assuring me that I've done nothing wrong and that he still loves me, but that he wants to break up because ""he feels weird and he can't ignore his feelings.""

I have been absolutely gutted by this. I feel so helpless because even he admitted there's nothing that I could do to help him sort his feelings out and that I did nothing to cause this. And here's the part that has me especially frustrated. I asked him how long he's been having doubts and feeling his excitement wane and he says about a month. Within the past month he's had a series of personal tragedies including the loss of a close friendship and his grandfather (whom he was super close with) passing away suddenly due to COVID. I'm not a mental health expert by any means, but personally, I think his loss of excitement is a byproduct of all of the stress he's been under lately, and has nothing to do with the relationship itself. I've tried telling him that, but he keeps shrugging my suggestion off. He was also raised in a household that taught him that ""men that show feelings won't be respected"" and so I think that's contributed to him ignoring my thoughts on the matter and my suggestions that he seeks professional help.

Anyway, I'm looking for any advice that I can get. We spent years planning for a future together and now suddenly it feels like all of that is being thrown away due to no fault of my own. So has anyone else ever dealt with a partner suddenly getting cold feet like this? Is there anything that I can do to help him get excited about the relationship again or to help him regain ""the spark?""",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1156613,public,self,I (23F) Flew Across The Ocean to Visit My Boyfriend (24M) Only For Him to Tell Me That He Wants to Break Up,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sisf82/i_23f_flew_across_the_ocean_to_visit_my_boyfriend/,no_ads,0,,,

Also, obviously all women aren’t the same—discuss preferences with your partner.

Although it seems counterintuitive, pausing stimulation while teasing during foreplay actually increases arousal for women. 

The only time you want to avoid this approach is if she’s reaching the point of orgasm.  The concept of ‘keep doing what feels good’ applies in these instances.

You want to help her achieve orgasm or get her as close as you can before actual intercourse occurs. The overall sexual experience will benefit both of you—if foreplay is drawn out, taken slowly, with teasing and attention being paid to other parts of her body, sex will be hotter.

Here are some examples:

- Lightly but rapidly brush her clitoris as you’re kissing. After several minutes, pause for about thirty seconds. During this time continue kissing her, but also move to her neck, her breasts, her shoulder. Then, continue, with the rapid fluttering of your finger for a minute. Stop. Then continue the fluttering while you kiss her but for only about 15 seconds or so. Continue this ‘cycle’ of stopping and starting for seven minutes before moving on

- If you’re fingering. Try to position her so  she’s leaning against you, with one of your arms around her, in bed or somewhere comfortable where you both are laying down. As you kiss, use your middle finger to press up against stimulate her G Spot in rapid heartbeat like rhythm. Your fingers will be moving in an ‘upward’ motion on the upper wall of the vagina, near the entrance. After minute, stop but leave your finger inside. Kiss her, focus your attention kissing her and other parts of her body, and whisper to her. Start the rhythm again, but with stronger, slower rhythm. Ba-bum. Ba-bum. 

You don’t want to stop too much, there needs to be balance. If you stop too frequently, it will throw things off. But the right amount will turn her on more.

We are both 24 and work full time. She's a nurse with early hours. She works 5:30am to about 3pm. Early on we texted A LOT, she also had different shift hours during that time. 

We FaceTime 3-4x a week. For at least an hour and a half too. We really vibe and end up staying up way later than intended whenever we talk to eachother. 

Lately she's became a really slow texter. Sometimes 3-4 hours before a reply on text or snap. We do have the red heart on snap though so I guess that's good? She always replies/doesn't leave me on read and seems to show effort but I've had some very emotionally draining ""flings"" with girls. I texted her ""hey you :)"" the other day and she replied ""hey lol"". That sent me into a massive overthinking phase for some reason. 

She said she's down to FaceTime tonight so we may chat for a while. I want to make sure we are on the same page about communication. She had told me that lately she hasn't hardly even been checking her phone and trying to not be on her phone as much. She's been working out, working full time, doing productive things etc. 

I understand I'm obviously not the most important thing in her life right now and she has other priorities. That's totally understandable and a good thing honestly, but I want to see how she feels about how things are going and how she feels about talking throughout the day.

We used to see eachother casually about 2.5 years ago but the pandemic caused us to drift apart after i moved to a different state. We got in contact and started dating 2 months ago and last week I flew out to spend 4 days with him. It went great… we went on dates and had lots of time to spend in person. He asked me to be his girlfriend 2 weeks ago and I said yes. During sex 3 days ago he told me he loved me and I just brushed it off and didn’t respond or mention it after. I keep thinking about this and sort of want to ask him about it but it might be pointless. I think it was just in the moment and he didn’t really mean it. Especially because he’s kind of acting distant towards me and not texting me good morning/goodnight and really texting me at all. SO Last night I texted asking him if he’s still interested in me after spending some time together and if he still is my boyfriend. He said of course but mentioned that it was out of nowhere and said he still feels the same way and nothing has changed. I apologized for being weird and asked him how he’s doing but he never responded. That was at 9pm last night and he didn’t text me this morning. I’m not texting him first because it seems like he needs space. He’s my boyfriend and i wish he’d communicate if something is up. I am debating on calling him when he’s off work later to see how he’s doing, is this a good idea or should i wait?

January came around and the date of what would've been her and her exes anniversary. She seemed to have a bit of a mental wobble with this and started changing up on me...taking hours and hours to respond and when she did, was pretty blunt. I obviously clocked this and told her I'd give her a bit of time n space...a couple weeks went by and she seemed perfectly fine until she cracked again...this time telling me she's not over her breakup and that she doesn't want to date anybody and wants to just stay friends at the moment. I told her my feelings go beyond being her friend and then I don't think I can be her friend if it feels unhealthy/toxic for me...

I really like this girl and honestly if you told me in 3 months we'd be together I'd wait around but we all know it doesn't work like that. She told me I'm seemingly perfect for her on paper but she just can't date anyone atm...Do I be friendly here and there with her and date other women? Do I just completely cut it off?

It started off as the normal catching up that two people do who haven’t spoken in years, but I started to get romantic feelings for this girl after hanging out a couple of times. 

She had contacted me first and expressed her desire to hang out and catch up (by watching some movies the both of us enjoyed). We did just that, she came over and we watched some movies and went out for dinner. She seemed to be interested in moving forward but also a little bit hesitant. I didn’t want any confusion between us, so I told her how I felt about her and asked what she would like to see happen between the two of us - relationship wise. She admitted that she did like me, and did like spending time with me, but as she got out of a bad relationship about 3 months prior, she was hesitant on getting into a full on relationship again so soon. I said I understand, no hard feelings, and I’ll leave you be to sort everything out. She wanted to continue talking and hanging out. This was about one month ago. I said ok, if you would like something to happen between us, we can take our time. She agreed that slow was good. I’m willing to put in the time and effort for a girl that I have real feelings for and could potentially see a future with. 

Another month went by and we are still basically doing the same thing - hanging out, talking, kissing and so on. I’m curious about the trajectory of this relationship, so I bring up it up again. I asked her if she just wants to be friends as she doesn’t seem to be ready for a relationship yet - I thought I gave her an easy out (if that’s what she wanted). She instead says that she still really enjoys spending time with me, she likes me, and she can see this turning into a relationship down the line. I didn’t pressure her for exact dates or anything. 

This was now two weeks ago that we had this conversation and I haven’t seen her since, although we literally talk every day (she sends me good morning texts and selfies on snap chat, all the normal stuff, she never ignores me or doesn’t answer for more than an hour or two at the most). She works odd hours and lives about a 30 minute drive away. I had asked if she wanted to hang out this week and she mentioned that she’s pretty busy with work and we haven’t made a plan to hangout again in the future. Typically I would have walked away from this weeks ago, but I do like this girl and she seems to like me too.. but at what point do I draw the line and say “let’s put a hold on this until you know what you’re looking for”. I am quite confident she isn’t seeing anybody else, but I could just be naive, although she tells me that I am the only person she speaks to romantically. 

So, I like this girl. She seems to like me. Does she actually need more time, or am I just wasting my time? I may be turning a blind eye to some typically obviously red flags because I am interested in this girl. I need an outside opinion.

In short the girl (F18) that I’m (M20) talking to for over a month (known her before 4 months) had a mental breakdown a couple of days ago. It was because she was going through family problems and college rejections. She called me crying and talked about her problems and to basically say she just wanted to be friends because I’ve helped her so much this month but that she wasn’t in the right headspace for a relationship and I accepted it. 

Later after having a talk with her mom she told me that she can’t stop living her life because of the things she was going through and that she needs to start a new chapter in her life and move past the bad things.

We both decided it would be good to do a fresh start and try again with dating. She said she didn’t have a label yet for us and that she wants to test the waters to see if we would be good together and to take it slow. She basically said all this on our first date over a month ago so it’s literally back to square one.

But there was some things that she said on our conversation that led to her having a breakdown that concerns me.

1. She said she thinks I’m a great person but there was something about me that she didn’t know how to feel about. She said she didn’t know the specific but just something about me.

2. She said that I’m exactly like her (that we both care a lot about people, same interests, have sort of the same thought process). She said that it wasn’t a turn off and that it’s great but idk it doesn’t seem like a good thing.

3. She said that were both different people when we’re at work versus when it’s just us talking. She said that we both have to act different and that our boss suspects that we’re going out makes her feel worried that our coworkers might now too. She said that she’s not embarrassed that she’s talking to me just that she didn’t want drama at work.

I don’t really know If I’m overthinking or not and if I should bring my concerns up. To me It feels like that I’m just someone thats here right now that’s good for her until someone else comes along that she likes first. I just feel after a month you should know at least a little bit if you’d want to be with someone. She knows that I like her but it just feels like everything’s on her terms since I’m the one that knows how I feel. I know the woman has the right to do that but it just feels like my feelings aren’t really being considered here.

 I don’t know if I should talk to her about this. I don’t want to add stuff to her plate (a lot of her problems have gotten better but still it’s fresh) but I can’t just let these things go. She told me afterwards that she was sorry for the things she said and that it was in the moment but I feel that even if you say things in the moment there’s some truth to them. I really do like her so maybe I should just wait it out but right now I’m not sure.

There is this guy at work where I have crush. He stares at me and when I catch him he looks away shyly. A few times I decided to stare back and now he just doesn’t hide it anymore… He talks with other coworkers and jokes but not with me. I try to smile, joke around and even joke with him which I think helped cuz now he makes here and there jokes and small conversations. Yet I can sense he is a little bit nervous but not sure. When we are alone he doesn’t speak.These days I see he is coming a lot closer to my personal space but in a work related way if that makes sense. He never do that before. Example… he have to say something to my colleague and he’ll stand right next to me (my back facing him) and he’ll speak to the coworker face to face or he’ll lean next to me to tell us something quick. Then there this hot girl, when she is next to him he looks at me to see if I’m looking at them???He is more engaging but not looking so intense like before…like he stares but not so much and I don’t know what the hell is going on?
