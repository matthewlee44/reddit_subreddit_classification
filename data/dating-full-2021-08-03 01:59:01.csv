Any advice is welcomed!

TL;DR: Dated someone for five months, it was headed in a serious direction, however, given circumstances both beyond our control and his priority level, we broke it off. He reached back out and now I'm trying to decide if it's worth giving it a second shot. 

Recently, I (26F) took a hiatus from dating. Coming out of two very toxic, serious relationships, followed by a small period of dating that seemingly felt healthy but just didn't work out, I decided to take some time to reflect inward and address some personal things. It's been going great and I've been doing well on my own; sure it gets lonely, but I'm building a strong community of friends which has proved so helpful. 

In the past few months, however, an ex (30M) reached out to me and it's left me unsure how to move forward. We began dating in October 2020, after I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship. Still working through things and healing, I was pretty cautious and didn't hold any expectations. Ironically, we started dating and it felt like one of the most healthy relationships I've had: he was caring, thoughtful, respectful; he initiated plans/conversation, and we spent good, quality time together. We really vibed and both expressed a serious interest in each other. One thing that I really appreciated was his honesty. In early discussions about our wants/needs/boundaries, he shared that he didn't really have any experience with serious relationships so far in his life (he focused on his career), but he was doing a lot of self-work in the past year as he wanted finally make time and space for a relationship. He acknowledged that communication wasn't his strong point -- particularly around deeply personal things as he's always handled it on his own --but he was working on it. I clocked this, but considering that we were naming the issue, there was likely room for growth. All said, things felt like they were moving in the right direction.

Around four months in, one of his parents suddenly grew very ill. I didn't know what was going on at first, as our communication also suddenly dropped off for a week. Finally hearing from him, he vaguely told me what was going on, and that he had rushed back home to support his family (understandably). I offered my support, which he was thankful for, but admittedly shared that this was something hard for him to discuss and receive help with (which made sense given the above sentiment). For most of February, things were kinda spotty as he was traveling to see his parents, trying to take care of his own health (which was of concern), and juggling work (he got a promotion). He still made time for me as best as he could, but of course he was exhausted. He was filling me in more about the status of his parents which was great, but he was also becoming more involved with other projects (buying investment property, going out of state to visit friends) and it felt like 'we' were becoming less of a priority. After another small bout of lack of communication, I suggested maybe we take a break not because I wanted to, but mostly out of fear things weren't going to work out. As mentioned, I was still dealing with the trauma from previous relationships and this was in part a trigger response, but also a decent boundary. Soon after, we met and had a deep conversation where I clearly expressed either we work on this or we separate as it's not fair to either of us. He admitted he was having a lot of difficulty balancing things but that he strongly wanted to be together and work through it. I was kind of surprised honestly, but the conversation felt so good. About three weeks later, I get a text that says he has to rethink things because he's just too overwhelmed. It sucked, especially since it felt a bit like a blindside but I knew it was out of my control so I began to move on. I told him if he wanted to talk about it, I'm around. About month later after not hearing from him, I get a text that he wants to meet to catch up. After a ton of back and forth because of his work schedule, I finally go over to his place to talk at midnight on a weekday. He apologized for how he handled things, including the lack of communication, and then explained he just didn't know how to balance things. He wanted a relationship with me -- and acknowledged that we were building something serious together and he never felt like this for someone -- but at this time he couldn't prioritize me with all the other things going on. He then asked what he could do, and where it left us. I expressed my appreciation for his honesty and the conversation, but said I couldn't be the person to tell him how to live (he asked me how to be better at making space in his life for all of this, which was ultimately the big convo we had weeks prior where I told him only he could make the decision for himself what he wants), and respectfully walked out of his apartment. When I left we were both really hurt and emotional (I don't think he thought I was going to leave) but it didn't seem like there was any other option. 

Fast forward a month later, and out of blue he adds me on snapchat. This is the only social, aside from Facebook, he has and we never connected on either. He starts sending me snaps of mundane things, like his work day, where he's traveling, what he's doing. I don't respond because I feel like after everything that transpired, if he wanted to talk the least he could do was send me an actual composed message. This goes on for about two months. Last month he finally reaches out with a drunken text to see how I am, how he wants to see me, and spend time. We talk but I don't really show too much interest, in part because he's drunk but also as I've already started to move on and I'm a bit frustrated this is how we connect again. For the next three weeks he's reaching out via text and snapchat, but now he's also sending me explicit messages, which was something we never really did when we dated.  I also notice that he's posting stories with another girl and they look kinda boo'd up. I go back and forth many times about whether or not I should even engage in messaging him at this point, and he keeps pressing to see me. This weekend I finally gave in and he came over. Needless to say we slept together, but he didn't stay for long as he was actually out with family and then was leaving for an international flight in the morning. It was bit awkward at first: we didn't really know what to say since this was the first time we've seen each other since we broke up and this was kinda a booty call.  He also made some weird comments about being jealous of my new apartment (note that it always kinda felt like we were in competition about who was the breadwinner). Eventually it passed and we talked about life, I asked about his mom (which I think he was taken aback that I remembered/cared). He left shortly after, but said that upon his return from his international trip he wanted to see me and actually talk. 

It's now been a day or so and I'm not really sure what to do. I know what I feel, which is I miss him. I thought he were really going to work out, and I still wish things would. But I'm uncertain if anything has really changed. From the small bits of conversation we had, it didn't feel like he found balance for himself. Also, I'm not sure where he's at with dating this other girl or what he wants as far as commitment. To some degree, it feels like he's lonely and he's just returning to what he knows makes him feel good...

At this point, it feels I want to have a conversation upon his return and just lay it out -- I know what I want (commitment) and what I don't (FWB, situation). This way at least once I know where he stands with this, and our wants don't align, it's not worth pursuing. I guess I'm just wondering if giving him my time and my energy is worth it? Does he show really any interest or am I just playing myself here? I've been doing so, so good on my own self-work and healing and I don't want to regress...but I also don't want to shut something out that I know I want.

Love doesn't die a natural death.


It dies because we grow in different directions and we no longer want or are willing to strive towards the same things


It dies because of lies and cover up. When we inflict jealousies and inappropriate behaviors. The explosive confessions after a fog of suspicion.


It dies because its impossible to divide the heart over multiple partnerships. That feeds indifference. And its a testament of character.


It dies due to starvation from crumbs of affection and attention. Crumbs of smiles. Crumbs of happiness.


It dies due to stagnation. Love is dynamic and alive ever growing and developing. When you no longer wish to explore new interest together, love will coil around someone who will.


It dies from abuse, cruel words, non pleasing acts and from over possessiveness. All these states invite resentment.


It takes more than love to keep love alive. Midnight never strikes two hearts at the same time. One will always love more than the other. The one who loves less stops protecting the one who loves more. Remember my reddit reader. Love is not words. You can proclaim love and treat that person badly. Love is not a feeling. Your feelings can change over the course of breakfast, plus love comes with a drop of pain and fear. Love is behavior. What you do. What you show.


We have become sexually frivolous and confuse desire with love. Sex and desire are elements of love just as hot water is not soup.


Remember the vow. Remember the reason for the vow. The wisdom behind the vow.


To honor and cherish my mate in good times and bad. Please grasp the wisdom. Good times destroys sometimes faster than bad times. Look at the mess celebrities create. In sickness and in health. A vain man always working out or woman looking for a boob job has a drop of poison. Health can destroy. In want and in plenty. Wealth becomes tools of dominance, and that is anti love. Love is an equalizer in that it can reduces a king to kneel and marry a peasant. To forsake all others. This one really confused people and I will not get into this.. All others. All ,not except...


But love does not die naturally. When you allow yourself to get familiar and boring. When you allow your passion to wane. When you reach the point when you believe your mate isn't worth fighting for.. You murder your love.

I work in a big warehouse with mostly people in my age group (20-30, I'm 24.) Everyone is cool and friendly, and a few chicks have caught my eye. 
One in particular, with tatts all up on her leg and beautiful wavy hair, and very feisty. We talked in passing a few times but not much aside from her teasing me but the last 2 days shes definitely said a lot more. Asking why I didnt hang out with her at lunch, didnt say hi, etc just teasing. Lots of mutual smiling at each other. She did say ""goodmorning handsome"" as I was working but I only got to watch her walk away that time 😋🍑. Everytime I go near her she gives me shit but I can get her right back and she is quick with it. 

Today though I was taking care of something and she was nearby with a few of her friends she came up alone and said,"" asking for a friend, do you have a significant other"" and if asked If i wanted one. It was adorable and awkward and totally caught me off guard. I said something clever tbh I can hardly remember, her friends heard too and laughed a bit. We talked for like 46 seconds probably and she walked off. I asked her her friends name and she said I'd have to find out on my own. And like high school I heard her friends laughing and teasing as they walked away. I tried to see if I could catch her on our way out but she was with a few of the other supervisor/coworkers I didnt know and I chickened out. 

Funnily enough I have no idea what her name is since it hasn't really come up organically, we never really have time to just stand around and I'm a little chicken.

I'm currently a 29M. My 20s were an insanely hard time of my life. I lost a parent to cancer when I was 21. Because of that, I decided not to date while I put the pieces of my shattered life back together. I started dating again when I was 27. I really didn't date prior to losing my parent, so I literally had to learn how to date at age 27. I spent basically two years straight absolutely failing, but after each failure, I would reflect and be very critical of myself. Each time I got a little better.

Fast-forward through all of the shit experiences, about a month and a half ago I decided to shoot my shot again with a girl on hinge. We had previously matched a few months ago, but I just couldn't get a conversation to click between us. With an extra few months of failures and experience, I was able to get a good conversation going and we clicked. We texted for two weeks before going on our first date. It went great and we started finding out we had a ton in common in person, both with our interests and personalities.

We've gone on a few dates since, but this weekend was just magical for me. We were driving back from a day at the beach and she more or less brought up the exclusivity talk with me. Just basically said, ""like it or not I'm you're girlfriend now"" (the night prior she also mentioned how she's not seeing anyone else and that she doesn't have dating apps anymore). Later that night we went to a little get-together at her friend's house and she was referring to me as her boyfriend to her friends. I don't care how sappy this sounds, but that was such a great feeling. I cried tears of joy on my way home that night after I dropped her off. I've been through so much bullshit in the last decade. My 20s started out absolutely horrible, but it's looking like they'll be ending sky high. I'm just really enjoying this feeling of euphoria right now. I think it's really important to bask in the good times while they last. I know that more difficult times are inevitable in life, so when things are going well, just slow it down and enjoy them. I'm tearing up as I'm writing this and I feel so blessed right now.

My advice to those that are feeling like they're failing with dating: don't give up. You have to reflect and be critical of yourself after every failure. It's a difficult process, but it's the only way you're going to get better and find someone right for you. Literally, every failure I've experienced has helped me with this girl I'm currently seeing.

I’m pretty confident in my looks but looks aren’t everything and I’m afraid guys will think I’m a weirdo if I were to flirt with them. I also hate telling people I’m still a virgin and never been in a relationship because they always look at me like there’s something wrong with me.

I rmbr he was gone.. and I dance with people.. kissed people.. I was not ready for a relationship and I think I cheated on him in his face before.. I danced with someone infront of him.

A guy I dated after.. he was bad.. generous though.. but he was bad. Not worth it. I cheated on him when I went on a trip somewhere kissed someone on new years eve.. then I sexually cheated.. was not proud.. it was disgusting.. 

I got cheated on badly by one bf.. who I really let down my guard as he was generous and also gave me the name. But he was actually bisexual. It was one of the worst relationships I ever experienced. 

Last bf also a very bad relationship.. I met him as a cheater.. and things were horrible throughout the relationship. He was one the only ever.. who ever wanted me back..

It had been the 100th time he’s left me for a stupid reason. Since the beginning he’s always blamed me and made it a problem in our relationship about my past what I would do single. I didn’t even know him then. I would party and had my fair share of hook ups, but I literally just got out of high school and starting partying and having fun. It never defined me as how I would act in a relationship I never came across someone that wanted a commitment till I met him, and I honestly stayed through all his bullshit. The most abusive and toxic relationship, and to top it off I had a baby with him. I stayed for almost 4 years. I’m going to be 25 this month and I’ve come a long way of realizing so much and maturing so much. I’ve given this guy so many chances and each chance he walked out on not just only I but our son too, because I was left behind playing the role of both parents. I’m done begging for him. I finally stood up for myself and told him I was completely done with him. And it’s never going to workout between us. 


So I’ve been seeing someone for the past two weeks. I really enjoy him a lot. I feel like within time I was over my past relationship that I don’t feel like I need a long break to be ready to see someone else. I’ve just wanted someone to actually care, and for once I don’t feel like I have to hide or be scared to say something of my interest. This guy is extremely out going and knows how to talk to people fine. My ex always had a problem with someone or felt like everyone is out to get him which is unfortunate because it’s not true. Well I did end up sleeping with this new guy I’m seeing. Despite of how happy o feel with someone else I hate the feeling in the back of my mind like an annoying buzz, and it just reminds me of my ex ready to talk shit and say I’m a bad mother for sleeping with someone else especially since our son is only 2 years old.

So i do know that i can be crazy and insecure due to past relationships and i know i currently can not bring it to my new relationship i’m in atm 

for one instance me and him talked about what we would and wouldn’t be okay with so in my mind we set boundaries like hey let’s not do this and i have told him i eventually will get over this i myself need to get over my insecurities i’m working on it 

so one time him and his brother were sending half naked girls on tiktok to eachother and called them hot and spoke about how they want to get them “ pregnant “ 

i told him him hey i’m not okay with that please don’t do it so he stopped 

another time i was asking him if i can use his instagram to look someone up i had thought blocked me , and i had seen he searched a girl up USUALLY that would not bother me it’s instagram whatever right ? well a few days prior we spoke about a friend of mine how she was upset with her boyfriend about it and i guess it kinda got to me like in a what if he’s doing it type way ? so i talked to him about it and i said hey i don’t think i’d be okay with that and he agreed and was like hmm alright so when i seen the girls name i did get upset with him and kind of questioned it 

because of course what if she’s just a friend you know? so a few weeks later we had got into a fight and we spoke about like the whole instagram thing and we got into a fight because i had seen he looked up one of my best friends instagram and stalked ALLLLL her photos and to me that seemed weird and his response to me was i’ve done it to other people of your friends this one you just so happened to catch and i kind of got thrown off guard by that remark 

because i did have a bad relationship before so i felt kind of a pattern happening like my past but i do know something crazy thoughts will pop up 

sooooo we talked about the girl he searched up and he told me he uses her photos to jack off and in my mind it would be different if it was someone who had did only fans butttttt it was someone he had went to school with and had a class with and he was only upset i was packing my things when i heard that because i indeed felt some way and my first instinct was when i heard him say that was pack your bags and get out

but of course i didn’t i stayed and we never talked about it again

until one day i had a friend stay the weekend and i over heard him and his brother talking about my friends ass and how it looked in short shorts &amp; he just told me he was talking to his brother and he doesn’t know what else to tell me 

so now i seen he got a message while he was sleeping and it’s a friend of his saying how she missed him and honestly nothing but rage went through my body seeing it",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,934576,public,self,Am i really crazy ? or do i react perfectly,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owz0cp/am_i_really_crazy_or_do_i_react_perfectly/,all_ads,6,,,

For context I'd like to point out I am a virgin and my first sexual experience has been with my current partner (F26)

So we now have slept together three times. The first time I was rather nervous but not that nervous. I am not experienced but did a lot of research into how to pleasure her and fuck it if I couldn't I asked her not to worry about my ego and just guide. Couldn't believe it but I made her cum four times via foreplay. That made me really more confident and noticeably less nervous. So that's when she decides it's my turn and goes down on me. My first blowjob. Not gonna lie, it didn't feel like much. It really did feel good when the head was played with, but I could tell I'm not as hard or excited as I usually am when touch myself. So it was nice and after a while I just kiss her while she gives me a handjob, again I was surprised that nothing was happening. Even worse, it became half soft and half hard and felt powerless.

Fast forward the two other occasions: more of the same. I make her cum and when it comes to me, I can't get it up or keep the erection. The condom kills it even more. And it's really irritating now, she feels bad cause she thinks it's her but this girl arouses me and attracts me a lot. It's been three times and I CANT EVEN GET HARD ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY PENETRATE HER WHICH WE BOTH WANT SO MUCH

So I \[30F\] and client \[M\] have known each other for a while. First of all, the positive thing about this is that this will have no impact on my work life, which is great. So, I've been working at a technical site for the last two months where I've been managing a team. Me and my client hit it off straight away, we got on really well. However, I think our friendly banter is starting to turn into something more.

Recently, whenever we get into work he spends over an hour talking to me about anything and everything and when the conversation is about to die he brings up a new topic. He tells me a lot of personal details about himself and he's made it clear he is single.

We had access issues to some areas of the site and he had an emergency meeting with his bosses saying that I had to get access as my skillset is in high demand and my time is worth a lot of money. He also called up another boss telling them to give my company a 5 year multi-million dollar contract and to make sure that I manage the whole thing.. he told me he even said, 'if you want a successful job done make sure you get \[30F\] to do it'. He also gives me and my team particular privileges on site which usually isn't allowed and I know he never allows anyone else to do what he lets me do. Whenever a decision needs to be made, he asks me if i'm personally okay with it... beyond the usual care of a client relationship.

He always gives me intense eye contact when he talks to me and is always very close when he speaks to me. Also playfully punching my arm when he's making a joke and setting up my work desk next to his.

My gut says that he has feelings for me, but I just wanted to get further insight.

Okay guys pls help me out. I have never been in a situation like this before.
Okay so I have a boyfriend and we have been living together for 2 months now and we are really enjoying each other. 
After we moved in his family started getting real comfortable and showed me their true colors. They are nice people but they are also a very very toxic family that I have a hard time spending time with. It’s not always enjoyable. Okay, so the last 6 times I have seen the sister she has been sneak dissing me and been rude to me. At first I ignored it but I’m really bad at standing up for myself and setting boundaries so I just let her continue. My boyfriend got sad that he never defends me when his family members or friends are rude to me so he went over to his sisters place and told her in a nice way how I felt and she listened. 
She saw me at my boyfriends birthday at our place and seemed nice but when she went home she texted me asking what my problem is and told me she never did anything to me. Instead of just saying sorry. She then kept on calling me names and it started getting real personal. She used some personal stuff I have told her against me. So I feel really betrayed. She wants to involve my boyfriend but my boyfriend doesn’t want to be involved. She is 30 years old single and living alone and looooves drama. I told her to speak nicely to me but she kept on being personal. Today she has blocked me and she knows very well that she has my suitcase that she borrowed. I don’t think I will ever see that suitcase again…. How do we go on from now? She blocked me because she wants me to stay away from her. But what do we do when there are family gatherings? Me and my boyfriend also really wants to get married. How do we do that when the sister hates me so much? She is trying to be manipulative but it doesn’t work on me or her brother. Now she is trying to make their mother hate me but the mother told my boyfriend that she will support all of us.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,934855,public,self,Sister in law is 30 single and loves drama.

We were holding hands all the time so it was pretty good long date.

I mentioned to him that I want to have sex only if I know the other person does not have sex with someone else (meaning exclusivity) and I asked if he is seeing someone else. He answered not anyone seriously. I know people will judge me for stalking him but I did open dating app to see if he is still online and yup he is.

He never texted me during the week and only texts to set up date detail. So I found it quite weird as I would text people I am interested in. Not sure if he is interested or not

I will ask him if we meet again: 
If he likes me
If he wants exclusivity 
If he would pause the dating app

Do you think bringing these up by just 4 dates are demanding and too fast? I am looking for serious relationship and I know he is too, so I don’t want to waste time for one person if it won’t go anywhere.

I’ve been hurt in the past by giving my all to emotionally unavailable men so being treated so well is new to me.

She doesn’t know jack shit about technology. And that has probably caused the scam to slow down a bit.

At around 10 at night her family sat outside and right when they were done i gave her the gift, and she said thankyou so much and whatever, so she asked me if i wanted to sit and play some games with them, and i said ofcourse. So we played and her family was very nice and funny, and we got along really really well it felt like. I didn't talk to her much but mostly her family since they were asking me alot of questions and trying to get to know me. So the next day I was walking and saw her family without her and they said goodmorning, and I said hello. But now after we both went home I tried texting her to see if she wanted to call me so we could talk and setup some plans to see eatchother again. But she didn't respond for some hours, and then said she couldn't talk rn, so i said ok, just text me tmrw or whenever your available, and she responded with things like ok, and when i said goodnight, she said night, and so forth. Im so confused because i thought she was looking to go somewhere with it, but it seems like she's uninterested so quick.

So these past months I’ve been forcing myself a little to get out and meet new people and happen to have friends in common with this guy (30M) who’s really patience with me. 

We meet a few months back in may in a friend gathering, we exchange numbers but I never really get to connect with him over text (I suck at texting back) but we had a pretty good conversation recently and I’ve been more interested in him. We have a lot in common and the flow of the conversation is more natural, he is a bit shy and I tend to be more social and really loud (I’m Latina) but he attracts me. So right now he’s in Canada because of his job and coming back to France in a few days and I’m excited to see him. 

But this past weekend my ex happened to text me after 8 or 9 months, out of the blue. This shocked me cause my ex isn’t the guy that usually communicates his feelings, and he told me that he misses me and wishes he could take back time to be together again. We broke up because we were far from each other in pandemic times. Now we live in different countries (he in UK and myself in France) now this whole situation had me thinking more about him. 

Being honest I think I haven’t got over him yet. But I wished I have cause I had a pretty bad time when we broke up. Now I wanna try things with this guy but maybe I’m not ready yet. This guy is so cute and funny and he treats me so nice I don’t wanna hurt him because of me having feelings for my ex.
