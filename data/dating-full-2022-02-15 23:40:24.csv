However, he seems really eager to get into a committed relationship and I have communicated to him on our last date that I would prefer to take things slow and see how things develop naturally without rushing into it just because we appear compatible on the surface.

As I’ve only known this guy for 2 weeks, I’m definitely not at a stage where I’m comfortable with being exclusive with him, and so my dating profiles are still active and I am still talking to other people. However, on our last date, he had told me that he deleted all of his dating apps after meeting me and then asked the “what are we” question, to which I told him that it’s far too early to put a label it.

But now I’m starting to feel quite a bit of guilt by going on dates with other men when I know that he has deleted dating apps altogether and seems really committed towards me. I feel like I ought to be honest with him because, since I am keeping my options open, I feel he should do the same in case things do not work out between us. But I also think it’s in poor taste to bring up this topic with a date (if a guy were to mention to me how he’s seeing other girls, it would definitely kill the vibe - even if I had already assumed this about him). Is there a tactful way to tell him that it’s too early for me to commit and I’m keeping my options open at the moment? I’ve only known him for 2 weeks so normally it’s expected that both of us would be keeping our options open, but he’s really pushing for commitment. He’s such a sweetheart and I want to keep seeing him and give it a chance but there’s other guys (even before I matched with him) that I’m currently seeing as well. I know it’s not a bad thing because that’s what’s expected of online dating - you match and date multiple people until you find what you’re looking for. But I don’t think he views it this way as he’s ready to commit almost immediately :(

Tl;dr:
Guy I’m seeing deleted all his dating apps after meeting me. It’s too early for me to commit to him so I haven’t deleted any dating apps yet and am keeping my options open.

I (28M) posted in a personals subreddit the other day looking for someone interested in something casual. Several hours later a woman (36F) messaged me and said she lived in a nearby town and was interested in meeting up. I offered to send her a normal photo of myself to which she said she'd be interested but no face photos until we had met up in person. So I sent her a photo with my face cropped out and said her we could meet for coffee or drinks sometime. She replied that she was up for it. Later on she sent me two selfies with her face cropped out and videos of her (that did include her face) from her Tiktok. I could tell the person in the faceless selfies and Tiktok videos were the same person. I'm sorta wary though as there are some red-ish flags that have popped up.

She says she lived her whole life in the neighboring state and has a summer house in my state, and is currently here for work. But it's pretty clear English is not her first language. The name on her Kik profile is a very English-sounding first and last name but that seems suspect given that her English isn't the best. It's possible she's just using a pseudonym online. I have met with other people who listed alternate names on their profiles.

Outside of the Tiktok videos she sent, the selfies were cropped at unusual resolutions which are not from any phone cameras I know of (960x444). Both of them were the same dimensions too so I doubt it was just manual photo cropping.

Do you think it would be safe enough to meet IRL without any additional verification? I'm concerned I might be getting myself into a sketchy situation but maybe I'm just overly suspicious. She hasn't asked for money or photos so if something is going on I'm not sure what it would be, outside of potential catfishing.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159170,public,self,"Met someone online, not sure if I'm being overly cautious before meeting",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sth5o9/met_someone_online_not_sure_if_im_being_overly/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

It's kind of a long story but I'll do my best to summarize it. So, me and this girl have been texting on instagram for about 2 weeks. We have never even met before but we've decided to hangout at her house to hangout with her family/ friend around 11pm. 
So we all pretty much watched TV and played video games. However by the time we got to playing videos games, it was pretty much me and her brother playing smash bros on the switch.
 I thought I was doing the right thing by leaving a good impression on her family cause her brother was really having fun playing video  games with me lol she even told me before I came over that we can just watch TV and and play video games.
 In conclusion, it felt like we were all already friends and had a chill night by just hanging out. The next morning she texted me saying it was a chill night and had fun:) she even said that she didn't know her brother was gonna take over by playing the switch lol. I replied back and whatnot but she didn't even open the message. She could at least leave me on read so I  somewhat know for sure that she isn't interested

We made it clear from the start that we are both looking for something serious, but with no flirting whatsoever, only two dates with no physical contact and barely any chatting (I have decided to let him reach out as I feel as I have been making any move), there is no progress. It is a shame as he checks many boxes for me. I like the fact that he has a stable job and is a hard worker, but not being available at all is making this difficult. 

Comparing it to my past experiences in dating, this is going incredibly slow. Typically the men I talk to flirt right off the bat (though is not a dealbreaker if that comes later), they also tend to plan dates soon after talking and then plan another date if the first went well. Having to wait 2-4 weeks for another date is long. I must also mention that I am keeping my options open, but there hasn’t been anyone else to date since meeting this guy.

I have been dating this guy for 5 months we’ve been on ~ 12 dates during this time. We met at a company where we were both interns post college last summer, went out as friends for a while and wasn’t until fall where we things took a romantic turn; started holding hands &amp; hugging. 
I’m super emotionally attracted to him. He is caring, thoughtful, considerate just amazing - everything I want in a guy. Physically I don’t know if I’m attracted to him. 

Before him I had never been or gotten close to a guy, or even hugged a guy that wasn’t a relative. I’m 26 and although I’ve found men good looking I’ve never ever felt sexually attracted to anyone. I don’t know what sexual attraction is supposed to feel like. I rarely feel horny and can’t see myself being intimate with someone past holding hands. On our last date, he invited me to his house to watch a movie. We cuddled, he was caressing me &amp; I felt a little wetness down there but no urge to do anything else. It was super romantic: dim lights, candles, perfect setup to get hot &amp; steamy but nothing happened. We are both touchy people, he is reserved and always asks if I’m comfortable which I love.  I was hoping to make out but I just couldn’t do it. I think about getting more physical when I’m not with him but in person I can’t get myself to. He kissed me at the of the date but there was nothing there and I pulled away pretty quick. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m confused, I’m frustrated and I’m angry at myself. I don’t know if I should continue seeing this guy. I don’t know if the problem is with me and/or my sexuality or if it’s a confidence/self esteem issue. I have noticed I find it hard to give him eye contact and a lot of my touches can be awkward.
On one hand I don’t want to let him go because he makes me so happy. On the other hand I don’t want to deny him of physical intimacy and string him along.

We parted with a jokey handshake and he texted me the next day to say what a nice time he’d had. 

Now I know when people say “right now” that usually means “not you” but we really do get on so well. And I did notice after getting back on the apps that he changed his “looking for” from “don’t know yet” to “something casual.” So maybe it wasn’t personal?

I’m not totally over it yet but I know these feelings will pass. And i genuinely like and respect him as a person. Now obviously my preference would be to date, but I’m ok with accepting that may never happen. Here’s where I’m unsure—is that a really pathetic way to feel? Am I leaving my self respect in the trash? In most cases I’d simply walk away, but it really does seem like he just isn’t in a place for a relationship with anyone right now and he’s always treated me with kindness and respect. But like no I probably would not like the feeling I’d get if I saw him start seriously dating someone else, which seems like a prereq for friendship.

I’m a partial owner/operator of family business. About 6-7 years ago an employee came into my office and started making out with me. When working I tried to match peoples energy. Maybe we flirted while working together or she saw it that way. We ended up hooking up a lot and a month or two later I got the “what are we” talk after hooking up. I think I was 21 at the time and at that time I asked her if she would be my girlfriend. Things go well we had are ups and downs especially while working together it got tense, but overall we managed a nice relationship. 

As we grew older we both started thinking about the future of this relationship and that’s when things went south. I come from a religious family (Islam) and also grew up with many Muslims and was taught in my younger years about my religion. I wouldn’t say I’m the most religious person. I just hold my values and try to be a good person. A lot of Muslim people live double lives. Meaning hiding one side of their lives from there parents and then infront of them act like an angel. My father and parents eventually caught on. That was a hard time on me, they didn’t know I was in a relationship with this girl just knew I was doing stuff. I have this inner side of my that wants to please my family and fears judgement from friends/family if I were to marry this girl. I care and love this girl so much but I guess it’s not enough to pull the trigger and marry this girl. 

She loves me more than I love her. This is when we broke up. About a year and a half ago. She couldn’t take it, she loved me so much and it hurt her more being with me knowing there’s no future. It was hard for both of us we eventually started talking again, she still worked for me. Shes in nursing finishing up this semester. We went back as if we were still dating. Also I should add I started losing sexual attraction with her the last 2-3 years of dating, and we didn’t have much sex when getting back together unofficially. I didn’t look at us talking everyday as working on getting back together, but she did. It felt good to me having her back in my life and she felt the same but she looked at it as maybe I’d change. We ended up breaking off again after a year and a half after breaking up. Because I haven’t changed and she’s calling me selfish. I feel terrible I didn’t look at this relationship this way. I don’t know why I held this relationship so long. I broke this girls heart and dreams of seeing a future with me. It’s crushing me for what I’ve done witch wasn’t my intentions. I wanted her to be happy and I saw that when I’m in her live but in reality she will be happy when she’s with someone who wants and knows to have a future with her. So many memories together I never knew this could be so damaging mentally for both of us. We still work together. I’m understanding now what I have done to her.

For context: me(20F) and my bf (20M) have been dating for over a year and I moved into an apt with one of my close friends in May. I used to go to his house frequently, and we would take turns going to each other’s places. He would come here probably 2/7 days of the week. Now that it’s winter where I am, he lives 30 minutes outside the city where he goes to school and works- and my car broke. The weather has been so bad, so to avoid missing school or work, he stays with me when there’s a blizzard, if the highways are closed, or if it’s just bad driving conditions.There was a time where he was here 5 days/nights in a row. I have no issues with this because I love spending time with him, he saves gas money, and he doesn’t miss school or work. My roommate expressed she didn’t like that he was here so often, and my bf texted her clarifying why he stayed so often, said he can stay other places(which he has, when he can if it’s been lots of consecutive days) and just saying he likes to be accommodating and she can feel free to let him know if he’s overstepping. **sorry this is so long** 
She replied gracefully, and she’s very understanding. Her bf comes over every weekend, and even more before he left for school. She’s loud, and she also does things I don’t like which is besides the point lol I just wanted to throw it out there. 

CURRENT EVENT: my bf was here for the weekend for valentines, and went home and today he came over after school because it was snowing like crazy. My roommate texted me asking to talk in the kitchen again and said he is here way too much. I understand, my quarrel is 
1. We are ALWAYS in my bedroom, not using the common areas 
2. He helps clean 
3. They are mutually friendly 
4. Him staying here consecutive days is for safety, and access to work and school 
5. I asked her to text him if she could express her discomfort as well (as she said she would in her text response back to him) but she said she didn’t want to. 
6. We don’t pay for utilities and he eats my food, or buys his own.

I (25M) have been dating a girl (24F), (lets call her ""S"") for a few months now and we have several dates over this period and those were all great dates, even she mentioned that herself. We had the relationship talk and decided to pursue a relationship on the 3rd date. It was going great until, I asked for a date last weekend, over a phone call and she said we can't do it anymore because she thinks she can't give me more time. I won't blame her anything.
But damn, my heart burns. It all started out as a short fling and we decided to date after that. Had so many great moments. What started as a casual date eventually turned into a relationship which both of us agreed to. I have been single for a little more than 3 years before meeting S, just after ending up a relationship. At that time, my life was not going anywhere, I had to pursue a master's degree and find a career. It was on my front burner and it helped me go through that breakup better. Over a period of time, I healed and was happy being single, doing very small things that made me happy. In 2020 quarantine time, I decided to get fit and lost 19kg and became the fittest I ever was in my life. Also, I started a new, promising career in 2021 and life was soo smooth. 
I never thought of dating anyone as it was not even in my thoughts. But I met S and I wanted to date her. It was magical while it lasted.
Now, I feel like I wanted to go back to how I was 4 months ago. Both of us started to open up more and be vulnerable with each other. But after her saying we can't do this anymore, I feel soo empty, I feel like I don't want to do anything. Most of the time, I feel like just lay down and sleep. My friends wanted to meet up and I just can't get ready and go out. I have started to take up more work at my job just to keep myself occupied. 
But whenever I see some couple or watch a movie where something reminds me of her, I feel so sad and I just couldn't continue watching the movie. Before meeting S, it used to be like I have no time for anything but now it feels like time doesn't move and everything irritates me, I am getting snappy, couldn't make long conversations with people. I am just trying to pass the day until I will be healed.
I do know that I will heal over time but going through this healing process sucks and I just wanna get to the end of the process.

Since Valentines Day was yesterday, I figured I’d make my first post about it.

I am a very romantic person and he knows it so, when Valentines Day came around and nothing happened, I was pretty disappointed. I like to think that I’m not materialistic but I think I hyped it up in my mind and now that it’s passed, I just feel kind of hurt. We talked about it for weeks.

There’s always been some sort of tension between her and myself and this has been ongoing for about 4 years, the tension exists because obviously, she is one of my sister’s long time best friends, also she was in a previous serious relationship with someone that played on my hockey team, who I did not know well and she came to a lot of our games. She still had feelings for me, and I wanted to respect that she was in a relationship too despite having feelings for her. 

I ended up getting hired at a place she worked at, and her and I had lots of chemistry and we shared a gaze that I will never forget, that felt like it went on forever, like we were the only ones on earth and there was a sensation of fireworks. 

Anyways, her and her boyfriend broke up and we are both single now. We have been for a while, but we both thought it would be best to move on because to respect their friendship and not ruffle any feathers. My sister is well aware of our dynamic but as you can imagine she’s not super comfortable about it (which is fair). 

But I saw her on tinder a few days before Valentine’s Day, I swiped right on her by accident, went back and swiped left (despite my feelings for her still I wanted to respect her friendship with my sister). But on Valentine’s Day a match comes in and its her, despite me really swiping left on her I guess coindentially the left swipe glitched (or the feature doesn’t work at all). Also coincidentally, the day we first met was Valentine’s Day.

It seems that despite the obstacles that stood in our way, we somehow find a way back to each other. I wouldn’t really claim myself to be a superstitious person, but it seems really weird how things just seemed to fall into place and line up the way they did for us, like me swiping left on her despite my strong feelings for her but matching with her anyways, on Valentine’s Day of all days…

Also my sister never really brought her around because she knew how she felt about me so our relationship was built solely upon chance really. 

We also have a bizarre amount of things in common, it all just feels too weird.

No signs that he is emotionally unavailable but I am paranoid. I seem to only attract emotionally unavailable men and I really want to break that pattern. I also live in nyc and it’s difficult dating here / men typically don’t want to settle down. I see an amazing therapist and have read books on attachment styles so I’m aware of why this pattern may happen but I also think half of the time it’s a coincidence. I ran over the date a million times in my head and can’t find any red flags, but I’m thinking it may be too early to tell since we’ve only been on one date. He spoke about a 2nd and 3rd date and mentioned that hopefully I’d get to meet his dog one day. most guys are extremely into me after the first date or so bc of my looks and bc I have a big personality, but usually it fizzles very shortly after for no reason, mostly because they’re severely emotionally unavailable. I do want something serious, but I’m not even thinking that far into it yet. It would be nice to even date someone for a little bit that I liked even if it ended up dying out, because then at least I’d get to be excited about it in the moment and it’s literally the best feeling to like someone and see potential. I’m not asking if he’s emotionally unavailable or not - I’m more so asking can you really ever tell from a first date? Are there small subtle things I should look out for? Or is it too early to tell? I know sometimes it’s obvious, but this time it’s not. There have been zillions of times where the guy was obsessed with me in the beginning or I felt like I was out of their league so I had no worries and then they end it shortly after. January was an incredibly awful month for me so this has me excited and has taken me out of my funk. I’ve  also been burned beyond belief in the dating world (no seriously, I could go viral probably from some of my stories) so I am scared. I do have a habit of romanticizing people in my head and I am fully aware of it, but I feel like I can’t help it. I am pretty picky and I am looking for something niche (it’s too complicated to go into but trust me it’s for good reason). It’s a joke amongst my friends that I find a guy I like every 8 months, and this happened to hit right at the 8 month mark.. My pickings are slim. So I really would like this to turn into something because as ridiculous as it sounds it will take prob another 8 months (lol). I would appreciate withholding any comments about taking it slow and to stop romanticizing / to lower my expectations because while I may be obsessive,  I am fully aware of it.

I don't feel any pressure to date anyone, I'm just slowly growing curious about what it's like, which is funny to me. I feel childish and naïve for saying it like that, but it is what it is.

Realistically, it wouldn't be until later this year that I'd put myself out there, because my side-quests would hopefully be like 40% complete by then (it's the getting started that's been difficult).

Anyway, it all comes down to needs (as they change!) and communication though, as it always does, doesn't it?

Turns out she's back with her ex now so now I'm assuming she just lead me on in case it didn't work out with her ex.... ew.

Anyway, I'm talking to another woman now and it's going about the same. We've talked sex a lot and she's sent nudes, but again she always seems to have an excuse about why she can't meet up. We're just casually talking not committed at all, but still it sucks being lead on and I don't want it to happen again. She's a single mom so I understand it's tough to get free time, but like 3 failed meetups seems a little too convenient.

I'm thinking of asking her if she's serious about meeting up or if she's making up excuses. But I feel like I'd come off as insecure if I did that since she does have the single mom pass lol.

But his female best friend has been an issue that I have been overthinking a lot lately, let me explain: they have been friends for 6 years now since they met in college. They are both 24 now. I have been dating my boyfriend for just 5 months. My boyfriend (Pablo)and his best friend (Karla) like to go to a kava bar almost everyday, this bothers me. They both have similar work shifts so they meet there at early evening, I have to work until later. So they make a lot of plans together. I told my boyfriend that this bothered me and that I wanted to spend more time with him after I got off work and he agreed and spent more time and he did for about 2 weeks but then he started seeing her at night as much as before. Im not the jealous type but I have to admit that Karla is a gorgeous girl, and she is the type of girl my boyfriend would date (physically) as he had described me the types of girls he liked as a bisexual man. What makes me very insecure is how she acts around him: she is very clingy, and likes to touch him a lot, like holding his hands all the time, touch his shoulder, puts her legs on him and likes to cuddle with him. Even though I trust my boyfriend and he is next to me and touching me almost 90% of the time the three of us hang out, I feel uncomfortable thinking she likes him romantically, and I don’t know what to do, they wanted to buy a house together since they both live with their parents right now, but when Pablo told her I would move in with them she got pissed saying she never agreed to that and canceled on buying the house with him. I’ve noticed that when my boyfriend gives me a lot of attention she wants to leave and gets bored. I get paranoid when they hang out alone. I trust my boyfriend but not her.

Ladies of Reddit, im trying to figure something out here. I would say I’m a decent looking guy around average height who has been with some attractive women. However it seems like every time I try to date one of these girls, they end up finding a guy that’s generally richer or taller or older. They may have a “better personality” too, but it seems like the ladies that I have been on dates with always seem to go for the next best thing. I don’t know if it’s because I am in my very early 20s but this is where I get skeptical if personality really means enough to overturn some of the other qualities because I have had fun on majority of dates and have felt like I connect with them pretty well overall.

My dating experience has been based on just a couple through college and mainly on dating apps right after graduation. I’m just confused on why if personality and confidence mattered why I get left behind for someone who is better on “paper”.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159214,public,self,Always going for next best thing?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/stnkzg/always_going_for_next_best_thing/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,

Hi we are both 18.

On one hand he’s a really sweet guy and we go out on dates a lot, he always makes sure i’m okay, he’s probably one of the most thoughtful guys i’ve ever seen but i don’t want to ignore any red flags that could mean i should cut him off. Here’s what i’ve gathered so far:

Things i don’t like 

pessimistic/always reminds me of worst case scenario ( ex. “what if [terrible scenario] happened right now?”)



pretty insecure (especially about sex)

(ex. random moments of asking “do you like when i f*** you?” or “what would you do if i got fat?” out of nowhere) 

judgmental of overweight people . today he said they “have more body odor” because they have more body mass. like wtf is your issue with overweight people, he talks about it or asks questions regarding that a lot. 

starting to ask or say sexual things out of nowhere and then backtrack 
(last example) (ex. “when can we have sex again? it’s okay if we don’t i’m just wondering”)

repeats things twice for no reason 
ex. him: “so you had school today?”
me: “yes” him: “somebody had school today”

Am i being too specific here or are these legit turn offs? How do i break this off if so?
