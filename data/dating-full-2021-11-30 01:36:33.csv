So long story short we worked together  3 years ago but then I left to go the military. Back then she had a bf so I really didn’t think of her in that way but we always got along fine but nothing crazy( regular coworker jokes).
I have a podcast and sometimes she would say something about an episode and that’s how we would stay in touch. Fast forward to like 1/2 weeks ago she responds to a storie of mine on IG and since then we really didn’t stop talking, 3 days ago she was talking about going to a rooftop bar and I just said “hope you have fun” (This is me thinking this is platonic) and she responds “well if you want you can join me because I was going alone anyway”
So tomorrow we are supposed to go to this rooftop bar after dinner, is this a date? Or just some casual drinking thing?

Im (M27) on vacation visiting family in the dominican republic and last weekend i was in a resort with my cousin (M28) in punta cana. I had never been to a resort and had always wanted to experience one in Punta Cana. I had alot of fun as we tried it all and did some gambling. One issue i had was at night we would spend a few hours in a bar. Im not much of a drinker, i barely ever drink, and we’d just hang out and talk. Im also drinking anxiety medication that ive been told by my nurse does not mix well with alcohol. I didnt really drink at the resort. There wasnt alot of people at the bar and everyone was in their own groups and almost everyone was coupled up the 2 nights we went there. The last night though i noticed a girl across the bar i thought was cute. She didnt seem coupled up. She was just hanging out with another girl drinking and dancing with her. It wasnt any type of sexual dancing just regular dancing between friends (at least thats what it looked like). 

I kept thinking about approaching her to make some type of conversation with her, but something kept holding me back. Id think stupid thoughts like “you suck at dancing” or “you dont drink so what are you going to even do”. It was basically an hour of me trying to muster up something to talk to her and she left with her friend. I dont get much dates and im not saying that something wouldve happened but i feel like it couldve been a missed opportunity and it may be some time before i get one again, even if nothing wouldve happened. Sometimes i feel like i should just start drinking to fit in, even if i dont like drinking but i feel like not drinking has avoided me having fun or making as mcih friends. Like maybe itll give me the balls to do things i struggle to do sober, like approaching strangers or make me seem more fun (i know it sounds stupid but ive been on medication for a few months and am still struggling). Ive been kind of beating myself up for not even trying to talk to that girl.

I always hear drinking helps you not give a fuck and im considering maybe start trying it in group gatherings to have more fun.

Its been 5 days though and she isn’t accepting my follow back. I can see she is accepting other requests but I am stuck on requested. She has a lot of followers too. 

I am just a little annoyed because I wanna see her bikini pics or something and she is wasting my time.

And yes, as soon as exams are over I am gonna aggressively approach her in person and make my intentions clear, rejection or not. But in the meantime I have no way to in person approach and this is just teasing me so bad.

This recently happened after I'd been on a slew of horrible dates with people from various dating apps.

\--------------

So I was out having drinks with some friends one night. We went to a fancy bar where the drinks were basically desserts in a cup. I was enjoying a lovely, sweet drink and then BOOM! I was drunk AF. I eventually sobered up so I could drive myself home. I parted ways with my friends but on the way something didn’t feel right.

As I walked back to my car, I’m sure some creep was following me. Like from a movie, I turned down a random block or two and this fucking creep followed. So I quickly ducked into another bar, even though it was really late/early and it looked like Bartender, an adorable gangly dude, was closing up. I walked up to him and told him what was up.

Bartender responded in the best way - he said I could hang out until I felt safe to leave. He made me a drink on the house, continued closing up, and chatted with me about every topic one could imagine. I got those butterflies in my stomach, the ones everyone always talks about. I also got hammered again...and more or less held poor Bartender hostage at work. I made a few sly passes at him - I probably should’ve called my friends to come get me.

But Bartender didn’t bite, but he also didn’t seem to mind. We talked for HOURS. He waited for me to sober up and then walked me to my car where he gave me his number and asked me to text him to make sure I got home okay.

I texted him when I got home. The next day he texted back and said he was glad I made it home safe. Once I was truly sober I solidified some actual date plans with him.

A week later - we met up at a bar that wasn’t his place of work, got tossed together, and made out in a photo booth. It was the date of dates, with photos to prove it. And for the first time in years, I’m excited to date again.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1131128,public,self,"Be patient, don't go looking!

I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds. Then, I came to my senses and realized I should be moving on and walked away. Problem is that I’m finding it really hard to move on. 

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she’s drunk? Why did she say that we don’t get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

This will be long, please bear with me.

I am a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug this summer after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and introversion/slow to open up.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, you just dont meet many people your age after school it seems.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

Slow to open up. I have a hard time being flirty with girls before I am friends with them. I dont want to use the term demisexual (as I am not that), but I can relate to those people and that idea of needing to be close to someone before moving a relaitonship beyond a friendship. I also dont want to use the term friendzone, but it honestly feels that way most of the time. We become friends and then after some time, I think about asking her out as I start to develop feelings, but she only sees me as a friend. I have lost quite a few friends this way and frankly I dont want to lose any more and I feel broken because of it.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"". I have been also told that I am too genuine for my own good.

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

Getting out more - over the last month I have gone out to the local ""downtown scene"" with friends on a somewhat regular basis. Trying new restraunts, shops, etc. and generally getting out more. Though, I just feel too young for that crowd (surrounded by young families mostly), and too old for the college scene that exists.

Meetup - none exist in my area for things I am interested in, so I made one. A short hike to the top of a popular hill for the sunset and astronomy viewing. No one showed up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

I thought he was cute but wasn't going to act on it. I went to uni in another state so we didn't see each other after that internship but from time to time he would message me on Instagram, sending me random pictures of his day or would always reply to my Instagram stories. As an introvert and someone who really only makes the effort to text people regularly who I want in my life, I thought he was interested so got super emotionally invested, but after a long time of just messaging like that and him not really initiating anything I assumed that he was just one of those people that are super friendly to everyone. Our conversation slowly fizzled out, and we basically stopped talking. 

Fast forward to now and we're back in the same state again. He messaged me on my birthday to wish me, and asked to catch up (in a group chat that we have with all the other people we interned with). Dinner with everyone went well nothing special, and we all agreed to meet up again. He didn't talk to me especially during that meet up, but after he started doing the same thing as before (sending me messages from time to time, sending me random pics of his day etc) and for the past week or so we've been talking everyday this way. 

Initially when we started messaging again I really classified him as a friend in my head, but the longer that its gone on the more that I feel like I've caught feelings again. He would reply super quick to all my messages (within 5-10 minutes throughout the day even though he's working), and of course all my feelings come back. Then all of a sudden he stopped replying with as much frequency (he seen'd my last message to me) and now I'm left confused. I don't want to bother him if he's not interested, but I don't even know if he is interested? Or am I just overthinking this and is he just being a friendly guy. (Also aside from the group meet up stemming from my birthday wishes, he's never initiated any meetup, let alone any with just me and him)

When you ask for any dating advice ever weather it be YouTube, Reddit, friends etc they’ll all tell you that women love a confident man and how well he will carries himself; what does this mean exactly? 

Being confident essentially just means being happy with yourself and comfortable with every aspect of who you are; it’s the energy you give off, it’s the attitude you present to her. Someone who is depressed, shy or had a bad day problem isn’t going to give off the same energy or attitude of a man who just got a promotion at work, reached a new personal goal at the gym or bought a new nice outfit. In short, stay positive and upbeat. 

Some men will fall into this terrible mindset that they’re never going to be good enough for someone or they’re just ugly which isn’t true. 

LISTEN TO ME

Every single person on this earth brings something unique to the table and what’s what even makes dating possible, we’re all different. There 8 billion people on this planet so yes, of course there are always going to be better looking guys than you, taller, more successful blah blah blah. The way to stay confident is by appreciating the fact that you are your own person and bring a unique look, personality and mindset to the table for women. Not every woman wants the same guy just like not every man wants the same woman. 

For the ladies who may be reading this the same goes for you too. Yes, of course there are more beautiful women out there, bigger boobs, bigger butt whatever blah blah. I promise you that men love all different kinds of women. The way you set yourself apart from other women is by being and appreciating yourself. 

This mindset is also gives the byproduct of not being jealous. Why be jealous of someone of something you have no control over? You want to know what you do have control over…yourself! 

Become the best possible version of yourself! Hit the gym, eat right, pick up an instrument, learn a new sport like skiing or volleyball, buy a new outfit or two.

That's also when I lost my virginity. It's funny; I have had people when I say that immediately be appalled, they think that's disgusting. Too young or whatever. Where I live, in one of the poorest states of the country, it's normal for women to get pregnant that young. At least, that's what the statistics say.

I remember when I lost my virginity nobody on the school-bus believed me. Just that sentence alone is disturbing. It was one summer in high school and the sex was some of the worst sex I ever had. It lasted for seconds; I had no idea what I was doing; all I remember was anxiety. I do remember that girls name, Sabri. She had brown hair that was twirly and pink lipstick, and was small and cute.

Anyway, why am I going back to the beginning?

It's interesting as you age. I am 30 years old now. I do remember that girls name but I don't really remember many girls’ names as I age. I have dated hundreds of women at this point; maybe more. I have slept with 40-50 women if I remember correctly, but honestly, I have no damn idea. I have so many insane stories about hook ups and debauchery it is disgusting.

Why did I choose becoming a Bachelor?

I was an alcoholic for years. I had a lot of issues, grew up with a horrible and abusive family and it took me a long time to find my own path. I have been sober for almost 6 years from alcoholism. My alcoholism made me obviously unfit to be a boyfriend, let alone a husband, so for the first two decades of my life my dating life was straight awful.

Most the women I slept with it was in my early twenties. And guess what? I only remember three or four of their names. You might think, oh, he's a player. Well. There are men I've talked to who have slept with hundreds of girls they claim, so I'm not some insane player I'd say.

I have noticed when I say these things to some men, they get very judgy and jealous. They think I am lying or whatever. That is fine.

Anyway, since I was an alcoholic for several years (I was an addict from 16- 24), I couldn't find a wife. Plenty of hook ups though. One-month relationships. All over the place, I don't even like to think about it.

I have had 3 relationships that actually meant something since then, that's it.

THREE.

Quantity over quality as they say. I am proof. Out of a hundred girlfriends I have only loved or really liked three women. And when you enter Bachelorism, things change.

Starting at the age 30, the entire dating field is different. I have around 6 - 7 women I talk to on a daily basis, most are friends or more. I get around 10 - 15 likes a week across the dating apps. My girlfriends come and go, I was engaged recently (that was one of the THREE if you paid attention!) but not for long.

Dating is so casual now and people love the success and the pad I have. So, I have fun.

We pretty quickly started hanging out almost everyday, for hours at a time. In between these hangouts, we would text pretty consistently throughout the day. We’ve hooked up and I’ve stayed at his place a couple of times. 

There are a few signs (imo and my friends believe so too) that he is into me way more than I am into him. He quit smoking for me by the second date (I expressed that it’s not my favorite thing, but never asked him to quit). He is incredibly affectionate and often kisses me in public - on the forehead, on my hand, my shoulder, everywhere. Whenever we go out to eat, he is always touching or kissing me somehow someway. He is willing to hang out with my friends for our weekly game nights and is making an effort to get along with them. He is incredibly open with how he feels and often verbalizes it with a pet name, a compliment, etc…


I think he is a great guy, but I am working long hours, and am not completely emotionally available to be with him right now. I am also not looking to do long term with anyone, but find myself in this situation where he is acting as if we are in a serious relationship. Am i being crazy to think that we need to have the conversation now before he gets even more attached? How do I convey my feelings to him without hurting him? I selfishly do want to keep a casual, FWB type relationship with him…do you think I’m delusional to think that it’s possible?

I don’t understand what aspect of my life is preventing me from getting girls. 

Everyone always says I’m the best dressed person they have ever seen I get so many compliments on my clothes on the daily even from strangers, I even had a stranger come up to me and say I’m in my own lane for clothing. I won’t lie my clothes are reps and fakes but nobody can tell the difference because none of the girls I talk to are even into fashion plus they pretty much look identical even I can’t tell the difference between the fake and real. 

Secondly some of the girls and guys I hung out with they always call me one of the funniest person they know. I even had this one interaction where this girl(my closest female friend) kept laughing at me for 5 mins straight and I wasn’t even doing anything and she kept saying I just can’t take you serious everything you do is funny. On top of that people say my personality is amazing and I’m cool guy. 


Thirdly, I’m a really goal driven person and always aim for the top. I’m a scholarship student for getting the highest marks in electrical engineering. I work out regularly at the gym although recently I’ve lost motivation as it just seems like whatever I do it won’t ever work out for me I will never get girls. I also submitted an idea for a graphic novel for a publication company which got accepted but I now need over 5k to fund it for the illustrations which I don’t have the funds for but what I’m trying to say is that I’m on my purpose and have goals and everyone always tells me girls like a guy on their purpose a guy who has there own life outside the girl etc.  I’m even looking at making a song with one of my friends, I want to go for a juice wrld style. 


Recently, there was this girl that I had the biggest crush on and  I meet her in the library and really wanted to start dating her. It  looked like things were going great she would whisper on my ear that this song could describe us in the future (it was a romantic song) or make comments like I’m the only girl that can make you listen to juice wrld because what we have is special. And she wasn’t out my league, she had so many insecurities about herself that she didn’t even look at herself the way I looked at her she thought she was like a 6 and needed constant reassurance. She choose another guy over me despite saying all that stuff which hurt me so badly cuz she basically lead me on and I liked this girl a lot. I keep thinking what does this other guy have over me. Additionally, he’s kind of mean to her (jokes about her insecurities) and ignores her at times which just makes me think girls chase after the bad guy. He even denied her a relationship and told her ignore me in a public setting because I don’t want people thinking we together yet she’s still stuck on him like glue. I obviously have cut her off. 


After all this I went to club with my friends to try and get over her. There was this fine girl and I got her snap but she never opened my message and left me on 5 weeks delivered. 


What’s annoying is I just can’t get the girl that choose the other guy out my mind I was literally head over heels for her. I’m struggling to move on. Plus we spent a lot of time together even though we never went on a date. 


I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m starting to think I’m ugly. You can dress the best but if you’re ugly you’re still ugly. You can be one of the funniest guys or be on you’re purpose but if you’re ugly you’re just ugly. I even set up a tinder, hinge and bumble for the last month  and I literally can’t get any matches. I only have like 5 matches in a month and I just get ghosted. 

I think I’ve just accepted that I will never be able to pull girls and will probably die alone. 


If any girl is reading this, I need you’re honest opinions about my looks do I look ugly or average or what’s my rating from a scale to 1 to 10 where 1 is ugly.

Also do you guys think this girl (library one) was out my league in terms of looks, did I shoot too high? That’s the sandcastle we built.

I (33) been see this guy (39) for two months.
We haven’t established yet what we are but that’s not the point . We don’t see each other as often . Appx once a week.
He lives around 35-40 min drive from me and he has a car . I don’t drive.
We made arrangements I will come over  and stay with him overnight this Friday .

So he didn’t offer me a ride or anything.
First he said I’ll pick you up in the evening around eight after traffic is gone I said ok . And then he started to say that I should take a subway and he’ll pick me up from the station .

It will take me around 45 min to get from where I live to the station that he wants to pick me up from (station close to his house, like 20 min drive )
I said that is a very long ride for me especially I’ll be coming after work and I’d prefer not to spend almost an hour in the subway after work .

It’s not like he’s always driving me around or picking me up so that he’s asking me to take the train for once .
I don’t mind but I felt like he’s not even making any effort , not even offered to order me Uber . He said he’ll have to drive to me and then drive all the way back etc . Like it’s not even that far .

Then I said if at least he can pick  me up half way so that I won’t have to do the long ride and he didn’t really said anything. He said it’s not that bad etc etc.
So I’m kinda upset tbh. It’s all about the effort and being a gentleman. No?

I have never found anyone romantically attractive that I know of, but I have had moments of absurd devotion in my imagination.

For example, I find myself somewhat attracted to a fictional character. Not even an actor, just a character in a book. I believe this is due to the notion that I find their personality admirable. However, when I think of what a relationship would look like between me and the fictional character, it goes along the following lines:

I would do anything to make the other person happy. It is as if they became the most important thing in the world, and nothing else was even close to as prominent. It is like I become obsessed with the idea of making the other person as happy as possible.

Now to me, that did not sound too bad when I reflected on my initial reaction to the fictional relationship at first. However, I have seen a lot of people discuss relationships. I have seen movies, t.v. shows and books that portray relationships, and none of them have a relationship quite like how I thought it should go. This led me to question if what I felt for the fictional character, and this relationship, was even love. It started to seem more like obsession and devotion.

The strangest part was that I did not get sad or jealous imagining them with another partner. As long as they were happy, I was content.

I started to question my mindset as a whole when I thought about the fact that I did not want anything from the other person in the relationship except for their happiness. It seemed completely one sided, that I was giving but never taking. Metaphorically, I was a power generator giving the   
lightbulb (fictional character) energy, and as long as the bulb was on (they were happy) I was content. 

However, even though it seems like I would be fine with this arrangement, something feels off about it. My gut gives me a bad feeling about my mindset in this regard, but I do not know why. Is this even romantic attraction? What is this obsession? Why haven't I found this obsession in real people?

I met this girl at work and we hit it off, just me telling stupid jokes that she laughed at and me laughing at her ranting about shit. It was fun, and she quickly became my first and best friend down here. I always thought she was cute and we had a lot in common, but she was in a long term relationship so I wanted to respect that. I asked her to hang out once, and we got together and hung out at work one night. This is the night she told me she was thinking about breaking up with her boyfriend and moving in with her aunt. This is the night I started catching feelings for her and I don’t think I’ve handled it great since then. At first it was fine, she would talk to me when I saw her after our shift changes, and tell me about why she was considering breaking up with him, what she was hoping to gain from moving on in life, and still we’d just talk about random shit. I always avoided telling her what I thought she should do because I didn’t want me having feelings to get in the way of any opinion I could have. We started texting more but after a while it wasn’t as frequent, then it would pick back up again. This is when I started getting bad anxiety about all this. My longest relationship is 2 months, and that was 4 years ago, so I have no experience. That’s why I moved though, to just grow up and start my adult life, and I stress cause I don’t want to fuck it up all with this girl, but I realize me worrying about this isn’t helping at all. I want to start respecting the fact that she just got out of something long and very personal, and quite frankly I need to get some of my shit together as well so that I can actually be something down here. Mutual work friends have said good things about the way I’m trying to go about this, and have frequently encouraged me to try and go with the flow and connect with her. I think right now, she needs that time to be alone and work through some things, and I just want to be there for her. 

That’s the backstory. Long story short, I’m thinking that in order to be a genuine friend to her, I want to be 100% honest about how I feel. I want to let her know that yeah I do like her and at some point I’d love to see where this could go, but I know she needs time, and honestly, I’m not ready either.

It’s been about 7 months since we’ve been together. We both met not knowing we will fall for each other. But here we are…I came back to the states as planned (was at her country as a tourist). We both talked about how this relationship would work and ultimately it was for her to move to the states. Even though we have not dated for a while the fastest way for her to settle here would be for us to get married so we are both looking in that direction. No problems there. We both love each other and never thought about marriage before until we saw each other. 

The problem now is that as things are getting closer for her to come here she expressed that she REALLY does not want to come here. This is because she is leaving her family, friends, pretty much her whole life behind to start a new one with me. I totally understand and we already had our talks regarding this. But when we are talking she mentions along the lines of ‘i want to stay here’…’i dont think I’ll be happy there. Im scared’…which I totally get but now I don’t know how to respond to that because it seems as if she just doesn’t wanna go through with it but also doesn’t want to break up. I also do not want to end the relationship, but I do not know anymore how to respond to her when she says that. We’ve been through this but I’m spending my time trying to console her but she ends up in a really bad mood. If I don’t say anything to it and tell her that I don’t know what to say anymore…she ends up in a bad mood. So Ladies of reddit…what can I say to comfort her??

Also, we’ve talked about me going to her country, but timewise putting both our jobs and restructuring our lives it makes more sense for her to move here which is why we agreed to that.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1131243,public,self,Long distance relationship trouble?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r5jirn/long_distance_relationship_trouble/,no_ads,0,,,

He parked up 3 miles from my house and gave me the option to sleep with him or walk home at 3am in only a tiny dress and heels when it was mid January, heavily raining, and stormy. I was drunk and he was sober, I was frightened. I wish I’d got out and found another way to get home, or even just got pneumonia, but I didn’t.

I had ptsd afterwards and put myself in some risky situations with men for a few years after until something happened that made me realise I needed therapy.

I am much more healed now, though I wouldn’t say cured. I’m dating again and want to find someone to settle down with. But this part of my past makes me anxious about intimacy. I can’t afford therapy atm.

I’m dating a lovely man who I’ve told I want to take things slow and he has been respectful. We’ve only had 4 dates but I like him a lot. 

It’s something id like to talk with him about before sex so he will understand I need to be comfortable enough to stay in my body not my head. but it’s also very heavy and I don’t want to scare him off or attach with a trauma bond!

It’s been so long since I let someone in that I don’t remember how to cope with losing someone who meant the world to me.

Ive been battling with severe anxiety and depression since experiencing childhood trauma and he was my biggest supporter for the last year. I lost a lot of my close friendships after I transferred to our college during covid and because of covid I haven’t really met enough people to have a solid support system outside of him and my current roommate and even then my roommate has never been my best friend, but she has been very kind and we share the annoyances we feel towards our other roommates. 

I’m afraid that my depression is going to suffer because I wasn’t ready to fight this battle on my own. He came in when I needed him the most and I wasn’t ready to let go and I’m still willing to fight for our relationship.

I replied with something like “ok no worries!” Unfollowed and unmatched him and softblocked him (removed him as a follower). 

Since then, he has been viewing all of my insta stories which i find quite…weird. My profile is public but he doesn’t follow me so he had to actively search me.  I don’t get why he’s keeping tabs on me when it was clear he wanted nothing more?
