The issue is that the poor thing is so goddamn nervous around me that he acts like a complete spaz. It‚Äôs actually preventing us from getting closer. 

For example when we are together, he will NOT STOP TALKING. The other day he was trying to get to know me and rapid-fired three separate lines of thought at me almost at once. The first time we talked, it was him and my friend and me, and I swear to god, I thought he was on cocaine or having a full blown manic episode. It was a little embarrassing. Sometimes he‚Äôll trauma dump and I don‚Äôt make him feel bad about it but it‚Äôs undeniably weird to just immediately unravel for a near stranger, especially since he has a lot of friends and apparently he doesn‚Äôt do that with everyone. He has adult ADHD and so do I so I am sympathetic to the issue, but friends that have spent time alone with him confirm that when I am not there, he‚Äôs able to actually focus and carry on a normal conversation because he isn‚Äôt nervous. 

Should I just wait it out and hope he eventually realizes he can relax with me? Should I just address it directly and risk putting him on the defensive?

It's like walking into a company unannounced and saying I want a corner office I want to be paid this much I want a private parking space I want this many vacation days....

11,pxc8e8,1632852674,Characteristics of a good (online) conversation,"After having numerous conversations on dating apps here is what I have learned are the properties of a great conversation:

**Depth**: Good conversation tends to have depth, meaning the replies from both parties are detailed and descriptive. They tend to be longer, have multiple parts, and are emotional. eg ""My morning was great! I just made some pancakes and they turned out to be perfect. Too bad I ran out of Nutella :(. How is your Sunday coming along?"" as opposed to ""Great. Just had breakfast. You?""

**Convergence**: A great conversation has replies that tend to converge when discussing a topic ie the time taken to reply by both parties progressively reduces over time eg she replies in 1 hour, he replies in 45 minutes, she replies in 35 minutes, and so on. This is obviously not hard and fast and can periodically diverge because we are all busy with our lives but some level of convergence shows that you are interested in them and vice versa.

**Media**: As they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Sharing pictures/audio/memes/links when used strategically takes the conversation to a whole another level, especially if is original content.

**An anchor**: I have seen a great pickup line or icebreaker doesn't really cut it for me. It usually takes an anchoring topic that both parties dive into for a short while until they become comfortable with each other. It could be a shared like/dislike, current event, etc eg moving into a new apartment, getting a new pet, a recent celeb scandal - anything that gets both the parties talking freely.

**Humour/banter**: This one goes without saying but it is so important that it shouldn't be left out. I personally have never seen a good convo where there weren't some jokes/ribbing/sarcasm/jokes/lols.

**Natural**: The minute you try to force a conversation you make it worse. Sometimes it is better to just let it go. Talk less, change the topic, change the rhythm, and if nothing works just stop. If it feels like an interview or interrogation you are doing it wrong.

14,pxchb5,1632853388,"I (23 Male, moved to Birmingham, England 25 days ago) wanna date someone nice and someone who I genuinely like. I'm a little desperate now and I believe I have the reason to be ..","So I have avoided dating for the past 4-6yrs because I genuinely wasn't good at handling these things along with my very intensive engineering classes. And before that I had even problems making good friends. So I focused on myself and having a great college life, made great friend and had great experiences but generally stayed away from dating/relationships. 

While I've had self esteem issues all my life ( I know a lot of people do, I'm sorry if that sounds like I'm trying to give myself some kind of self importance). but yeah I'm 6ft 3 and now I'm a little chubby in my stomach area because I had a really bad accident which led to a broken back and also I fell from the second floor which really broke my left arm ( I still can't grip properly). So I worked hard to regain basic strength along with working on myself and overcoming mental barriers to reach here where I feel I'm actually gaining proper gym strength( upper and lower body along with back) but I still have that belly fat I need to get rid of.

But the thing is, all people see is a ""fat"" guy. I know I'm not that fat but yes when you notice my belly being a little wider than what it should be then yes I can be called fat. I'm still working hard to reduce it and it'll take time because belly fat is really hard to lose. Even a few ""friends"" I made here made some comments about them not believing I work out and that I wasn't dateable. I don't think I'm undateable because of my fat.. i know I might not be gifted with a ryan gosling face but I clean up well and look good, but yes that fat does annoy me and brings down my insecurities.

So now I, an Indian guy is in Birmingham England,getting his master's degree and meeting tons of other people. But yeah, I am alone and now after staying away from dating for so long.. I do wanna date some cute nice girl who likes me for who I am and LOL I'm not even rich because I'm an international student here on a budget trying to ""make it"".. and I know I will make it.  I hope this doesn't sound like I'm boasting but I'm a really great boyfriend... I'll take care of my girl, I'll be there for her, take her out on experiences,   ( in my financial capabilities and will go above and beyond my capabilities too) love her and walk around the city talking to her, snuggling in bed, studying together and I dunno much more. I'm unable to meet someone here though and I don't think dating people from my classes and/or my accommodation ( like the people I'll see EVERYDAY and have to work with) is a good idea... although I'm sure even that is a tough thing for me. 

I finally caved in and downloaded bumble yesterday.. hoping I can meet someone I can connect with more than just on texts. I understand that I don't ""need"" someone to make my life complete or make me happy... but I'm just a guy who wants a partner now. I'm 23 and have never had one proper nice long term loving relationship. But I know I can, if I can barely pass the first few gates. 

Also, there's a lot of stereotypes about Indian men ..some well deserved( and I know some of those people) and some really bad and undeserving and really off putting. I'm finding it difficult beyond approaching, talking and taking their numbers.... I find no real connection no effort from the other side. Is this what western dating culture is like(literally I wanna Know..)? Because people here are open, expressing themselves , being themselves, be it men or women and other non binary human beings, so I thought the stereotyping wouldn't be that much and dating would be just fine. Anyway.. the point is, I don't know what to do...  typing all this kind of makes me sound selfish and as if ther aren't bigger problems in this world.. but yeah, while I'm normally very confident,  I'm kind of in shambles right now with this)

She‚Äôs smart as hell, really funny, kind, thoughtful, so good looking that my friends seem to think she‚Äôs ‚Äòout of my league‚Äô, has similar interests to me, etc. And above all, she actually seems really into me. When we‚Äôre both free we text back and forward like rapidly, she gave me her number and all her socials, she was the one to message first, she sends me songs and other recommendations of things she likes that she thinks I would, when tv shows we‚Äôre both into her brought up she slyly suggests we should ‚Äòwatch it together‚Äô, etc. 

It‚Äôs getting to the point where I feel like I should definitely ask her out. We‚Äôve been talking for like over a week now, we‚Äôre clearly comfortable with each other and enjoying talking to each other and she‚Äôs done a lot of the initiative taking so far lmfao. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve never been in this position before. I‚Äôve never had a girl show like such an obvious interest in me. I‚Äôve asked girls out in the past but it‚Äôs never, ever been a yes.

I feel like having no relationship experience has emotionally stunted me into being stuck in the mindset of like a 14 year old boy. I genuinely think part of me feels like I‚Äôm unlovable cause it‚Äôs never happened for me before, and now when a girl is showing clear, continued interest, rather than leap on the opportunity my brain just wants to shut down and run off.

29,pxdpmj,1632856942,"I have two great male best friends in my life, but am not sure who to choose.","So I have two best friends. Both of them are dudes. I am a girl for the record. Both of them are really great people, but really different people.

The first, let's call him John, is a bit of an aloof person. He isn't very emotional and isn't the most talkative person. He's tall and I'd say pretty handsome. He's very kind and has a sweet heart. I've known him for almost 6 years now, and we hang out pretty regularly. Things can be kind of awkward when we interact though, because he's super quite, and I'm super talkative, and honestly, it feels like talking to a brick wall sometimes.

Onto the second guy. We'll call him Tim. Tim is a really great guy. He's a lot more talkative than John, and definitely more expressive. He's very outward when it comes to his feelings. I've known Tim for only 4 years, and there was about a year there where we got busy and didn't talk. We just very recently reconnected and went out together. Meeting up with him for the first time in a while was amazing. There were no awkward silences (like there usually are with John) and he was so chill. We had the best time. I can also tell that Tim really cares about me, and he's even expressed that to me, while John has never really expressed any concern for my wellbeing in a way. I know John cares about me and he's just way to shy to say anything about it, but it's still hard sometimes.

Another thing about John is that my interests are never a huge deal to him. When he recommends things to me I usually look into him, but when it's the other way around, he kind of disregards my interest whereas Tim tries to understand what I like and vice versa. 

I know I've been painting more of a negative picture of John in some ways, but John is a really great guy. He's very sweet and has a good sense of humor, he just hasn't fully opened up to me yet, which can be frustrating at times since I've known him for so long. 

So anyways. There's my dilemma. If anyone wants to share any advice on how I should go about my relationships with them that would be much appreciated. Thanks for listening.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxdpmj/i_have_two_great_male_best_friends_in_my_life_but/

I'm tired of the people that put absolutely nothing about them in their profile other than shit like ""I won't reply to ""hi"" "" or ""just ask""
The guy is expected to do all the effort but its near impossible to do when you have nothing to go on.
I've tried asking questions about stuff in their profile or pictures but I hardly get a response, the problem is guys hope they can get a reply from a woman, whilst the woman basically get to choose from the hundreds of messages they get.

32,pxdsa6,1632857155,Move on?,"So I‚Äôve been talking to a guy for a couple weeks. We originally started talking last year when we matched on Okcupid. We exchanged numbers and on Thanksgiving he ghosted me (Lol). Well he messaged me one day a couple weeks ago on okcupid again. He apologized for ghosting me and that he said that someone from his past had reached out to him and that‚Äôs why he ghosted me. I understood so I kept talking to him and we exchanged numbers again. From that day on we talked on the phone a minimum of two hours almost every day. We had planned to meet up on a Friday night but he said he got busy at work and that he‚Äôd call me later. Well he didn‚Äôt. Then Saturday morning I called him and he sent me a text saying he was dealing with a work emergency and would call me later. He didn‚Äôt. He ended up ghosting me again for a week until I messaged him telling him that he was being dumb because we clearly like each other and there was a connection. We started talking again and he said that he felt overwhelmed and that he shuts down when he feels that way and doesn‚Äôt communicate with anyone about it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt because I knew he was dealing with stress from work and sometimes feelings can be overwhelming. Well we finally met Tuesday last week. He came over to my place after work and it was great. I felt such a connection to him, one I‚Äôve never felt with anyone and I can‚Äôt really explain. We did end up having sex and it was probably the best sex I‚Äôve ever had. It wasn‚Äôt awkward or weird and we kissed and smiled and made eye contact throughout. I again felt such a connection to him and I couldn‚Äôt believe how amazing it felt. I should say that I‚Äôm not one for casual sex, it‚Äôs awkward and I get nothing out of it. Anyways, we continued to talk and text throughout the week and I asked him if he wanted to hang out again during the weekend. He said sure probably Sunday because he wanted to do yard work on Saturday. Saturday I sent my usual good morning text and we exchanged a couple text then silence again, I was busy and figured he was too and maybe he‚Äôd call that night. He didn‚Äôt. Sunday I text him in the AM and he responds but then nothing. I call him, nothing. Then I call him a couple hours later and again he didn‚Äôt answer I leave him a voicemail asking what‚Äôs going on and wondering why he‚Äôs, again, shutting me out. If he didn‚Äôt want to hang out he can just say that. He sends me a text telling me he‚Äôs tired. So I leave him alone. I feel stupid still putting any effort towards him but I also don‚Äôt wanna lose this connection. I know I deserve better but I also haven‚Äôt felt this way about anyone before. I know I need to just move on. I guess I just wanted confirmation that this is what I‚Äôm supposed to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxdsa6/move_on/

34,pxdva5,1632857383,I feel lost and need help,"Hi I‚Äôm a 24 year old guy. I have never dated anyone. Never had a first kiss, never done the stuff that comes after that either. 
I have had friends that are women just never a Significant other.

In my freshman year of college for the first and only time in my life a girl actually showed attraction towards me. She always wanted to sit next to me, and talk to me. She would also always smile at me  and laugh at pretty much everything. But I was too stupid back then to realize the signs and I kinda feel like I missed my only chance.

I want to meet a nerdy girl That I can share my passions with. I mean she does not need to be a nerd I mainly just want someone to love as I have been craving that for a long time. 

I am very good at having a conversation. It‚Äôs just really hard for me to get over my anxiety of introduction.

I kind of have a problem where I‚Äôm worried about approaching women because I don‚Äôt want to make them feel uncomfortable or make their day worse in any way. So instead of interacting I tend to just wish that I would interact. I‚Äôm not afraid of rejection I‚Äôm afraid of making her uncomfortable.

Am I just unattractive? I don‚Äôt have great self confidence when it comes to my looks. I am 6ft and 175 pounds. I lift and am quite strong but I still have a little bit of a belly (pictures of me at the end)

So I guess my main question is how can I start putting myself in situations where meeting a girl would be possible? I read online (I know kringe) that you should go to places like bookstores but what do I do? Just like sit around all day doing nothing and just look for girls? I feel like that is super creepy. 

If you want to address any of my other problems I have talked about I would also really appreciate it. 

Oh and if you have any questions please feel free to ask me. I‚Äôm a very open person.

36,pxe5xy,1632858214,Is he emotionally unavailable or just insecure?,"I‚Äôve (28F) been seeing this guy (29M) regularly for over three months now, and we‚Äôve been talking on and off since January this year. We originally matched on tinder and after a while we started talking on Instagram instead. I wasn‚Äôt in the right headspace at the time and therefore didn‚Äôt respond very frequently and the convo eventually died out. He tried reaching out to me a couple times after that, but as I mentioned I wasn‚Äôt in a good place mentally. He reached out again in April and told me he thought I seemed like a great woman that he‚Äôd really like to get to know more. I was in the middle of exams in law school, so I told him I‚Äôd be down to meet up once everything had calmed down a bit. We ended up meeting up at his place for some wine and we had what seemed to be great chemistry. He was also very respectful and didn‚Äôt try to get in my pants. However he didn‚Äôt reach out in the following days, so I decided to send him a text asking when we are seeing each other again (I later found out he hadn‚Äôt reached out because he felt as if I left very abruptly, so he assumed I wasn‚Äôt too keen). He responded well and suggested a specific time and date, and told me he would love to take me on a boat ride to this really nice restaurant on an island. The date went really well and we hung out for almost 10 hours and it never felt awkward or forced. To make a very long story short, we‚Äôve now been on at least 15 dates, but I just don‚Äôt feel like the relationship is progressing. He didn‚Äôt attempt to kiss me until the 8th or 9th date. When we finally did kiss he looked at me with a smile and said it was about time. Yet he hasn‚Äôt tried to do anything sexual with me. He even seems hesitant to touch me in non-sexual ways. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I love a good gentleman and I‚Äôm happy to take things slow! If I wasn‚Äôt I would have taken the initiative myself. But the lack of progression combined with some recent ‚Äúflaky behaviour‚Äù (being a bit hot and cold, contacting me nonstop when he‚Äôs drunk, being a little stingy with contact when sober etc.) makes me wonder if his interest in me is still there. The frequency in which we talk has also barely progressed. He pretty much always responds if I send him snaps, but I find that he isn‚Äôt reaching out much. He told me recently that he‚Äôd asked his best friend for advice before reaching out to me in April, and that that same friend had asked him to hang out a weekend we were seeing each other. When the friend found out we were seeing each other he had supposedly said jokingly that he wanted some of the credit for being the ‚Äúmatchmaker‚Äù so to speak. So his friends obviously know about me, yet I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that he has lost interest. I‚Äôm seeing him this week, and I‚Äôm kinda lost on wether to bring it up or not.

She and I hit it off, went on a lunch date a week later, then that Sunday we went out to a fancy dinner and a live art performance. We had a blast. There was definite chemistry there. Her hands were all over me, and I got invited back to her house after. I spent the night in her bed but we didn't do anything other than spoon. we had both mentioned before that, that we missed the warmth of someone else in bed, and given how much fun we had - we definitely hit it off.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I got a call at 6pm - ""I'd like to see you, if that's ok?"". She had her kids with her but I said that's fine. We went to dinner and then back to her place, I spent the night again. She's made a lot of comments about how I've made her very vulnerable and she's let her guard down around me, ""something about you"", or ""if my friends knew we talked this much and I told you these things they wouldn't recognize me""

I could tell he was shy but interested so I felt it out to be sure, followed him on Instagram and messaged him about a week later. We talked for a week or so through Instagram until he finally asked for my number. Since then we had been talking regularly and we met up for the first time (outside of the gym) for drinks and it went really well (2 1/2 hours, he asked to kiss me goodnight) a week or so later we went to dinner and again it went really well, he walked me back to my car, kissed me again etc. and was a total gentleman really, is so sweet and attentive, asked me a lot of questions.. from there I went to his apartment once and he came to see me at my place 45 minutes away (at the time, I had an apartment set up 5 minutes from his with the lease starting in September). He was definitely interested in sleeping together but when I showed the slightest hesitation he backed off and didn‚Äôt make any sort of issue out of anything.

I was aware he was about to get really busy with work and he kept saying how much he wanted to see me but how busy he is (I know, excuses).

He doesn't seem to be that interested in responding to my texts or making an effort to call and talk to me. Under normal circumstances, I don't mind not texting all the time, I get it, people are busy. But the issue comes in when this is the only way we are able to communicate with each other. For context, we are in the same area when I am not in school and I am far away while at school. At the beginning of our relationship, we would text pretty regularly and he would insist on calling me every night, even when we were in the same area. Again, I do not expect him to call every night, but I would hope he felt the urgency to try to call at least a few times a week. I feel like I am initiating everything now. We used to watch movies online together as sort of a virtual ""date"" when we were LD last year, but now I'm struggling to get him to even set a date for us to watch a movie together. I am making sure to work around his schedule. I feel neglected in sort of an abrupt way. I have brought up our lack of texting and he just tells me ""You shouldn't expect me to text you all the time I don't want this relationship to feel like an obligation"" and yeah I totally understand that...But I really don't think asking for a movie night once a month is really a huge ask. I normally wouldn't be this worked up over a lack of texting and calling, but since it is the only way I can talk or ""hangout"" with him while I am far away, I expect more frequent online communication. In my eyes, that's something you kinda sign up for when getting into an LDR. For example today, I sent a good morning text and he never replied to it, and was active on social media throughout the day while not replying to my text. I guess I am making this post because I feel stuck. On the one hand, I totally get that he doesn't have the time to text me all day and I am not expecting him to at all.

53,pxfzd5,1632863301,Confusing 3rd Date Flake," I 27M met girl 27F on Hinge.  First date (drinks) goes very well.  She's super into me and keeps pushing the date to go longer.  Towards the end she asks me what I'm up to on the weekend and tells me we should go bowling Saturday night.  I eventually agree.  We leave the bar she kisses me then grabs my hand and we walk to her car.  We makeout for a couple minutes at her car and say goodbye.

2nd date I pick her up and we go bowling.  Have a fun time and go back to my place for some wine (she loves wine).  We eat pizza, drink wine and listen to music.  We makeout in the kitchen and on the couch but each time she pulls away after about a minute and goes back to drinking/eating.  I maybe could've pushed to escalate more but she was acting a lot more reserved on this date.  At around midnight she asks if I can take her home as she has a dog at home and work in the morning.  I drive her home and we makeout one more time in the car.

Next day she texts me saying she had a great time.  We make a plan to get dinner the following Sunday night.  We text a few more times throughout the week.  Probably 50/50 each of us initiating.  

On Sunday (day of the date) I text asking what time she'll be ready.  We agree I'll pick her up at 7:30pm.  At 5:30 she texts me saying she's super tired from the last few busy days of work (she works weekends) and asks if we can reschedule.  I'm a little thrown-off but play it cool and say ""that's fine let me know when you're free and we'll figure something out"".  To my surprise she follows up asking my schedule for the week.  I tell her then she says ""well maybe Tuesday or Wednesday then?"".  I say ""Tuesday works for me.  I get off work around 5pm"".

And that is the last I heard from her.  It's now Tuesday night.  She never followed up.  The flake itself was a surprise but the fact she made the effort to reschedule then ghosted is what's really perplexing.  Is it worth reaching out at some point or do I just assume low interest?

60,pxh376,1632866561,Should I (27m) pursue her (22f)?,"Hello redditors,
I warn you, english isn‚Äôt my main language.
So goes the story. First, a bit of context. I met a girl through friends and when I first saw her, I thought she was incredibly gorgeous. She was at a party at the neighbor‚Äôs house and she came to make small talk with my friend whom she knows. I told my friend that I thought she was stunning and he told me that she had a boyfriend. 

Fast forward a month and a half ago, she started following me on Instagram. I was thrilled and curious why she added me since we only saw each other for like 30 seconds and that I didn‚Äôt say a word. On Instagram, I went to chat with her, but it was more in a friendly way since ai knew she had a boyfriend. We exchanged a few jokes and laughed a bit, but I ended up stopping answering. 

About a month later, I ended up having a match with her. I immediately dm her on Instagram. I knew she was fresh out of a relationship (less that a month) that lasted 4 years and I was reticent in meeting her, but I asked her out anyways. She told me that she wasn‚Äôt ready for this. Two days later, she asked me out. I told her no and asked her if she was really ready for that. I didn‚Äôt want to end up hurt or a rebound. Anyways, my friends convinced me to meet her and a couple of days later, we had a first date. 

I went on 2 dates with her. During the first date, I feel like we really connected (we joked a lot, laughed a lot and the conversation was flowing). Everything was fine until the second date in which I told her that I really felt like kissing her. After I told her, she started crying. I felt really awful, insecure and I was worried if I had done something wrong even though I knew that she was dealing with a breakup. We stayed with each other for two hours after she started crying and I was giving her emotional support and genuinely cared about her feeling better. She spoke a lot about her ex (as you may have guessed) and told me she wanted to get back with him but didn‚Äôt want to at the same time. 

At the end of the date, I said I was open to see her and that I don‚Äôt want to pressure her into anything. She said she wanted to see me again too and gave me a hug. 

The next day, we texted a bit and she told me she felt really awful. She said that she need some time alone and that she isn‚Äôt ready to date. I said that I understand and to take care of herself. I told her that my door remains open for when she is ready. Later that day, she messaged me some tik tok video. I answered her that I was confused since I thought she wanted to stop seeing me. I asked her if she likes me and she said she doesn‚Äôt know, that she is in a weird part of her life.

Yesterday, we texted a bit and I asked her if she was open to simply be friends since we really get along well. She said yes.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm beginning to feel doubts. A part of me thinks that I may have been pushy with her and scared her off dating/a potential relationship with me in the future. Another part of me understands that she is in pain and that it‚Äôs not my fault, that it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm not attractive/interesting enough. I can‚Äôt help but feel responsible. Also, I hope that it will develop into a romantic relationship eventually, but I feel like I shot myself in the foot by asking to be just friends.

71,pxi26i,1632869568,Next move text or in person?,"I (30M) recently moved to a new country and joined a local sports club partly because I love the sport, but also to meet new people. I'm now on a competitive team with a woman (27F I think) I'm interested in. We've had a few 1 on 1 conversations including one earlier today, and we get along but most of our interactions are in a team/group setting. I have no idea if she's in a relationship, but I would guess not.

Our season is winding down, we have one practice and one competition day left, those are both next week. So I need to make a move pretty soon if I'm going to make one. We have a team WhatsApp group, so I have her number available even though I've never actually asked for it. What I'm wondering is if it makes more sense to try to approach this situation via text or hope for a good opportunity to maybe ask her out in person? To be clear, I wouldn't be asking her out right away through either medium, just trying to build up to that.

Pros of texting: 

* Moves things along faster, if I wait for in person I'm waiting probably a week or a week and a half
* Possibly build rapport better than quick conversations in a sports focused setting

Cons of texting:

* I genuinely don't think she would be distressed or anything if I texted, like I said, she knows me and our interactions have been good. Still, she didn't give me her number and that's a mental hurdle for me. Would this be weird?

&amp;#x200B;

Pros of in person:

* I think all else equal, having conversations or asking someone out is nicer in person as compared to through text

Cons of in person:

* Not sure there will be a good time to flirt or ask her out",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxi26i/next_move_text_or_in_person/

But at 21 i feel like its a little weird to never be in a relationship. Dating and sex is such a common topic of conversation. I honestly feel a little left out. I wondered if it‚Äôs the idea of virginity? I had friends scoff or look at me in a demeaning way every time my nonexistent dating history comes up. Its not like I‚Äôm saving it for marriage but i would like it to be someone i trust and feel happy with. I personally just can‚Äôt stand it when they say ‚Äúsomething must be wrong you.‚Äù

Another aspect is trauma. I have pretty severe CEN (Childhood Emotional Neglect). I haven‚Äôt realize how badly it effected every part of my being until I‚Äôve done my part of the whole reflecting process during COVID. I don‚Äôt trust people easily, i have abandonment issues, I can‚Äôt rely on people, worst of all i feel broken and empty inside. It‚Äôs like whatever degree of emotions normal people feel, i sometimes can‚Äôt feel at all. 

I‚Äôve always wonder what the feeling is like to get butterflies in your stomach. How its like to be completely obsessed with one other. How exciting it all must be. But sometimes i feel like it difficult for me to feel something as simple as attraction, (not aesthetic) but emotional or sexual attraction. Its a feeling i rarely experience. 

In terms of attraction, many people have told me to ‚Äúgive someone a chance‚Äù or ‚Äúlower your standards‚Äù. But truthfully, i don‚Äôt know what my standards are. I don‚Äôt mind meeting new people but pushing myself physically outside of my comfort zone makes me feel scared and induces anxiety and panic attacks.

I don‚Äôt know if I should clarify this, but i hav toyed with the idea that maybe I‚Äôm a ace (or at least on the spectrum). It would make sense on the attraction level, but i always wonder if its just my CEN haunting me. 

Anyways, am i normal? Should i just push myself to get into a relationship? If not, when will i know I‚Äôm ready?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxinj3/21f_i_cant_bring_myself_to_date/

I got scared on Saturday, he kissed me and said he loved me. I went into full blown panic. I have genuinely only been in love with ONE person before. And while yes of course the feeling of being in love sounds so great, it's just not that easy. 

I can't be worried though, because I did this to my ex. I fell in love with him the day I met him. So I can understand the excitement behind it. But instead of acting like a normal human I decided to get smashed. He showed up to come get me, and I wasn't ready to leave (because I'm a brat) and he stayed with me, made sure I drank water, fed me, and let me keep doing what I was doing. I could tell he was pissed, as he should be. 

Finally he takes me home, puts me in bed, gets me water, and kisses me and APOLOGIZED for scaring me to the point I chose to freak out. 

Why the hell is he apologizing?! I'm the asshole here. 

I went and picked him up yesterday and decided it was time to open up about my love for my ex. I told him the good and the bad. Everything to help him understand why this is so damn hard for me. He didn't even judge me, he held me, and I cried a ton. And he told me it was okay that I still feel that way. He wants to keep talking through these things and building something better with me. 

I'm feeling pretty freaking selfish for acting out like that. I didn't do anything inappropriate and I did go somewhere safe where we have mutual friends who would have babysat me. We have this saying, we tell it to everyone, ""we came to together, we leave together, and if we don't come together, we will go home to the other person"". 

He was mad, he didn't yell, he didn't put me down, he didn't call me names, he didn't make me feel like garbage, and he didn't walk away. He so calmly explained how he felt, the next day, because that day there was no point.

Not physically my type at all, but his profile and the response he gave to my initial message was too good for me to not give it a shot. He was really good at communicating and seemed interested in getting to know me. We even had a date planned. It fell through bc one of us got sick, but he kept talking about taking me out on a date and meeting in person and all that stuff so I‚Äôm thinking he‚Äôs still interested in hanging out. He also mentioned if his feelings change he would let me know, which I respected because no one likes being ghosted. Except I noticed his texts getting less frequent and/or substantial, but I‚Äôm busy so I figured he was too, but now he‚Äôs not texted me at all and I‚Äôve already sent two messages to get the conversation going again (read receipt are on so I know he has seen them) and I‚Äôm not sure if I should send a third asking if everything is okay and giving him the space to tell me he‚Äôs not feeling me anymore, or if I should just say fuck it and try again with another guy. I don‚Äôt really want to just let it go, but I‚Äôm also not going to fight for someone who clearly doesn‚Äôt want me. I‚Äôm also not sure if he‚Äôs just busy because he said he would let me know if things changed and he hasn‚Äôt said anything, but he could‚Äôve just been lying. I am also very anxious and I assume the worst with every situation so I need someone level headed to guide me haha

TL;DR been talking to this guy who said he would tell me if he wasn‚Äôt interested in me anymore. Haven‚Äôt heard from him despite putting in effort to start a conversation up.

I've even heard popular girls at my school talk about me being pretty good looking. I'm pretty confident as well. Well it's all put on. But I am quite quiet at school. I can talk to anyone I want and I am civil with pretty much everyone but I chose not to speak to anyone. I don't know what I'm going through at the minute but I am considering just killing myself. I mean I'm seeking recognition from Reddit users. I find myself very lonely even though I have plenty of friends and family. So I started looking for someone that I could love, care for and could do the same back. I've spend at most a month getting to know someone over text and then ask them out after 2 weeks to a month. Rejected time and time again I finally get a yes. I'm exhausted by this point. The first girl I went with I was mad in love with. But she shut me down cause she ""wasn't ready."" The most recent one I can't get my head around. She's the prettiest blonde I've ever seen and I've been out with her twice and she wants me to meet her parents. Yet she goes on about other boys and how they are so cute and hot. After sending her a very dry reply and saying goodnight without a kiss emoji. We usually end with a kiss emoji. She sends me back the exact same dry goodnight and puts up on her story 5 mins later saying ""Pu to be pinned."" I know I was pinned cause I seen it. The last girl I went into depression for 6 months and I'm more in love with this girl. Heck I thought she might have liked me. I don't want depression again. I might kill myself if I do again cause I was so close before. Pls help me Redditors.

A little backstory I was born with a rare genetic bone disorder (not contagious!) where my bones are fragile If I were to fall or get hurt. Therefore it makes it extremely painful for me to walk. I use a manual wheelchair to get around and I‚Äôm extremely independent . I‚Äôve lived on my own before, take care of myself personally and physically. Like I literally do not need any help in the caregiver world at all. 

Every time I have met a man I am upfront and honest with them. I tell them straight from the bat &amp; tell them exactly how it is. I make it very clear I have no limitations and they could not hurt me from doing anything it‚Äôs just if I were to basically fall and land the wrong way. (Hopefully this makes since) 

Most men I meet are not accepting of me or my wheelchair and I just want to know from both men &amp; women what is so hard to accept about a wheelchair?

97,pxk3ey,1632876477,I found someone...but I'm nervous about it all.,"So I (M21) met someone (F20) that is interested in possibly pursuing something more. We both have things to figure out before we have this discussion again, but I have never actually reached this point in dating/getting to know a person. It's been just over a month.   


I would really like to make this work, and I'm finding what we have so far to be quite healthy; we've been managing expectations, talking about boundaries and things we're comfortable/uncomfortable with, etc.   


We're both college/university students so our time is quite packed at the moment, but we text each other whenever we can. I really like this person, but due to past events, I feel like I'm self-sabotaging. I asked her if she could be my lockscreen wallpaper, and she said yes. (We had a laugh over the picture she sent, and I have it set to be a slideshow so it's not just her.)  


But then she mentioned that *she* doesn't really have people as any wallpaper, so I thought I might have made her uneasy.    


I don't want to feel this way; I intend on giving her space whenever she needs it, and if she isn't in the mood to do anything, that's more than okay.

99,pxk7ps,1632876877,I was able to turn an innocent conversation into a date!,"I  (25 f) recently moved back to my hometown after seven years of living across the state. Four years of college studying to be a pediatric nurse. Three years of working at a hospital in the same city where I went to college.

I was also living with my boyfriend of four years while there. In January broke up for a multitude of reasons. We couldn‚Äôt agree on where we wanted to live. We couldn‚Äôt agree on getting married and mainly we couldn‚Äôt agree on having kids. I want to and he didn‚Äôt. Our breakup was amicable. We both could feel ourselves drifting apart over the last year or so and it finally took a day snowed in together to make us discuss our future. We both realized that our future didn‚Äôt include us together. Soon after our breakup I got a job offer at a hospital in my hometown and jumped at the chance to really move on.

Since I came back home I reconnected with a couple of my high school friends since we hadn‚Äôt seen much of each other in the last few years. I‚Äôve been working like mad and needless to say I haven‚Äôt really been on the dating scene or even really looking.

On Friday night last week my friend Andrea called me to ask if I‚Äôd like to go to a football game Sunday afternoon. I was excited to say yes. I hadn‚Äôt seen our team play in person in forever. Plus a few of our other friends from school wee going to be there and I was looking forward to seeing them. 

Andrea also laughed and said her brother Chris (26 m) was going to be there. She knew that I had the biggest crush on him in school. He was definitely not my normal type. I was the nerdy, quiet straight-A student type and he was the class clown always in trouble heavy metal type guy who played in bands on the weekends. Needless to say because he seemed so much different I was drawn to him.

So while I ever dated him I always liked him  and back then Andrea was always trying to get us together. It never worked out though and once he graduated high school he enlisted in the army and I haven‚Äôt seen him since. So I just laughed off Andrea bringing him up because I knew she was joking.

On Sunday he did show up at this tailgate party we were at. And my god how cute was he still? He said ‚ÄúHey shorty!‚Äù when he saw me. He‚Äôd always tease me about my height back in the day. I‚Äôd say that I was petite and he‚Äôd say that was a polite way to say short. I was also amazed at how much he‚Äôd changed. He was so much more serious and seemed to have his shit together. But he still had his joking personality too.

We ended up talking for a long time and we were both drinking and had a good buzz on. He told me if a rookie on our team got an interception or a sack he was going to buy his jersey. I said if he did that he had to buy me one too. He agreed. Like I said we were both buzzed.  

Our team won and after the game he laughed and said the guy didn‚Äôt sack the quarterback so he didn‚Äôt have to buy us jerseys. Before we went home we exchanged numbers. Today while I was on my lunch I saw on Twitter that the player he mentioned did indeed record half a sack. So I jokingly texted him that he owed me a jersey. He responded that it was a half a sack so he was only buying himself a jersey.

So on a whim I responded that the least he could do was take me to lunch. He wrote back that I had a deal. I didn‚Äôt respond immediately because I was debating doing this and I ended up doing it I wrote back: ‚ÄúGreat! It‚Äôs a date then!‚Äù

Then I sat there nervously wondering if I did something dumb. I could see that he read my message and it looked like he was typing a response then nothing. Suddenly my phone rang and it was him. I answered and we said hi and he said ‚ÄúIf this is going to be a date why don‚Äôt we make it dinner instead of lunch?‚Äù I said is love to go to dinner with him and so we‚Äôre going out on Saturday night.

I called Amanda earlier today and told her that her brother and I were going out and she said finally! So I guess while I was not even looking I got a date this Saturday.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pxk7ps/i_was_able_to_turn_an_innocent_conversation_into/
