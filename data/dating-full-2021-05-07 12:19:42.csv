I had a real experience with a date I met at a dating event. It was meant to be at a speed dating event, and I only talked to her for 5 min where I asked her for her number. 

So when we were texting, I asked her if she wanted to continue this and go on a coffee or dinner date. She accepted and I took her to a semi decent restaurant. Nothing that breaks the wallet, but not something that looks like McDonald's. And no, it wasn't olive garden. We had a nice talk, and I personally enjoyed it. When the bill came up, I paid it in full, which I planned to do the whole time. But I saw what seemed to be a red flag. She not only did not attempt to pay for her half (I would not have let her, but I saw no attempt to reach for the bill or to ask for 2 separate bills or such), she sat there with her legs and arms crossed almost looking like she expected me to pay for all of it. 

I kept that in the back of my mind, but didn't think much of it after. I asked her later via text what she thought of the date and if she is open for another. She said she isn't interested in dating anymore. And I want to make it clear, her exact quote was ""I didn't feel a spark, and no longer wish to date you"". My friend who was sitting next to me saw that response and said she came to get a free meal, and bounced bro. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and said she might just be in a bad situation and I don't want to pressure her into anything. So I sent a text saying okay, thank you for your time then. She messaged me back saying you're not even going to attempt to rescue this? You just give up? 

I was shocked by that message because I always thought that no meant no. I told her this. I told her that once she said I am no longer interested in you, and I still approached her with sexual intent, it is getting into criminal territory and I do not intend to be used as a fleshlight by some 6 foot 6 prisoner. I told her it wasn't me giving up, it was me respecting the clear boundaries she stated, and no man with self respect would pursue a woman after she clearly states she is not interested. I told her that if in the future any man who still pressures you even after you tell him no is not worth it. This must have pissed her off because she blocked me after I said this.

I have been talking to this person for around 5 months now, we have met three times during this time and I'm planning on seeing them again soon. We both live quite far away from one another so it's more of a long distanced thing than anything else. 

We both have made it clear we like one another, and talk about places we can go in the future sometimes, so it seems as if it can lead somewhere more serious. However, we have never really established what our relationship is, I tried addressing this last time we saw one another but he kind of shoved off the question. 

It feels a little more than casual, but like I said we have never really spoken about what we are, and after the last time I tried bringing it up and being shut down in a way, I'm too scared to ask again. This leaves me a little in the dark I suppose.

So, since the last time I saw him (last month) I have been faced with a couple of tempting situations. The first time was with a guy who was clearly into me, and I allowed him to flirt but we never kissed, so that doesn't really count. The second guy we flirted quite a bit and we did kiss, and the third guy we made out a couple of times in his bed (woops). And yes, I was drunk on all of these occasions. So yeah, I kind of feel bad about the third situation. 

I don't know whether to tell this to the guy I'm actually talking too however, but at the same time I have no idea what he's doing when he goes out. For all I know he could be doing the exact same, but at the same time I feel like he wouldn't... I don't want to tell him as I'm worried he will break things off, which I don't want because I really like this person. I also don't know whether it's something I should even have to say, considering we haven't established whether we are official or not.

What I wanna know is whether this is cheating or not, as relationships like these are always so confusing and life would be so much more easier if there wasn't such a stigma on the 'so, what are we' questions.

We've snapped (on Snapchat) for a while now and I'm slowly starting to like him more than a friend. But I'm not sure if he feels the same way. Due to my high school being different from his, I graduated at 11th grade instead of 12th and took a gap year before college. He's currently in his last year of high school(graduating in a few months). So the problem I'm facing is that we used to snap a lot, whenever I would snap back, he would usually reply with a snap in a few seconds/mins. But nowadays, he hasn't opened my snaps and he would do it for max 2 days. The other day, I noticed he read our college group chat's messages and snaps (he doesn't often snap in that group as much as he does with me) but not so much as open my snap. I'm not sure if he's busy or already found me boring. But he would snap back to me eventually. He has been sending me mirror selfies of him in the gym and most of the time funny or sleepy selfies. I've asked some of my guy friends for advice and most of them told me if he didn't like me, then he wouldn't keep replying to me. Figured I would get everyone's advice at this point. Does he feel the same way?

The second question is: do I have a chance? We are both completely different people who do completely different things. He's really out of my league. He loves sports, food, playing with kids and working out while I like playing video games, reading books and cringy wattpad stories, and watching movies. I'm not as fit as him that's for sure and I'm about 58/59kg, slim thick. I'm worried he would want different things or he wouldn't like me cause of my weight or how I look in general. Is that a thing? Does it mean something? I have a few body issues like my thighs, stomach, etc, and told myself many times that he wouldn't like me if we were ever together because there are many things I couldn't do, many things that I couldn't wear that look better on many other gorgeous girls he could date.

Also, I can't meet him in person yet because the distance between us is super far away.

That isn't to say it can't work in the short term, getting them to reluctantly date you, but it just results in a mutually unhappy relationship which probably won't last. 

I don't think they seem to realize that women (and men for that matter) will only be ""addicted"" or stay in toxic relationships if the partner has positive arbitrary attributes (i.e. physical attractiveness, financial status &amp; wealth) that make the toxicity worth tolerating.

But if you have all the toxic traits and zero positives, the relationship will either never happen or they will...

But when I ask her out on a date, she gave me a straight YES. Simple. No strings attached. No doubting, no excuses. Just a 100/100 Yes. I instantly felt like ""what am I doing back then with the previous girl who give me excuses and never make time for me"", why did I have to go through those BS, when another girl MAKE IT EASY for me lol.

I also feel that judging interest from her text response is unreliable. The first girl text me much more enthusiastically than the second. But the second would go out on a date with me, thats all it counts!

We  started texting back and forth Monday. Monday night, I was free so we  chatted quite a bit (unusual for me, as I am not a big texter.) The  conversation flowed naturally. The next few days, we continued talking  though I slowed down a bit due to being at work, not being a big texter,  etc. He asked to go on an hour long ""adventure"" with me Saturday, after  we both talked about our love of exploring. I suggested something more  low key like drinks, being our first time meeting, I didn't want to be  in the car for an hour with a stranger. However, now he is starting to  really annoy me. The conversation went from natural to him badgering me  with constant questions and this is not how i am interested in getting  to know someone and also find a lot of his questions odd and stupid and  haven't been asking him questions back the last few times. I haven't  responded to anything today yet. What should I do?

She’s about 5 years younger than me. She and I are church members and we have seen each other at church events. That’s how I’ve originally met her. I’ve also hanged out with her before and she’s also gone to my birthday party.

At church events she and I would talk about different things. She would tell me what’s going on in her life and I’d tell her what I’ve been up to. Back then she was dating another guy and went through a hard breakup. I was there to try and comfort her. This was back around 2019 before the pandemic was going on. I haven’t seen her or texted her for about a year until February 2021. She and I were FB friends though.

Fast forward to the middle of February of this year and she sees me at church and as I’m about to leave she yells my name. She was really excited to see me and wanted to see how I was doing. Later on that night, I texted her letting her know that I was nice to see her and she said the same. 

We didn’t have much of a chance to talk at church so I asked her how she was doing. She told me that she’s planning on going back to school to get her Master’s Degree and is helping out at a facility to get volunteer experience. I’ve also told her that I’m planning on going back to school because I was interested in pursuing a different career path. She was excited that I was pursuing my passion. 

Several weeks passed by and we kept on talking and talking. We would text each other about every 2-3 days. We would talk about many different topics. But what I recently noticed was that she would take much longer to reply. Her reply’s would be around once a week. Once she would took 3 weeks to respond. Granted, our messages were not short messages so I understand why she may have taken longer to reply.

Fast forward to a couple of days ago and I thought that I would be best to tell her that I liked her. I preferred to tell her in person, but I couldn’t meet with her or speak to her over the phone because it felt as if she was really busy and I didn’t want to seem like I was bothering her. Yes I know that text is not the best way to tell a woman that you’re interested in but I felt like I didn’t really have much of a choice.

Anyways, so I send her a text telling her that I like her and that I’d like to get to know her better and meet up with her in person more. She then tells me that she would be fine hanging out with me but as two friends. She pointed out all of the good qualities that I had and that I’m the most admirable guy friend in her life. She said that she’s not interested in anyone romantically right now, even me with all of my great qualities. She said that perhaps it’s not the right moment for her or she may not be the right girl, but all that she could offer me at this time was a friendship. She ended by saying that she enjoys our conversations.

I accepted what she said and told her that I’m fine with being friends.

What caught me off guard though was that she mentioned to me that she certainly wasn’t expecting for me to like her as more than a friend.

I guess that’s where I am concerned. I’m concerned that perhaps I'm not showing the right signs to a woman. I find myself asking “What I am doing wrong?”. Because I thought that by talking to her, showing interest in her life, and saying nice things about her I'd be showing romantic interest, but I guess that's not enough. It sounds like there's more that I have to do.

When we're together everything is amazing, but then there are just random stretches of time where we don't talk. We've had sex twice, and after both times she's become so much less engaging. I'm convinced if I don't reach out, we'd never speak again, which is odd because we talk about future plans a lot. Our last moments seeing each other before things go cold (twice now) are always on great terms. For example, both times after hooking up, she was all over me, goodbye kisses, cuddling, etc. I just don't understand.

First time we went a week without speaking, I confronted her and asked if there was a problem between us because she wasn't being engaging, or initiating text. We used to reach out evenly. I didn't want to confront her, but I'd rather not worry about someone who was no longer interested. I had to know where her mind was at. I know she has a little anxiety, but that didn't stop her from texting normally before we got more intimate.

After I confronted her, she apologized and explained how she wasn't in the mood to do anything due to work stress. I told her I understand, and if she's ever in the mood to let me know. A few hours after that she asked me out and we went for dinner. Then the next day after dinner, we hooked up for the second time. Since then, we've had a short snapchat interaction, but overall it's been quiet. We did discuss potential plans after we hooked up however.

I don't want to text meaningless things all day, but it seems like she has no interest in talking to me anymore, or doesn't know how to anymore. Last thing we texted was her telling me she got home, then I thanked her for coming over. No response since then. Yeah, I could reach out again, but I don't want to have to beg for attention even if she suggested possibly coming over today.

Am I just overthinking too much? I'd love to ask her to be my woman, but our communication outside of faec to face has just been trash lately. I also don't know where her mind is at regarding relationships.

She’s about 5 years younger than me. She and I are church members and we have seen each other at church events. That’s how I’ve originally met her. I’ve also hanged out with her before and she’s also gone to my birthday party.

At church events she and I would talk about different things. She would tell me what’s going on in her life and I’d tell her what I’ve been up to. Back then she was dating another guy and went through a hard breakup. I was there to try and comfort her. This was back around 2019 before the pandemic was going on. I haven’t seen her or texted her for about a year until February 2021. She and I were FB friends though.

Fast forward to the middle of February of this year and she sees me at church and as I’m about to leave she yells my name. She was really excited to see me and wanted to see how I was doing. Later on that night, I texted her letting her know that I was nice to see her and she said the same.

We didn’t have much of a chance to talk at church so I asked her how she was doing. She told me that she’s planning on going back to school to get her Master’s Degree and is helping out at a facility to get volunteer experience. I’ve also told her that I’m planning on going back to school because I was interested in pursuing a different career path. She was excited that I was pursuing my passion.

Several weeks passed by and we kept on talking and talking. We would text each other about every 2-3 days. We would talk about many different topics. But what I recently noticed was that she would take much longer to reply. Her reply’s would be around once a week. Once she would took 3 weeks to respond. Granted, our messages were not short messages so I understand why she may have taken longer to reply.

Fast forward to a couple of days ago and I thought that I would be best to tell her that I liked her. I preferred to tell her in person, but I couldn’t meet with her or speak to her over the phone because it felt as if she was really busy and I didn’t want to seem like I was bothering her. Plus she said that she was having car issues so she couldn't drive much. Yes I know that text is not the best way to tell a woman that you’re interested in but I felt like I didn’t really have much of a choice. 

Anyways, so I send her a text telling her that I like her and that I’d like to get to know her better and meet up with her in person more. She then tells me that she would be fine hanging out with me but as two friends. She pointed out all of the good qualities that I had and that I’m the most admirable guy friend in her life. She said that she’s not interested in anyone romantically right now, even me with all of my great qualities. She said that perhaps it’s not the right moment for her or she may not be the right girl, but all that she could offer me at this time was a friendship. She ended by saying that she enjoys our conversations.

I accepted what she said and told her that I’m fine with being friends.

What caught me off guard though was that she mentioned to me that she certainly wasn’t expecting for me to like her as more than a friend.

I guess that’s where I am concerned. I’m concerned that perhaps I'm not showing the right signs to a woman. I find myself asking “What I am doing wrong?”. Because I thought that by talking to her, showing interest in her life, and saying nice things about her I'd be showing romantic interest, but I guess that's not enough. It sounds like there's more that I have to do.

I guess what I’d like to know is what I could do better in order to show a woman that I am interested in them romantically. Because I guess she didn’t catch that based on what she told me.

I hung out with a girl first in person and we had great chemistry during our first date. 

Second date we agreed to go out and then later enjoy some edible marijuana at her place (I have a legal prescription for it). We had agreed to just cuddle up and watch tv together but after she had made me relax in her dark bedroom and then went to the bathroom and came back out in lingerie looking amazing. 

She agrees that it was mutual but since I was less intoxicated I should not have initiated the intercourse. 

I’m confused as hell because why would she have me in her bed, change into sexy lingerie, have me eat her but then later say I shouldn’t have gone for the intercourse.

I really liked this girl initially but now I’m starting to wonder if I should walk away right now while I still have the chance.

I want to hear your opinion.   


* We text daily, but recently his text are shorter and sometimes a day passes between the replies. He also doesn't ask a lot. If i ask him about something he doesn't ask back, just gives a boring reply. This behavior has been going on for 2 weeks, but before he was really active.   

* He has mentioned his ex 3 times in two months. Is that a red flag?  I personally hate when people are talking about their exes. One time it was him telling something about a toxic ex, the other time he told me where he took his ex to travel, the last time was ""my ex got me into this type of music"". He was engaged to someone 2 years ago. Oooof.   

* He wanted to connect me to his mother, i was unsure about it because she doesn't know who i am. He just wanted me to text her. I joked and asked if he has connected a lot of people to his mom and he said ""no, never"". After some lurking i found out that he frequently connects female colleagues to his mom. Not sure what to think about it?   

* He is hot and cold. Sometimes when we call he is all excited and wants to know about me, talks about his family, asks me a lot, shows his dream kitchen, asks about my mom etc. Next time we call he is aloof, doesn't even look into the camera and starts to respond and reply to people. This has only happened once so far, he started to respond to texts...it kinda hurt thinking about how he responds sometimes every other day and when we finally call he shows off how he is texting others. I did tell him about it and he saw nothing wrong.   

* I am having problems with my arm. I work in the art industry and have overworked my wrist to the point of needing surgery. I am waiting for surgery now and the pain is killing me everyday, i am mildly depressed. He knows. But he doesn't show much care. I excused it with he is busy, and he is. But then he informed me that he is video calling his sister 3 times a week because she is going thru a hard time. Dont get me wrong, that is great :) But when it hit me that ive been making excuses for his behavior but actually he has plenty of time to show that he cares if he wanted to . I felt stupid.   

* Art is my work and my hobby. Its kinda off putting that in two months he hasn't cared about asking me what inspires me, even seeing my art...when he was talking about his ex and how she got him into a a certain genre of music, he said that it was fascinating to see how art and music connects because i guess she showed him that . Ive been trying to have those types of conversations with him and not much respons from his side. Thats sucks.  

* He forgets things about me a lot.   


I am going to have a video call with him tomorrow just to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I have a strategy of how to bring up the mom topic and also ask him about his future plans, to see where his mind is at. After that i am not sure. I really like him but i can't accept behavior like that. Also how should i end the situation? Just talk to him less and less and then not respond? Or just say that his behavior is off putting.

I want to date someone I’m enthusiastic about, and settling has always made me feel like crap—it affects my self-esteem in a noticeable way. The women I’ve considered to be on my level that I *have* dated were totally awesome, but none of them were looking for anything serious, so those all lasted a couple months or whatever and then I’m off trying to find someone new.

I feel like my main issue is that women in the 8+ range are inundated with matches and messages and infinite possibility; at the same time, attractive strangers on apps have zero value to them. Dime a dozen. Conversations with them lean toward the pulling teeth variety, and it’s clear many of them just want validation. So what really has to happen is you need to somehow meet them in person and wow them with your presence and vibe, have them see your gait and posture and hear your voice, but getting to that part through OLD is pretty tough and inconsistent.

Because of this I need some objective point of view because I might be literally directing an Award winning movie in my head. 

So i’ve been talking with a guy for over 2 months now and each day I am more confused than the last. When things began he would text me almost all the time and would call me the kind of nicknames you use in a relationship. Which I thought was super weird because I just met the man, but i let him. He would send me pictures of whatever he was doing and I could feel him a little more present. 

A couple of weeks ago dude started being a little more withdrawn and would text me less but we would speak over the phone longer, which i thought was ok, he showed interest. I try not to be all over him so I kind of “disappear” for some time of the day and just let him reach out. Whenever he does, it will be sort of like reproaching. Asking me why I haven’t texted him..... why the hell can’t he do it first? Anyway, any time I’m kind of absent he will send me songs with cute lyrics and tell me he is thinking about me or just throw hints at me through IG so I start a conversation. Heck but when I do, the dude becomes monosyllabic and only uses emojis, which drives me nuts because I am making up this idea in my mind that he is not interested in talking to me. So I man up and ask him if he would like to FaceTime before we go to bed and the guy just changes attitude, all happy saying that he would love to. Wtf! 

I have this hypothesis in my head, backed up by my therapist, that the guy is starting to get feelings and he is scared as shit and will try to avoid anything that will give me a clue. Are guys like that?

I was chatting with this girl on tinder for a few days and it was going really well, talking throughout the day and we were super compatible, which is rare on tinder so I was feeling pretty good. I suggest a date for Saturday and she agrees! We were texting until like 2am Friday night and everything was great, she was sending heart emoji’s through text and all.

Then Saturday night comes and silence. I hope she’s got a busy morning so I text around 3pm with a quick “hey we still on for tonight?” This isn’t my first rodeo so as the hours pass I realize this date isn’t happening. I check her tinder profile around 8 pm and notice her miles away from me number is different, she’s like 5 miles away from me instead of 20. So she’s obviously not at home and I kinda put 2 and 2 together and realize she probably went out with someone else. I check her profile a few more times through the night and notice her miles away is back to normal, (meaning she’s back at home) and then about an hour later I’m unmatched.

It seems she went out with another guy, wanted to see how that went and when it went well she unmatched me. Which feels really terrible being the 2nd option when the date was already agreed upon. And I understand I could be wrong. She could have been doing anything else, but at the end of the day she still ghosted me completely out of nowhere with no explanation.

This is mostly a vent about OLD really. This is not the 1st time I’ve been flaked on the day of. Most of the time I’ve gotten some communication though. It’s typically “I have a family member that’s sick I can’t” and then I don’t hear from them again. I know what that means now and it’s whatever. It’s difficult to say I found someone else and I get it. It’s just so hard to find something genuine these days, or get excited about connections when you finally find one. I don’t think we could have hit it off any better. It is so impossible to know where the other’s person head is at on the other side of the screen even though their words are telling you the best.

The next time, which was honestly shortly after, I asked a friend of mine. She agreed, we set a time and place. She ghosted two days before. 😐

He invited me over to his place for dinner. I \[M, 28\] thought it was a pretty good first date. We spoke about a wide range of stuff and we poked fun at each other the way kids who have crushes on each other would, but we know it's harmless fun.

Closer ot the end of the night, I asked him about his top3 kareoke songs and he (which I thought was so much fun) started performing each of them from 1-3. He was a great performer and I found it entertaining. 

When it came to my turn to share, he asked me the same question and I told him my number one, and somehow he managed to divert the conversation to something else which lead us to watching random Youtube videos on his couch. He then proceeeded to try to make out with me and invited me to his bedroom but I made it perfectly clear I wasn't there to have sex with him. In fact, just toprevent myself from hooking up with guys on the first date, I always wear an old underwear...like, the ones with holes in it that you mean to throw out but haven't because you find it comfortable as hell? (Or maybe that's just me \*shurgs\*)

Anyhow, I digress. He ended up jerking off while we kissed and came on himself. I shortly thereafter left (as it was getting very late) and thanked him for the food, entertainment and a (mostly) fun evening.   


Since that day, the texts have gotten so infrequent, days would pass without hearing from him. And when I do, it would be a short ""What's up?"". I would respond with full honesty and he would respond a day or two later with ""so what did you end up doing?"" or something to that effect. I have stopped responding in long paragraphs and just decided to match his energy. However, I asked him if he would be interested in another date this coming weekend and he said he would be busy working for for the next couple weekends and opted for a phone call instead. He didn't offer a date, or time for said phone call; and when I asked about it he did not respond. That was two days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is different form the hetero-normative questions you guys would usually get here but I thought I would still ask: **Is he interested or not?**

Am I over reacting for feeling a bit pushed by the wasyside? Should I just forget about him and move on? Should I just straight up ask him if he is interested?   
I am not desperate or anything...I just feel caught in this cycle of meeting a guy (online), get to talking, liking him (as he checks all my boxes) and then not hearing from them after awhile.

Then, we were talking Tuesday night and I responded to something and I've heard nothing. He watches all of my insta stories promptly.

However, most people have screwy baggage to work through, and a good portion of people will completely ignore their bad patterns, toxic narratives and annoying habits to the point where they cycle in and out of relationships without much realization that they are sabotaging themselves and leaving a trail of destruction behind them.

My good friend of 20 years? She has dated 2 men in the past couple years who were devoted to her, mature and well liked by all of her friends and family... but guess what, her biggest complaint was that they were ""too nice"" and ""boring"". Despite the fact that one of them was a published author and the other was probably the funniest and most engaging person i've seen her with. The more people loved them, and gushed over how wonderfully they were together, the less she liked him. She would literally convince herself OUT of the relationship the moment someone said how great they were, which is not typical of couples who are looking for their friends and families approval. The men she pines over are usually jobless, vague about commitment, and consumed by either tattoos, cars or baby mama drama. 

One of my male friends has been depressed about being single for the last decade...despite the fact he's been on over 100 dates since I met him 4 years ago. He can't sustain a relationship longer than 3 months before getting bored and cheating on them. The women he pines over? Usually the ones so far out of ANYONES league that even the Hemsworth brothers would have a hard time getting into bed with them. One time he told me he ""lost respect"" for a girlfriend he had when she made him a valentines day gift. He was so repulsed by the act of affection that he promptly left and hooked up with some random girl at the bar. 

Every person who had their heart broken by these two people felt there was something wrong with them, and it sucked to hear about the long phone calls, and pleading for answers. It made me realize that we often have too much faith in other people and take their actions so personally that we immediately conclude we must be a terrible partner if they can't see how great and caring and loving we can be to them.

**1) They focus on pictures too much**. Yes looks are important but there is a reason for the saying, don't judge a book by the cover.

**2) Texting just doesn't work.** You can't tell tone and a lot of people add a filter when texting.

**3) Too many options**. Having too many options just makes it super easy to give-up or look for the next best thing. People simply don't work on the relationship and go back to swiping or exploring on the app for the next match.

 I met the guy on Tinder, he seemed decent if with a bit weird sense of humor. We talked for a fee days and agreed on get a coffee- like date. All good, right?

Well, apparently he lied about a few things, first, his age. I was 21 at the time, in his profile he said he was 23, while in reality he was 20. Same for his height, which for me is important (I like taller than me guys which isn't really that hard to achieve since I'm 5'3 myself, and its my personal preference, not to offend anyone). He said he was 5'7, and yet was 5'2 at best. Really, its not that hard to be honest about such things is it? Its gonna come out anyway, whats the point of lying?

Well, all of that aside, we decided to meet at 5pm and then head to our destination. I got ready, dressed up nicely- first impressions are important and all that, and waited. And waited. And then some more. When I was just about to leave I saw some guy running towards me and stopped, I honestly didn't think it was him, looked different than the pictures and not dressed for a date.

He was wearing slightly stained sweatpants and a few size too big, wrinkled, sweaty shirt That's was fucking dirty. And slides. I obviously wasn't too impressed he looked like he just got out of the bed, went for a run and came to see me after it. I mean, you're going to a date dude, not to get a beer after sitting on a couch all day watching football.

Whatever. We went to the coffee house, while for some reason he walked two feet in front of me(?),ordered drinks and a snack (he didn't offer to pay for it), then proceeded to a hellish awkward date, if you can call it that.

The guy seemed nervous, so i led the conversation, hoping he'llease into it or something, but the whole time it felt like an interview or a therapy session, and with me initiating everything it was sort of exhausting and not at all enjoyable to me. The part where you get to know each other didn't really happen, he would just sometimes drop weird or inappropriate jokes and then try to explain them to me if I wouldn't laugh. For some reason he thought that telling me he tried to hook up with an older woman was a good idea, but it just made me more uncomfortable. Seriously, what the fuck was that, trying to impress me somehow?? I couldn't wait for it to end.

And when we finally parted ways he simply tried to kiss me like hello? Consent? Lord gracious i couldn't walk away fast enough and then swiftly ghosted him.

Long story short, if anyone read this mess, please, dress up nicely for your dates and don't throw around inappropriate 'jokes', it won't leave a good first impression. And for the sake of everyone, be a decent person and ask first before kissing someone.

The height and weight of the ""average"" woman in the US is 5'3 and 170lbs. (source: CDC) 

The amount of women under, lets say, 130lbs are about 13.5%-27.8% depending on age groups. Those are closest reported weights and could be off. 

I see a whole spew of absolute bitterness/resentment, and I understand that it hurts feeling rejected. But then I see so many other comments about what men want here and it's apparent to me many dudes have NO clue what the average woman looks like/does. 

You want a thinner woman? The average woman isn't thin. You want a woman who's not a single mom? Over a certain age, many people have children. You don't want a woman over 30? Okay, you've eliminated more potentials. 

It's OKAY to only want a small % of the population and it's OKAY to have preferences, but I'm tired of men here pretending they'd throw themselves at any Sally without having standards.

When men talk about social media girls/Instagram/Onlyfans etc, they're talking about a small % of conventionally hot women who use their looks to get what they desire. When men say ""any average woman has a lineup of guys at her feet,"" they're talking about ATTRACTIVE women, not *just* average women. You don't have to be a model to be conventionally attractive, but it's still a small % of women. 

I think this is where the disconnect comes from. Men on here say ""most women can xyz!"" and women here get upset because it's not *their* experience, but that's because they're not the women these men were referring to in the first place.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,760616,public,self,"Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I genuinely believe a lot of men on this sub have no clue what an ""average"" woman actually looks like/does, and that's why there's so much bitterness.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7acfx/maybe_an_unpopular_opinion_but_i_genuinely/,all_ads,6,,,,,,
